review/text: My tiny Maltese dog loves these treats and they are perfect for training sessions.  They are small/miniature treats and about the consistancy of a 'slim jim' jerky stick. Best treats I have found for toy dogs that don't crumble.

review/summary: Great for potty training!!
review/text: I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!

review/summary: Great treats!
review/text: Our puppy (5 month old labradoodle) loves these. They are great for training at home or at the park, but don't do the job very well when in puppy class. I think they don't smell as good/strong as some of the other stuff, so with multiple distractions it makes it difficult to get his attention.

review/text: the size of each particle is quite good for dog training. and the smell is very strong, you cannot put them in a open bag, must seal it everytime you gave it as treat, otherwise your dog will stand up trying to fetch more.<br />i believe the taste is great from my puppy's affection for it, and i will purchase more for sure.

review/summary: I almost want to try one...
review/text: Our dog loves these.  We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so.

review/summary: My Dog & Pup LOVE it!
review/text: I call this product, "puppy crack".  I have a 3 month old lab pup who, against type -- Labradors are supposed to be gobblers -- doesn't gobble his high quality kibble.  In fact, he grazes.  But when I unseal the package of Zuke's, he bounds at me bouncing in the air.  I taught him "sit" in two minutes using Zuke's (Chicken).  My 19 month old Catahoula Leopard Dog-girl loves them, too.<br /><br />I like the small size of these treats (it's easy to carry them in a snack size ziploc) -- perfect for training/rewards.  I pretty exclusively purchase natural, high quality food/treats for my animals companions.  Zuke's is our household's favorite canine treat!

review/summary: Good size for training
review/text: My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical.

review/summary: Great for training
review/text: We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!

review/text: Using Zuke's mini snack for my 6 1/2 month Siberian Husky has been fantastic. Before starting her on Obedience classes I was required to find something she really went for. I guess it was the trainer's way of making her training easier for her. This natural product has been amazing! It's chewy and savory and just right for my picky dog/pup. Except my pup prefers the beef flavor but thankfully she is now becoming a well-behaved dog.

review/text: My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training. These moist mini peanut butter flavor treats are perfect! They don't gross us out and both our dogs (the puppy and our 2 year old dog) LOVE them and are highly motivated during training sessions.

review/summary: I think they're bland, but my puppy loves them
review/text: The aroma of these treats is fantastic--there's a tantalizing meaty, smokey smell that wafts from the bag. And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.<br /><br />On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them.

It still applies to this product!<br />I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them.

review/text: These are sooo great for training. I just stick a few in my back pocket, usually even break them into halves or thirds and use as treats. My dog loves them, and while she isn't the pickiest, she certainly doesn't like some treats. The real reason they are great though is because she likes them enough so that she will do her tricks for only a third of the treat! (This is an extremely tiny portion, which shows how flavorful they are.) And if they estimate correctly that's only one calorie of her diet! Can't go wrong, I've had chicken and salmon and both are great.

review/summary: Perfect size, but goes quickly
review/text: Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally.

The chicken has a typical dog food meat smell, but the salmon does not smell like dog food at all.

They are the perfect size for a training treat, they fit nicely into some treat dispensing toys (like the artichoke one that Planet Dog makes), and my dog loves the taste! They are moist, but they have a tendency to get dried out if you don't reseal the bag after opening. They are made in the U.S. and don't have any wheat or corn products in them.  They're also only 3 calories each, and perfect for training since they don't completely fill my dog up!

I love them because they are healthier for him than the other treats we'd been giving him and they are great to train with. I'm glad it comes in the 16 ounce bag because we go through them pretty quick!

review/text: Usually I don't write reviews, but who really does unless the product is either outstanding or absolutely horrible. Thankfully this review is not the latter. When I initially got my puppy she was not house-trained, didn't know any tricks and was not food motivated. However, with these treats she was potty-trained and knows quite a few tricks. It was effort on my part, but those treats were definitely a good motivator. Also, looking around at other treats and their prices these are a really great value. If you want something that your dog will enjoy and a great value for the amount and type of treat this is what you want to look for. You and your dog won't be disappointed. I know mine isn't.

review/text: My greyhound service dog loves these treats! I use them for training or reinforcing good behavior while out. They aren't too stinky, aren't too big, and are really healthy. An additional plus for service dogs is that these treats are soft, so there's no loud crunching sound when you use them in the library or in that quiet waiting room at the doctor's office. The small, round design means you'll fit a lot of these into a typical training pouch, so you won't run out. One note I would add is that, if you don't use them all on a particular outing, be sure to dump the unused treats back in the resealable bag or they may get hard. Other than that, these really are the perfect training/reinforcement treat for service dogs! Great stuff!

review/summary: Did they change the recipe for these??? Rosemary and cherries?
review/text: I have ordered these just a few times for our new puppy and recieved exactly the picture shown (the chicken flavor) but I just re-ordered a new bag and thought I was getting exactly what I had ordered previously but this one is slightly differt.  They have added 'anti-oxidents' to the recipe so it has cherry, rosmary and some other things added.  They are still the small round training treats and are still great (a little more calories at 3.5 per treat instead of 2) but I found it interesting that it wasn't as advertised by amazon.  Do they still sell the old ones or has Zuke's just changed their items?  FYI, I chose the '1 pound' option in the drop-down when I ordered.<br />I still give this 5 stars because I think they are the best treats out there for training, they are small, moist, stinky (that's good for dogs) and made with healthy quality ingredients.  Just not sure if Zuke's changed them or if I was sent something slightly different by accient.  I guess I will find out next time I try to order them!

review/summary: Nuts for these!!!
review/text: We adopted a 10 month mix breed and needed to tap into his hunting breed's tendencies and these treats are the only reason our guy gets excited about training and hunting for treats.<br /><br />We ordered a Kong Wobbler too and these treats are the perfect size and shape to put inside and keep him entertained for awhile.  They're great for having on hand just as treats or as rewards while working on training.  You can carry alot and it not be awkward.<br /><br />He loves the chicken flavor and can't seem to get enough.  I love the price for the size of the bag you get and they last a good while as long as you ration.  Even though they are definitely "mini", each one has such a strong (not overwhelming) aroma and taste that just that little morsel is enough for our big guy.  His nose knows.<br /><br />I'm ordering more today and will continue to order as long as they're available.  Just wish they were on auto delivery.  We'd never want to run out.  Any other treat just won't do.  I highly recommend you at least try them.  You and your pooch will be glad you did.

review/summary: My dog's new favorite treat
review/text: I was looking for a small treat that was soft, wouldn't have to cut down to size, mostly protein and made in the US.<br /><br />PRO:<br />They are a one bite size. No cutting needed even for smaller dogs.<br />Dogs love. I haven't met one that doesn't like it. My dog is picky about treats.<br />They smell but like salmon, nothing offensive.<br />Low in calorie so you don't need to worry when training.<br /><br />CONS:<br />They dry out. I ended up storing them in an airtight container.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />It's a treat my dog loves and it's not harming her and I don't have to deal with cutting it down. I wish I had these when we were doing puppy class and going through a ton of treats nightly.

review/summary: Wonderful treats!
review/text: I thought that these treats might be a little too small for my basset hound mix, but she loves them! They smell ridiculously strong which is a good thing since my dog knows she's getting a treat whenever I open the bag. I'm planning to try all the other flavors from this company! I tried them with a 3 mo beagle puppy and an adult German shepherd and they adored these too so I know they're great for all sizes.

review/summary: Best treat for training!
review/text: I've had my 5month old Malti-Poo for about 3 weeks; and being a first-time trainer, I was doubtful. I found these mini treats, and the bag had awesome reviews from a good amount of people. The treats weren't pricey at all, and I went ahead and bought them. My dog absolutely loves these. They're moist, small, and perfect for training. She listens so well when I bring these out, and she hasn't gotten tired of them at all. She's perfected two new tricks on top of repeating her old ones in just a matter of one day! The only negative I would say is that they do have a particular smell since they are very moist and natural. Overall, these treats are a huge success!

review/summary: Zuke's Salmon, Chicken, and Rabbit work well for my picky dog!
review/text: I've been using Zuke's Mini's for training since I first brought my girl home and she (surprisingly, for she's quite picky) still tolerates them and *sometimes* even seems to want to work for them. (Not having a food motivated dog SUCKS for training - I could literally be walking around with big macs in my pockets and it just wouldn't matter) They are low calorie and reasonably cheap (I can actually find them at some local stores cheaper than I can on Amazon, sometimes) as the bags tend to last a while. (I actually use kibble mixed with the treats when working with her, becuase I'm sneaky like that and she doesn't notice the difference once we get going)<br /><br />Of course not all dogs work with all treats - and it SHOULD be noted that although these treats do not have a lot of the "bad" ingredients in them they still do have grains. (NO grain treats have a much different texture, either from being pure meat or using various ingredients as the "binder" necessary for treats like this)<br /><br />This is the only type of treat we feed that has grains in it; almost everything else she eats is pure meat in various fashions. (lamb lung, water buffalo, venison, rabbit, etc)<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies you may want to try some of the grain-free options for training treats, like the mini lamb lungs or mini beef jerkies, etc. For our needs, though, these are perfect. \<br /><br />I was SO psyched when I saw that they came out with the "rabbit" variety! I try to keep the variety going in her diet and she doesn't like the peanut butter kind so it was always down to alternating between chicken or salmon, both of which are very common proteins. I can't tell if she likes this kind more or not, but she's definitely eating them which is a good sign! They tend to be more expensive than the other variety so I don't buy them as often, but love including it in the mix!<br /><br />One last thing I wanted to mention, my Mom has small dogs (tiny chihuahuas) and they can eat this size training treat with ease. However, I recently purchased the SMALL training treats for her (they are usually about 1/2 cal per treat) and she said that they are PERFECT for her sized dogs that she is constantly trying to diet. I don't believe they are made in that size by Zuke's but there are several brands out there that also use similar ingredients (no bad preservatives, no corn, by products, etc) that may work better for very small dogs.

review/summary: Great value
review/text: My dog LOVES these treats. They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell. So if you are afraid of the fishy smell, don't get it. But I think my dog likes it because of the smell. These treats are really small in size. They are great for training. You can give your dog several of these without worrying about him over eating. Amazon's price was much more reasonable than any other retailer. You can buy a 1 pound bag on Amazon for almost the same price as a 6 ounce bag at other retailers. It's definitely worth it to buy a big bag if your dog eats them a lot.

review/text: I have a 10 month old weimaraner who is allergic to beef which makes finding treats a bit of a challenge.  Luckily we found Zuke's right away!  There is no beef, wheat, or corn in them.  With their small size (about the size of a pencil eraser) and moist texture, they are the best for training and reinforcing good behavior.  We've tried the chicken, peanut butter, and salmon flavors, and the salmon are definitely her favorite.  Next up - I think I'll get the rabbit flavor for her to try!

review/text: I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to. They must taste good because the dog cant wait to get a treat after he walk outside.

review/summary: Great yummy treat for my little ones
review/text: I got a border collie puppy recently and have been working on training her. She's so smart so it's nice but she's tiny so most treats are kind of big for her. I didn't want her training treats to take her a bit to chew on. So these are great and trust me she goes BONKERS over them. I wash my hands after the training sessions because she goes crazy over the lingering smell too. I also have 2 cats and they both show up when the bag opens. They have PLENTY of their own treats but they love these yummy morsels. I'll be buying them the Zukes cat treats so they can enjoy them just as much

review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals - Healthy Treats
review/text: Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for "pee" rewards and larger ones of another brand for "poo" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces
review/text: My dog loves Zukes Mini Natural Treats! treats.  He expects them before he goes to sleep for the evening, and often looks for them when we just tell him he is as good boy.  When we run out of them he actually pouts because now he expects them every day.  What I like about these treats for our dog is that they are natural, no chemicals, and just the right size for our dog to chew (he is 28 lbs.).  Also, some of the proceeds go toward Cancer Research for animals, which I am all for since we lost a Jack Russell to cancer at the age of 5 (Lymphoma).  Very sad to see an animal suffer with Cancer, as with a human, and also to lose them, which is especially emotionally stressful.  We will purchase Zukes as long as our dog loves them - and we know this will be for his life.

review/summary: Perfect training treats
review/text: My beagle-daschund Pixel needed a lot of re-training when I got her, as her previous "owner" had neglected her for several months. The Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats were perfect for use in training, because they're small, low-calorie, and healthy, so I didn't feel like I was over-feeding her by using them throughout the day.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Pixel had a very sensitive stomach when I first got her, these treats never made her sick (her previous "owner" had not fed her regularly, she was underweight, and the food she had gotten was of poor quality, so for several weeks after I got her, most foods made her sick).<br /><br />I still use these treats, as they're made from good, simple ingredients, they're free of wheat/corn/soy, and they're low-calorie. Plus, Pixel loves them!<br /><br />A tip for using these tiny treats: I fill a plastic medicine bottle with these treats (they're small, and about 15 will fit in the container), and keep it in my jacket pocket to use while on walks.<br /><br />I also filled a medicine bottle with these and I keep it in the car, which has been useful in two ways. First, it's nice to have a treat for Pixel when she goes in the car. Second, while driving I have encountered my neighbor's escaped dog twice in the past few months, and having treats with me makes it much easier to catch her and return her to her home!

review/summary: Perfect for puppy training class!! She loves it!!
review/text: My 8 month old golden retriever is surprisingly very picky about food. Our training class uses positive reinforcement with treats and lots of them. The last class, I ran out of hot dogs, and my puppy decided she didn't like bologna, or cheese anymore (which was all I had left) and was over it! She lost interest in training for the day after that.<br />I got home and decided to look for a really enticing treat that she will love and I found these on Amazon and for a great price too! She LOVES it and it's small enough and plentiful enough that a bag should last me at least a few weeks or longer of training.

review/summary: They smell soooo yummy!
review/text: My dogs love these and they smell so good I have been tempted to try them!!!  I bought the chicken variety.  They are way small so great for training purposes so that you don't overfeed your dog in the process of teaching him good behaviors.  Plus, they are natural so must be good for the doggies.  I will definitely order them again when we run out.  Shipping wasn't the speediest on this item which I found strange because I have the Amazon prime 2 day shipping.  Not super slow, but it was longer than a week before I got them so I had to buy some others to use in the meantime.  Maybe it got lost in the mail, not sure.  One of my dogs will not stop begging for these when he sees I have the treat pouch!

review/summary: Brody Loves These!
review/text: I am all about providing my puppy (6mo. shihpoo) all natural treats in moderation.  After signing up for a puppy class and him learning some things, I am making sure to reward him when he listens and obeys commands.  After a while you realize that your choice of treats becomes very important to keep him happy and healty.  I saw this had high reviews here so I decided to give them a show.  He really likes them!  They are nice and small so he can easily chew and swallow them, and the bag is huge!  I am used to buying the Blue Buffalo treats so this seems to be a bit more bang for the buck :)  The only "con" is that they really are smelly (chicken flavor).  Not sure about the other flavors but they smell like a bottle of vitamins.

review/text: Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loves these treats!  We purchased soft milk bones to help her with her training but we have to break them up every time we want to praise her.  There are the perfect size and I don't feel too bad for giving her a couple at a time.  We haven't really started training her but giving them to her every time she goes potty outside rather than inside is working out great.  Glad I got the 1 lb bag too because she is going to go threw them.  Oh, my cat even likes them....

review/summary: Terrific treats
review/text: Izzy, our rescue Mini Schnauzer, has tummy issues. We've had to go to a sensitive stomach dog food, and be very careful with what we feed her for snacks and treats. We've been looking for treats she'll like, with ingredients she can have, and made in the United States. With Zuke's we get it all.<br /><br /> We also have to limit how much treat she can get in a day, but with the small size of these treats, about the size of pencil eraser tips, so we can give her 3 or 4 and use them as rewards when training.<br /><br />She loves the salmon flavor, and while I can smell they are salmon, they don't stink and my hands aren't gross after giving Izzy her treats. So far we have hadn't any bad reactions and she enjoys getting a yummy treat, she doesn't have to know it's good for her too!

review/summary: Perfect for puppy training
review/text: Small and soft enough for a quick reward when training my puppy. It doesn't hurt that she also loves them. They do smell strong but nothing worse than typical dog food, plus the odor keeps her attention. The only downside (if you would call it that) is that they are a little on the "oily" side. Just a tad but enough to keep a lingering smell if you don't wash your hands right away, which I would do any way so really is no big deal.

review/summary: Darn Good Stuff
review/text: I bought these over a year ago on the recommendation of a dog trainer. I had tried several others, all of which were OK.  These are the most strong-smelling and apparently tasting treats I have ever seen, and our Lab really responded to them.  You do have to keep them in a sealed container or they will dry out.  They are a bit expensive compared to some others, but  I found that I could cut them in half and get the same effect when using for training (and save a few bucks).

review/text: These are the perfect treats for training. My dog loves them and because they are moist and so tiny I don't feel bad about giving him multiple treats for completing tricks or good behavior. It is so convenient not having to break treats up into tiny pieces and you really get a lot for your money. These last me quite awhile and the resealable bag helps to keep them fresh. I would highly recommend this treats!

review/summary: Little doggie attention magnets!
review/text: I am a trainer at a local no-kill shelter.  I work with all different types and temperaments of dog, and the only common denominator is that I need their undivided attention and a reward they'll do almost anything for.  Plus, being a wide population, I needed something with a simple ingredient list (so as to avoid digestive issues).  THIS IS THE TREAT!  I am a huge fan of Zuke's already, but was dubious as to whether or not one type of treat would suit the tastes of so many different dogs.  The chicken flavor has yet to fail me.<br /><br />Low-calorie, a universally appealing flavor and the perfect training size.  Bonus for trainers: they don't smell half bad!  However, their scent is still strong enough to work as a puzzle toy filler, a Kong filling, for tracking or scent games or to just grab focus from an enticing squirrel. ;)<br /><br />Even previously feral and non-treat-motivated dogs seem quite happy that I bring these.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: love the natural ingredients!
review/text: I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market.

review/summary: Salmon Dog Treats
review/text: Mini Naturals - 1 pound - Salmon Flavored<br />Great product for training dogs!  I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching).  They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward.  Unlike dog kibble or other treats, these are quickly digested so that your dog will not be gagging on them as he/she works on the next behavior.  To keep fresh, keep bag tightly closed and put a portion of the cut treats in a resealable sandwich bag.  If they do get exposed to air and dry out, a small portion of a moistened paper towel in the bag will restore them to original texture.

review/summary: Dog likes them!
review/text: My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better.  One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag.  It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor.  But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small.  They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there.

review/text: Surprised of the bad reviews because of the smell, . . .come on seriously?  Dog lick their privates and smell each others butts.  I mean the smell is hardly that of a baked apple pie but I love that these treats are made of natural ingredients.  I also love the perfect pea sized shape.  Not to much and not to little.  My puppy loves the stuff and I've gotten him to do all sorts of things.  Catch a frisbee, sit, down, shake, sit pretty, play dead, roll over, fetch, touch a target, say his prayers, stay, and come and he's only 4 months old.  I make sure that I adjust his feeding when I treat so that he does not over eat for the day.  These are great.  I buy the peanut butter flavor.

review/summary: Great in Every Way Except they STINK!!
review/text: I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the "natural" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the "natural" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs.

review/text: We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside. They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath.

review/text: I read that chicken jerky from China is dangerous for dogs so I was looking for another treat they would eat.  This was not one of them.  It didn't matter how hungry they got, they wouldn't eat these.  They sat on the floor two days.  I picked them up, threw them away and then tried again a few days later with fresh treats.  I left them in their treat spots.  They sat there for days.  They would not eat them.  It doesn't help if they were made in America but my dogs find them unpalatable.

review/summary: Chicken-Flavored Treats
review/text: This review is for Zuke's Chicken-Flavored treats.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is their overwhelming smell. It's not pleasant at all, almost like they're on the verge of spoiling. I've left the bag open accidentally and returned to the whole lower level of my house reeking. Even after putting them in a sandwich baggy for training during our walking session, the smell clung to my coat. Basically, anything these things touch, they'll share their smell with.<br /><br />Stench aside, these are fabulous treats. My dog responds more readily to them during our training sessions than any others I've tried so far (guess what disgusts me smells like heaven to him). They're also already the perfect size, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I'll definitely try out some different flavors next time.

Fits *anywhere* and seals tightly so no smells and they stay fresh. Easy to refill. Only holds a little but but a small portion is all we need.

review/summary: yum
review/text: The price for these on Amazon is a couple dollars cheaper than where I used to buy these.  They are a nice treat for training, I sometimes even break them in half (even though they are small).  They smell strong and my dog loves them.

review/summary: low calorie treats for dogs who need many rewards a day
review/text: My miniature schnauzer has a sensitive stomach.  She has tolerated these without a stomach upset for several years now.  The treats are so tiny that she can have several a day for all the good dog behaviors she has.  They smell good but I have never tasted them.  By saying "Zuke" she will stop barking or come to me in an instant and I will give her a Zuke.  And she still feels she is the boss. Additionally, I add these to her prescription diet dog food for dogs with sensitive stomachs and she eats her meal. She is a very high maintenance but adorable and loving.

review/summary: Great for training
review/text: My 4 month old puppy loves these.  I agree with the other reviewer that they do tend to dry out fast so I recently ordered the PB kind to see if they stay soft longer.  Of course, if you keep them in the package or a ziplock, they don't dry out, but when I'm training with them and have them in my pocket, they do start to get dry.<br /><br />Training has been great with these treats.  My dog is very responsive and I know I can use a lot of them without any upset GI issues as they're healthy for him too!

review/text: These little treats are his favorite treat and he loves all three flavors but especially the peanut butter flavor.  They are great for training or just because.
