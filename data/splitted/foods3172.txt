review/summary: Lemon flavored cookies - YUM!
review/text: I found the lemon flavored Nonni's Biscotti at my local grocery store,in the deli section.<br />The other flavored cookies did not appeal to me. They were too heavy and hard. These<br />lemon flavored ones are great dunked in my hot tea. I usually have 2 a day and greatly<br />savor them as I work at my computer. I try and enjoy these treats five times a week.<br />By the way, they quit handling my Limone Biscotti at my store and I went looking for<br />a new source and found it thru Amazon.com.

review/summary: Not a fan of biscotti in general, but Nonni's get two thumbs up!
review/text: I am not normally a fan of biscotti. Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste...This one however, is different! Let me start with the price: on Amazon I paid 40% less (!!!) with free delivery, then in my grocery store! Hurray! Other then that, why Nonni's?<br /><br />1) They are not as dry and crumbly as other biscotti I have tried over the years. The toffee adds a bit of moisture without being gooey. They are gentler on my teeth, but still with enough cruch to make one biscotti a satisfying snack (at 110 calories), and allow for dunking.<br /><br />2) Individually wrapped, they keep fresh and moist (as moist as a bicotti can possibly be...) for quite a long while. It is good to have an extra box or two for unexpected guests.<br /><br />3) MILK chocolate!!! (I HATE dark chocolate...I'd rather eat spinach...but that is what most biscotti are covered in). There is just enough of it to give you a taste without making you feel you are eating a chocolate bar!<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/text: This product is a superior light biscotti, crunchy without being hard, and with a light coating of chocolate.  The texture is good, and the flavor is good.  Each piece is 110 calories.  It makes a good snack for a mid-afternoon break, or can be added into a brown bag lunch.  The chocolate coating is heat sensitive, and I would recommend against shipping it in hot weather.

review/text: First, I love Nonni's..I buy the chocolate and plain ones all the time, but never saw the Limone. The order arrived and I noticed a somewhat musty smell on opening and then noticed the expiration date on the boxes is just 8 weeks off. The biscotti in the store are much fresher. Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue.

review/summary: Love This - Careful about Baking It
review/text: I was a little leery about using this mix based off the few 1 star reviews. I bought it for $5 from a natural food store to make a bundt cake for a dear friend with soy allergies. When I was mixing it up using an electric mixer, I tried some of the batter. I was also concerned as it was gritty, but crossed my fingers and didn't mix it any longer than I do other cake batters (a few minutes using a rubber spatula along the edge of the bowl to make sure it was mixed).<br /><br />I was able to get enough for a Nordicware bunt cake pan and a few cupcakes. I decided to try a cupcake to make sure it was decent. The cupcake was delicious and moist with the corner edges that were slightly crunchy (something that could be avoided by a shorter cook time, but I liked it). My friend's cake was softer when I took it out (but fully cooked). When it cools down, I'll sprinkle it with powdered sugar. I can't wait to give it to her and her family! :)<br /><br />It's possible the 1-star reviewers got duds for their cake mixes, but it sounds like their cakes may have overbaked. Here's a tip that may help others in the future:<br /><br />Unless you are doing a box of Betty Crocker-type instant mix or maybe using lots of crisco/lard, a chocolate cake can overbake into a dry brick in minutes. Watch your chocolate cake like a hawk. I've ruined many 5-star cake recipes like that.<br /><br />Start checking on your cake with a toothpick (or a skinny smooth chopstick) 5 minutes before the minimum end time. If it's not done, put it back in and check it every five minutes. It also really helps to use an oven thermometer (putting it where the cake goes after the oven is preheated) as a lot of oven have temperatures that are off.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but chocolate cakes seem to dry out faster than other cakes, and I bet it's even more so with this mix as the brown rice's texture would become way more pronounced with even a little overbaking. Hope this helps. Happy baking! :D

review/text: I bought this cake for my sister who has coeliac disease. She had made one of the mixes and said it turned out well but as I do a lot of "regular" baking I wasn't willing to take her word for it so made one myself. I was very impressed with the quality of this cake. Tasty and moist. I served it to everyone in the family and no one could tell that it was gluten free. We ate it over a three day period (stored in the fridge) and enjoyed it every day. It will be nice when the price starts to come down on gluten free products but in the mean time this is a nice treat. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I received this product through a friend and used it to celebrate my and my son's birthdays---I'm celiac, he's not. This cake is, hands down, one of the best we've ever had.  My son was completely happy with it because it didn't taste like it was GF (grainy and dry). Like all GF products, it's on the expensive side---but unlike so many others, it's worth it!  Excellent product!

review/summary: Easy cake
review/text: My mother can't eat traditionally processed sugar; my step-father can't eat gluten.  I purchased this to make a birthday cake for my sister that the whole family would eat.  It was delicious.  I topped it with a glaze made with fresh local raspberries and honey, and everyone had cake.<br /><br />It makes the same way as a traditional ingredient cake mix; eggs, oil, water, mix it, pour it in the pan, bake it. I had no unexpected troubles in the making.  It's quite a bit pricier, of course, than a cheap supermarket boxed mix, but if you need the specific ingredients, I don't think you'll do much better.  I just wish they were sold in single boxes, since I don't make that many cakes for the entire group, especially in all chocolate.

review/summary: Great cake mix!
review/text: I am gluten, dairy, soy and corn intolerant and have had to avoid these foods for some time now. I haven't had cake in 2.5 years. I didn't eat cake often before, but my birthday is coming up and I really wanted to be able to have some birthday cake. I found this mix at my local health food store last week and couldn't believe I had finally found a baking mix of any kind that was not only gluten free, but free of the other foods I cannot eat. I made half of a cake last night and it's great! I used applesauce for half of the oil to lower the fat and calorie content a bit. I don't know what it would be like if I hadn't done that. It's relatively moist for a gluten free cake. It's a bit chewy/spongy, but I didn't mind that. I've been gluten free long enough that I don't look for gluten free foods to be exactly like their gluten based counterparts. I enjoy good tasting gluten free foods for what they are. The taste of this cake is great. I frosted it with a 7 minute egg white based frosting, which also worked well. My husband just tried some and he likes it too.

It was a nice savings for me and I was able to try some items which I was reluctant to do to the price.  Now they raised the prices and say you are saving $6.17 on a purchase of 6 - but with shipping going to cost me over $12.00 I am losing, I can purchase them here at the local store for $5.99 each.  I am very dissappointed in some greed of people who pray on others with any disability.

I followed the directions, mixing well, and the cake took longer to bake than the instructions indicated. The cake has a gritty texture and sort of a stale aftertaste.

review/summary: Chewy yet dry, high carb and fat
review/text: I received my Eat.Think.Smile bars free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I pack lunches every day for five people, so I'm always looking for something nutritious and tasty to keep lunches and snacks interesting.  I eat a low carb diet, so the first thing I do is read the labels on foods.<br /><br />My verdict on these bars (my kids also tried one) is that they aren't that healthy, and the texture and flavor of them is just average.  They're dense and gummy, and while the chocolate flavor is nice, the cherry flavor is so subtle that it's hardly noticeable.  There aren't any recognizable chunks of walnut, either.  I thought they tasted too sweet, but the kids disagreed.<br /><br />Wheat, corn flour and brown sugar are the first ingredients. They contain 4 grams protein, 200 calories, 7 grams of fat, 12 grams of sugar, and 34 carbs.  And at $1.52 apiece they're rather expensive for a snack bar.<br /><br />We eventually finished the box, but won't be looking for these again.

review/summary: Gritty texture and mostly tasteless, certainly not a health food.
review/text: These Dark Cherry bars are purported to be healthy nutrition bars. There is really nothing healthy or nutritious about these "Eat Think Smile" bars. They are high in calories (200), fat (7g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either. The claim is that because they contain cocoa (chocolate) they are good for you because chocolate is supposed to be an antioxidant. That is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven. The only ingredients that might be healthy are the cherries and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog's Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these "Eat Think Smile" bars. The claim is that these bars are a smart choice! If you are starving and only alternative is eating dirt, the dirt might be a healthier choice actually. I really dislike companies that create this kind of ridiculous untrue hype about any product.<br /><br />These "Eat Think Smile" bars are basically cookies and that would be ok if they tasted good but they don't. They have a gritty texture and taste overly sweet and did not taste cherry like to me. If you are looking for a great tasting real nutrition bar, then check out the Zone nutrition bars or the Kellog's Fiber Plus bars or any of the other real nutrition bars. And when you do, compare fat, calories, carbs, vitamins and such before you ever consider buying these fake health bars.<br /><br />If you like gritty cookies with mostly no taste, very sweet and really nothing nutritious in them, then you might like these bars.<br />If on the other hand you are serious about health and nutrition, then there are a lot of better choices that taste much better.

It also contains brown rice syrup).<br />-The taste is simply ok.  Nothing to get excited about.<br />-The bars are slightly crumbly, but really not too bad.

There is no sign of cherry flavor. Picture someone adding a little sweetener to unsweetened cocoa and just enough moisture to turn it into a dry bar. Did I mention that it is dry? I wouldn't go out of my way to ever have one again, but it is ok with a big glass of milk. It didn't go well with coffee or tea.<br /><br />When they call it a nutrition bar, they must be referring to the anti-oxidants, because they don't seem particularly nutritious otherwise.

They have a good chocolate and cherry taste. While I'm not a fan of walnuts, these weren't overpowering. The bars are a bit dry, so an accompanying beverage is recommended.<br /><br />The ingredients are decent, but the box has a lot of hype, which I take with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The name is stupid and I would be embarrassed to bring these to the cashier. The bars taste o.k., but I wouldn't buy them.

review/text: The ingredients look good, there is no MSG or other nasty things. I had high hopes for this bar. It has a very strong cherry flavor which was just a bit strong for me. The real problem was the texture, it has the feeling of eating some very fine clay. It is not really a gritty texture but one which I did not find pleasant. Since I had a pack of 12, I offered one to my wife, my kids, daughter in law and a friend. The friend without any coaching from me came up with the same texture description. Of the others; two said it was "okay", one said "I liked it but I wouldn't buy it" and the other said "I don't like it". No recommendation here.

With only 4g of protein it's not exactly going to keep you full the way a normal protein bar would, and it has a whopping 200 calories, so it's certainly not a light snack. However, with 7g of fiber and lots of other healthy ingredients, you could certainly do a lot worse. The cherry flavor is almost non-existent, which was disappointing, but it's not a bad-tasting bar at all.

review/summary: After eating, I thought, but I didn't smile much.
review/text: I have rarely been so perplexed when I have written a review of any product, and I have written more than a few reviews. But this nutrition bar confuses me - it's not one of those "candy bars with vitamins" like some other bars, nor is it as nutritious as say, an apple and a handful of nuts (my usual "meal replacement."). It tastes good, but not as good as a piece of fruit and handful of nuts or the candy bar type bar for that matter, but let's not go there. It tastes a whole lot better than those "Penance for eating a convenient snack" types of bars, of course.<br /><br />Many of these nutritional bars are billed for meal replacement and as such, this bar fills you more than most because of its generous size (measures 2-1/2" x 4-1/4", larger than a competing bar we had in the pantry.) It is a lot more filling than its weight of 1.8 oz (51 grams) would imply. That's probably due to its generous 6 grams of fiber, which unfortunately is likely due to chicory root extract, am ingredient I personally avoid. I stayed full for hours after eating this, which is unusual for a little bar.<br /><br />The taste also confused me, and your mileage definitely may vary in this area.  I was unable to discern any cocoa flavor at all, but my recent finishing of a box of Valentine's Day chocolate may have something to do with that - the flavor just wasn't strong enough to register with me. I did taste some cherry flavor, which I really thought was artificial flavor instead of real cherries. The first impression I got was more like Robitussin instead of fresh cherries. I didn't taste walnuts at all, and was surprised to see them in the ingredient listing. Walnuts, eggs, wheat and chicory may be allergic triggers for some, and some label reading is in order before buying.<br /><br />Would I buy these? Probably not, because lately I choose an apple (100 cal) and a packet of 100 calorie cocoa coated almonds when I want a meal in a moment. A check of the label reveals that it has 200 calories, which seems about average for a bar like this, but it also contains 7 grams of fat, which puts this bar into the "once in a while treat" section in our home. Sadly, my husband and child rejected this bar out of hand. That makes it a difficult choice because although these would rate higher than many competing bars, they don't rate as high as peanut butter crackers (190 cal, and very little nutrition), a favorite because of taste alone.

review/summary: Not very nutritional but they do taste good.
review/text: The good:<br />-The taste is fantastic.  The cherry is perfectly balanced with the rest of the ingredients. Not like a chocolate covered cherry (which is what I expected) but still tasted good.<br /><br />-I did a "purse" test and threw one in my bag in the morning to see what it would look like after being carted around all day. Although the bar did break apart, it wasn't crumbly and was still easy to eat. So I give it 5-stars for being able to be a plan-ahead snack to grab on the go.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-The bar is dry.  Not crumbly but dry tasting.  A bit hard to get used to.<br /><br />-This bar isn't very nutritional at all.  For the amount of calories in the bar, there are much better options, even if you are forced to grab a snack from a convenience store.  The protein or vitamin/nutrient content hardly even warrants calling this a nutritional bar at all.<br /><br />I'm giving this a the non-committal, on-the-fence, 3-star ranking. The bar clearly fails a nutritional bar but offers some satisfaction as far as taste and only if you can get past the dryness.<br /><br />Would I buy this?  Probably not. I can't think of any situations where this would be the better option in a store.

review/summary: More like a Chocolate Cherry Cookie Bar
review/text: These Eat/Think/Smile baked nutrition bars, are more like a cookie, than a protein bar. Why? Because they have the same nutritional value of a cookie. Each cookie has 200 calories, with 7 grams of FAT, 34 grams of carbs, and 4 grams of Protein. There's a bit of a problem with the saltiness too, with 240mg of Salt. So, if you need a meal replacement, this isnt it. It simply doesnt have enough protein. On the plus side, these taste really good. They're sweetened with brown sugar, and dextrose and brown rice syrup. As for the chocolate, they are using some South American chocolate, so if you have issue with the child slaves working in the Ivory Coast chocolate farms, your conscious will be relieved. The taste overall is rich, chewy, and complex, mixing the chocolate, cherry and walnut flavors, in a whole wheat-corn-oat flour. Also, the bars have a lot of naturally occuring minerals and vitamins, including magnesium 10% and Iron 6%. Still, if I were thinking of buying a nutrician bar, I'd recommend a protein bar, that's vitamin fortafied.  If you are supplimenting a meal, or need a lunch box snack, etc, then these nutrition bars arent a bad choice.

review/summary: not particularly interesting...don't like the added chicory root
review/text: Given that I liked this brand's granola so much, I anticipated finding this bars delicious as well.  Quite honestly I was underwhelmed by their flavor.  They don't taste bad -- and there is a nice, subtle cherry flavor -- but overall it just tasted like a slightly sweet flour-based bar.<br /><br />When I eat a bar like this, I'm generally looking for a decent protein content.  Unfortunately these bars (like this brand's granola) get almost all of their calories from fat and carbohydrates.  Each bar has only 4 grams of protein.  If I'm going to eat a low protein snack, I want it to be something more delicious than this.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this bar, however, is the addition of chicory root to bring up the fiber content.  Each bar contains 6 grams of fiber -- nearly 25% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This could be a great thing for people who ordinarily don't eat whole foods, but if your diet regularly contains whole wheat, brown rice, and fruits and vegetables that contain fiber, then getting 25% of your daily fiber in a bar like this is only going to cause intestinal discomfort.

review/summary: Tasty if a bit dry.
review/text: Nutrition/energy bars are an iffy proposition.  Even if it sounds like you might like it, you could easily find yourself biting into something that's a bit like a mixture of sawdust and rubber cement.  Fortunately the Eat, Think, Smile (Odd name, that.) Dark Cherry bar is pretty tasty, though it does suffer from a little bit of dryness.  Nevertheless, it's got a brownie-like quality that I enjoy, and if the cherry flavor isn't as cherry-like as you might hope, it's a small thing, really.  What you've got is a nice, nutty, chewy, cakey bar that has 6 grams of fiber per 200 calorie bar, and 4 grams of protein.  That's not bad, really.<br /><br />What ETS is promoting here is the antioxidant quality of cocoa. I'm as thrilled as the next chocoholic to think that my favorite indulgence might be good for me, but I really don't know how to evaluate the claim that one sort of cocoa is better than another, or that it's all better than green tea, and honestly if you're eating chocolate because you think it'll improve your health, it might be time to reevaluate the rest of your lifestyle.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these bars might be just the thing if you want a fast snack.  They're small; they'll fit easily in a purse or pocket. What more could you want from something that didn't come out of a bakery?

They are almost dry and taste a little like saw-dust paste but I was not expecting milk chocolate, melt in your mouth, gooey either.  They are in between a traditional granola bar with honey binding the ingredients and dry oatmeal pressed together.  The flavors are so subtle that I had to read the wrapper a few times to remind me what flavor they were supposed to be. I checked the date of the bars which were 8 months out so they were not close to expiration and will be gone in a few weeks. Are they worth a buck a bar? Absolutely not. Will you want to eat two at once? Probably not.  Will I buy them again? No.  They were worth a try though.

Think. Smile.' (I'll just call it ETS) kind from a friend who said nothing but good things about it, and after having a couple, I can see why. These bars are delicious, and aren't bad for you either. The calories are in the usual range for something like this- 200, each bar packs 6g of fiber, and you get 8% of your daily protein as well. Upon the first bite, the ETS bar had a chalky texture to it, almost like an old granola bar. But as I started to chew, everything got better. The chocolate taste is strong but not overpowering, and there's a slight cherry flavor too. Somehow, there's a bit of a banana flavoring too, though bananas are nowhere on the ingredients list. People with allergies to walnuts should beware though, as the ETS Dark Cherry bar here does contain them.<br /><br />There's only so much you can say about a snack since you need to try it for yourself in order to really get it, but anyone who likes chocolate will probably love this. The bars are filling and just one kept me full for a couple of hours, whereas one Odwalla bar lasts about an hour most of the time for me. The one thing keeping it back from 5 stars is the high sodium count (10% per bar), but it's not too big of a deal. The current price for the ETS bars is good, and they're very much worth your money if you're looking for a good healthy snack.

review/summary: Yummy Nutrition Bars
review/text: I'm not going to comment on the nutritional value of these bars, but more on the taste.<br /><br />These Dark Cherry baked "nutrition bars" are quite yummy and don't have a cardboard-like taste that some have come to expect from these sorts of snacks.  It's not too dry (I guess my opinion differs from other reviews), and not too moist.  My only major gripe is that it's a bit too crumbly (but not dry!) to hold its shape when you have the bar coming out of the foil wrapper, like the way you might eat a chocolate bar.

review/text: Very good because it's not hard and it's not chaulky.  But of course, it's not as rich as a bakery item.  Then again, this is actually better than some fat heavy dessert from a bake shop.<br /><br />I would buy this again if I were spending a lot of times outdoors and needed a quick nutrional snack.  It's far better than some of the nasty ones out there.

review/text: This bar is made with what I would consider healthy ingredients, so that made me wary of the texture.  Normally, the "real food" bars are kinda gross and dried out.  But, these bars were not that at all to me.  They had a nice texture, and flavor.  One of them kept me full all morning while I was busy running errands, and that was awesome.  They held up nice in my purse, with all the banging around that can happen with that, and my kids liked them as well.

review/summary: Yum, Yum...Like My Oatmeal Cookies!
review/text: So I got these thinking they would be an ideal meal replacement bar.  At 200 calories, and made from whole grains, I was hopeful that this would be delicious AND nutritious.  It does not disappoint.  And this bar is SOFT, which is rare in bars these days.  What makes it so soft is the brown sugar.  For me, I don't mind at all.  Personally, I am totally over all the fake sugar stuff, so I am happy to have the real stuff in there.  So first ingredient a blend of whole wheat and corn flour, then brown sugar, then oats.  Then about 8 other things, including eggs and walnuts and cherries.  I like that it's 6 grams of fiber, regular amount of carbs (34) and I'm not really concerned about the fat (7).  The only minor issue is the protein.  It only has 4, so for a meal replacement it doesn't really cut it.  But it's scrumpcious like a soft oatmeal cookie so I will overlook it.  The cocoa is not very apparent, but I don't really care.  I really like this bar!

review/summary: A bit dry but not bad tasting overall. Nice as a quick snack
review/text: Like a few others have remarked these are a bit on the dry side. Nothing where I needed water to wash them down or anything, just a bit more noticeable then most energy/fitness bars. After the first fews bites I didn't really notice any more and found the taste appealing although not something that bowled me over. I generally eat z-bars or some of the zone perfect fare and would work these bars into the rotation.<br /><br />The ingredient list is typical outside of the cocoa claims. This is not a gluten free product. It also does list brown rice syrup as an ingredient, although it is the second one from the end indicating a fairly low presence.(Compared to my z-bars where it is the 2nd ingredient listed). Pricewise they are bit on the high side, in my opinion, when compared to the aforementioned z-bars, zone perfect, luna, or labrada bars. Bring the price in-line with those offering and this would be a great alternative.

review/summary: great taste, perfect snack. love it!
review/text: I have eaten many "healthy" bars, some have been great and some terrible.<br />Before I purchase health-claiming-filled bars, I evaluate the following<br />contents: calories, fat, carbohydrates, and sugar. I also aim for whole<br />grain and avoid high fructose corn syrup at all costs. If anyone is into<br />healthy eating, I am sure everything I have mentioned sounds familiar.<br />Taking all my inspections into consideration, this bar exceeded my<br />expectations. The ingredients are healthful, and I was certainly left<br />thinking and smiling.<br /><br />Considering content, even if one bar is 200 calories, it's a perfect<br />snack-choice for a post "intense cardio" workout (zumba!). If you compare a<br />Fiber One bar to this one, some of their bars are smaller and have 240+<br />calories, including more sugar and carbohydrates. I prefer more protein in<br />my bars, but with all else included in this bar, 4g is good enough for me.<br /><br />Also, I just don't see how flavor can go wrong with the combination this bar<br />offers: dark cherry and cocoa. As for the texture of the bar, however,<br />that's where some consumers might be picky; the bar is, after all, slightly<br />dry, but not so dry as to make chewing unpleasant. Consider a semi-moist<br />cookie for texture. There's a level of texture one desires in a chewy<br />chocolate chip cookie. Comparing to a cookie, this bar's texture is below<br />that craving; it is still tasty nonetheless. My five year old enjoyed the<br />bar so much, he begged me not to take all of the bars to work (for my<br />snack), because he wanted to keep a few bars at home for when he craved<br />eating one.<br /><br />Overall, I (and my family) loved this bar. I do wish the price per bar were<br />cheaper. However, I do believe the taste trumps price, especially because<br />it's healthful!

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: At age 64, my nutrition bar requirements are totally driven by taste and calories.  I'm not usually a fan of baked bars because they tend to be dry, if not crumbly, and fairly bland.  This puts me immediately in mind of Clif bars.  At 200 calories, ETS bar's dark cherry flavor was a pleasant surprise because I could actually taste both the dark cherry and cocoa flavors without being over or underwhelmed by the sugar content.  The bar is not as moist as I'd like, but it holds together.<br /><br />The ingredient list is special to me because most everything is recognizable and just as specified on the Amazon page.  The allergy information disclosure, that this product is manufactured on equipment that processes peanuts, other tree nuts and soy, is also printed on the box.<br /><br />For me, these bars are somewhat pricey at $1.52 each.  As a rule, I pay that much only for KIND bars, my absolute favorite.  However, ETS dark cherry bars are tasty, filling, have no aftertaste, and are not nearly as sticky to eat in the car (when on the go) as KIND bars.

review/summary: Enough to stand out among a sea of nutrition bars?
review/text: It seems like another new type of nutrition bar, energy bar, or diet bar pops up every week.  I can't even count the number of brands, let alone varieties.  A lot of them are loaded with sugar, and in many cases you might be better off just eating an apple or a banana and a handful of nuts, but they are really convenient to have around.  They keep for a long time, have interesting and varied flavors, and are certainly much better for you than most any candy bar.<br /><br />To compete in such a crowded market, these products need some sort of differentiator to set them apart from the crowd.  In the case of "Eat. Think. Smile." from Apure foods (a Colorado subsidiary of Hershey's) it's the Cocoa Lavado, which they claim has much higher levels of antioxidants in comparison to common Dutch processed cocoa.  Such flavonoids might be good for your heart and circulatory system and could potentially even lower cancer risk a tiny bit.<br /><br />There have been at least a couple of studies indicating there may well be health benefits to lavado "washed" cocoa, including one last year from Pennsylvania State University that showed the higher levels of polyphenols in this type of cocoa appear to help block carbohydrates and fats, potentially helping manage weight.<br /><br />I was curious how much of this cocoa is in each bar, in comparison to how much would be needed for any health benefits to be fully realized.  A Hershey study cited by Eat. Think. Smile. seemed to indicate that consuming 22g of natural cocoa was found to cause a measureable improvement in blood vessel health, but I couldn't easily find how many grams of cocoa these bars actually contain.  I'll have to assume for now that they contain at least enough to provide some potential benefit.<br /><br />So, is it enough?  I had to also evaluate the taste, price, and other factors to help find out.<br />At over a dollar per bar, these certainly aren't cheap, but also not out of line with other nutrition bars on the market.  I don't know how much it costs to make one of these or a PowerBar or Cliff Bar, etc, but I suspect they must be rather profitable, as evidenced by the crowded market, and yet still fairly steady prices.  I must be in the wrong line of work.<br /><br />As for ingredients and nutrition, these certainly aren't for the allergy-prone, as they contain nuts, milk, wheat, corn, and eggs.  As long as that's not a problem, they seem reasonably balanced from a nutritional perspective with mostly natural ingredients, including the cocoa, and without a bunch of extra vitamins artificially crammed in for show.  They have 200 calories, 4g protein, and 6g of fiber, much of it from chicory root extract (for comparison Fiber One bars, which are a little smaller, have about 140 calories, 2g protein, and 9g of fiber).<br /><br />I found the Dark Cherry flavor nutrition bars to have a nice flavor, fairly sweet, but not overpoweringly so, with a somewhat light and vaguely cakelike texture (at least in comparison to heavy protein and sports nutrition bars).  The cherry bits, nuts, and oats seemed well balanced without overpowering the cocoa flavor, and as nutrition bars go, these tasted pretty good.<br /><br />Would I buy more?  Probably, if they go on sale.  I do like them better than some other bars, and I also like the idea of the natural, minimally processed cocoa, but I still think the whole product category is overpriced so I tend to either look for good deals, or I find alternate snacks (for example the aforementioned fresh fruit and nuts).  It's hard to beat the convenience of bars you can just drop in a backpack or desk or locker for when you need them though, and these seem as good as most and better than many.

review/summary: Nice, but I'm not substituting these for my Clif bars...
review/text: I've tried a number of "nutrition bars" over the years.  There are certain characteristics that make them acceptable and desirable:<br /><br />1.  Taste - they have to taste halfway decent.  I realize these bars in general aren't supposed to be candy bars, but in the heat of competition or need, a bit of taste isn't bad.<br /><br />2.  Calories - one of the reasons for having a bar is to supplement your diet.  For example, I ran 10 miles this morning, costing me about 1000 calories.  Most bars are in the 200-300 calorie range.<br /><br />3.  Fat - I'd like the calories from fat to be less than 30%.<br /><br />4.  Ingredients - when push comes to shove, organic, whole grains, and few additives is my goal.<br /><br />5.  Fiber - at least 6 grams of fiber per serving helps the world go round.<br /><br />6.  High fructose corn syrup - avoid, avoid, avoid.<br /><br />7.  Consistency - they shouldn't fall apart as you are eating them.<br /><br />So this particular bar, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar (Dark Cherry) has a nice taste (and cherries in the ingredients!), is 200 calories with 60 calories from fat, has 6 grams of fiber, is a bit crumbly (don't eat it on a treadmill), and is mostly whole wheat, corn, and oats (nice).  It's not vegan.  There is no HFCS (yay).<br /><br />I like the dark cherry taste.  Better than some, but I'm not giving up my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RDRO">Clif Bars</a>.

review/summary: I'm Smiling!  I'm Smiling!
review/text: It is such a pleasure to give a health bar a good review.  I have tried many and found them wanting.  Some were really bland.  Some tasted like moldy hay,(I could write a book about products that taste and smell like moldy hay, especially baby formula and cereals sold for the comsumption of children)one of the biggest disgraces in this country, in my opinion.  I think if it smells like moldy hay, and it tastes like moldy hay, it's probably made of moldy hay. And people wonder why their children are sick and have allergies.  I wonder why they wonder. If you don't know what moldy hay smells like, you need to find out so you can protect your children.)  Some tasted like somebody ground up a multivitamin and made it into a bar.  My least favorites are the ones that taste like iron.  Uggh!  But my biggest complaint is that no matter how much protein they have and how many calories they have, they are not satisfying.<br /><br />I found these bars to be both delicious and satisfying.  They came on a day when I came home from a trip and was tired and hungry and didn't want to cook anything and didn't want to go out.  I ate one, thought it was really good, but I wasn't quite satisfied.  So I ate another one.  I was completely satisfied and wasn't hungry for the rest of the evening.  That's never happened before with any bar.  And, I don't think 400 calories is bad for a meal.  I love the subtle but rich chocolate taste complimented by cherry flavoring which is not overdone.  Some products have so much cherry flavoring they are sickening, but this bar is just right.  I would definitely buy these bars.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm a little suspicious of the lukewarm reviews written by other reviewers because it sounds like they haven't had much experience with health bars.  I wonder if they are working for other companies that sell this particular type of product.  But that couldn't possibly be.  No company would think of hiring someone to give a rival company's product a lukewarm or poor review.  Would they?

review/summary: Do not be tempted! (Attempt Number 2)
review/text: After the disaster that was the Rescue WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets, I decided to try the Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap.  The swelling had receded from all of my newly acquired stings and I was ready for revenge.  This had trap had to work - I mean, how could it not?  There are pictures of yellow jackets trapped in the bag on the box!<br /><br />Oh how wrong I was.  I filled the bag with apple juice and bait and hung it on a tree next to my garage.  I sat in wait, watching the bag and waiting for the buzzing vermin circle the bag.  One even landed on top of the plastic rim.  It left, but not before it mocked me by doing a jig.<br /><br />I left the bag up for four weeks with no results.  When I went out to get it I noticed a wasp nest FIVE FEET AWAY!  Yup, this whole queen catcher line is complete garbage.  The nest was approximately 1/3 of the way built and not one stupid worker bee was floating in the bag!  Granted these were paper wasps and not a member of the subfamily Vespinae - yellow jackets, but the nest was already about the size of a softball!<br /><br />I was suddenly inspired and decided to use the bag to take care of the wasp problem.  I ripped the yellow plastic off and dumped the fluid.  I inverted the bag and wrapped it around my hand, like you do when you're picking up dog poop.  I grabbed the nest and quickly folded the bag around the top.  Perfect fit!  I shook the bag up and held it to my face to taunt the now enraged wasps.  How satisfying.  Then I tossed it in my trashcan and wandered off.<br /><br />Unfortunately wasps can actually live for more than an hour in a closed trashcan, as I discovered much to my horror when I tossed out the remains of the Rescue WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets.  Oh boy were the wasps mad at me!  Now I know that I have a high immunity to both yellow jacket AND paper wasp stings.

These are one at a time sized cookies, and I actually can't imagine wanting to eat more than one at a sitting anyhow because they are kind of hard to work through (See grainy/dry) but the flavor overall is good, I prefer oatmeal raisin over this or the dark chocolate variety but that's subjective. ..Also, something to note, if you are buying kashi items in bulk be prepared to eat a lot of them and quickly as the expiration dates are usually no more than 2 or 3 months past purchse (afterall these don't have all the chemicals/preservatives of your typical quick foods) All in all, this is a great healthy option for cookie lovers, or would work well in a kids lunch box!

review/summary: Best Oyster knife
review/text: Not sure how he did this, but this is the best oyster knife I have ever used. From the grip to the tip, it is a fantastic tool for opening oysters from the hinge. The grip takes a little getting used to, but, once you do, oyster beware. The slight bend on the tip is perfect for prying open the hinge on medium and large oysters. For 90% plus of these oysters, the effort required to open them will be minimal. And, no more slipping and stabbing yourself with a sharp tip! For the money, you absolutely can not beat this product, and it still would be a bargain at twice the price. He also offers a slightly thinner/smaller blade with a white handle to use in opening scallops or smaller oysters from the non-hinge (bill) end. Get both styles--you will not regret it! But, don't use the white handled one to open from the hinge or you will end up with a broken blade. Should you break the tip on a white handled knife, use a file to smooth out the tip and you can keep using it. It actually may work a bit better on smaller oysters after it is sharpened, as it will have a thinner edge to work into the shell. Many "professional" shuckers sharpen the blades on their knives. But, you obviously need to be very careful if you do this as it really is a knife then. I can attest to this as I opened up the side of a finger next to the nail at a friend's oysterfest using my sharpened white knife. That was my only slip all day with that knife, but that was all it took--painful!<br /><br />Pair this with<br /><br />  Ironclad Mach 5 Gloves (I wear on both hands) and<br /><br />  G & F 1670XL Cut Resistant 100-Percent Kevlar gloves (for your oyster hand, so you end up with two gloves)<br /><br />and you should be ready to shuck a box.<br /><br />I recently noticed that Lamson sells a knife with a similar, if not identical, blade design. But, it has a round wooden handle. While I have not used the Lamson product, I find that the handle on the Casson product really works better than the traditional handle designs. Plus, the Casson was cheaper than the Lamson at my local retailer.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I received this knife as a gift a year ago, and have since put it through much abuse. I work in a French restaurant in New York, and we sell a fair amount of oysters, so a good knife is a great tool. Everyone in the kitchen asks to borrow my knife when it's their turn to shuck, which is testament enough for me.<br /><br />I really love this oyster knife, and am about to order a second...

review/summary: Best oyster knife ever!
review/text: This oyster knife is the best I have ever used for shucking oysters.  It is uber strong and secure in the hand, and the perfect shape and thickness for getting into the hinge.  Even if you only need to shuck oyster once a year, this knife is worth it.

review/summary: good gum!! Bad delivery time!
review/text: I love clorets gum but can't find it in the stores anymore, so I order it online, in bulk.  The downside is, it has been 4 weeks since I placed my order, but have not yet received the product!! This happened the last time I ordered Clorets??  Not sure what the problem is with the delivery time but I hope next time it's improved!!!

review/summary: A Good Chew
review/text: Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.<br /><br />The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.<br /><br />Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval.

review/summary: treat not a chew bone
review/text: These are great as a treat, but not as a chew. They are so well liked they don't last. What I can't understand is why a seller that offers Amazon Prime charges albout 3 to 4 times the cost that other prime sellers are charging for the same items and think they will make a profit. I guess it's buyer beware and be a bargain shopper if you don't want to seriously overpay.

review/summary: Made my dog throw up bad
review/text: Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible "bone" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.

review/text: Most of the time when I order food products from Amazon, they arrive in good condition.  These cookies, however, were in crumbs when we received them.  It wasn't a packaging problem -- I think that just the way these cookies are made they don't ship well.  The crumbs were tasty enough, but we won't be reordering the cookies.
