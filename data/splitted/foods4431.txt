review/summary: Not so durable
review/text: Great for light to moderate chewers but if you have a serious chomper save the money and trouble picking up the pieces.  My dogs love these, but must be watched closely so the heavy chomper doesn't steal it and destroy it.  I wish he understood that he used to have one, but he ruined it.  I bet a Border Collie would have figured that out, but then again, a Border Collie would have logged on and bought another.

review/summary: Forget the Everlasting treats, just put regular treats inside
review/text: I originally bought this product to use with the Everlasting treats.  My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure.  But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.<br /><br />I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right "not-too-fast, not-too-slow" rate.  Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours.  The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it.  This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable.  My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear.  I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.<br /><br />So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats.  I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work.  A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.<br /><br />It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.<br /><br />Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XAFTG">Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treats</a><br /><br />www.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1

review/summary: Depends on the dog
review/text: This kept by 150lb Giant Newf busy for an entire day - he couldn't get the treat discs out and because they are so hard he chewed on it for hours without eating them all.<br /><br />Then my 65lb hound dog stole it from him, quickly figured out how it worked and chewed up the BALL portion until the treats were accessible.  Within 15 minutes of her having it the ball was in pieces all over the floor and she had taken out both treat discs. There was $20+ down the drain.<br /><br />The ball and the treats are Made in China - the treats are rock hard, the main ingredient is wheat and I suspect it is closer to some sort of wheat gluten glue that hardens - when  wet it does smell a bit and does leave a mess on the carpet. The ball is a jelly plastic that has a strange odor - I had a really hard time getting the treats into the ball so not surprised that the one dog couldn't get them back out. But if your dog can figure it out, or gets frustrated quickly you'll be surprised at how fast that ball will be torn to pieces when the dog turns its chewing jaws from the treat to the ball. Have no idea what the ball is made of and if it is toxic or not so had take it away (and throw it away) before they had a chance to eat any of it by accident.<br /><br />So -<br />Pro: could potentially last your dog a long time and keep him occupied<br /><br />Cons: expensive, Made in China, wheat based treats (allergy alert) and not going to last long if you have a determined dog.<br /><br />Kongs are the only toys my dogs have never been able to tear apart, they are the only things that have survived from puppyhood to now grown, adult dogs.

review/summary: I Don't See The Issue...
review/text: I have a three year old pure-bred English Bulldog that is THE most powerful chewer I have ever seen. I only bought this toy about 3 hours ago and he's been gnawing away at it. So far, he hasn't put a noticeable mark on it yet and also hasn't popped the treat out of the center. So, I don't know how all these other dogs have managed to destroy their toy or retrieve their treat so fast. As another reviewer stated, I believe the treat ball would probably be best for the "dumb" dogs and the Bento ball for the "smart" chewers.  But, now at the 3.5 hour mark, my bulldog has tired himself out from chewing on the ball and it is sitting in front of him with noticable marks on the treat surface, but the blue ball still looks brand new (well, with a little slobber on it.)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy for your power chewing dogs!

review/summary: lasted 20 minutes
review/text: My dog, a vizsla (50lb, pointer/retriever) loved this - but he also destroyed it.  He broke the rubber/gel molding in a few places within minutes such that he easily removed the included treat part.  I had stuck carrots, hotdogs, etc, in the "trap" center of the ball which gave him a little bit of a project.  Thus it seems to work okay as a puzzle for a little while.  However, I would bet this "trap" will only last a couple more uses as he seems to be able to break the product.<br /><br />I was hoping for a "puzzle" product to add variety to the kong he loves.  Unfortunately I wish now I had saved my money!  20+ dollars for 20+ minutes of dog fun, is not within my budget.<br /><br />Save your money.

review/summary: My dog will not touch this toy.
review/text: I gave the ball with the treat stuck inside to my dog yesterday. He would not go anywhere near it. He sniffed the toy and treat and then walked away and it hasn't been touched since. I think what's turning him off is the smell of the plastic ball itself. It has a VERY strong fake-vanilla scent to it which is unpleasant to humans but must be overwhelmingly gross to a dog. By the way, my dog is not at all picky. He will play with anything and eat anything so this is a real first!<br /><br />Also, I looked at the ingredients for the treat and it's all absolute junk. The first ingredients are wheat and gluten.

review/summary: LOVE THESE- GET THE LARGE SIZE
review/text: Both of our dogs absolutely LOVE these and can stay occupied for at least an hour at a time knawing at it.  IMPORTANT TO CHOOSE A LARGE ENOUGH BALL so they can't get the treat out, as many reviewers have been frustrated by that.  If you have two or more dogs (we have a lab mix--loves to chew--and a french bulldog teething puppy),  I recommend getting all of yours in the larger size, so you don't have to keep track of who is chewing which one. Our dogs sometimes switch, and the lab can get the treat out of the medium ball. If in doubt, just get the largest one.  Our frenchie is perfectly happy with the larger size.

So I did not bother to replace the treats anymore...but it turns out that he just likes to chew on it. And he does- alot!. This is a different kind of really tough and flexible material and it is still intact after several months. So- turns out it was a hit after all!!

review/summary: Great treat for some dogs
review/text: I have 3 Australian Shepherds. This is a great treat for two of them and it lasts a whole heck of a lot longer than any dental treat or the Kongs. My other is smart as a whip and got the treat out in less than 5 minutes. Needless to say, I'm not giving her the treat again because its just a waste of my money. As for the flavors, my guys like the chicken, but that is all we've tried. I didn't realize that these are now available at my Petsmart store, but they don't give you two treats with the purchase of the ball. They toy holder if you will lasts- I haven't had a dog even try to destroy it.  The medium size is perfect for Aussies and Border Collies.

review/summary: Great toy!!
review/text: I have a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier.  She has chewed me out of house and home (literally).  She chewed a huge hole in my kitchen floor, all the way thru to the crawlspace, then proceeded to chew thru the back door (yep you guessed it... she succeeded).  Anyway, stuffed toys are a joke to her.  They last all of 2 minutes, no matter how "tuff" they claim to be.  She generally has no interest in the rubber "Kong" types, so I was skeptical about this Everlasting Toy.  Boy was I wrong.  She is completely addicted. She carries it everywhere.  The disk treat inside lasted about a day.  She had more fun licking it than trying to get it out of the toy.  She finally licked it down so far that it pretty much came out on it's own.  I stuffed little treats in the other side.  She could not put it down.  After going at it a full day, she finally got it empty.  I inspected it at that point.  Not a single puncture or tear.  This thing is amazing.  It was a little pricey at Petsmart.  I'll get the refills here.  Definately worth the $$.  She's about 18 lbs, so I got the medium size.  Perfect fit.<br />*** CON:  The Chicken flavor disks do smell a little yucky.  And, after awhile of constant licking, they also get a little slimey.  I would suggest keeping it off the furniture.

review/summary: get the right size
review/text: From everything I've read, you need to get the right size or your dog can pop out the treat.  We have a 16 lb pom/boston mix, she can't get the treat out of the medium.  I can see all the teeth marks in the everlasting treat, she is really working it.  I fill the other side with some of her daily kibble and she'll roll it around and get her kibble out.  I've put in other treats and she'll go after them too.  The flaps are rather thick, which makes it hard for the treats to come out.  Good for keeping the interest, but not so good for younger dogs that lose interest quickly.  She would have ignored this a month or two ago, at 8 months she can play with it longer.  I put in easy things to get out now, I'll make it harder in a week or two.  This treat, and the inserts, are on the expensive side, but it seems durable enough and she likes it.

review/summary: PERFECT Treat Ball!
review/text: There are so many ways to use this treat ball it will be quite awhile before your pet tires of it!  First you can use it with the included treat caps.  Put one in and your dog will lick it and enjoy it for hours. Be sure you purchase the right size treat ball for your dog - buy one too small and the dog will be able to pop the treat out and chew it up in no time.  Purchase the right size and it will be impossible to remove the treat cap, which is exactly how the toy is supposed to work.<br /><br />Another way to use the cap is to fill it with EveryFlavor Treats (sold separately) by the same company. These are small, soft treats, in many different flavors, that spill out slowly while the ball is played with.  Again, the idea is that the treats are metered out slowly.<br /><br />You can also feed your pet his or her daily kibble in it if it's of small enough gauge.  If you need to, you can clip back the rubber on the ball to make it easier.<br /><br />You can also fill it with a mix of kibble and peanut butter for a double treat.<br /><br />We have these in all three sizes because we have pup's that fit all three.  We have to keep the pets separated while they have them or the Brittany heads straight for this one because he can pull the cap out in about 10 seconds and then chew it up and swallow it in about 2 minutes - a tasty treat which we try to keep him from enjoying!<br /><br />Disclaimer:  We sell this product in our store and it's one of our best-sellers but we use it on a daily basis and have since they started making them.  We still have all our original balls, they're that tough!

review/summary: Bichon/Yorkie mix loves it!
review/text: I bought this for my Bichon/Yorkie pup.  She used to get separation anxiety and really hated being in her crate.  I thought having something to do in there might help.  It didn't.  I solved that problem another way.  But in the mean time this treat ball has become a favorite when she's not in her crate.  She loves it!  It keeps her occupied for hours and the treats do really last a long time (days).  I was so impressed I bought a larger version for my 18lb Bichon/Coton mix.  He loves his too! He's a pretty good chewer although his teeth aren't very sharp. We even bought one for our friends' dog, a 14 lb dachshund who can destroy anything.  He loves it so much his parents call it his "precious".  And, so far he has not destroyed it!  I would just caution that even though these may keep your dog occupied, you should still supervise him/her in case they do get the treat out (I always just put it back in) or if they manage to pull hunks of plastic off.  Hasn't happened for me, but I read that some of the larger breeds have managed it.

review/summary: Great concept - wish it was a bit more durable
review/text: My two little dogs absolutely LOVE the Everlasting Treats that fit into this ball.  This is a great concept, but the rubber is quite soft.  As soon as the treats started to wear down, my dogs began to chew pieces of rubber off of the ball itself.  From the description of this product, I thought the rubber that the ball is made of would be a little more durable than it is.  The replaceable treats, however, last an incredibly long time.  My dogs were totally obsessed with this toy.  My only recommendation is to monitor your dog with this toy and check for signs of wear. Had I replaced the treats sooner (before they had worn down and were difficult for the dogs to get to), I think that my treat balls would have lasted a lot longer.  I recommend this product only with supervision, as my dogs are only around six pounds each and chewed pieces off sooner than I thought they could.

review/summary: Not good for Giant breeds!
review/text: I have an Alaskan Malamute (120lbs) who I do not consider an aggressive chewer, but he is powerful. Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.<br /><br />However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days. Well worth it in her case.<br /><br />I think the key is getting a size appropriate for your dog. If your dog can fit the entire thing in its mouth, it's too small. When in doubt get the next size up, and if you have an XL mouthed breed don't bother.

review/summary: Not for every, dog but nothing is.
review/text: For those of you with champion chewers, I would reccomend this whole heartedly.  I have one destructive chewer that loves it and takes him an hour or so to get the treat out, but if I put little treats inside it takes him alot longer (he even gives up on it).  I have another that has the treat out in 5 minutes and has the little treats out in about an hour (he then waits for the other dog to give up, then finishes that off too).  The blue silicone part is the toy they have had the longest and seems to still be lasting.  I have had it over 6 months.  I have the red fire hydrant one also and it is almost torn up and I have had it less time than this.  I think the configuration of the other allows my dog a better angle to chew (and thus destroy)the toy.<br /><br />I know some people who have destructive dogs complain that it does not last but I would venture to say thier dog is so destructive that nothing works.  I would be interested to know if it outlasted most other toys given to them.  I am not saying it will work for sure for your dog, but I do say it is worth a try, as I considered my dogs hopeless (they tore up everyting in 5 minutes or less) before I found this.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that if you moisten the edges the treat pops in easier (great to know because I was using a spoon to wedge it in).  Just make sure you let it dry before giving it to them so it is more difficult for your dog to get out and (love this tip) put the treat in upside down so the dome is facing inwards and the treat will last longer because it is more difficult for your doggie to get at.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: My dog is very high energy and pretty smart.  She loves this thing, but she always managed to pop out the inserts and eat them whole in under 5 minutes.  What I've started doing instead is inserting a small treat or two into the folds of the center.  This is much harder for her to get out and now this toy occupies her for hours.  It's a pretty durable material, but I'm sure it won't last forever.  I will happily buy another one, though, should it ever fall apart because she LOVES it so much now!  For instance, my dog usually flips out when we say the word "potty" (running laps around the house in excitement) because she knows she is going to get to go outside.  Well, when there is a treat in this thing, I practically have to pry it out of her mouth and hide it just so she will pay attention to the leash!  She almost carried it outside with her the first time I stuffed it with treats.  It's been a long time since I've seen my dog this happy with a toy and remain so content for so long.  Even when she shows interest in a toy initially, she usually gets bored with it rather quickly. Not this though!  I highly recommend this, even if you don't use it as intended!

review/summary: 1 ball, 2 treats = 3 hours for my pit
review/text: My pit mix is a pretty devoted chewer.  I put one everlasting treat into each side of my large everlasting treat ball (and I should mention that this itself took about ten minutes - those things are NOT easy to get in).  My superchewer managed to finish both treats in a marathon 3 hour chew fest. She hurt her leg this week and is supposed to be resting, so it was nice to be able to keep her happily occupied for a while.<br /><br />The ball itself is something we inherited from a friend's dog and we've had it for a while. I don't think it's indestructible but it's one of those toys that she prefers to carry around and play with than to chew.  We sometimes put her kibbles inside the toy and she likes that too - I would say that it ranks fourth in her heart after scented jolly balls, waggle toys and new tennis balls.

review/summary: 24 hours of chewing and licking but wont buy again
review/text: Our lab received this for Christmas. She loved the toy carrying it around all day licking or chewing on the treat cap. A couple of hours into the treat we noticed she would hack / cough as if a piece of the treat was caught in her throat and she needed water. Nothing alarming as her cough quickly cleared what was bugging her and she continued to feast on her treat. We noticed this happened a couple more times throughout the day. I picked up the treat to inspect it and the flavor cap was coming apart in pinch sized pieces. The blue portion was intact and was not showing signs of strain. The smell of the flavor cap was horrible, made me almost vomit but my dog loves it. Then we noticed our dog wasn't feeling so well. She had excessive gas that was room clearing. I looked up what could be causing this and most say its due to a diet change or low quality food being feed to the dog. I saw all kinds of remedy suggestions from rice and veggies to pepto. Her stool is soft but still firm so I am not alarmed. We are just going to ride out the effects and she will just play with the blue portion of her toy.  We feed our dog Blue Buff food so this large flavor cap could be a much lower quality resulting in her digestion issues.

review/summary: Serious waste of money for aggressive chewers
review/text: If you have an aggressive chewer DO NOT BUY THIS.  My 18 month old pit mix was able to pop the end out within minutes.  I put it back in and gave it to him.  within 5 minutes the rug had bits of blue plastic as the holder is very easily chewed.<br /><br />Such a waste of money as that toy is a bit pricey.

review/summary: Great product, but not for smart dogs!
review/text: We bought the large ball for our power-chewing 30lb cattle dog mix, and this product was AWESOME for the first two weeks. She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!

review/summary: Buy a medium Treat Ball for small dogs
review/text: Thank you to the other customers who suggested that people buy a medium Treat Ball. My little dogs popped the treat out of the small one in a matter of minutes. When I first brought home the medium Treat Ball I was afraid that my three little ten pound dogs couldn't lift it. They had no problem lifting it and they couldn't pop out the treat. I had to buy three so they could each have their own. It was a good investment because they last at least a week and they really enjoy it.<br /><br />A few months after my review....My little dogs destroyed three of these. I still gave the ball four stars because I can't find anything else comparable. I don't like to give them too much rawhide.

review/text: Willy, my 14 pound poodle and Gracie my 15 pound Carin terrier both love these everlasting treat balls. We purchased them each their own medium size ball. Takes them approx 6 hours of licking time to make a hollow in the side of one treat. They have never been able to pop one out and the toy itself looks like it is still brand new after being used every day for about 9 months now. It's their favorite watching TV with Mom and Dad treat !

review/summary: Dogs love it!
review/text: I had the small version of the everlasting treat ball, but both my Corgi and Shiba were able to pop out the treats pretty quickly. So I order the large treat ball (which is surprisingly huge). I could barely force the treats into the giant treat ball, but that is good, because neither of my dogs can get the treats out now. Instead it keeps my corgi occupied for ages, and when he has to go in his crate I toss it in there to keep him busy. He loves it. My shiba is not quite as interested in it, but that is just her nature. It was a bit expensive but worth it to keep the puppy busy.

review/summary: Really Tough Toy
review/text: I gave this toy to my 50 lb lab mix, Maddi, a few days ago, with an everlasting treat in each end.  She's been gnawing and playing with it ever since, and she still hasn't gotten in to the treats yet.  I bought the large, and it's a little too big for her, but she doesn't seem to mind.  She can't pick it up until the everlasting treats are chewed almost all the way through.  It's given her plenty to chew on though.  She hasn't looked at anything else since she got it.

review/summary: MY PUPS LOVE THESE
review/text: My 2 dogs absolutely LOVE these balls and the treats. When they see me pull out their blue ball, they get so excited because they know what's coming! They are both around 26 pounds and STRONG chewers. At first I bought the medium size balls but found that they were able to pop the treats out in about 1/2-1 hour. So, I switched to the large size and now they can't get the treat out and it takes them a LONG time to lick and chew on it until its finished. They cant pop the treat out until its almost completely finished. Thus,I would only recommend the large size for any dog over 20 pounds. These are great when you need to keep them occupied for an extended period.

review/text: My one year old pit can be very hyperactive- I bought this just today and at first was a bit disapionted that he kept getting the treat out becuase it was in one of the edge compartments.  Then I tried fiddling with it and managed to stick it in the middle which made it much harder to get to.  After playing a little one sided fetch he's still trying to get at the treat.  It's amazing that something has such power to amuse him for so long! I recommend this toy, especially to puppy owners.  It works wonders.

review/summary: A Winner
review/text: We started off purchasing a medium sized ball for our 40 lb mix breed.  We quickly learned that wasn't enough of a challenge and purchased the large size.  The large size has worked out wonderfully!  It takes him hours to fininsh a treat.  Our other dog who his a 70 lb shepard and who doesn't normally like chew type treats or toys also like it so much that we bought her one as well.  We purchased these about a year ago and they like them a much today as they did then.  We have also learned that the vanilla mint treats are by far the favorite.

review/summary: Better for those that aren't chewers
review/text: My dog quickly figured out that just biting this ball sideways caused the treat to pop out for easier munching.  He made quick work of the "everlasting" treat hunk once it was released from the ball and would repeatedly pop it back out if I reloaded it.  I now use this to just stuff regular treats inside of and it is mediocre.  Definitely not the best or longest lasting treat toy I've found.  For the price, it's just not worth it AT ALL.<br /><br />Perhaps smaller dogs or dogs that are less prone to chewing would get more long lasting enjoyment out of this.  It is more like the "10 minute treat crunching bonanza" for my boy than everlasting.<br /><br />The Premier Busy Buddy treat dispensing toys (particularly this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a>) are more durable, offer more options for filling, and are more difficult/entertaining for the dog...and also much cheaper!  I would highly recommend buying this instead.

review/summary: GREAT - for Small to Medium Sized Dogs!
review/text: My wife and I have a jack Russell mix (25 pounds) and a high energy Chihuahua mix (20 pounds) who we both adopted from shelters.  Whenever we would go out for a night on the town they would absolutely destroy everything! We were looking for a solution for months.  After spending money to baby proof every cabinet and buying yuck sprays we were at our whit's end!  While shopping for dog treats my wife came across the everlasting treat ball!  We ordered 2 and purchased extra discs because we thought that our dogs would surely go through the discs like they go through other treats.  Well, as soon as we got the ball we decided to try it out. We put their favorite sirloin flavored treats inside the bottom of the ball and put a disc on the top side.  We left for dinner and a movie and when we came home we were afraid at what we might find.  To our surprise and delight, they were still busy working on the ball!!  While they were able to get the sirloin treat out they were trying to destroy the disc instead of our stuff!! We have used about 3 discs in 3 weeks so they last a long time.  This works like a charm.  Each time we have to leave the house to go shopping, visit a friend, or go out on a date we leave them with the everlasting treat ball and they are entertained.  We do not let them play with it when we are home, this way they don't get tired of it!!  I highly recommend this product to anyone with small to medium sized dogs!

review/summary: What do you get the dog that has everything?
review/text: I will admit, my dog is spoiled. Not in a "dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled." Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat "caps." The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official "Everlasting" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it "just right." He eats like a cat (when he's hungry), but likes all kinds of food.<br /><br />Crockett and I both hope that this helps you choose well for your pet!

review/summary: Perfect for chewers!
review/text: I bought a medium everlasting treat ball a years ago when my corgi was a puppy. This toy is one of only two toys that she hasn't destroyed, and shes had it almost 4 years. Shes allergic to the ingredients in the caps, so I never get those, I just fill the blue central ball with treats and food. This keeps her busy for 20 minutes or so. The end caps dissolve into goo quicly anyway, so they really aren't worth getting.<br />Given that she's destroyed "undestructable toys," toys made out of firehose material, every stuffed toy, and even killed a kong, I must say that I am very very impressed with how well the treat ball holds up. The treat end caps aren't worth the money, but the central blue ball toy is worth every penny.

review/summary: Sturdy toy, but pricey
review/text: My dogs have chewed up every toy I have ever bought in less than 30 minutes.  I have two Jack Russells, and they are set on destroying everything that is theirs.  I bought two of these balls last Christmas and both are still 100% intact.  I hardly ever put treats in them and the male dog loves to play fetch with it or even just chew on it in front of the tv.  I give it 4 stars though because it costs a lot and the treats come out too easily.  Although, I would have spent well over $100 on other balls that they would have destroyed in the last year, so I guess when you look at it that way, it's more than worth its cost.

I was looking for something to keep the dog busy and entertained for awhile.  If you're paying attention you can put the treat back in place and extend the time a little.  The ball itself is quality material and hasn't gotten chewed up.  Unless the treats drop in price significantly I probably won't buy anymore.

review/summary: Finally some alone time!
review/text: My dog Cora - a 50 lb. Boxer/Pit-bull mix - loves any and all treat toys.  I recently broke down and bought one of these toys and she loves it as well!  I've limited her to one treat every two weeks, since they are not cheap and I don't know the caloric density of these treats and like to keep her weight well regulated.  In the between times, I place treats/kibble inside the ball and she flings it around the apartment to get them out.  I've had to take the Everlasting Treat Ball away from her on occasion because she WILL NOT STOP eating the treat and starts to get frustrated that she CAN'T GET IT OUT!  She has popped out the treats occasionally but only after several hours of chewing and licking it beforehand.  It's nice to have something I can give her that will keep her occupied.<br /><br />TIP: Make sure you get the right size!  Otherwise, it will be more likely that your dog can pop the treats out.  I bought Cora a LARGE.<br /><br />TIP: Put the treats in upside-down!  This trick was mentioned by someone else who commented, and it definitely works for my dog.  It is a lot more difficult for her to pop out the treat if the convex side is toward the center of the ball and the flat surface is exposed.  She does get a bit more frustrated with the toy if I do this though, so I have to watch her more carefully to make sure she's not chewing up the toy just the get the treat!<br /><br />TIP: I tried the fire hydrant version of this toy first, but Cora chewed the edges off around the treat in order to get it out faster.  So... it died.  This one is much more durable since it doesn't have the same sort of "lip" around the edge.

review/summary: This is good but not everlasting...
review/text: Just an FYI to all those who have a smart dog like me -- this may not last as long as you hope. I've tried them all and am on a mission to find soemthing that will keep my pup entertained for a little while and won't break. Kongs don't last for Kobe and as much as he loves squeaky stuffed toys, they don't last more than 10 minutes. Gosh, did I mention he's barely 7 months old - can't fathom how much smarter he will get. SIGH. OK, so you've got an idea what my dog is like onto my review.<br />So I've seen these things both online and at pet stores, and always felt a little unsure about these things. For one thing, these things aren't cheap and two like I've described I've got a really smart Lab. So I broke down and bought this at the pet store after a worker I spoke with highly recommended it. Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a "chewer." Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball. Next thing, he had it out again and this time he chewed a good chunk of it so it no longer fit. So I put it in the inner part of the ball and minutes later he got it out of there too. S-I-G-H.<br />I take off 1 star because in my case it was everlasting. I do give it credit for being pretty durable and the treat took a little while longer for him to eat. Also, it's got a cave you can bury treats in which isn't as easy for them to get things out of. I say it's OK.

I have resorted to cutting the new Kong Ziggy's in half, and jamming them between the flaps and as of writing this - he's been busy for 15 minutes. :) It's a durable enough toy and he seems to really like the squishy factor.

review/summary: Fantastic Toy!
review/text: This toy has saved my sanity and my furniture!  Instead of my puppy chewing the furniture, he chews on this toy instead.  My puppy, who usually tires of toys in a day, has had this one for over a month and it is still the first toy he goes to each morning and the last toy he plays with before going to bed at night.  It took him an entire week of daily, constant chewing to just get through one of these cookies and when he did, he was very excited and pleased with himself!  Once he finished that one cookie, he went on the attack the second one.  I also put treats inside the ball, under the cookies and my dog loves trying to get through one cookie just to get to the treats inside.  I have never seen a cookie as hard and sturdy as these are and my dog loves every flavor he has tried so far.  I highly recommend this toy!  It has kept my active, hyper puppy amused, occupied and happy, every day.  I can not say enough good things about this toy, which is good for puppies and older dogs alike.  The only problem I have found is trying to keep enough of the cookie refills stocked in my home.  I wouldn't dream of running out of the cookie refills  for this toy !

review/summary: Treats pretty dense but not difficult to remove
review/text: I bought this ball for my dog thinking it would be the solution to her intense chewing but it wasn't. In all fairness the treats are very dense so she didn't gobble it up immediately, but it didn't last over 20 minutes.  I put one of the treats in and she immediately grabbed the end that sticks out and pulled it out and began to eat the treat within 5-10 minutes.  I think the treats should be more low-profile so they can't just be pulled out like a human would.  Also, with just one treat in my dog figured out she could just stick her snout in the opposite end the the treat would pop out the other side again.  I took the treat away when it got flat like a disk and stuck it in the middle compartment (where you're supposed to put tiny treats) and she got that out too.<br /><br />SUMMARY: 3 stars because the treats are dense and using tiny treats in the middle alone might make the toy more functional, but the big treats are too expensive and weren't difficult enough to entertain my dog for longer than a rawhide.

review/summary: Its no longer lasting than anything else
review/text: We have a medium size dog who loves to chew. We were looking for a long lasting treat that could keep him occupied for hours and tried the everlasting dog treat ball. I inserted the treat into the toy and gave it to him as soon as it arrived to see how long it would really last. At first it seemed like it was going to work great, but within 15 minutes he had mastered the art of removing treats from the toy and had chomped through half the treat. Once he figured it out the first time, he could remove additional new treats in a minute or two. We went to whole foods and bought 6 bones for the same price as one of these treats; its been an hour and he is still working on the first one.

review/summary: Not so everlasting
review/text: I have a 7 month old springer spaniel puppy, and I've been going through toys at a rapid clip. I bought this because I thought it might keep him occupied awhile and that the toy part would last. He wasn't terribly interested in it at first, but later on he made a project of it. I was encouraged when he stayed working on it for about 30 minutes. He popped the treat out soon after that. I didn't mind so much because I thought he'd just keep chewing on the plastic part - and he did. Unfortunately, it only took another 1/2 hour or so before he had chewed little bits off. I give it poor ratings because a toy named "everlasting" should hold up better than that, esp. one so expensive.

review/text: I noticed some people were saying that their dogs were getting the treat out in 10 min. Make sure you put one of the hard treats in both sides of the treat ball, this makes it harder for the dog to manipulate the ball to get the treat out.

review/summary: Not everlasting
review/text: My dog, a 5 month old Irish setter/golden mix, LOVES it.  From the moment we took it out of the packing, he went to town.  I, however, am not very sold.  We decided that the treat ball would only be given to him during "special" times when he needs to be entertained.  That being said, he's only had it for 4 days during certain times and he is almost through both sides of the treat.  It isn't lasting long at all!!  Also, he was able to get the treat out once, which made me nervous, but hasn't done it since.  I'm not sure if we will keep buying the treats or not.  They aren't cheap enough to justify him going through them in less than a week.  I'm disappointed to say the least.

review/text: A friend got the Everlasting Treat ball and 2 extra refills for my 17lb. dog.  My dog is not a destructive chewer but he had chunks of the blue part torn out within 20 min.

review/summary: Hands Down the Best Hot Fudge EVER!!!
review/text: Sanders first started back in 1875 when Fred Sanders started a single retail shop in Detroit Michigan. At their peak they had 57 retail shops or parlors. The stores not only sold candy, fudge toppings, and baked goods, but also had fountain counters serving light lunches, as well as an assortment of desserts including the popular Ice Cream Sodas, Sundaes and Hot Fudge Cream Puffs. I have lived in the metro Detroit area all my life and getting a Creme Puff Hot Fudge Sunday was a weekly occurrence in my family. Unfortunately the company wound up closing all of their stores back in the early 90's and concentrated on selling their products in regular nationwide grocery stores. Sanders was purchased by Morley Candies, another Metro Detroit company, back in 2002 and thankfully they have started to bring back the Sanders Parlors. As of this writing there are now 6 locations, including 2 that are less than 10 minutes from my house. I cant even begin to express how happy I am to see these stores being opened again. If your ever in the Metro Detroit area and have a chance to stop by one of their retail locations, do it!! It will be the best Hot Fudge Sunday you have ever had.<br /><br />If you do not live in the Metro Detroit area then dont fret. You can still buy their topping in jars and can even buy the creme puffs from their online website. In fact you can now order all of their products from their website. I recently placed an order for some sea salt caramels from their website and was absolutely blown away at the quality of the shipping. I ordered 2 boxes of caramels and a bag of creme puffs and when I received the shipping box I though for sure they had made a mistake as the box weighed like 25 pounds. They didn't make a mistake and the reason it weighed so much is because they had packed in like 30 of these special packets that keep the shipment cold and fresh. I have ordered foods through the mail many times and had never seen such care taken during the shipping process.<br /><br />As for the hot fudge itself, its hands down the best hot fudge I have ever had and I have literally tried well over 50+ brands of hot fudge from all over the world. None of them even comes close to matching the Sanders recipe. I myself prefer the regular milk chocolate version but they now have 7 different flavors including Dark Chocolate, Butterscotch, Cinnamon Pear, Bittersweet Fudge, Dark Chocolate Peppermint Pattie, Carmel Apple and of course the original Milk Chocolate Hot Fudge. I have tried them all and they are all outstanding.<br /><br />The bottom line - If you love hot fudge then you owe it to yourself to at least give Sanders Hot Fudge a try. I really suggest you go all the way and order a pack of creme puffs as well. Just cut a creme puff in half, scoop some vanilla ice creme in the middle of the creme puff and pour hot fudge topping all over it. There is just nothing else like it. Again if you love Hot Fudge then you simply must try some Sanders hot fudge. It simply doesn't get any better than this!!<br /><br />5 Stars and then some!!!

review/text: This company is the worst I have ever dealt with.  I received the item and the box had a slight ding, no big deal.  When I opened it, all 4 cans had large dents, 2 on both the top side and 2 only on the bottom.  Since these were for guests and the cans were not leaking or bulging, I chose to give them away and my guests understood.  The product is excellent, but purchase from Sanders candy themselves.  They are also cheaper.

review/summary: My puppy LOVES these!
review/text: I can't believe how much my puppy goes crazy over these treats!  She can't get enough of them!  After she has quickly consumed one, she spends a good ten minutes licking up the leftover that is stuck to whatever surface she was eating it on!  Be careful about where you let your puppy eat these at, because they could be a bit messy--they're really soft and when they get wet from your puppy's mouth, the combination is a sticky mess!  I do not regret purchasing these treats and I think I'll be getting some more because my puppy loves them so much!  Mine fit inside the small puppy kong and when she chews it down to the bottom, just stick the back side of a spoon or fork into the top of the kong to push the rest of the treat out!

review/summary: great for teething puppies!
review/text: When we are just too tired to run around with our little bundle of energy anymore, we give him one of these. We give him about one per day, so we choose the moment wisely! The result is an extremely happy dog for about 20 minutes. It is a little bit gross to keep pulling the chewed up treat out of the puppy Kong so he can keep going at it after he's finished the end that was sticking out of his puppy Kong, but worth the effort. (This is by far the least disgusting thing I've touched that he's chewed!) Puppies *need* to chew and chew and chew, and this treat is just the right size to provide an excellent alternative to trouble-making. A MUST for a new puppy!

review/text: My little dog definitely loves eating ziggies... but it's not as great as I thought it would be.<br /><br />My dog isn't a great chewer and maybe that's why he  doesn't pay his lil kong too much mind (though he will play fetch with it). After sticking a ziggie in about half way, he carried it to his bed and ate it pretty quickly. So I know he definitely enjoys it, but if a piece gets stuck inside, he just gives up. And it seems to crumble a bit too much for my liking, leaving tiny lil pieces of it all over his bed...

review/summary: Free Shipping?
review/text: My puppy loves these treats but the only reason I ordered them from Amazon instead of getting them from a local pet store is because of the "free shipping". Somehow free shipping turned into $3.90 postage due when they arrived. I would have refused the package but didn't want to deal with the hassle of trying to get my credit card refunded. It would be nice if the company would be bothered to get back to me about a credit/refund but so far they can't be bothered. I would call this false advertising.<br /><br />Update: After a couple of e-mails posted to the company asking for a refund/credit, I did get a response promising to refund the amount I paid for the postage due. I appreciate the timely response from the company and have changed my rating for the item to reflect this. I never had a problem with the product itself...the treats are great, but I did have a problem with paying for what was supposed to be free.

review/summary: Almost Packaged To Well
review/text: I was extremely nervous about ordering a bonsai tree online. I was worried that it may not be packaged well enough, or that it may come in poor condition. However, I swallowed all my fears and finally decided to order this particular tree. When it arrived, it was packaged very well. There was no way that the tree could have moved or been shaken during shipping. It was almost packaged to well, and I almost cut the tree while trying to remove the tape around it. Health wise, the tree looked and felt very healthy. I have yet to see any health problems with it.<br /><br />Another benefit of ordering this tree, is that it comes with some extra bonsai supplies. The book, 101 Bonsai Tips, is a bit small and lacking in information. But what it does have is wonderfully informative. The trimmers of of excellent build quality, and can easily prune the leaves. Although I typically prune my Junipers with my fingers, the pruners are a nice accessories to have. I have not yet used the wire that came with it, but I have bent it around and played with it a little. It feels like it is of great quality, but I have yet to try it on a tree. Bearing in mind that all of these things come in addition to the tree, you know this is a great buy.<br /><br />If you are hesitant about ordering a bonsai tree online as I was, I assure you that this one is alright. I have no complaint about it. Also, the price of this package is extremely reasonable. I highly recomend ordering this Bonsai  pack if you are interested in starting Bonsai. If you are already a Bonsai master, but just want another tree, then this is also the one to get. I highly recomend it.

I was not disappointed when it arrived!  It's a beautiful little juniper, just as pictured, and came with a clay pot, tray, potting soil, clippers, and a nice little guidebook.  Putting "fragile" on the box would probably be a good idea, as suggested by the previous reviewer, but the sellers did a great job packing everything up.  The corner of my box was damaged in transit, but everything inside was just fine!  I'm looking forward to giving this nice bonsai tree to my fiance for Valentine's Day!

review/summary: I like hardwood smoked flavor but not pine smoke.
review/text: I purposely gave this a high rating though I personally do not like it. I want to provide another perspective on this product without scaring away some who may only look at the 'number of stars' versus the textual content of the review. I smoke my own bacon, hams, shoulders, ribs, etc. I'm a southerner. That's what we do. However, I use hickory, mesquite, pecan, oak, apple, etc. Lapsang Souchong tea leaves are laid out on bamboo and infused with pine smoke. Folks, pine with its natural resins is not a good wood for smoking meats. Therefore, it's unlikely you've ever tasted anything in Amercia smoked with it. Don't expect smokehouse or pit barbeque smokiness in this tea. Think more of the smokiness you'd experience from burning brush or a pile of lumber. I do love Twinings black tea and highly recommend Earl Grey, Prince of Wales, Darjeeling, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Black Currant Breeze, and Orange Bliss. They are wonderful. You may thorougly enjoy the smokey essence in Lapsang Souchong. Just be advised that its not your daddy's barbeque smoke flavor.

review/text: My only warning is that if you do not like smoked foods then avoid this tea at all costs. It smells like smoky bacon and has a delicious and pretty much unrivaled flavor that is just so hard to describe.  As for the twinnings brand they succeed with this flavor of tea but if you can do get it from a proper tea shop that sells it out of a tea bag. It's always good for a cold day and really helps me relax after working on homework. Again, if you don't like smoky foods do not risk buying this just to experience a new flavor because while very good it is also very strong (as black tea should be!)

review/summary: maybe an acquired taste
review/text: Like another reviewer, I do not like smoked foods (cheese, meats, etc).  So, I took a gamble by purchasing this tea because I was looking for new and unique flavors.  The description says "golden black tea with a delicate smokey flavor." Delicate could not be farther from the truth!  This was shipped to me along with 5 more boxes of different Twinings flavors. When I opened the package, all I could smell was this - despite the fact that each bag is sealed in a paper bag, inside a plastic wrapped box!  The smoke smell was overwhelming. When I showed it to my husband, he said it smelled like tobacco.  The smell was so bad, I could not even brew a cup.<br /><br />Other reviewers obviously enjoyed this, but for me it was a complete waste of money. I could not even give the tea away.

review/summary: A St. Louis Original -- Best Chocolate EVER
review/text: My husband grew up in St. Louis (let me know if you want to know which High School ;-)  and the first Christmas he came to our house, he brought us a pound of the Milk Chocolate.  He certainly knew how to win over my family because our entire family practically had fist fights over this chocolate.<br /><br />It is incredibly creamy, rich, and full of flavor.  It makes Nestles taste like cardboard.  Their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZXXWF0">Bissinger's Dark Chocolate Peppermint Bark (10 Oz)</a> is also like Nirvana.<br /><br />Service from Bissinger's is excellent and they often have free shipping. Every year, I send this all over the country to all of my family members and it is always the most popular part of the holidays for many.<br /><br />I've had a LOT of chocolate in my 40+ years... this is by far the best I have ever had.

review/text: As a St Louis native who now resides in Virginia, Karl Bissinger's Chocolate was at the top of the list of things I missed after moving.  Thank goodness for the internet.  Prior to purchasing these online, we routinely made trips back to St Louis to purchase Bissinger's Chocolate.  No we aren't really crazy, but this chocolate spoils you for any other chocolate). I have used this chocolate for years to make fresh chocolate covered strawberries for friends.

review/text: Yup, these are probably the best jelly beans out there.  Yeah they don't come in all the weird flavors like jelly belly but they are very good and very well made.  These were super fresh when they arrived.  These are usually only available at Easter time but through the magic of Amazon you can get them nice and fresh year round.  They arrived safe and sound in just a couple of days! Yum!

review/text: These jelly beans are the best. Nothing like them anywhere. If you miss out on these you will be missing one of the most flavor bursting candies on the planet. Everyone who tries them are amazed with the flavor and want a bag of their own. Don't miss out and get some before they stop making them. I will be giving these out to my very best friends instead of the same ordinary chocolates I use to give out as gifts.

review/summary: Average At Best
review/text: Jelly beans are one of my favorite candy treats, but these are average at best.  There is an initial faint flavor release on the first bite that very quickly dissapates, and the chew is grainy in texture.  Very sweet.  They definitely need a flavor boost to compare with Sunburst or Jelly Belly brands.

review/summary: Great Anytime of Day!
review/text: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:<br /><br />--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I'd had a relatively "healthy" start to the day.<br /><br />--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.<br /><br />--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!

review/summary: soft, chewy, yummy!
review/text: I was recently given a complimentary "vox box" from influenster, call the mom vox box. It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie "raisins" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets

review/text: I received a Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie to try/eat for free from Influenster [...]). I shared the cookie with my kids, and we gobbled up the cookie faster than you can say "Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookies." It was soft (as advertised) and included a sufficient amount of raisins to make me happy (I like raisins). It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)
