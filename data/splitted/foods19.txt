review/summary: I've had worse but I've had better too.
review/text: As someone who lives and dies by seafood I've had my fair share of lobster bisque. This stuff, while not completely horrible, needs some love before it's decent. The texture isn't quite there, not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either. As for the taste, it's rather bad. A little on the bland side. As a Marylander I reached for the one thing that fixes all things seafood, Old Bay. Dumped in a liberal amount and stirred while still on the heat. The Old Bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat. Doubt I'll be purchasing this brand again though.

review/summary: As far as canned soups go
review/text: As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different brands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh.

review/text: I advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you. The tomally functions as the lobster's liver and pancreas. However, even in the cold Scottish waters, dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public. I was disappointed to discover this information, so I only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors.

review/summary: Lovely seeds for your cereal, baking or yogurt
review/text: In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.<br /><br />The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.<br /><br />We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt.

review/summary: The best flaxseeds I've ever had
review/text: I've been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits. I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had. To get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder. We usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade, crystal light, or tea and drink it down quick before it expands. Flaxseeds are loaded with minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and fiber. They are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation. There are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it's against the review guidelines to post links so I'll just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google.

review/text: It's best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega3. Since you are grinding the seeds yourself, the released omega 3 oils are at their freshest.<br /><br />I recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer. You can keep them there after you open them as well. I grind 2 tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake. Good stuff!

review/summary: It would be a 5 if it weren't for the rocks.
review/text: I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste.  This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.  BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds.  I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole.  Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.<br /><br />After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.  Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.<br /><br />I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag.

review/summary: They're Good Seeds.
review/text: These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily.  Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own.  Will buy again.  I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time.  So we grind a week's worth at a time.  Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well.  Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods.

I chew on this like the Romans and Greeks and it gets stuck on my molars.<br /><br />These seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice.  Go figure.<br /><br />I incorporated a 1.5 cup into the regular white loaf recipe from The Breadbaker's Apprentice and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and I did not get much of a rise, so I baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the bread rose to its usual height.  Since white bread is not that healthy, I will include flax seed ground in my food processor to ameliorate the ill effects.

Very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is Mrs. May's Almond Crunch. From the first time I tasted it, to every time I eat it now, I am amazed at the crunchiness, quality of the almonds, lightly-sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle-like, attention to healthiness in the ingredients, etc. As a side note, because of how much I was impressed by this product, I went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of Mrs. May's products, from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches, etc. Perhaps I'm biased to the original, but none of the others have that same magic. I would rate the rest as 4 stars. But the almond crunch should get 6 stars.

review/text: After reading some of the frothing reviews criticizing Mrs. Mays for manufacturing their product in China -- which doesn't in any way address the quality of the product itself -- I tried to confirm this for myself. The website and packaging say nothing about this, so I wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured. Here is the response in full:<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thank you for your purchase and inquiry. We understand your concerns because<br />food item are very personal. If you can spear a few moments to read details<br />about our quality assurance, it would be appreciated.<br /><br />Our factory in China is HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point)<br />by US agency & BRC certified UK agency.

We hope we have assisted you correctly.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Julie<br />Mrs Mays<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I've read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops, Communism, and carbon footprint. To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it.

review/text: Mrs. May's should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. I won't be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. Do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in China. Totally frightening what they're getting away with.

review/summary: Mrs Mays Anonymous
review/text: There ought to be a recovery program. But the good side is that a Mrs. Mays addiction is healthy. I already have a stack of boxes in the garage so I won't run out. And here I am stockpiling more (in case of nuclear holocaust).<br /><br />Almonds have always been my staff of life -- raw, roasted, dry roasted, blanched, flavored, and of course Mrs Mays. I rarely have a day without them. I even feed them to the parrot. A bird guy told me they were the healthiest. And the bird goes nuts for Mrs. Mays.<br /><br />These are, dare I say, miracle nuts. One taste and I was hooked. How she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle. If you're tired of tastless, bland, gotta-eat-it-because-its-healthy snacks from the nutrition store, try these for a pleasant awakening.<br /><br />Mike

review/text: We are typical Americans who know we should eat better, but often don't because "health" food is usually expensive and frankly doesn't taste that good.  That is why we are so thankful to have found Mrs. May's products!!  They are all very healthy and quite tasty, and ordering them from Amazon keeps the cost down.  My son's a golfer, and I am always looking for portable, healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag.  Mrs. May's products fit the bill nicely.

review/summary: Great taste - but honestly what goes inside ?  read on ...
review/text: I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.

review/text: The negative reviews of Mrs Mays products just because it is made in China are not really valid, cannot base on other companies' poor quality control and apply to every company in the country!  There are many bad quality foods that are made in the USA that's bad for your health, so just because it's labeled made in USA doesn't mean it is good quality.  As long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales.

review/summary: Noticablely tastey!
review/text: So... I usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta.  It's usually all the same to me.  HOWEVER... when I tried this brand of pasta, I noticed that it does taste better.  I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?  Yes, that's how good it is in comparison!  Mmmmmm Mmmmm!

review/summary: Chiclets--Fond memories and a taste of the past--fresh as new!
review/text: Gum made without sugar substitutes isn't easily obtained these days, so I was happy to find Chiclets through Amazon Prime.  Sugar substitutes present problems for persons sensitive to them, so it's good to have the option of gum made the old-fashioned way. Another source for this and other gum from yesteryear is Vermont Country Store online; however VCS sells the same box of Chiclets for $14.95, so clearly Amazon is a better deal.  Amazon Prime (free shipping) makes it a much better deal.<br /><br />My Great-Grandpa used to come home with Chiclets from time to time, so this gum isn't just loaded with long-lasting peppermint flavor, but long-lasting, happy memories, as well.  I guess you can say there's a lot packed into such a little piece of gum.  Hope you enjoy as much as I do.

review/summary: Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder
review/text: I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.

review/summary: great alternative to bottled green tea
review/text: The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something "healthlier." I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.

review/summary: nice substitute for soda or sugary tea
review/text: I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very Reasonably Priced and Delicious
review/text: If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for "White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream," "Green Tea Papaya Nectar" and "Green Tea Sugar Cookies." You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Stash Premium Mint Green Iced Tea Powder
review/text: As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.

review/summary: No Flavor - Not Authentic
review/text: I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!

review/text: To get a more intense taste, I mix two packets in a 16-oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, adding 8 oz of water and the rest ice, plus a packet of Stevia, shake well, sip, and oh so good! No-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidants, and I'm drinking a lot more water. I also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants, saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories. Although the Stash rep tells me there is a "negligible" amount of caffeine, the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout. Since I love mint, I think I've found the perfect product.

review/text: This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said "negligible."<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product.

review/summary: Good tea taste, not sweet
review/text: This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: "Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties." Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well.

review/summary: Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again
review/text: I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.

review/summary: Trying this product for the first time
review/text: I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool-aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.

review/summary: YUM....Yum, Yum!!!!
review/text: This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea "add to bottled water" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this "top shelf" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!

I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves--no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K.

review/summary: Just had a glass today
review/text: When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said "natural", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong "mint" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)

review/text: This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.

review/text: I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.

review/summary: not too sweet, not too strong, just right
review/text: As a long time tea drinker, was happy to come across this iced tea mix.  It serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing.  I find this iced tea very refreshing.  I really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content.  The plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry.  The blueberry is good too; it's unsweetened, so I add half a packet of Truvia.

review/summary: Great pick me up on the go - hot or cold!
review/text: I really enjoy this tea because it's not to sweet and it's easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants.

review/summary: Easy and tasty for better health
review/text: Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it.

review/summary: Very refreshing!
review/text: Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners, and really does not need them.<br />This is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well!

review/summary: Powdered Green Tea by Stash
review/text: Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. Simply pour in water bottle, shake and be on your way.<br /><br />Product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. Much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on Amazon.

review/summary: Just as expected
review/text: I was looking for mint green tea I could carry with me to mix up while out and about. If that's what you want, then this product is perfect. I add a little extra water, but that's just my taste. So, if you're looking for mint green tea powder . . . look no further!

review/summary: Great taste and convenient
review/text: This has a great rich taste. Remember this is ground whole leaf, so the tea is stronger than you may expect.  Not overly sweet and dissolves readily.  I use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a Polar bottle.
