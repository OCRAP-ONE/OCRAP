review/summary: Better than the peanut butter chocolate chip bars
review/text: I liked the trail mix bar better than the PB chocolate chip bars that Bakery on Main makes but they still have the problem of being too sweet.  Is it possible to make a bar that doesn't cause your blood sugar to sky rocket (and crash)?  All of this being said, I still enjoyed my bars.

Maybe instead of so much sugar they could add more fruit pieces or something that would balance the sweetness out. They are still a great on the go or after the gym snack.

review/text: I usually buy this at my membership warehouse during the holiday season.  It comes as a box that makes 4 loafs which is the same box pictured in the photo shown here on amazon.  This leads you to believe that that you get 2 packs of 4 loaf each kits for a total of 8 loafs.  That is not what you get.  They send you two 2 loaf packs for a total of 4 loafs.  You get 8 loafs for the same price by purchasing it at costco or sams club when the holidays are here.  I will definitly stock up next year.  But if you love it (it is awesome) and run out, guess you gotta pay.

review/text: This pumpkin bread mix is very easy to use.  Simple directions and ingredients to be added.  I baked mine in a bundt pan, but they list plenty of options to suit anyone.  Various size muffin pans and bread loaf pans can be accommodated.  The taste of this pumpkin bread is wonderful.  It is moist and flavorful.  The pumpkin aroma while baking is sublime and the taste afterward is mild but distinctly pumpkin.  I almost never bake with a mix, this is one excellent exception.

review/summary: I hate to admit it, but this is better than my homemade recipe.
review/text: I am well known in my family for my home made breads and baked goods (sorry I had to toot my own horn there). I used to think from-scratch was ALWAYS best. But even I can't top how delicious the pumpkin bread comes out when made with this kit. I took the sliced loaves of pumpkin bread to a school picnic and people were going back for seconds and thirds.<br /><br />Your kit basically has the can of pumpkin, the dry mix and the icing packet. Add your own (4)eggs, oil and water to the pumpkin, blend, then add in the dry mix and stir just until moistened. Pour in tins and bake. Easier and faster than measuring the dry mix ingredients out one by one in a scratch recipe.<br /><br />Hint1: use olive oil. It mades for a moist and dense bread and definitely smells better than anything made with corn oil.<br /><br />Hint2: butter the loaf tins generously. I think butter does the job better than nonstick spray...just a personal preference.<br /><br />Hint3: stir in the dry mix JUST until moistened. Overstirring toughens anything made with wheat flour. Do not try to "work the lumps out". They work out on their own in the baking process.<br /><br />This recipe made one 8X4 loaf plus three "mini" 5X3 loaves. You can get a bundt cake out of this or make other sized loaf combinations if you like. Probably even makes great muffins ( I don't have the back of the box to check on this right now).

review/text: OMG !!!!!!!! Last year I purchase 36 boxes of this mix. Think I'm nuts ?  This has got to be the worlds greatest. I make them for church, gifts and of course for me. My 3 year old great grandson is crazy about his pumpkin bread, & I don't blame him. My secret is that I use Mayonaise instead of oil and they come out so moist and YUMMY. Unfortunately this year they are hard to obtain as there was a flood in last years pumpkin fields. So now I will need to be using my scratch recipe for all my pumpkin baking as I could only obtain 2 boxes. Enjoy what you can get.

I tastes just like pumpkin pie but it's bread of course. You must try it! Even my picky husband and toddler loved it which says a lot for our family.<br /><br />I made sure to grease the pans well so I did not have any issues getting them out. I used half a batch to make muffins and the other half for a loaf. I cooked them separately because of the cook time and they both can out perfect. I will definitely be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Nothing special.  In between great and awful.
review/text: Mmmm, it's the time of year when I remember how yummy pumpkin tastes.  So when I saw this Pumpkin Bread kit on sale I decided to give it a shot.  The recipe was super easy.  Add a few eggs, oil, and water to the canned pumpkin and then add their prepackaged dry ingredients.  I baked mine in a bundt pan (baking directions are on the package.)  The mixture provided too much batter for the bundt pan.  And even taking some out made for an overflowed baked product.  The final product tasted fine.  The texture was a bit chewier than expected.  And the spice level was a little muted.  I'm sure you could do better if you made it from scratch.  But do you really want to do that?<br /><br />The box shows you can also make muffins, so I'll try that next time.  I bet you can spruce these up with a little spice, and maybe jazz up the icing with some cream cheese.

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/summary: Came highly recommended by our dogs breeder
review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/summary: Response to the 2-star review...
review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this
review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/text: I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/summary: Super for my Shiba
review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.

review/text: We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.<br /><br />We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.

This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.

review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

review/text: I enjoy the occasional bowl of Frosted Flakes, but like everyone I also like to cut back on my sugar intake. So when I saw this reduced sugar version, I decided to try it. Unfortunately, the lack of sugar on the flakes (which I did not miss) made the flakes completely soggy once they hit the milk. For this reason, you might as just buy cornflakes, which do hold up in milk.<br /><br />I agree that you don't miss the sugar, however, the taste isn't as strong either.

review/text: We have to keep several bottles of this in our home because it has become the household favorite.  It is thick and has a wonderful flavor.  My wife and I use it on Salads and the traditional things like veggie dip.  My kids use it like a condiment on so many things, pizza, burritos and more.<br /><br />Here's the kicker for this dressing.  We have a complicated home.  My wife has Celic and can't eat things with Gluten, and I am using Atkins to drop some lbs... this Ranch works for all of us in the home.  It is very low in Carbs, and it's Gluten free.  It has 2 Carbs per serving so you can use it even in the induction phase of Atkins.<br /><br />As you would expect for a bulky and heavy food item, if you can find this locally you will probably save.  Our big box grocery stores and even our local brand stores all carry this.  Check it out; if you like Ranch at all, you'll like this version.<br /><br />5 stars for a great Ranch dressing.

review/summary: Lovely Lemon Ginger Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I love Jerky. I use to order it on eBay and other sellers mainly from Seattle. Like pizza, everyone has their preference to the type of jerky they like best. My preference is the harder type and then I'll leave it in my mouth and slowly chew on it. I don't like the soft gooey type. To me, the hard dried out jerky is the best, as 20 or so seconds in your mouth will soften it like a piece of gum ready for chewing. Being a vegetarian my preference is the salmon and tuna jerky. SnackMasters makes both. I ordered a box of each. It arrived in short time and I could not wait to jump in. You must watch out when your friends come over as the jerky will be consumed in record time. I had a friendly poker game with 6 friends and we went through 5 packages of jerky! My friends are now all sold on SnackMasters jerky. This by far is the best jerky I have ever had and I highly recommend it.

It really is the best I've ever tasted, and I have tried many times to find a jerky that is just as good or better than SnackMasters. It just doesn't exist. Trader Joe's no longer sells this jerky.

review/text: This is absolutely the best jerky I have ever found.  It is getting harder & harder to find, thank goodness for Amazon.  I agree with other reviewers, the larger packages are better than the smaller because then seem to have the larger, better pieces.  Enjoy!

review/summary: The best Turkey Jerky I've had
review/text: This is hands down the best Turkey Jerky I've had. We used to buy it at Trader Joes, but it was then discontinued and replaced with their own, inferior brand. I was then on a hunt to find it elsewhere.<br /><br />This jerky walks a great line of not being either too dry or too soft, has great turkey flavor and a salty, pleasing teriyaki flavor. Some may think this is too salty - for me it is perfect, but I love salty things.

review/summary: Jerkey
review/text: I ordered this jerkey for my husband who tells me its the best jerkey out there. We have tried both the beef and turkey and both are great. There isn't another jerky out there that can compare.

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky on the market
review/text: Snackmaster's makes the best Jerky I've ever had. All of their Turkey Jerky product are exceptional, but I'm quite partial to the Teriyaki. It has a faint hint of sweetness that's very nice. Most turkey jerkies I've tasted had a slight chemical taste. And most were somewhat powdery. Not the case with this brand. Great taste and nice and chewy.

review/summary: Not very good...
review/text: Jack Link's turkey jerky has not been available for a while, so I tried this.<br /><br />It tastes like jerked worcestershire sauce. There isn't much I can add. I'll not buy it again.
