review/summary: Finally, we have the sour Geckos.
review/text: A few months ago on a family road trip we stopped into a combo BBQ / Gas Station / Candy Store.  My Five year old loves sour candy.  I see these interesting little Geckos (a sour candy never seen by our family before).  So I bought her one.  Ever since that trip, my daughter has asked and asked for me to find her another Gecko.  Well after random in and outs at any of the local filling stations with zero luck, I knew Amazon wouldn't let me down.  And now we have enough Geckos for her to share one with all of her classmates!<br /><br />These are really good.  Here is how I would rate them in a few areas (1 - 10 scale) comparing them to other sour candy (worms, patch kids, warheads, rips, punch straws, etc...)<br /><br />Sour Level: 5 (not the most sour but still has some zing to it)<br />Sweetness: 6 (a little sweet but nowhere near as sweet as Sour Punch Straws or Sour Patch Kids)<br />Hardness: 3 (these are pretty soft and chewy - not sticky)<br />Flavor Distinction: 5 (of the different colors, there is a slight variation of flavors but nothing dramatic)<br /><br />My Overall opinion of these: One of the best sour gummies I have had.  They're not too sweet, not too sour, and I like the softness.

review/text: Because it has MSG.  People are vastly over-concerned about MSG: it's a very small percentage of people who may have a legitimate reaction to the stuff, apparently.  Consider that the Japanese put it in tons of their food, and it's all over our food too (anything made with bouillon, for example).<br /><br />This is the best mayo.  It makes everything it touches delicious.  Sometimes I have to force myself not to buy it because we end up putting it on everything, and I worry at the thought of consuming that much mayo (ie, for fat and cholesterol reasons, but msg concerns).<br /><br />Try this, you'll be hooked.

review/text: For years, I would go to a small Izakaya joint where I'd drink Japanese beer and have some insanely delicious small dishes like shishito peppers, lotus root, sashimi, etc. There was one dish that always hit the spot after a few beers: chunks of fried chicken with Kewpie mayo on the side. I'm not the kinda guy to be passionate about mayonaise, I never thought about it much, to be honest. But this mayo made me kinda crazy and in fact I ended up going to a market in Little Tokyo in search of this beauty (before it was available on Amazon) and it was worth every bit of effort.

review/summary: Had to try it...
review/text: After reading other reviews on this mayo, I had to give it a try.  I grew up on Hellman's mayo, and as another review observed, you will probably prefer what you are used to.  Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor, I can't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste.  I want to try making some deviled eggs with it, I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor.  I also tried Duke's mayo, which is a lot like Hellman's, only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor.  I'm glad I tried both of these, I expect I will use up the Dukes, not sure about the Kewpie mayo.  It recommends using within one month after opening.  But ultimately, I think I'll end up staying with what I am used to, which is Hellman's.

review/text: I saw a TV segment wherein a chef specified the use of "Japanese mayonnaise" in a recipe, so I Googled it and found it on Amazon.  It comes in a very soft, pliable, plastic container, kind of floppy (Phthalates???).  It isn't much different than American Mayonnaise but does differ in a couple of areas.  It is a bit more tart and tastes more "egg'y" to me.  It says it's made with "vegetable oil".  Not sure what that is comprised of, possibly all or part soy, which is something I am trying to stay away from since, if it's not organic, is genetically engineered (GMO).  If the phthalates and the GMO aspect are not an issue with you, go ahead and try it.

review/text: If you've never tried this French Vanilla coffee, then you're in for a real treat.  I took this into work the other day and literally, it looked like one of those weird commercials when people are floating towards the coffee room!  Everyone went crazy over this stuff - it smells so much like caramel when it's brewing and when it is done, the flavor is just so very rich that I just drink it black.  I really cannot recommend this one enough, and everyone that I know that has tried it, now keeps it on hand all the time.  This is my morning breakfast coffee now - lot less calories than a doughnut with the same effect (well, sorta!).  This is a little pricey here though.  I pay four dollars for it at my local hardware store (yes, I did say hardware store!).  This is the number one brand of coffee in the country, per consumer reports. Highly, highly recommend!

review/text: I moved from NY to SF, the land of the coffee snob.  I missed my cheap tasty coffee.  Thank God Amazon sells my favorite-est cheap flavored coffee!  If you're not in to the burnt starbucks flavored 'gourmet' coffee and just want an pleasant cup of joe in the morning, look no further.  Unless you prefer Hazelnut, then check out 8-O'Clocks hazelnut beans...

review/summary: Very refreshing
review/text: We have a coffee maker that grinds whole beans as part of making the coffee.  Eight O'clock brand is reasonably priced and makes a very refreshing, tasty cup when ground and brewed as part of the same process.  My wife and I have also found that adding a small amount of ground coffee with chicory to the filter basket imparts an extremely interesting taste.  We've been using this combination nearly two years and it has turned us against coffee not made by our coffee maker.

review/summary: Delicious cup of coffee
review/text: I've been trying a lot of different coffee beans lately and this is one of the best.  I would rate this up there with Kona coffee from Hawaii.  This is delicious coffee and I make it with an Aeropress coffee maker.  I will try the French press with these coffee beans tomorrow but I know this will be delicious.  It is not bitter, have a very good french vanilla taste, and the smell is amazing.  I love the smell of this bean when you open the bag and when its steeping in the hot water.  I will deifnitely be ordering this coffee bean again.  I will also be trying more coffee beans from Eight O' Clock cofee.

review/summary: Too much vanilla ruined our coffee grinder
review/text: This is probably fine if you like Maxwell House International Coffee and you drink your coffee with lots of sugar. But I was looking for a hint of vanilla, and this was far more than a hint. I made a pot, took two sips, and poured the rest down the drain.<br /><br />But the reason I'm giving it one star is that grinding six tablespoons of this left our Capresso burr grinder reeking of vanilla. That hasn't happened with other vanilla-flavored coffees we've tried. Running non-flavored beans through didn't cure it, nor did disassembling and cleaning it. The vanilla seems to have permeated some silicone parts that can't be cleaned, and it's flavoring other coffee we run through it, so we're buying a new grinder. That was a very expensive pot of coffee. :-(

review/summary: These cloves taste off
review/text: I've bought so many different Brands of cloves, that it never occurred to me that I could buy one, especially an organic one, which wouldn't taste quite right.  I thought cloves taste like cloves... and didn't really think much of it.  Well, unfortunately these Simply Organic cloves do not taste like the McCormick, Badia, or even Store Brand ground cloves I've bought.  They don't taste like the whole cloves I've ground by hand in a spice blender either.  They taste... weird.  Just off a bit.  The color is redder too.  We go through a lot of cloves in my house--both using it in tea as a flavoring and in cooking/baking.  I've never encountered this before.<br /><br />Packaging is nice.  Price was great.  Amazon did a great job in wrapping it in a ton of bubble wrap.  But now I'm stuck with three large bottles of cloves that I don't see myself finishing.  If you've bought this brand at the health food store and like them--then maybe commit to the 3-pack.  Otherwise, I advise you to steer clear.

review/summary: Staple Food Item in my Pantry!!!
review/text: My husband being of Middle Eastern descent, introduced me to my first falafel on a visit to a little Middle Eastern market in the Boston area.  When I saw this mix in the grocery store I decided to give it a try and the rest is history.  These are so delicious I don't know if I will ever bother to try making them from scratch.  Sadly, we moved away from the store who carried this product and have yet to find another store with this OSEM (or, AWESOME, as I call it) mix.  Out of the blue, I decided to look for it on Amazon and surprise!!! Yes, there are a lot of packs in this order but they won't be wasted.  I plan to make some for an upcoming party as an appetizer.  Note, I do tend to make mine a little larger and while the pack yields around 30, I only yield half that amount.  I can't stress how wonderful they taste.  Throw them in a pita with lettuce, tomatoes and onions topped with a nice tahini/lemon/water/salt paste - amazing.<br /><br />Word of caution, when preparing, just make sure you form the balls with wet hands or the batter will stick to your hands.  What I find works well is to wet my hands, gently shake, form two balls, wash my hands and start the process all over again with wetting my hands.  Also, while I have seen some mixes say they can be baked, I have not tried it with this mix.  The instructions don't mention it as an option but I will probably try it one of these days.  For now, I fry. We don't have an exhaust fan so it does make the kitchen a little smelly because of all of the herbs.  We open windows to help it air out.  Totally worth it!!!  These are fantastic in my opinion.

review/text: Falafel have been one of my favorite foods for several decades.  I have eaten them in many restaurants in Europe and the USA but have never found a mix that I like until Osem.  It is my platonic ideal for falafel:  light and flavorful with none of those bitter overtones that other mixes have.  They are quick to make and the mix also keeps a very long time---I just found a packet that I bought well over a year ago, cooked it up and the results were just as fab as with a fresh package!

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: The fact that these are gluten-free is really just a bonus to a delicious, satisfying cracker.  I was snacking on them prior to my teenaged daughter going on a GF diet because Nut-Thins are just incredibly tasty!  They are thin with a hard crunch, and a complex nutty flavor.  We've tried all of the various varieties of Nut-Thins, and I can't decide which is my favorite.  The Ranch and the Cheddar are great for out-of-the-box snacking.  Try the other varieties with a small slice of cheddar cheese for a little bite of YUM!.  Often the flavor powder on other crackers can be a bit heavy on the salt, so I was concerned before trying these since they are already a "salty" cracker.  But these are seasoned perfectly, where the saltiness seems to be the same as the non-flavored varieties.<br />Recently, my daughter had some of these Nut-Thins with her on an outing with her friends.  Her friends asked if the crackers were some of her "disgusting" gluten-free food.  My daughter persuaded them to try the Nut-Thins, and all of the girls declared the crackers to "taste great!" as they polished off the entire bag.<br />At the risk of sounding like a commercial, I have to say that, whether or not you are on a Gluten-Free diet, try all of the Nut-Thin varieties!  And get more than one box, because once you and your family taste them, they won't last long!

review/summary: Almond Nut Thins Country Ranch
review/text: I've had some of the Nut-Thins crackers before, and I enjoyed them.  That being said, this wasn't my favorite flavor of them.  It just didn't have that great of a taste.<br /><br />I love pretty much anything flavored ranch.  Dressing, powder, popcorn, etc., it's all good.  This however, was not as good of a ranch.  It started out with a good initial flavor, kind of a buttermilk light flavored ranch with a punch of garlic, but then the taste quickly devolved into a pretty gross tasting after-taste.  And I think this was from the rice flour used.  I'm not a fan of rice flour, there's just something slightly sour about the taste that I really don't like the taste.  So to go from a lovely ranch to that just ruined the cracker for me.<br /><br />I was surprised at how many ingredients were in these crackers since they are natural and gluten free.  I'm guessing most of it was the flavoring, but it was still quite long.  And the first ingredient was rice flour.  So right there's where I had my problem.  The next was the almonds luckily so at least they were right up there, and then the rest was the ranch flavoring.  I was surprised that there wasn't that much garlic in there, because it was such a predominant flavor in the cracker.  It also had a few ingredients I couldn't pronounce, but always make me wary.  Although it's hard to say without an intense research if these are natural or not.  And I'm just not that ambitious.<br /><br />Calories are 130 a serving, and that's about 16 crackers.  So in all, that's actually pretty good.  It's perfect for accompanying a meal or you can just snack on them without worrying too much.  And there's about 4 servings per box.  Sodium is slightly high at 220mg a serving, but sugars are only 1 gram.  And there's 3 grams of protein.  For vitamins, there aren't a whole lot worth mentioning; it's not the main point of these crackers.<br /><br />Ok crackers, I like some of the other flavors, but I won't be buying this flavor again.<br /><br />Review by M.

In fact, I used to think the Snyder's butter flavor was great, but now in comparison, it just seems bland. The flavor of all of these various Nut-Thins crackers is sublime.<br /><br />In addition, you simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap. They are wonderful with dips, but they are so delicious, I actually prefer to eat them plain.<br /><br />At only 8 calories per cracker, Nut-Thins compare favorably to the Snyder mini pretzels I mentioned, which are 5 calories each.

review/text: As an individual who cannot eat gluten and doesn't really like nuts, I struggle with trying to find items that I like. Out of all the nut-thin Blue-Diamond crackers, these are my favorite. They taste great with tuna salad, but are great without too! I have to buy them at Whole Foods which is about a 35 minute+ drive depending on traffic, so needless to say, I was pleased to see that they sell them here online. And even without the subscription, they were still cheaper than buying them in the store, not by much, but still cheaper! Especially when you consider time, gas, and SALES TAX - all of which are momumentally saved on Amazon! I ended up signing up for the subscription, its a saving of $.78 cents per box, once again this excludes the sales tax of 10% I get charged plus the hefty price of gas! So, its well worth it to me. I also signed up for the subscription for Cheddar Cheese Blue Diamond Crackers, they are really tasty too!

review/summary: Great crackers/chips - but buy from store or company!
review/text: These crackers are amazing. A hint of almond and ranch with the crunch of a tortilla chip. I love them and they are great when you are craving something salty. I buy them from the grocery store or the cheapest that I have found is from the Blue Diamond store online. With shipping a dozen boxes was around $34, which is really 48 servings. Not bad for a fairly healthy, nutritional, gluten free snack!

review/text: As others have said, "if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire", then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it "smokey tea" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

review/text: This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Daughter's first choice
review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.
