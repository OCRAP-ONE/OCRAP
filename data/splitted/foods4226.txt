review/summary: Fishy Wishy stinky too
review/text: I like sardines, really I do, just havent tried this brand before, thought I'd give it a try. won't be making that mistake ever again.  The sardines were VERY small, lots of bones within them too, I guess some people would rather just eat the bones along with these fishies, but I don't like that.  And the supposed "smokey" flavoring was very overwhelming, and I don't care for that much either.  I just canceled my subcribtion to these nasty little things.  In one word,  "ew".  I wouldnt serve them to my kitty if he were still with me.  Better yet, I think I'll just dump the ones that're left, heck, if I were to package them and add them to a basket of food for the needy, I'd probably get it returned, these are just that nasty.  DON'T BUY, looks little discolored goldfish in these tin cans.  again, EWWW!  (oh and VERY stinky.....)

review/summary: Good, economy-sized wakame package
review/text: As you may have read, seaweed is a good source of nutrients, and has benefits for your skin and hair. Wakame is a kind of kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and is most commonly found in miso soup and Japanese salads.<br /><br />If you use wakame a lot, this bag will fit your bill. I've been using this brand for years because it's big and one bag usually lasts me a year or more. Text and texture is comparable to wakame brands I've had in Japan.<br /><br />There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50+ bowls of miso soup. Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes, then enjoy.<br /><br />Wakame is also good as a salad. Rehydrate in water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and cut into desired lengths. Add some julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad. Top with a Japanese-style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice. You can also add some imitation crab leg pieces and mayo, or use the wakame as a bedding for other foods.<br /><br />Wakame should be eaten shortly after rehydrating, otherwise it'll lose its elastic texture and get soggy.<br /><br />Product of Korea.

review/summary: Dog Approved!
review/text: I received a Kyjen Tennis Slider to review, and at first I was skeptical. It seemed flimsy and gimmicky. My two dogs changed my mind, and a friend's dog has also tried it and given her approval too! All three dogs thoroughly enjoyed learning to move the individual flaps of the puzzle toy to release one and then both tennis balls, and then moving the center piece to slide up or down, revealing treats! All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy. I thought it was flimsy, but so far even with the abuse dished out by close to 200 lbs of dog so far, it only has a few minor scratches, so I would say it is holding up nicely!<br /><br />The bad: the dogs solve it too quickly, and there is no way to make it harder. Additionally, I am not sure how it will hold up in the long term, but I will let you know!<br /><br />Feel free to read the entire review at: [...]

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: This was a great treat. I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs.

review/text: This game was great...for about 3 days.  My 7-month old lab mix spent a lot of energy (yay!) figuring out how to get the treats.  Unfortunately after about 3 tries, he had it totally mastered.  Even tightening it up to the max was still too easy.  It also completely broke after about the 5th use.  Might be great if your dog is smaller or less energetic.

review/summary: Cut my dog's mouth :-(
review/text: As a previous reviewer stated, the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5" deep, 2 1/8" wide and 2 1/4" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow.

review/summary: Good for long toungues or really small faces
review/text: Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.

review/summary: Great for slowing down feeding time!
review/text: This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle, but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.  I fill all four compartments up with kibble.  I holds about 2 cups of food, and it extends eating time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes.  Which means less gas for my dog and sweeter air for me.

This would be a great tool though for using at feeding time if you have a dog that you need to slow down.  It is easily washable.  The cups will break if chewed on, but they're not intended to be chew toys.

review/summary: Two paws down
review/text: My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to "spin" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't "Paw-centric" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product. (yes I'm a worry wart pet parent, but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into...)

review/text: I have two dogs that received this gift from Santa and figured it out pretty quick since Santa pre-filled it. They play with it until it is empty... as most dogs would, I suspect, since they can smell the food inside. They seem to really enjoy it. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needs really small bits of food/treats and is not so easy to fill. I end up with quite a bit of food on the floor while trying to fill it. I might try to find some really small cookies to put inside to cut down on the frustration of filling it. My dogs like it though and that is all that matters to me!

review/text: My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup. In the beginning, she was pawing at it. Finally she figured out a way to remove the cup with her mouth. Within ten minutes she was able to find all the hidden treats. After this exercise, she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation, she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration, she would have given up. Now, this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups. I didn't know if this would be too big for her mouth, but she has no problems. This is a great toy and a fun way to keep your dog stimulated and active.

review/text: I'm happy to say that all three of my dogs had no issue with the yellow covers cracking. They are hard plastic, but they are fairly thick and don't give even to a hard squeeze. My dogs all realized that the object was to get the covers out of the way, not to chew on them, so that may be the issue. My 4-month-old German Shepherd figured this out very quickly and even put the little covers back on after all the treats were gone, as if she expected them to refill magically, lol! It took my 3-year-old golden retriever a bit more time to figure out and she used her paws quite a bit whereas the puppy was all teeth. It was very interesting to see them try different ways of figuring out the puzzle. However, my 3-year-old malamute is kind of a baby and he tried very briefly before he looked at me and started to whine. Clearly it's not as much fun for a furbaby who is used to having everything handed to him! My girls still get very excited every time we pull this out though. We always use a high value treat in the puzzle, something special that they don't get every day. They will play the game over and over and over as many times as I refill it. I definitely think this is something most dogs can do on their own if you need to keep them busy for 10-15 minutes but my girls seems to enjoy it even more when I'm there cheering them on every time they have a success. The materials are very durable, in my opinion, and clean up couldn't be easier. The holes are very easy to wipe clean and a quick rinse under the faucet for the rest is generally all I need to do for the rest. Wonderful toy at a great price if you have highly intelligent dogs who get bored easily!

review/text: We have a 16 week Cocker Spaniel-Australian Shepherd mix (~20 lbs). We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, "Okay, now what?  What's next??"<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds.

review/summary: Not for smart dogs or large treats/kibble
review/text: It's a good feeding mechanism for my dog who scarfs food, but as far as a toy that challenges her, it's a cakewalk.  It's a great start for Kyjen to start marketing to people that love Nina Ottoson but don't want/can't spend $40 on one toy.  I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.

review/text: This product was way to easy for our 4 month old pup Raisin. The compartments opened up very easily with each nudge. It does serve well as a puppy food/snack bowl if your pup eats too fast - making him move from compartment to compartment to eat will slow him down. Not great for trying to improve or test your puppy's IQ, but a fun way to feed him.

review/summary: My Dog gave it 2 paws up :)
review/text: My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it.

review/summary: Affordable Dog Puzzle!!!
review/text: I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My "boys" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL  but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be "released" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys. Plus, the price has been great and I found it at my local canine speciality store too!

review/summary: too easy, even for "not-so-smart" dogs
review/text: i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.

review/summary: Affordable Fun for your Dog!
review/text: I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the "name brand" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their "drive" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!

Bacon is a schnorkitzu (schnauzer yorkie shihtzu). i imagine larger dogs would chew the yellow parts up pretty quickly.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to getting another puzzle toy in the future.  i recommend this toy.

She finished her meal in 20 minutes and then grabbed a chew toy and jumped on the couch. I know Lily likes this toy and so do I. The price makes it extremely likable also.

review/summary: Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.
review/text: I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning "nosework" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective "nosing the flap" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2"x2" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could "find" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she "finds" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-

review/summary: Good idea however....
review/text: This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it.

She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.

review/summary: Amazing Toy!!!
review/text: My dog loves this game.  As soon as he sees it, he runs over and waits for his command.  Even though there are 7 areas to hide treats, I usually only do 4 or 5.  When I give him the commad "Find the treats" he sniffs by each cover until he finds the one with the treat.  Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.  The ones that are empty, he does not bother to remove the cover.  Really AMAZING Toy!!!!<br /><br />I would recommend keeping the toy hidden until it is time to play, especially if your dog is a chewer.  The covers are small and can be chewed up quickly.

However, once it was figured out, they had fun eating the treats. I will warn multi-dog houses. You might try this on a individual basis. 2 of my dogs who normally don't fight over food at all got a bit possessive of the toy. Also, do not leave unattended so it doesn't get chewed up. Otherwise, I say go for it. It is a good thinking dog toy.

review/summary: Too easy a game
review/text: As some other reviewers have mentioned this toy was not much of a challenge for my food motivated Golden Retriever.  It took him less then 3 minutes to pick up each of the little yellow cup covers and eat his treat.  I will continue to use this toy, as I already own it.  I might even ue it sometimes just to put his dinner in so it will take him a little longer to go from well to well instead of gobbling down his bowl of food.  I do like the fact that the toy is all plastic so it can easily be washed.

review/summary: Affordable, and not too challenging.
review/text: Not a bad starter puzzle, especially for the price.<br /><br />My Lab/Border Collie had it totally figured out within about 20 minutes, so it wasn't super challenging for her. She had more issues with the cups located in the "palm" section of the paw. It was hard for her to get her mouth on them, and almost impossible to "slide up."<br /><br />The primary complaint I have with this toy are the yellow cups. They are flimsy and could be easily cracked into pieces with very minimal effort for a decent sized dog, or an aggressive chewer.<br /><br />DEFINITELY do not leave your dog alone with the toy. (This should go without saying..but...)<br /><br />Would I recommend the toy? Maybe. I think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that aren't too smart for their own good. (If your dog can unscrew things, open doors, drawers, etc..then you may want to go for a more challenging toy. I wish I had of.)

review/summary: Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.)
review/text: I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

review/summary: Think of this not as a puzzle or toy but more of an interactive feeder
review/text: I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far, has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!

review/summary: Great Toy to get dogs thinking!
review/text: I have two rat terriers, and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.  Their main drive in life is to eat, and then play, so this was perfect.  I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.  It took them about 10-15 minutes of playing, barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.  Great toy Kyjen!<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

He is sweet and friendly.<br /><br /> When he saw this product he first ignored it but I turned my back and then he stuck his little paw in the large shape to get the ball. Such a cute lil guy. Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course, the neon ball was very interesting to him. He rolled it around the house happily. The red part is great too because I can actually clean it unlike his other furry toys. I'm so happy a company actually took the time and effort to create such a great product with your dog in mind.<br /><br />Thanks CAGEY :)

review/summary: Cattledog approved!
review/text: Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to "Go find".<br /><br />This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber "bars" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for "wait", "go find", "give" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way.

review/text: Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.

You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog.

review/text: After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys.  One of which was this treat wheel.  I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix who I think is pretty smart but I was still worried that she wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle.  She figured out how to lift off the yellow cups fairly quickly but it took her a few tries to figure out how to spin the wheel.  She's got it down to an art now and loves playing with this puzzle.  I am also amazed at the fact that she has not destroyed/chewed any part of this puzzle as she has destroyed almost all of her other toys.  I would definitely recommend this product to others who want to challenge their dog.

review/text: My morkie loves interactive games. Make sure you take notice of the dimensions, it is larger than I expected. As one of the other reviews stated, my small breed cannot get his mouth around the yellow pieces, but is able to get them off with abundant effort via scratching and using his nose. As smart as my lil guy is, he gets the yellow piece off and thinks his reward is being able to play with it. But it was his first attempt and we're working with him, showing him the treats are underneath. He was continuously excited and determined to figure out the game. I expect over time he'll get better with it and the learning process in itself is fun.

If you nudge it gently it opens & aligns and as long as you don't bump it, it stays in place to eat each dish. I even tried to use it to feed her dinner to slow her down, but that didn't work at all--she aligned it once and ate out of it like a bowl. Bummer, I spent over $20 for a piece of plastic that will end up in a landfill. Stick with frozen kongs...

review/summary: Paw Flapper Fun, But Too Easy
review/text: I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles.

Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.

review/summary: Fun even for little dogs
review/text: when I opened this, I thought no way my little Lhasa Apso is going to be able to play with this.  So wrong.  I stated with some yellow cups upside down (easier for her to grip them) with a few right side up.  She figured it all out very quickly.  It's lots of fun to watch her get the big yellow cups in her small grip, place them carefully all in one spot.  After a few times, she was able to grab all the cups placed in the red container the proper way.  She loves finding treats!

review/text: This is a good product, my dog opened the doors twice and found the treat.  After the second time she just picked the toy up and turned it upside down till the treats fell out.  For a small dog it might work better

review/summary: Deceiving plastic caps
review/text: Hello, I don't plan on using this particular item. In viewing this item at the time of purchase it didn't appear that any of the yellow plastic caps came loose.The picture made it appear all the caps stayed in the cups and twirled around. Then the instructions warn not to leave your dog alone with this toy. My whole purpose was to leave my dog alone and I wouldn't have to worry about any of the plastic caps coming loose. Actually, I'm sorry I bought it. However, I bought two of the squirrels in the tree trunk toys, one for me and one for a friend, and we're very happy with them.

review/summary: Poorly constructed and designed
review/text: This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the "pegs" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is "buried") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting.

review/summary: Moon Rover Rescue
review/text: This is a review for the Moon Rover Rescue toy.  While touted as one of their more durable toys, I found the plush toys to be more durable than this!<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement puzzle toy for one of my dogs, who adores plush toys and puzzle toys.  The second dog I have is more destructive and you really have to watch him with toys.  I was hopeful that the plastic would hold up better and the plush-lover would get more enjoyment out of his toy before it would get destroyed.<br /><br />The moon rover was much too difficult to get into (or out of) the moon; neither dog was able to retrieve it.  Within 30 minutes chunks of the moon were missing and the front part of the rover was chewed off as well.  Even though we're thorough, we were picking up chunks of blue plastic around the play area for a few days.  This purchase was a complete waste of $20.

review/text: The toy seems pretty durable which is a big winner for me because usually the toys that I buy for my dogs don't last quite long.  The toy itself has a tennis ball inside which I really like you don't have to buy two separate toys. I also love the fact that it has a ball inside and they can try to entertain themselves. So awesome.

review/summary: The Paw Hide is a great little toy.
review/text: Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!<br /><br />Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!

Now everytime I get it out he knows exactly what to do :D I would recommend to anyone who wants to challenge their dog a little bit. It is definatly something you would not want to let your dog use unattended b/c of it being all plastic.

review/summary: Good Toy
review/text: I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.

review/summary: Good fun for dogs
review/text: This adjustable puzzle toy is a good way to provide a challenging way for your dog to have treats.  It is fun for them if you just put one or two treats inside or many.  The rubber "feet" on the bottom do grip the floor somewhat which makes it more stable when the device is tightened up for extra challenge for your dog.  This is one of what could be many puzzle toys to entertain your dog.  My dog gets excited when I bring out a puzzle toy because he knows that with a little work, he gets a treat.

review/text: No seriously, she is.  My dog's "grandfather" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift. I videotaped it - 1st time, 23 seconds, including eating 4 treats.  She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles!

review/summary: Nice, basic addition to the collection...
review/text: I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the "spin" and "flip" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a "cheater", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a "project in the works", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!

review/summary: Not Much of a Puzzle
review/text: After the first go-round, my little mutt knew exactly how to get at the hidden treats.  Treats are always welcome, but I think she gets more fun being put in a "sit" and watching me move around pretending to hide a bon-bon in various places. She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop - but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable-but-dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.
