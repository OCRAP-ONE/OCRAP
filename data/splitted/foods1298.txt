review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
review/text: I purchased this product both for my dog and my daughters dog and it gave them both extreme diarrhea, explosive poor pups couldn't even make it out of the house. VERY embarrassed dogs!!! Both dogs suffered from this product.  We administered the exact amount for the weight of each dog.  They both LOVE their Greenies so I was shocked with this reaction.

review/text: This tea is really great and I'm super happy I decided to try it. Its got a really mellow flavor that to me isn't all that sweet, the only drawback is that it's not as soothing as regular chamomile. But overall I have really enjoyed all the Pukka teas, and I highly reccomend!

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: I like the soothing effect chamomille has on me but this tea just doesn't do it. I read a good review elsewhere and was excited about my purchase but this one just tastes too sweet. It's super vanilla. It'd make a nice dessert tea if you're looking for something like that but if you want more of a chamomille taste I wouldn't recommend it.

review/summary: Deliciously cool!
review/text: This is my second purchase of this tea this year, and I love it. It has such a crisp, clean, cool taste and fantastic aroma. I can drink a pitcher of it cold in a day. It is also delicious hot. A hot cup totally relaxes me right before bedtime.<br /><br />I was so disappointed to see Amazon eliminating most of the Numi loose teas in favor of bags. Most of the Numi loose teas they have kept are now being sold in 2 lb lots instead of 1 lb at a time. That's OK with me because I drink so much, as long as they do not discontinue my favorite 3: this one, the Ginger Sprite with black oolong, and the Ruby Chai herbal tessan. Fantastic stuff!

review/summary: The highest quality I have always loved from Numi!
review/text: I was worried about ordering this Numi tea just because of the most recent negative reviews but I've always loved Numi tea and couldn't imagine that the loose leaf Moroccan Mint tea could be as bad as the disgruntled reviewers say.<br /><br />I have enjoyed many, many Numi teas and believe me, the Morrocan Mint is in keeping with the highest quality I have always loved from Numi. And, like all of Numi's teas, it is certified organic and that is very, very important to me.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I was intoxicated with the splendid mint aroma!  The leaves are indeed full leaf and not the "dust" one usually finds in the ordinary tea bag.  The color is rich and verdant.  The flavor when brewed is heavenly...the mint is fresh, sweet and lively.  The herbal effect is lovely...it soothes the tummy, aids digestion, calms the nerves, and lulls the senses.  I really love it and can always find the time in each day to enjoy a pot of my favorite mint tea!<br /><br />I recently acquired a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LNOPSG">The Breville One-Touch Tea Maker</a> which is the perfect method for brewing loose tea.  I get the most excellent results this way in brewing Numi's loose leaf Moroccan Mint. Of course an electric tea kettle isn't necessary for brewing this fine tea but it certainly makes it easier and the Numi~Breville combination ensures perfection.<br /><br />In fact, I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product!<br /><br />The loose leaf Morrocan Mint is an extraordinary value when purchased in bulk like this from Amazon.  I'm using one 16 oz bag and keep the other in the freezer until I need it.  The way I enjoy this lovely tea and my Breville tea kettle, I'm sure to be going through my 2 pounds of Numi Moroccan Mint loose leaf tea in no time.<br /><br />If you are a tea lover and appreciate high quality, organic loose leaf mint tea, do not hesitate to choose this one!

review/text: Not sure what the other reviews are talking about... we all like this stuff at my place. It's also fun to tell people you got a KILO of it (almost).<br /><br />I'm not experienced with Moroccan Mint since this is my first purchase of the stuff, but it's pretty good. I've had other mint teas, and I like this as well.<br /><br />Giving 4 stars because the zip-seal on one of the bags came off... not a big deal since I can just clamp it closed, but still kinda annoying.

review/summary: Do not buy!!!!!  It's the worst ever !!!!!!
review/text: Let me start by saying, I have been on over a year long quest to find the perfect loose mint tea.  This is the worst out of several teas I've tried. Very bad tasting.  The mint is ground down to a very fine powder, which makes sure all the oils (flavor) evaporates leaving no flavor.  If you use a mesh strainer you will notice the tea will escape the strainer instantly.  The zipper that is in the bag comes pre-broken for your ultimate displeasure.  Can't even think of one good thing to say about this tea.  It just tastes bad.  Didn't notice the stomach soothing effect noticed with all other mint teas I've tried.  This was a purchase I regret x2.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this horrible product.  When describing this tea I use a lot of swear words.

review/text: I got this loose leaf tea for both friends/family and myself. I usually love mint tea, for after dinner, etc. This stuff is nasty! It smells okay right out of the bag; but once brewed, yuck...like I'm drinking "grass"...and not the kind you mow. Buy this if you drinking ass. Sorry to be so frank; but man, I bought a ton of this stuff...if you really want to buy it, buy it from me...for free! Heck, I'd almost ship it for free, just to get rid of it. I think I'll start serving it up at parties when I want my guests to leave. That's actually not a bad idea...

review/text: I've had my fill of sour patch kids, so as a lover of all things Haribo, I decided to give these a try (in bulk, too). I wasn't disappointed. I *think* the flavors of the s'ghetti are green apple, raspberry (blue) and watermelon (pink). First two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup, but no high fructose corn syrup. There's also wheat flour, which I found odd, but I thought I'd put it in the review in case someone allergic to gluten might come across my write-up. Warning: if you get mouth sores from sour candy, these will definitely do that, so try to restrain yourself and not eat the whole bag in one sitting!

These are not the same. I thought these would be easier/better for my younger grandchildren to eat than the larger gummi worms, but they don't like them either. Oh well, win some, lose some!

review/text: I think these are my new favorite gummy candy (and I'm addicted to gummies). Well at least my favorite sour gummy candy. Normally like their centipedes but last batch shipped out and was completely different from normal. If that's a "new recipe" or something I may have to switch to these fantastically addicting, mouth-watering treats. ONLY downside is that you only get about 3.75lbs for the same price you can get other bulk Haribo gummies in 5lb bags for. Likely due to the fact they come individually packaged...but if they put out a full on "bulk" 5lb bag for the same price it would be one of the sweetest deals on gummies around.

It worked great, and I've found it a regular "go to" in my spice collection any time I make something with chicken or with a slight southwestern hint. It's great for chilis, chicken that's cooked before being added to other recipes like chicken taco soup, or chili, and others. I also agree with the other reviewer that it has a nice list of simple ingredients without a bunch of "modifiers" and other non-natural stuff.<br /><br />It does not contain cumin, which was a big win for me, because I don't like cumin, but there are other Goya mixes that do contain cumin if you prefer it.

review/text: This honey is very nice tasting.  A little pricey, but it does have very good flavor, not sure if it is really raw though, sdoesn't seem to be.  Overall, a nice flavor. My dad was a bee keeper and pproduced his own honey for many years, this is good like that just not as dark.  Very sweet!

review/text: Exactly how I always pictured Bertie Bott's beans would be. I have the generation before these and they've been spot on since movie 1 (GOD, the HORSERADISH flavor was AWFUL. UGH.). The generation before these has a single flavor that literally made me retch. The fish flavored jelly beans are SO AWFUL that you will gag.<br /><br />You will.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, only have a few really awful ones. Avoid vomit if you can, because that's probably what you'll be doing next.<br /><br />whoever makes these is awesome.

review/summary: The flavours are not lies!
review/text: These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

My girl was so fascinated at the idea of being able to eat candy like Harry Potter ate that she tried the vomit, earwax and soap flavors and giggled her way through every disgusting moment of the assault on her poor little taste buds. She LOVED them. But I guess you need to be a true Potterhead to really appreciate the things. Ugh!!

review/text: I was really excited to find Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans because my kids would love them.  It was a 2-pack, and for $9 I figured that the boxes would be pretty big.  Boy was I wrong.  The boxes are the size of small raisin boxes, and they aren't even filled very full.  I was very disappointed and feel ripped off.  Breaking the cost down, each jelly bean costs about 25 cents, and these are small candies - the size of jelly bellys.  Don't waste your money unless you have a lot to waste...

During a Harry Potter themed birthday, we had an "every flavoured bean tasting" The dirt and grass were pretty realistic, but the vomit was a bit coconutty in taste. (Hmmm. Makes me wonder.) Anyway, they were not all meant to be delecious, yet some were (think, Tutti-Fruity) I would def give them a go again should we have the urge.

review/text: I bought this for my wife who's an HP fan; all the while thinking "what-the-crap".<br />But I found it to be quite fun to pick one at random and trying to guess what the crap you just put in your mouth.<br />There are "normal" jelly beans and special "weird" flavor jelly beans; these smaller boxes contain mostly weird ones - a larger box that I purchased (outside of amazon) had a more balanced variety between the two kinds.

review/summary: Authentic - enjoyed by wizards AND muggles
review/text: Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!

review/text: For the price, there should of been a bigger boxes or more boxes. It isn't anything like I thought it would be or like the product at Universal Studios. I was under the impression that is where it came from originally. My daughter wanted to taste it and that is exactly what she will get a taste. Guess I should have waited until Universal's website added more to their store.

review/summary: Great gag gift
review/text: This is a great gag gift. I got a big kick out of this with my friends and my co-workers. Most people I offered them to seemed put off by the possibility of getting a bad flavor jelly bean, but eventually curiosity got the better of them and they couldn't resist trying one.<br /><br />I had the displeasure of getting "earthworm" and "earwax" myself. Yes, they tasted absolutely horrible. But that's the point! It's fun to try the jelly beans out to see if they really are as disgusting as you might imagine.<br /><br />There are some good flavors in there too, but most of them are gross and fun. :p<br /><br />It's a great conversation starter. It's fun to see who is risk-averse and who will try anything.

review/text: I recieved these in my stocking from "santa". I was very excited because I've been dying to have some of these. I got two packs of them and was a bit surprised at how small they were.  There are very few flavors and none of then even marshmellow taste good! I do have to give credit since they taste as they say, like earwax. After I eat them I tend to get a little sick to my stomache. I don't think this is the best gift to get someone. Get a wand instead!!!

review/summary: Fun, but way too pricey for the size!
review/text: I ordered these to have at my son's Harry Potter birthday party.  The kids had fun eating them and trying to guess what "nasty" flavor each one was.  However, the two boxes are extremely small and I would not pay the almost $9 +shipping for them again.  If I had known how small the boxes were (I honestly did not check size before purchasing-lesson learned!) I would not have bought them.  I had to be very skimpy with the kids on how many they could try so that each child got to eat a couple-and we only had 10 kids there!  Fun, but pricey!

review/text: I live in Jacksonville and its hard to not notice the Iguana brand down here, and thats<br />a blessing. We can even get it at Publix and Winn Dixie and that is a major plus for<br />pepperheads down here. Hard to beat the flavor of this stuff, its fresh and clean.<br /><br />Still not going to blow your head off, but it will make you nod your head with an<br />enthusiastic "YES!" when you try it. And but you'll have a hard time finding any other<br />real habanero sauce that tastes better on fish, pork, or chicken. And I have to believe<br />this stuff is either contracted to Melinda's or by their producer since they both come<br />from Costa Rica, both have the same ingredients, and look almost identical. Duh!<br /><br />A great complement to veggies and other light dishes, and when you go to Firehouse for<br />a sub you can try this on your smoked turkey and you will be pleasantly amazed at the effect.<br />Great stuff, a staple for any decent collection and worth seeking out. 5 Scovies

review/summary: Good stuff, saved the day!
review/text: My son was a micropreemie who was diagnosed Failure to Thrive for getting insufficient calories, due to a feeding delay, uncontrolled reflux, and extended illness.  He began drinking Pediasure as his complete nutrition at 11 months adjusted.  While he did still eat table foods, he was incapable of eating enough food to make a caloric difference during the day.<br /><br />Well, after two months on Pediasure (with Fiber, to make his stools looser), he was finally ON the weight growth chart, after NEVER having been on the chart before!  And after another 2 months, he is making steady strides towards a good growth curve.<br /><br />Although the containers say it tastes better very cold, my son prefers Pediasure at room temperature.  He does not like cold drinks at all.  My only complaint is that these containers tend to dent easily, because they are coming through the mail.  It's always worrisome when you find a dented container of food; however, in no cases have I found that the contents are disturbed/befouled by the denting.  Good stuff!

review/summary: AWESOME for special needs and regular kids!
review/text: My daughter is special needs and is entirely tube fed. She has been on the Pediasure with and without fiber since birth. She is a strong, health and active 2 1/2 year old now who has thrived on this stuff! The only thing being completely tube fed is that her muscle mass is not up to par with a child who eats regular food, but it is a great supplement for a child who needs more nutrition in their diet but has trouble eating. We go with the fiber brand because she had difficulty with BM's and now she has no issues (we use an ounce of pear juice a day too). This stuff stores for a long time too for emergencies!!

review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market added a new brand of soft drinks to their cooler and I tried a couple. The latest I had today was Cascal Bright Citrus Natural Soda in a 12-ounce can. Quite good! I can't really pick the dominant flavor, but it lists lemongrass, tangerine and pineapple with added effervescence. The drink is 35% juice. It has a fresh, somewhat sour taste and is not sweet at all, which I like, and it's listed at only 80 calories per can. The sodium is low also. Very nice drink. I'll be getting more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Tastes Like iHop Coffee
review/text: For twenty years, Eight O'Clock Colombian was the only coffee we drank.  I bought it at A&P and ground the whole beans there.  Nothing tasted as good.<br /><br />But either my tastes have changed or the coffee is just not as good because this coffee had no depth.  I made it with less water than the smallest Keurig option to give it a fair chance.  I smelled it before I drank it and got no strong whiff of fresh brewed coffee.  I drank it black with no rush of memory of the original brew from forty years ago. I added a squirt of cream and it only got blander.  I drank it with a Spanish omelet (thus the iHop connection) and it served only to wash the food down.<br /><br />Now that I've finished this cup, I'll give the rest of the box to my brother and brew a fantastic cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Coffeehouse, Italian Roast, 24- Count K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers</a>.

review/summary: The preferred salt for kitchen and table.
review/text: Except for baking, Morton Coarse Kosher Salt is what I use in the kitchen and at the table. I prefer pure, plain salt to the somewhat muddled flavor of sea salt.  Table salt is much finer so it is harder to pinch and distribute evenly on a finished dish.<br /><br />This coarse, flaked salt is also necessary for topping pretzels and margaritas and making pickles. It is also especially nice topping whole grain loaves and on meat, poultry or baked potatoes. If you have a French recipe calling for "gros sel" something of this nature is what is intended. A nice gift that is easy to make using this salt is pickled lemons, which are very useful in Mediterranean dishes.<br /><br />Note that this salt is less dense than regular table salt. The label indicates to add 1 tablespoon per quarter cup if the recipe calls for table salt.
