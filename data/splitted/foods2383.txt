I sent these cookies as a gift and my friend could not believe all the cookies I sent were gluten free! I recommend Cookies from Home for any occasion, or if you just want to send something to yourself. For me, as someone with celiac disease, I know I will be ordering a lot more from Cookies from Home in the future.<br />Highly recommend this company and their baked goods :)

review/summary: Nothing to really object about.
review/text: I bought these before picking up my 2 yr old from daycare.  He is used to having a snack in the car on the way home before naptime.  I usually bring crackers or a banana.  The boy really enjoyed these crackers.<br /><br />My own experience with these crackers is different, sadly.  The first bite was lovely.  But later bites were sadly lacking.  These crackers are like a lesser Cheez It.  There is a little bit (not enough) of cheese flavor, but the unique pretzel energy is lost.  It's best not to combine the modest pretzel with flashier snacks because it can't stand up.  It just winds up giving you a watered-down version of The Other Thing, in this case a Cheez It.<br /><br />I would say, stick with Cheez Its, OR, pretzels, but combining them  minimizes them both.

review/summary: Well-balanced in flavor and texture
review/text: I received the FlipSide Cheddar Pretzel Crackers in a care package and was initially a bit skeptical about the concept being afraid that either taste might be over-powering.  Although the idea is a bit strange, Town House managed to make an interesting cracker with a unique flavor and texture.  The cheddar and pretzel flavor is well-balanced and the texture falls somewhere between a pretzel and a cracker.  The cheddar flavor is somewhat subdued and is more of a sharp cheddar flavor.<br /><br />The cracker stands well on its own and would make an excellent snack in and of itself.  The Cheddar/Pretzel mix would also make the cracker excellent with dips like smoked fish.

In addition to the sweetness from the honey, there is a detectable molasses flavor which I really like.  I believe I would have a hard time making a better sauce from scratch.

review/summary: Makes for some mighty fine eatin'!
review/text: I don't know about you but it seems that is is becoming more and more expensive for my wife and I to eat out these days.  Here in Rhode Island you are looking at around $13.00 or $14.00 for a half a rack of ribs at national chains like Texas Roadhouse or at a local institution like Wes' Rib House.  Since my wife and I are not made of money we only go to places like these on special occasions or during a night out with friends.  Most of the time we choose to cook at home on our Weber grill.  If the menu calls for chicken or pork we always brush the meat with our favorite store bought sauce "Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce".  Frankly, we find that the meat turns out every bit as tender and flavorful at it does at a restaurant for about 1/4 to 1/3 the price.<br /><br />Since I am not particularly fond of hickory smoke flavor we never barbequed at home very much.  Years ago hickory smoke barbecue sauce was just about the only variety available at your local supermarket.  As I recall that all began to change with the introduction of the KC Masterpiece line of sauces in the mid 1980's.  Suddenly, exciting new flavors were bursting onto the scene.  I first became familiar with honey-flavored Bar-B-Que at a popular rib house in Montreal called Bar-B-Barn.  I just fell in love with the taste so when  "Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce" was introduced  I had to give it a try.  And I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.  I find that while I enjoy this stuff on chicken it is even better on pork.  See if you agree!  Very highly recommended!

review/summary: Gelatinous and an Odd Sweet Flavor
review/text: I understand that opinions vary greatly in these things, but I cannot for the life of me see how so many people like the Sweet Baby Ray's sauces.  I tried the original recipe and this.  The original was very ho hum but I thought this one was kind of gross.  The taste is slightly fake, as if its not made with sugar or honey but with some sort of chemical.  The texture is a bit gelatinous which contributes to the feeling of this being a synthetic product.  It reminds me of American cheese.  Its not awful, and on the right application actually tastes good, but it isn't really cheese and eating it makes me feel kind of yucky.<br /><br />I have since moved on and tried a few other sauces commonly found in grocery stores.  The one I landed on is "Cattlemen's Award Winning Kansas City Classic Barbecue Sauce".  So good you could just drink it.  Try that one out.

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

review/summary: Very Good Meat Snack - Highly Recommended
review/text: Jack Link's "X-Stick Original" snack sticks are very good tasting and far less greasy than other "meat sticks" (like Slim Jim). These are great snacks for diabetics (like me) since they have a negligible amount of Net Carbs.<br /><br />The Amazon "Product Features" incorrectly lists these as 160 Calories each, and neither the box or individual packaging list the Nutrition Facts, so I visited the Jack Links web site and found the following:<br /><br />Serving Size: .5 Oz (1 stick)<br />Calories: 60 (45 from Fat)<br />Total Fat: 5g (2g Saturated Fat)<br />Cholesterol: 15mg<br />Sodium: 220mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 0g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />These do contain MSG, which can cause "gastric distress" in some people (like my dad).<br /><br />Overall, these are great as a snacks between meals and they are so much better than the competition.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: These are along the line of Slim Jims but have a milder, less spicy, taste. The X-Sticks also have a much better texture than Slim Jims, these things actually look like they are made of real meat, NOT the 'mystery meat - goat hair/cardboard' texture of the modern Slim Jim.<br /><br />The X-Stick is 'not exactly' a health food snack. They have a fair amount of fat, a little over 5 grams (each stick, in this package, is 14 grams total mass). Sodium content is about 224 mg and, about 3.2 grams of protein and only 64 calories (about 47 calories from fat) per stick.<br /><br />What the X-Stick is, is a very satisfying snack. I sometimes have to miss a meal, due to my work. One or two of these take the hunger away and puts some energy back into me. I do try to limit my fat intake but do not feel guilty about snacking on these once in a while.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Ken

review/summary: Great Meat Snacks
review/text: This review is for the 0.5 ounce X-Sticks box of 50.<br /><br />First I will comment on the taste.  The X-Sticks have a mild and pleasing flavor to them.  They taste similar to Slim Jims, just without the chemical spiciness and odd plastic texture of Slim Jims.  In a taste test, the X-Sticks would win without a problem.<br /><br />Next is the price.  The price for the box of 50 0.5 ounce X-Sticks tend to fluctuate on Amazon but it's still worth it, provided the price stays below $20 a box.  When you combine this with the Subscribe and Save discount, you can save even more!  The price of the same type of Slim Jims is almost $10 higher, so once again, the X-Sticks win.<br /><br />So my final thoughts are if you're looking for a meat snack that isn't going to repeat on you an hour later, these are the way to go.  Although they can't claim to be "All natural", they have more natural ingredients than the Slim Jim.  These also are composed of beef and pork (yum), whereas a Slim Jim is composed of beef and mechanically separated chicken...  (Eww).  Anyway, I was very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend them for you.

review/summary: Good for a snack --
review/text: I can't really compare these to other similar products (Slim Jim,etc.), as I had never had jerky-type snacks before I got these.  I decided to take a long road trip (4500 miles round trip), and I have a tendency to get drowsy if I don't get enough protein.  I decided to carry these plus some string cheese in the car to tide me over between meal stops.<br /><br />I really like these.  The flavor is good, the texture is fine, and the "damage" from a diet standpoint is minimal (these are 60 cal apiece, based on the Jack Links site).  They're not too salty, either.  Having them on the trip from Bellingham, WA to St. Louis, MO and back was a huge help.  One or two of these provided just the right amount of tasty protein.  The size and packaging is handy, too, and easy to open when driving.<br /><br />I now keep them on hand for when I need a little pick-me-up.

review/summary: A Good Tasting Stick
review/text: This was my second purchase. Watching carbs, I look for snacks that are high protein with low or no sugars. Tiring of nuts all the time I tired these a couple months ago. Very surprised, they taste good with a bit of spice kick. Recalling that most convenience store sticks were dry or greasy or blah tasting, it was nice to snack on these. They are not the long sticks but a nice size at about 6 inches. Wrapped individually and easy to open. Great item to grab when looking for a quick munch.

review/summary: Just okay -- not nearly a Slim Jim
review/text: While certainly edible, I don't think Jack Links brings a realistic competitor here with their version of the Slim Jim.  Honestly, there are some bites I take which remind me of dog food.  I know we are talking about meat sticks here and not fine dining, but the texture of these is just not right, almost too granular.  I know Slim Jims have that greasy taste but these guys have a bit of it too and I have to admit I kind of enjoy it.  Overall, in my opinion, Slim Jims are much much better than these guys, but to each his/her own!

review/summary: A bit on the greasy side, but the kids love them
review/text: Some fairly improved ingredients vs a typical 'slim jim', at least its not made with jowls and pink slime.  The taste is good, salty, smoky, a bit on the greasy side.  If you've had the x-sticks, this is just small pieces of that in a bag, four times the weight of the stick.  In other words, excellent for sharing or a snack at school where eating a whole stick might be a problem.<br /><br />I also dump a package into a ziploc and can snack on it a piece at a time to boost my protein and fat intake a bit.<br /><br />A pack of 12 lasted my 7 year old and his friends about a week, which is way faster than most other meat snacks I've put on the snack counter.<br /><br />But even the 7-10 year olds say its a bit greasy, as they devour another package.

review/summary: Good, But Tastes Very Artificial
review/text: Having never had the X-Links before, I bought them based off some customer reviews I read here. Maybe I should have read more, but these are most comparable to a Slim Jim. While they are much better, they still fall into the same category, and I was looking for something a little more "real" tasting. These have a much better taste than Slim Jim does, although there is still a substantial "artificial" taste. Highly recommended as a Slim Jim upgrade, but don't buy these if you're looking for a more natural tasting product.

review/summary: Great On-The-Go Snack
review/text: I just bought my second box of Jack's Links because I'm sold on these!  I purchased a box of small Slim Jim's for my son's lunch box and for throwing snacks in my bag for the long afternoons of driving kids around to activiities and someone ALWAYS asking if I have something to eat!!  The Slim Jims were just ok, but after time got really hard, even in their individually packaged cases.  So I bought the Jack Link's X Stick and immediately my 10 year old son said they were WAY better than Slim Jims.  The 0.5 oz size is a little bigger than the small Slim Jims, yet not too big so that I'm filling my kid with even more fat and junk.  This is just the right size for a "snack" and the price is great.  At Amazon today I bought a box of 50 on sale for $17, which is about .35 cents a stick.  Don't hesitate to buy these if you are like me and need a variety of on-the-go, non-refrigerated snacks or lunch box fillers!!  Great product!

I wouldn't even put them in the same universe as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFS57I">Jack Link's Beef Stick, Original, 0.92-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 72)</a> or any of the beef sticks that Jack Links makes based on the 'Original' formula/base. I dig all of their flavored stuff, spicy stuff, etc, as long as it's based on the original beef stick variety.<br /><br />The X Sticks taste... like potted beef, wrapped into a beef stick? I don't know, It's odd. I'm still going to eat all 50 of them or whatever; they're not awful. Just "okay"; and in my world of seriously loving beef jerky and beef sticks, being just "okay" is a crime...

review/text: Good stuff if you want a Slim Jim type of replacement that is of better quality.  Does not have that waxy taste that Slim Jim tends to offer.  If you want real beef jerky I'd pass on this.  In fact, I assumed they would be more like the regular bagged Jack Links (myfault) just in stick form.  This has that mixed spiciness that you cant really find in any of their regular flavors but did remind me of Slim Jim.  Tastes like a hot dog in a way which is good and they tend to do the job as far as giving me a boost.  I give it 3 stars but I am going right back to the regular bagged stuff which so wayyyyy better.

review/summary: Good jerky for a quick snack
review/text: I had tried one of the Jack Links snack pack, the kind that come with cheese, pretzel and meat, so after trying that, and loving it, I knew Id most likely enjoy this.  I took a bite from the first stick, and it wasn't too good, I guess it naturally tastes better with cheese IMO, but after eating the second and then third, they started to grow on me.  These things are perfect for that late snack and its convenient and does the trick for a hungry tummy.  They have a chewy consistency, but when you take a bite each time, you can hear a small snap from when you bite<br /><br /> I also like the design, you just remove a piece of cardboard from the bottom and it becomes a dispenser, which is a little nice idea. I ended up liking these so much, I am going to subscribe to receive these once a month.  Price is great and if you do that, you get a nice little discount (15% off).  I definitely recommend this.

review/summary: Individual Jack Links best for sharing
review/text: Have to admit I've never had Jack Links X-Stick (or any other Jack Links product) and have NO idea what they taste like.  I bought these because I know a Marine in Afghanistan loves them and so do his buddies.<br />This particular item is perfect for military CARE packages: each unit is individually wrapped so nothing goes stale or gets sand in it after the box is opened.<br />The small-size box is great for people without a lot of storage or 'personal' space.  The single-servings are ideal for sharing (without wiping yourself out of goodies) and fit into cammy pockets without taking up a lot of room or adding to the weight you're carrying.<br />They make a welcome change from MRE's or when you need a quick energy boost (the convoy can't always stop for lunch).<br />Even if you don't know if your 'fighter' likes them, I guarantee they'll be appreciated - remember when the kids traded lunches in school?  They may be older but trading goodies within the unit is a time-honored tradition, too!

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Edible, but not great. I picked these up because Amazon had stopped carrying Pemmican beef jerky (which hadn't been the same since the company was sold anyway) and I was looking for something to snack on. I like Slim-Jims ok when they're good (but quality control is a major issue with Slim-Jims, as for every good one you get, you're likely to get one that tastes rancid or worse).<br /><br />Obviously, these aren't like beef jerky, they're closer to Slim-Jims. The consistency seems to be much better than Slim-Jims and the price is pretty good. The flavor isn't as good as a good Slim-Jim, but is much better than a bad one, so it kind of evens out.<br /><br />I was hoping these would be closer to the "Matador" line of snack sticks that Jack Link's makes. For whatever reason, despite carrying many Jack Link's products at present, Amazon doesn't seem to have the Matador line.

review/summary: Snikiddy Cheddar Cheese Fries
review/text: I've had the pleasure of trying a couple different kinds of the Snikiddy snacks. This one, and the Southwest fries. This one wasn't so good. They may be a "healthier" snack, but this one definitely wasn't very tasty.<br /><br />Snikiddy boasts of an All Natural product. Which it is. They are gluten free, no msg, vegetarian, and they have less fat than a lot of other snacks. There's even some vitamins packed in there. A read through of the ingredients shows that they can all be pronounced without problems, which is always a positive. It even has real cheese, yay! But cornmeal is the first ingredient listed. Which isn't necessarily bad, but I wish corn wasn't the predominant ingredient. It would be nice to have a snack without corn.<br /><br />The taste, its kind of hard to describe. Worse than cheetos, definitely. It tasted cheesy I guess but not in a good way. I usually can get through a whole bag of snacks during a workday. This one though, is still sitting mostly full on my desk after about a week. I just can't make it through more than a fry or two at a time. The cheese is kind of cloying and the texture gluey once you get through the initial crunch. The taste never changes through the entire consumption but stays the same bland yuck the whole way through.<br /><br />Not a very good snack in my opinion. They need to revamp the taste to something different. A healthy snack that noone wants to eat doesn't help anyone at all.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: My newest baked snack favorite
review/text: As someone who is fond of baked  cheddar cheese puffs, crackers and potato chips (I wish I was not), I was interested to try these. I'm always looking for something with great flavor but also something that is not outrageously high in calories or sodium and that has acceptable ingredients (you can view the nutritional information for the cheese fries here: [...]) and not a lot of chemical ingredients.<br /><br />These are marketed as baked "fries" and from my tastebuds' perspective, they are a much healthier alternative than the real thing. They have that crisp and crunch you don't find in chips (or I haven't found) plus great taste.<br /><br />Now, they aren't low calorie at 130 calories for a 1 ounce serving (about 4.5 servings per package) so you do have to restrain yourself, cause it is VERY easy to eat the bag in a couple (if not one or two) sittings if you don't restrain yourself.<br /><br />If you're looking for a cheesy "fried" alternative in a baked snack, give the Snikiddy Cheddar Cheese baked fries a try.<br /><br />They are now available at more retail stores where I live, but the price remains a bit higher than similar products that come with more ounces per package. But again, it's all about taste.<br /><br />You don't need to eat a lot of these to fill up fast and feel satisfied. Something that's also a consideration along with taste.

review/text: I've had cheddar cheese puffs from a different manufacturer that were so inconsistent from one batch to another it made me wonder how companies get away with it, but this beats them all. I love snacks like this, I just didn't like this particular product - at all. It appears they use artificial coloring though they say they don't; the fries are thin; the fries break easily; the fries lack any discernable real cheese flavor and are so full of air, they're just like cheese puffs in potato fry shape. And poor tasting puffs at that, but I said that already. Avoid, despite the attractive price. There's nothing organic in it either, so the price should be even lower than what it already is.
