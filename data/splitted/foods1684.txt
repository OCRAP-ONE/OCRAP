review/summary: Mixed reviews on this flavor from my family
review/text: This is my least-favorite flavor of Clif bars, one of my husband's lesser favorites, and my twenty-something daughter's favorite flavor. Clif has a lot of different flavors, however, so there is something for everyone. I switched over from Zone-type meal bars to only this brand a while back because it has much healthier ingredients.<br /><br />This cannot be considered a high-protein bar, because they tend to have 18-20 grams of protein, and this brand has only 9-10 grams of protein per bar.<br /><br />Like all meal bars, this is very condensed food, containing about the same calories as a candy bar of the same size.

review/summary: Much Cheaper Than In a Store
review/text: If you like Cliff bars, you should absolutely buy it on amazon.  Each bar can be $2-$3 in a store, so it is better to buy a box here and just use it gradually.  You will save money as long as you have the self-control not to snack on them throughout the day.

review/summary: It's pretty good...
review/text: These large pouches of tuna contain about 43 ounces of tuna with no excess broth at all to drain off...it's all fish. The tuna is in large, meaty chunks and tastes good...especially in salad or patties, etc.. Straight from the pouch it is good, but their is a slight bitter aftertaste which I ascribe to the vegetable broth used in processing and may contain some MSG, as many broths do...but MSG is not a listed ingredient.It was a great deal for under 14 dollars for the two pouches.

review/summary: Cheaper at ShopRite
review/text: My sister in law served this with a Caprese salad and I loved it so much I took a pic of the bottle with my cell phone. Once I got home I combed the gourmet kitchen stores to no avail. I needed it for an upcoming party, so I broke down and got it at Amazon. Hate paying for shipping, but not covered by Amazon Prime.  So I ordered it and it arrived within a week or so. Fast forward to the night before the party and I'm at my local Shoprite. You guessed it. There it was amongst the other humble balsamic brands. And it was on sale. Sigh. OK that was a long intro to my review: It's delicious and I highly recommend it. It's like balsamic vinegar, but thicker. Almost as thick as pancake syrup.I like it on salad greens and on the side for steak. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Does what I need
review/text: Please note, this goes to the dogs! Got the heads up from vets years ago that what otc products use to curb dogs who eat poop is MSG (some products add cayenne). This ajino moto is MSG, and when sprinkled like salt on a dog's food, it makes the poop taste bitter. Wonderful for multiple dog households. It works! And according to vets, dogs don't get MSG headaches or any side effects -- I certainly have never noticed any. After all, what's worse then eating poop (and think about them coming in and licking you after that!).<br /><br />This 5-lb bag is great way to get MSG cheap. It keeps forever. And, of course, you can use it to season food if you wanted to.

review/summary: My every day green tea
review/text: I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays "NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays "CAFFENE FREE".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.

review/summary: Truly Awful
review/text: Wow.<br />This gingerbread is terrible. Truly terrible. Inedible, even. It's not just because it is sugar-free. Of course sugar-free cake is going to be a little different and less rich. But this is way, way worse than other sugar-free baked goods. I have had sugar-free chocolate cake and loved it. THIS mix is terrible. There are many reasons:<br /><br />- The batter is like a mousse, that just gets hard when it bakes. So it looks like crap because it doesn't smooth out as it bakes. Every spoon-mark is still there when you pull it out of the oven. It looks really weird. You could not serve it to company.<br />- The cooking time on the box (for the loaf pan) is ten minutes too long.<br />- There is no ginger taste, or cinnamon, nutmeg, or spice flavour in this "ginger" bread. It is flat and tasteless.<br />- The lack of other flavours allows the nasty aftertaste from the Sweet & Low(tm) to bloom with full force.<br />- The gingerbread is lacking in body, because it is as light and fluffy as a mousse. It is not helpful for dieters because it is not satisfying to eat because when you eat it, you feel like you haven't eaten anything. Strangely, this gingerbread mousse is also rubbery. Rubbery stiff mousse that dissolves in your mouth.<br /><br />The overall experience is like biting into a vaguely sweet sponge. Then it dissolves. And then the bitter chemical aftertaste kicks in.<br /><br />I have NO IDEA how a slice of this gingerbread could be 160 calories. There's nothing in it, it tastes nasty, and it is gross to chew on! You can have a gingerbread Pop Tart(tm) for 200 calories, or a bakery gingerbread cookie for 120 calories, and they are full of fat and sugar. How can this sugar-free, taste-free, light and fluffy rubber crap be 160 calories?

review/summary: New to me.
review/text: I'd never tried sea vegetables before so I wasn't sure what to expect from this kelp, but several of my relatives have thyroid problems and after researching the matter I decided that adding iodine to my diet via kelp was a good idea.  When I received the product and opened a packet and saw that the kelp was covered with a white dusty substance I was horrified and assumed it was moldy but after reading the instructions--always a good idea!--I was informed that it's normal and is just salt and sugar substances produced by the kelp as it is dried.  This company claims that they voluntarily test for various kinds of contamination, so I was impressed by that. As for eating the kelp, I washed and inspected a piece of it, then snipped it into some chicken broth and gently simmered it for about 20 minutes.  It's a little chewy--imagine a really tough cabbage leaf--and seems salty, but I found it palatable and didn't get sick or anything.  In fact, I felt quite good the next day.  Don't know if that was down to the kelp, but I will keep on eating it.  Try it.

review/text: So I ordered this product yesterday at around 3 pm selected the 3-5 day shipping for 1 dollar.  Today I come home and I see this box and I realize its the pirate bootys that I ordered a day ago.  This product is a healthy alternative for chips and surprisingly fills me up.  For 21.00 I definately reccomend it.

review/text: I was not as pleased as I have been in the past.  The product didn't taste as fresh and there were many pieces that had hard parts like popcorn that hasn't been "popped" correctly.  Oddly enough, they have raised the price but lowered the quality!

review/summary: I LOVE PIRATE BOOTY
review/text: My family has always been a lover of the 'puffed corn' snack.  Pirate Booty blows all of the others out of the water.  The ingredient list is the first plus.  The second is the taste of the real cheese used in the product.  I almost never like 'cheese flavored' chips etc.  But I love the taste of the Ages White Cheddar.  My only complaint is that the bags never seems large enough for my appetite!!!

review/summary: Kids Love Pirate Booty!
review/text: My kids like Pirate Booty a lot. It is a great snack for lunches but I find that you limit the serving to about 1 sandwich sized Ziploc bag which is about right for a school lunch.  I would also point out that they don't like the consistency of it as much as Veggie Booty which is really their all-time favorite.

Nice light flavor but honestly doesn't fill you up.

review/summary: mildly cheese flavored packing peanuts
review/text: Not at all a "healthy" snack, though better than some. I was disappointed by the mild cheese flavor, preferring more cheddar flavor. The texture is truly much like Styrofoam packing peanuts. I just don't understand what all the fuss is about. They're just "OK".

review/summary: Best Tasting Packing Peanuts Out There
review/text: Okay: I haven't ever actually tasted packing peanuts.  But I would be willing to bet that they taste and share the same texture that these grub-shaped extrusions do.<br /><br />I can't believe how popular these are, actually.  I'm not a particularly picky eater.  I will even eat rice cakes, which are pretty Styrofoamy.  But these are really unpleasant.<br /><br />The "flavor" is a combination of something synthetic and inedible, with occasional hints of stale cornmeal, combined with a faint moldy cheese taste.  The bizarre texture triggers an instinctive "don't eat this--it isn't food" response.  The individual bits look disconcertingly similar to those large, "C" shaped June beetle grubs one occasionally digs up in the garden.  I bet those taste better.  This product fails on any aspect of "appeal" on every point.<br /><br />If you find these tasty, I'm betting you are either (a) high; (b) drunk; or (c) 7 years old and the only other thing you eat is bologna.  I kid; I kid.  :)

review/summary: Mildly cheese flavored packing peanuts
review/text: Now my review title is a "copy cat" title. I was talking on the phone with a friend while I was eating them and asked her if she had ever eaten a packing peanut (they are edible!) as I was trying to describe the taste, and the fact that they aren't labeled as chips, or popcorn or puffs or anything, they are just "pirate's booty" (it does say that they are baked corn and rice puffs) and the taste is barely even there. They aren't even a healthy snack, so do not let that persuade you. That are not an unhealthy snack, so that's a good thing, they are primarily made of corn meal (you know that stuff that has dog lovers up in arms, about the content of their dog food) There is really no nutritional value to this "snack". I guess it's geared toward children as the bag has sponge bob all over it. I don't find these tasty at all, but at the same time they aren't "untasty" My 3 year old ate a few and gave the rest to his 1 year old baby brother, who ate a few but left most.

review/summary: Deliciously satisfying snack that is merciful on your waistline!
review/text: The aged white cheddar Pirates Booty is hands down one of my favorite dry salty snacks.  I've been eating it for 5 years not and don't know if I'll ever get sick of it.<br /><br />For the volume of snackage thats in the package, it has half the calories (130) than there would be if the same volume of potato chips were in the bag.  In other words, its not one of those tricky bags of chips that is only 130 calories, but upon opening the bag, you find that it was pumped full of air and there's only 5 chips! When you open a bag of pirates booty, it is chock full of delicious, flavorful white cheddar puffs.  They are crunchy, and melt in your mouth at the same t<br /><br />Of course, fresh fruits and veggies are still the healthiest snack. Pirate's Booty is mostly carbs, a wee bit of protein, fiber, and calcium.  But compared to other snacks you find in the same aisle at the grocery store, this is a much healthier alternative.  The ingredients have nothing to be skeptical about, which is another plus.<br /><br />It is the perfect snack to "splurge" on if you're dieting, as the caloric content doesn't make much of a dent, there's a lot in the bag, and it's full of flavor!

review/summary: My Wife Likes Them, I'm Okay With It
review/text: Pirate's Booty, at least from what I remembered, was pretty tasty. Strong, bold taste.<br /><br />These 1-Ounce bags seems like a watered down version from what I'm used to.<br /><br />They are a light snack, and good to pack with your lunch. I would love for it to have a stronger cheddar taste, but apparently I would be wrong. My wife, and my 1 year old son loves them. They are light and melts in your mouth, so it's a very good grab and go type of snack.<br /><br />If you are like me, who like to be able to taste a strong cheddar flavor... I would not get these 1-ounce bags.<br /><br />But if you are like my wife, and my son who like soft and light taste of the cheddar, you would love these.<br /><br />I'm going to give it a 5 stars since my wife and son loves them.

review/text: My Grandson takes a 1oz. bag of Pirates Booty each day for lunch in school.Today he came home "Grossed out" his words , because there was " a dark brown, hard as a rock, chunk of something" in his bag.<br />My explanation was that probably a piece of Booty got caught in a machine, overcooked and the came loose and fell in his bag.<br />Would appreciate it if you have another or better explanation. He is a picky eater at best. Would be a shame to lose a reasonably healthy snack.<br /><br />You need another 'contact us' method. Did not want to make this a review but could not find another way.

review/summary: What NO popcorn!!!!!
review/text: I love this product.  I have always been a popcorn eater, but now I have sacks in my colon, so no seeds, nuts etc.<br />I found Pirates Booty years ago when I was on Weight Watchers, it was a great snack and hardly any calories.<br /><br />Now that I have this condition it is a great snack for me and I just love it.<br /><br />The only problem is that it was very hard to find a store that carries it.  I have found that I can now purchase it on line.<br /><br />This is a wonderful product and I hardly recommend it.<br /><br />Janet Wilder

review/text: WHILST I'LL NEVER STOP CONSIDERING POTATO CHIPS, (especially barbeque potato chips, sigh!), as my favourite snack, PIRATE'S BOOTY popcorn snacks come a very, (very!) close second.  Since they are made of popcorn, (and not potatos), they are better for one's over-all health -- especially one's eyes.  Potatos are,  (ssady : (  a STARCH, and no matter how much nutrition they contain, they still are loaded with carbohydrates, and starches..... :_(<br /><br />Aha - and Avast, there!  As here come the (very!) friendly "Pirates", who make "Pirate's Booty" snacks.  This particular flavour, AGED WHITE CHEDDAR, is totally scrumptious, besides giving the crunchiness that potato chip lovers crave! : )(People who list potato chips as their favourite snacks -- such as Diane Sawyer, (and me!) -- are reputed to show a personality that wants to TAKE CHARGE!  Yep -- potato chip lovers are the natural leaders of the world, those who crave power!<br />I know that both I -- and I'm sure Ms. Sawyer -- want power so that we can do GOOD things for the rest of humanity, abd why not?  (Don't kid yourself -- there ARE, and HAVE BEEN such people, throughout history.  THEODORA, once a slave and then wife of Emporer Justinian was one.  With her power, she wanted to HELP the poor of Byzantium.<br />Really!  Of course, the born aristocrats didn't like THAT too<br />much!  Or, THE GREAT of Russia, who worked alongside of workers to help build his palace!  And J.F.K. Jr, (and Sr?) who belonged to the 'ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY', as well as OPRAH WINFREY, (I'm not sure that potato chips were/ are the favourite snack of JFK Jr., (or Senior), or of Ms. Winfrey -- but I'd take a bet on it),..as well<br />as....well.....DIANE SAWYER, whom I saw on TV saying that potato chips WERE her favourite snack, and....and...well, and hopefully, me, if I ever can find a way to get the wealth and power which my love of potato chips so clearly indicates!)<br /><br />Yet potato chip must, of course, be eaten with discretion, and not with abandon....or one's hope for a healthy life will also soon be....abandned.  PIRATE'S BOOTY, who's major ingredient is not potato chips, but much more healthy popcorn, (here topped with scrumptious aged white cheddar cheese -- also a carbohyrate and starch...but which here, as a topping, is, though one can definitely taste it('s yumminess), is not nearly as much of an ingredient as<br />potato chips have potatos!  For those who have heretofore only had<br />the caramel, Cracker-Jack type coated popcorn, the infinitely lighter, (though still totally scrumptious!) taste of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks will come as a revelation.  One can find oneself eating just as much of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks, (especially THIS delightful aged cheddar flavour...at least for me!), as one heretofore did with potato chips!  Only -- much of the guilt is gone, because, ounce for ounce, these PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks are far, far healthier!<br /><br />And -- PLEASE don't think of "nasty" pirates, such as Peter Pan's Captain Hook, or the real-life Salesian Pirates, when you eat this wonderful snack.  Think of....Caotain Ballows, in the movie, "The Crimson Pirate", or Dr. Peter Blood, (played by Errol Flynn!), in the movie, "Captain Blood".  These are good, and HEROIC pirate figures...pirates who fought for freedom! (And who knows, but that SOME present, real-life "pirates", may someday soon do the same thing?)<br /><br />Althogh these snacks are NOT vegan, they ARE certified kosher.<br /><br />At any rate -- be sure to FREE yourself of needless calories,<br />and carbohydrates!  Have delicious PIRATE'S BOOTY Snacks, at least half the times you reach for potato chips!  As the Pirate's parrot might say: "Awwwwk!  They're Goooooood!"

review/summary: Not Exactly Like the Real Thing But Still Good
review/text: I mix a half a bottle of this sauce with a can of Campbell's healthy request condensed cream of chicken soup plus a little skim milk. I add diced cooked chicken, steamed broccoli or steamed cauliflower. Season to taste and heat through and serve on Ronzoni Smart Pasta or Ronzoni Healthy Harvest Pasta. Lots of times I'll also add some low sodium chicken bouillon to the recipe.<br /><br />I've even served the recipe above to company - including family who would have NO qualms telling me it was awful and even they thought it wasn't bad.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not wild about this as it comes out of the jar. I do think it needs to be "doctored" up and you absolutely won't mistake this for the yummy chicken fettucini you can get at a nice restaurant but if you are watching calories/carbs or on a restricted diet then this is not a bad alternative.

review/text: I really like Walden farms calorie free fruit dips and salad dressings, so was excited to give this a try.  It was disappointing.  This sauce is thin and pretty bland.  It's edible with a little work (salt, pepper, spices) but I don't think I will be buying this one again.  It might be good to mix 50/50 with a real sauce to REDUCE the calories, but as is I just did not care for it.  I will say that ate it on shirataki fettuccine noodles, which do not have much flavor so that could have been part of the problem.  This would probably be good used in a chicken bake or something (would still need to add some salt and pepper tho)

review/text: I am very sorry to say this tasted to me the way I imagine "rear end" would taste. I tried refrigerating them to make it more palatable. For some reason there was a very strong bran-like taste as the most dominant flavor, with sweet and chocolate as the secondary and tertiary flavors in that order. I assume it was from the brown rice. I agree with another reviewer that they are very sweet, though since I cooked them in mini cupcake form it was not a significant problem for me. I tried for several weeks (including refrigerating and freezing) to try and finish them without wasting them, but I finally gave up. I was so worried I gave away my other untried products (carrot cake mix etc.) from this company. I didn't dare try the rest, as brown rice was listed as a primary ingredient again.

review/summary: Good, But Not 'Gourmet'...
review/text: In my opinion, the Red Buffalo Coffee company thinks awfully highly of themselves and their coffee. At $22 a pound, they are getting away with some pretty serious acts of robbery. It's coffee, for crying out loud. It's not a bag of diamonds... or gold. At that price, the coffee grounds ought to jump out of the bag, brew itself, pour itself and make breakfast while it's at it. I'm sorry, but again, it's just coffee. I've tasted MANY flavored coffees, and Red Buffalo doesn't even make the best I've tasted, let alone $22-a-pounds-worth. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly tasty. I'm grateful to my niece for sending it to me as a recent birthday gift, chosen from my Amazon wish list, which actually makes me feel a bit guilty. However, when I added it to my list, I thought it must really be something special to be that expensive. But all future coffee orders will be filled by a more reasonably priced, equally flavorful coffee company, because I feel Red Buffalo is really just quite HOPELESSLY DEEP in to price-gouging.
