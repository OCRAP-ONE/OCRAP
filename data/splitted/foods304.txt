review/summary: Very delicious but not a meal replacement
review/text: I honestly don't know if this was supposed to replace a meal like Slim Fast(tm). It says it will satisfy hunger longer, this is mildly true. How much longer is up to each individual person. I would like it to satisfy more but what do you do to a shake to allow it to taste great, satisfy you even more, and not totally blow the overall appeal?<br /><br />Having spent many months drinking shakes as meal replacements (under doctor's care), I can say that these completely blow the taste of the other shakes out of the water. There is a taste that I always equate to vitamins in them but that's the added protein. Try drinking a protein powder and you'll see what I mean. It has a very high amount of protein for such a small serving, this alone makes it worth drinking no matter your size. The carbs are a bit higher than I'd like to see but that does come with the territory of protein and milk.  I bought the vanilla myself and had one chocolate from someone in the office who offered me a shake. I like vanilla because I can toss this into a blender and mix some fruit for a truly satisfying smoothie. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing to note is the price tag. At Wal-Mart (where I live) a 4 pack is $6.49, making that roughly $1.62 per bottle. Even with the "amazon" pricing of $43.68, each unit costs roughly $1.82. Sure, what's $.20ï¿½ per for the convenience of ordering online? Nothing, it's just something to point out. The tax on the item in a B&M store is likely what makes ordering online only slightly worth it, again YMMV.

review/summary: Very unhealthy
review/text: After reading the ingredients list on this product  I know I will never buy or drink any. I would be telling anyone I can how unhealthy this drink is. Whey protein is a debatable protein source. I prefer a protein powder such as hemp. It is easily digested and mixes well with liquids. The only way soy is healthful is if it is fermented, like tofu. This product contains 18 grams of sugar, which is very high. The carbohydrates are also high at 29 grams. The cocoa is processed with alkali. There are mono and diglycerides in this drink. The vitamin k1 that is used is not very absorbable and not recommended by those who understand vitamin k and which source is most usable by the human body. If I am going to spend good money on a product it will be for something that supports good health. I can't say this product is much good for anything but making money off of those who will not know better. I prefer to make my own protein drink which is much healthier and I know where the ingredients come from.

review/summary: Ok Stock....Really Disappointing On Fixens.
review/text: I picked up a pouch of this soup at a local market just recently.  I have always loved a good minestrone soup and make it home made a lot.  However like many others at times I like to keep it quick and easy, and a ready in no time bag of stock and fixens often fits the bill nicely.  Unfortunately this soup was quick and easy all right, but that is pretty much where most of the goodness of it ended.  The recipe calls for 6 cups of water plus a 15oz can of tomato sauce.  I opted for only 5 cups of water since I prefer a thicker, heartier soup.  But as I mixed it all together it was obvious as it simmered that this was going to be a really loose watery soup, even with using less water than directed.  Oh, the pouch has a nice list of ingredients on it, including pasta, bell pepper, onion, celery, etc, but both the size and quantity of them all  leaves much to be desired.  The stock itself was not bad.  It was not overly salty, was mildly spicy and tasted passable enough.  But with every spoonful that's pretty much what you got every time.  A lot of stock with a few pitiful pieces of fixens floating around in it...<br /><br />Like all soup mixes, the pouch recommends some stir in suggestions.  Like sausage, hamburger, beans, and cabbage for example.  But in my opinion if you want to enjoy a hearty soup for dinner on some cold night at all with this, plan on a stir in suggestion being not an option, but a must.  And even then I suggest you use less than the 6 cups of water suggested.  An even more sensible option is to forget this entirely and opt for a much better choice for a pouch style soup mix in the Bear Creek brand minestrone. Available here on Amazon, and in lots of local markets.  Its decently hearty all by itself, and is superior with some meat or other suggestion tossed in.  And you even get more stock and fixens for about the same price as this Cuginos brand.  All in all I cannot recommend this mix.  Either try the Bear Creek or other mix, or go home made... : )

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: Currently I'm on my second jar of this fantastic rice, it completely seduced me with its nutty and totally buttery aroma - raw in the jar it smells just like that, but the taste is equally impressive.<br />My favorite way of making it starts with saut&eacute;ing two shallots or some onion with a bit of olive oil or butter, then to that I add whatever herbs I have around, usually rosemary or thyme, then I add the uncooked rice and dry saut&eacute; it until lightly toasted, at the end I throw in a handful of golden raisins and two cups of chicken broth, 20 minutes on a slow simmer and a tasty side is ready.<br /><br />I have burned my share of rice in the past or was forced to throw out the overly wet batches, but this one comes out perfect every time. Whether I make it plain or fancy it up, it always tastes delicious.<br /><br />This brand of rice is great at creating wonderful hybrids for all kinds of dishes, highly recommended.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Somewhat misleading ad
review/text: i just got my Gourmet Popcorn Variety 3-pack (45 oz per pack) and wanted to make sure that other potential purchasers were aware of what they were buying.  There are three plastic bottles of popcorn in the package.  Each bottle contains 15 ounces of popcorn for  a total of 45 ounces for the entire order.  When I ordered the popcorn, I thought I was getting 3 45 ounce containers.  This would be a little over 3 dollars per pound which is reasonable for gourmet popcorn.  Instead this works out to somewhat more than 10 dollars per pound.  I considered returning it, but as a popcorn lover, I decided to keep it.  I may amend my review after popping some of it to see if it's worth the price.

review/text: I've tried a lot of brands, store bought and mail order, and consider this the best so far. Especially nice to get this 3-pack so you can see for yourself the difference in flavor you get from just using a different corn variety.<br /><br />It pops a bit smaller, as is true for many of the gourmet brands. But this popcorn has actual flavor. I usually pop it with plain oil and a little salt and pepper, letting the real flavor come through.<br /><br />The corn is non-GMO a plus for me.<br /><br />Don't go for the "bigger is better" but bland that is all to common. Give this stuff a try and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Excellent and highly recommended.

It's likely you can find something very similar to this in a local store (I got a similar 3-pack at Target last year) for a similar price, and will save on the shipping.<br /><br />Overall, it's good. It's just not a good value because of the shipping costs.

review/summary: Perfect treat for overweight dogs of any size
review/text: These wholesome treats are only 1 or 2 calories per biscotti "crouton." My 50 pound dog has a weight problem, and these are the only treats I can use to reward him for obedience multiple times a day.<br /><br />The biscotti don't crumble in my  pocket on a walk, and my dog even sniffs my pockets at home to ask for another one. Even though the treats are tiny, he doesn't swallow them whole. He chews them--maybe to savor them. I also put these in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038WP1YC">Ethical Pet Seek-A-Treat Shuffle Bone Dog Puzzle</a> as a reward, and he solves his puzzle with enthusiasm. Even though my dog weighs 50 pounds, one 8 oz bag lasts about a month.<br /><br />My dog has no diagnosed allergies, but his gasto-esophgial system was sensitive and irregular starting from the time we rescued him. For his weight-loss, I switched his food to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, which has no soy, wheat, corn, by-products, or preservatives. His gastro-esophogeal system happened to improve a lot and became regular. The hypo-allergenic treats did not cost much more than the regular ones at the time I first bought them, so I figured I would be safe and buy them. My dog hasn't had any problems on these treats, but the change in food might also explain it.  I'm sticking with the hypo-allergenic even though it's not eligible for free shipping.<br /><br />Having said that my dog likes these treats a lot, these are not his very favorite.  I give him a medium-sized biscuit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027D3QO">Nutri-Vet Breath & Tartar Spearmint & Parsley Flavored Biscuits, 19.5 Ounce Bag</a>every few days, and he goes absolutely crazy for it. Alas, the biscuits have too many calories for me to treat him more often. I'd say my dog would rate his biscuits 10 barks for taste, whereas he would give his biscotti a solid 7 barks.<br /><br />Because the biscotti treats are tasty, made with wholesome ingredients, and very low in calories, I rate them 5 stars.  I consider liver biscotti a good investment in my dog's health. Every dog should have liver biscotti as his or her go-to treats.

review/text: I use these treats with dogs all the time with very positive results.  The fact that they make a regular and one for dogs with sensitive systems are quite appreciated.<br /><br />I used to use treats that weren't as good (quality-wise) a fit when training.  These are not greasy by any means and you can keep them in your pocket or a treat bag quite easily.<br /><br />They are solid treats that aren't brittle so there's no real fear of them falling apart in your pocket or treat bag.  They aren't totally solid, but their baked quality gives them a harder consistency that provides a great crunch for dogs.  The closes thing I can compare them to are small croutons, (these are slightly smaller) like you'd put on a salad for instance.<br /><br />I make sure I've got a good supply of them around the house.  For the money, that hasn't been a problem.  And with the wholesome ingredients they contain, you don't feel guilty about giving out a few extras ;)

Piggy Puffs is one of those the dogs like.  Really like.  When the bag comes out of hiding they are standing there with their ears perked and ready to eat.  Other treats do not get anywhere near the reception.  While Yorkies are know as yappers among other things these two just settle down with their Piggy Puff and grant us peace and quiet.  We have never had an instance of choking such as some treats have a tendency to do nor have we noticed any negative results in their stools.  All around, these are good delights for the dogs and that makes us happy.  What more can you ask for?

review/summary: Yummy, easy, and gluten free
review/text: This is a wonderful sauce mix, especially if you are gluten intolerant. I took this sauce mix travelling with me internationally, along with some gluten free pasta (Trader joe's brown rice spaghetti or tinkyada spaghetti) and had a wonderful meal, especially with the addition of a can of clams. If you like you can also add some freshly grated cheese (romano or parmesan) for some added flavor. Very tasty, and quick to prepare.

review/summary: Have Been L@@KING All Over the Place for EYEBALLS!
review/text: Dang it! I've been l@@king literally everywhere for these blasted eye balls so I can prepare the WEIRD HALLO-CAKE! What I do with these is I freeze them, they are part of the cake decor; the "ooey, gooey, sm'ooey" cakey!<br /><br />It isn't a hard thing to make but really fun even for those "moms who works but really would love to make a creepy cake for their kids" to "grandma's (or Aunts, Cousin Itt - oops LOL!) has more tricks up her sleeves than you can imagine" ... It's true - those who've borne children automatically DO have eyeballs in the back of their heads - HEE HEE HEE!  HERE'S THE RECEIPE (cheat sheet):<br /><br />1) Store bought Angel Food Cake - turn it upside down - use toothpicks to mark 2 inches above (remember cake is upside down) from bottom - pushing it through every 6 to 8 inches all around if you have good EYES. Using non-flavored, waxed dental floss - cut the bottom end off (provides you a faster and cleaner cut in a sawing motion slowly) just above the toothpicks.<br /><br />2) Lift cake, leave base (bottom) on the store bought base and cover with lid and set aside.<br /><br />3) With the main Angel Food Cake, measure inside with tooth picks as markers 1.25 inches so you have a border on the edges all around; if you have something thin and flat (this is a tricky part; unless you've done this before with Bundt cakes) - for example: skewers (for k'bobs), another really ultra thin knife, or something where you have a starting point - measure it 2 inches from the top (which will be on a plate to a Lazy Susan - whichever you have it set on). You will also need a bowl. First cut the inside in an "X" motion until you hit that object then stop and start the other side then work your way around. You will then be able to remove everything out from inside of the cake except that small remnant that remains in bottom which can be removed carefully with a melon ball scooper, small cup, spoon - (examples).<br />Reserve 1/4th of the Angel Food in one bowl and cover it tightly, and reserve another 1/2 of the Angel Food which has been crumbled into pieces wrapped tightly or placed in Tupperware or Rubbermaid bowl which has been drowned with a bottle of Fudge and place in refrigerator. The remainder, everyone can eat it unless you wish to save some for decorations on cake (like a tombstone and graveyard - put those aside)- you can form these remnants by squeezing them together and making creations out of it before they have been icing or decorated.<br /><br />4)Place the base bottom on top of the hallow (which is upside down) and cover it; carefully setting it aside with a lid.<br /><br />5) For the ooey, gooey, smo'ooey inside - find instant Mooooooooooosseeee mix, buy at least three boxes to be on the safe side - take your pick; orange, yellow, green, or black (fudge) - if you want to layer it in multiple colors - you can; this what makes it all the fun!<br /><br />a) You can snatch the Peeps Ghosts and stuff them on the top and layer the first part with green (Pistacho)Mooooooooooosssssseyyyyy, then with the crumbly fudgey-wudey Angel Food as the spacer - spread it all around, then the next layer can be a simple Jell-O Wigglers (??) ... it's all up to your imagination as you fill up that Angel Food Cake but just remember to refrigerate it upside down first and permit it to rest before proceeding to the next level. To make life interesting - I love to do this, the same thing what they use to freeze bananas with as well as Ice Cream - I use that for the bottom end of the Angel Food as well as to Attach the Base Bottom to the Main Cake and it gets Frozen and yes, sometimes there are eyeballs in the cake but where?  I don't know that's what makes it so gross and interesting as well as fun!<br /><br />5) Whether you use Marzepan to Icing after you remove the Angel Food Cake out of the freezer to begin decorating it is solely your preference but keep in mind this has to remain refrigerated but before you serve it, please allow it to stand at least 15 to 20 minutes before the "FUN STARTS" ... expect a mess ... after all, where's all the fun without the "gore"?<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />I've used it for Adult Entertainment to my own son's parties to my grandchildrens ... every time it's always something different!<br /><br />PS: If you are using this for "Adult Entertainment" (no children) - and you have access to "Dry Ice" - you can use a special Sealed canister that will give an eerie appearance that this cake is smoking if you are using the Halloween Lights and so forth. Not only will you receive a lot of compliments .... it is really, really good - You will be a big hit, not only will the cake be so pretty to eat, but just perfect for the show... trust me, it is worth all the mess ... just watch your guests scrape it all up and some even licking their own PLATES! LOL! LOL! LOL!!!! (Yes, they do go back for more if there's anymore; and I've seen disappointed guests when they return back and only to find out all the Cakes are gone, in addition, I've even been asked if I had anymore so they could take some home for their kids? I admit, I do feel a little bad but it is a lot of work but worth every bit of it - take my word!)<br /><br />This year's theme is 'THE EYES HAVE IT' ...  :-D  I have some other eyeballs, but this is the MAIN ATTRACTION ... YEAH!<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />But of course you didn't read this review from me otherwise everyone else will begin doing this.<br /><br />:P

review/summary: Don't like brown rice? Try this one
review/text: Brown rice can be, well, heavy. But Texmati has all the fragrance of basmati rice, the fiber of brown rice and it comes in a wonderful clear square plastic jar that is great for filling with beans or popcorn when it is empty. This rice smells like pecans when cooking and tastes great. You can cook it up as pilaf with raisins, almonds and chicken or vegetable broth for a delicious side dish. Try it also by browning it in olive oil with a half cup of orzo per cup of rice and then make pilaf with broth. It is delicious.

review/summary: Good, But Not 5-Star...
review/text: We like all kinds of rice, especially brown and basmati.  This rice is very good, but not 5-star.  It arrived quickly and in very good condition, mostly due to the excellent packaging.  It is the amongst the FRESHEST rice we've ever purchased (and we've purchased from the source).  It has a wonderful taste and aroma.  After cooking several batches, both on the stove and in our Zoji Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, we like it, but find the texture to be just okay.  We've had better textured varieties in the past.  The grains are on the short side for "long grain" and they explode a little too much, even when we used less water.  It is very good, for brown rice; just not quite as good, for brown basmati.  We would buy it again, but not as our only source of brown basmati.

Texmati brown rice added a delicate perfume to the dish which complemented perfectly the mild flavors of the other ingredients.

review/summary: Oh so good!!!
review/text: Truthfully, this was an accidently buy. And it was a good one at that!!! Being an asian woman I took a break from rice for about 5 years. It was just one of those things. I've always been a healthy person but I had a big life change and rice left my taste buds for awhile. After reading, Diet for your Blood Type supplement book (I'm AB positive) it mentioned that I could eat rice practically everyday.<br /><br />I went to my local health market and grabbed the first label that said organic brown rice (and I liked the packaging. advertising works sometimes).<br /><br />What a wonderful blend. It cooks slightly different than brown rice. And it seems to stay a bit softer even after I put the leftover in the fridge. The regular brown rice (it says California grown) gets stale quicker.<br /><br />Someone mentioned GMO. Not a big deal to me. Lots of foods are more and more genetically modified. I not really here to argue but to promote a quality product. Nor do I want to get into one. I'm all about wellness. Most people know that brown rice (which most people don't even like to eat it)still has higher nutritional value even if it is a hybridization. Even if you lived the most organic lifestyle the reality is you have to take a supplement because the soil of today does not have the same trace minerals like what our ancestors had, nor the heavy toxic lifestyles that are advertised in our face daily.<br /><br />The true test is how your body responds to the food in the long run. You really just have to try it out to judge for yourself.<br /><br />Someone talked about a different brand that is comparable to this one. I have yet to try that brand but I'm hooked on texmati rice. Give it a try. I hope you agree with me and will switch from brown rice to texmati brown rice. And of course it does cost a bit more. You get what you pay for and it's...Oh so good!!!

review/summary: Not Genuine Basmati
review/text: Texmati is a brand name that mimics the word Basmati and this rice should not be mistaken to Basmati Rice that grows in the foothills of the Himalayas. Basmati rice is known for its long chain carbohydrates structure (conversion of starch into sugar is slower) vs short chain carbohydrates in any other type of rice, including Texmati, a glorified name for long grain American rice thats no different than any other brand long grain American rice, where starch turns into sugar fast and not suitable for healthy eating, especially diabetics (unlike genuine Basmati). For the same price or less you can shop at a local Trader Joes and pick up genuine Organic Basmati from India. Avoid this product its a total ripoff. Not the real deal.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like brown rice
review/text: This doesn't taste like other brown rice that i've had in the past, and that's why I continue to buy it despite the pricetag.  I tend to like my grains soft rather than al dente, and with a bit more water, stirring, and time cooking I can get this rice to that consistency on the stovetop.  It's well worth it, as it comes out buttery without adding water, and savory without adding salt.  It doesn't have that whole grain taste that other types of brown rice do, and tastes similar to white rice.<br /><br />I often cook up large batches at a time and microwave the leftovers and it comes out remarkably well, though certainly better when reheated with water.<br /><br />It's also worth trying out Lotus Forbidden Rice if you're looking for something different.

If you prefer the taste of white rice over brown, you may like this rice.<br /><br />I only make my rice on stovetop, using stainless steel cookware on an electric stove. If you use that method of rice cooking and use the suggested amount of water on the jar, it will turn out mushy. Using 1 c rice and 1 1/2 c water works much better.

review/summary: Wonderful texture, Wonderful aroma
review/text: This rice is absolutely outstanding both in flavor, aroma and texture. However, there is a "trick" to cooking this rice:<br /><br />1. Bring two cups of water to boil.<br /><br />2. Add one cup of rice and stir.<br /><br />3. Cover the rice and put stove on medium/low for 40 minutes.<br /><br />4. Turn off heat completely but keep rice on burner for 20 minutes.<br /><br />It comes out perfect every time, perfect texture, not mushy and deeeeelicous!!!

review/summary: BEWARE: Consumer Report fount Textmati Rice Contains Arsenic
review/text: Consumer Reports November 2012 issue found that most rice harvested in Texas.  Per the consumer report, this brand of rice was found to contain 4.2 to 7.6 micrograms of arsenic per 1/4 cup uncooked serving.  It is recommended that you consume no more than 1-2 servings of this rice per week.<br /><br />View the consumerreports.org for more information about issues with arsenic in rice from Texas.<br /><br />Bottom line:  DONT BUY THIS RICE.  Long grain brown rice from California, Thailand, and other areas typically do not contain arsenic.

review/text: This is pretty high quality brown rice, the texture is a bit softer than the stuff I get at the quality Thai restaurants, maybe it's the strain or maybe it's slightly milled? There might be better stuff out there, but as taste is subjective, this one is worth a shot for making up your own mind about it.

review/summary: Good rice, lasts a while but husband tastes the difference
review/text: This rice is very good and great for all sorts of dishes, I think.  The cook time is slower, of course, than instant or 5-minute rice, but you get a better-quality rice.  The Jars last a LONG time, so this 4-pack is almost unnecessary!<br /><br />The one complaint actually comes from my husband who feels the rice tastes too "oat-y".  I admit you can taste that its NOT white rice, but in dishes, I don't think you can tell the difference.  However, if you are making this to eat plain, yes, you will taste the difference between this and white rice.  If you like the taste of brown rice, however, you'll be just fine.

review/summary: nice flavor, terrible texture
review/text: I've been making brown basmati rice for a while now. But Costco stopped carrying it, so I looked online. I ordered this brand. It has basmati taste and aroma, without any of the basmati texture. It's mushy. I followed the directions perfectly. Then even tried soaking and rinsing it several times before hand. It still came out mushy. I might be doing something wrong, most people seem to like it. But I think it's the rice. I like Royal Brown Basmati rice better, from India, I think.

review/summary: Very tasty, but with some problems.
review/text: As a very fussy packaged product eater, this is the only canned clam chowder I will buy.  It has the best flavor of any canned clam chowder I have ever tried, but it isn't without its flaws.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that almost every can has at least a few pieces of clam that are sandy.  It is extremely unpleasant to bite down on one of these, and it makes my jaw tingle for several minutes every time.  As much as I enjoy the flavor, I can deal with this, but some people may not.<br /><br />Also, there is a rotten (or at least black for some reason) piece of potato in about 1 out of every 4 cans.  I have to watch out for this as I eat it.<br /><br />It's also a little thicker than I would like it to be, so I often thin it out slightly with milk.<br /><br />I like to sprinkle some crumbled bacon and green onions over this to jazz it up.  That helps make it taste a little more like "homemade".<br /><br />You may wonder why I gave it four stars when I have to deal with sand and the occasional black potato chunk.  Well, it's simply because no other canned product I've tried even comes close.  I would easily give this 5 stars if the sand and potato issues were fixed with better quality control.  As it stands, I give this a 4 star rating simply because it's the best that I have found when compared to everything else I have tried.

review/text: DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I buy the larger can of Campbells clam chowder at LEAST 8 times a month. I thought the subscribe and save would allow me to get smaller portions of the soup I love delivered to my door. This soup however IS NOT the Campell's clam chowder I enjoy. This is very runny, has no clams and very little potatoes. It is basically cream soup. It is awful that I am now stuck with 11 more can of this. I guess I will give it to the local food bank, but my subscribe and save has been canceled promptly. How is it possible for the larger cans I buy in the local grocery to be so much thicker and heartier than this? It is sad when you can't even count on trusted brands being consistent in quality.

review/summary: The chowder is great but most of my cans came squashed...
review/text: I love campbell's new england clam chowder but I can never find it in the small cans locally, so I was very happy to see it here on amazon. Unfortunately, when I received my order 10 of the 12 cans were severely damaged. If I saw cans in this condition in a grocery store I wouldn't buy them for any price. Amazon needs to figure out how to ship their canned goods safely. Hopefully Amazon will refund my money, but needless to say, I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Update July 2011<br /><br />I have ordered this chowder from Amazon 2 additional times (I just can't find the smaller cans anywhere). Anyway, the order I received early this year still had many dented and squashed cans but they weren't as badly damaged as the first time.<br /><br />I then placed another order at the end of June and miracle of miracles not a singe can was damaged in any way. The packaging was exactly the same as the first 2 orders, but this time it was shipped by Ensenda instead of UPS. I don't know if that was why the order was undamaged or if it was a fluke.<br /><br />FYI, Amazon's nutritional facts are all very wrong so I will copy the info from the manufacturer's label for you...<br /><br />Serving size: 1 can (10.75 oz or 305 grams)<br /><br />Calories 290<br /><br />Calories from Fat 150<br /><br />Total Fat 17g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 2.5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 10mg<br /><br />Sodium 1100mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 25g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber 3g<br /><br />Sugars 1g<br /><br />Protein 9g<br /><br />Amount Per Serving*<br /><br />Vitamin A 0%<br /><br />Vitamin C 4%<br /><br />Calcium 6%<br /><br />Iron 15%<br /><br />*Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

review/summary: The great flavor of adobo with NO SALT
review/text: I can't believe I found one of my favorite seasonings without salt or MSG.  I love Goya Adobo but,  these day I'm on a very low salt diet.  I have truly missed sprinkling adobo on chicken, steaks, fish, and see food.  I've tried all of the no salt seasonings available at the super-market (Mrs Dash, etc.) but, have not been impressed.  Most lack real flavor and rely too heavily on black pepper.  The only Mrs Dash seasoning I like is the steak grilling blend. Now that I have found the Marshall's Creek products It's like heaven.  I can have my adobo and stay healthy. The flavor of this Marshall's Creek Adobo is similar to the name brand but,  has more turmeric than the name brand.  I have used it on beef and chicken so far and it is just as good as the original minus the salt.  I will definitely buy this again.  The seller packed the jars so well and they arrived very quickly.  Thank you Marshall's Creek and Amazon!

review/text: Ok.....I cannot compare this large can to the smaller cans from the same company because I have never bought tuna from this company.  I have always bought whatever store tuna was on sale.  When we started trying to be a little more conscience about the products we were buying and the company producing those products, I stopped buying tuna.  I had seen this tuna before, but didn't want to spend 3-4 bucks on a small can.  I found this large can and decided to try it.  We are a family of 4, but have kids in sports who love to eat, so I don't think we will have any problem finishing this.  I will take a couple of portions and freeze them to be used later.  Much more economical than the little cans and way better quality than st*rk*st.

review/summary: taste okay, but not as inexpensive as you think!
review/text: Purchased this because it is was less than 1/2 price of the smaller cans.  It tasted decently, though the other commentors are correct that it tastes very different than the smaller cans - the smaller cans have a much more "clean" flavor.  The color of this can's meat is also different (darker, pinker).<br /><br />But my biggest problem is that there is SO much water in the can.  Really, a lot.  (I think someone else called it "soupy", and that is correct).  I cannot help but think this is deliberate, and it disturbs me; it makes me realize that maybe this company is *not* on our side, after all.<br /><br />So, if you are on the fence, go ahead and get a can.  You won't lose too much, and you can make your own judgement.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Placed my second order and the can is completely DENTED on top/side.  It is mangled.  Since I smell tuna juice, I assume this is unsafe to eat.  UGH, I am so frustrated!  I came back here to Amazon to file a claim, but alas no claim can be made (although I am still within 5 days or order receipt).  I cannot "return" the can, either.  Downgraded my 3 stars to 1, until they get this customer service sorted out  :(  Meanwhile, I have a photo of this mangled can on my phone, I will upload it to the photos for this product shortly.

review/text: I thought I was getting a great deal with these big cans and thought I would deal with the issue of a bunch of extra tuna for 3 or 4 meals.  The taste is not as good as the small cans.  This big tuna can is packed in water.  With the small cans, even though it is packed in water, it is OBVIOUS that the tuna is cooked in the can.  This must be the difference in flavor.  I will stick with the small cans even though more expensive.  I really appreciate the bpa free cans though with all their products and what they stand for.<br /><br />This tuna really would be sufficient for a large gathering.  It is not bad, just not as good as the small cans.

I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" version is not much more than pretty window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.<br />This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to recently.  Thin and yucky.  Sorry, Gevalia fans.  They make a good espresso, though, and the latte and cappuccino choices are much better.<br />Pass on this one if you're not sure and try one of the others.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I became a Tassimo fan about six months ago. I have tried all the different brews they offer including their imported Nabob and Kenco blends, all of which I truly enjoy. However, the Gevalia Signature blend is just perfect for the morning. It is smooth, fragrant, not too rich, and easy to drink more than one cup! This is the t-disc I reach for most frequently.

review/text: I've tried several of the t-disc coffees sold for Tassimo.  I feel this coffee is the best-tasting of them all. It is strong, but smooth and not bitter tasting at all!

review/summary: Gevalia is a ripoff
review/text: I can't believe the ripoff Gevalia is getting away with in this country. Yes, as a coffee it's OK, certainly better than  most coffees sold in the U.S. But then most Americans don't know what good coffee is.<br /><br />My objection is the price. Gevalia sells in markets in Sweden for between 19 and 29 Swedish Crowns, that is, between $2.32 and $3.65 for a half/kilo package, a bit more than a pound. It's the Folgers of Sweden, an average coffee at best. Idiot Americans are willing to pay 6 times the going rate out of sheer lunacy.<br /><br />My wife and I have a second home in Sweden and drink Gevalia there, but it's cheap coffee. If you want your Gevalia but don't like getting ripped off just go to Ikea where it's sold at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Stay AWAY from their membership!!!
review/text: These people are complete morons.PLEASE don't even bother joining up to their membership because they are idiots. First of all, I had a HUGE problem joining because they couldn't match my state and zip code, which is legitimate, and second, the 2 people that answered the phone were foreign and I couldn't understand a word they said and they couldn't understand me. Second, I cancelled my shipments and they charged my card anyway, which resulted in an overdraft fee, and then the next month they charged me AGAIN.I am now on the phone waiting over 10 minutes to talk to a supervisor...and what galls me is that their coffee is not even good.

review/summary: COFFEE IS SO-SO, BAD COMPANY IN MY OPINION!
review/text: DON'T JOIN THIS!  GO BUY THE SWEDISH COFFEE AT IKEA, IT'S JUST AS GOOD!  The 'perk' package when you join is a rip-off, we ended up giving it away.  The coffee is in 8 oz. packages, which makes it the third most expensive coffee in the world.  Trader Joe's is just as good, or spend the money and order Jamacian Blue Mountain. Yesterday I received a box that I didn't order of their "Heritage Blend with Tin", and discovered there was a $36. plus dollar charge on my credit card.  When I calle, (the Phillipines because Gevalia no longer has Americans on their phones) the woman, that I could barely understand, told me they had sent me a postcard 2 weeks ago, which I never got, informing me that it was 'an order as a Club member', and unless I cancelled the order they were sending it anyway.  TOTALLY ILLEGAL IN THE U.S., and when I loudly informed her that was a Federal Offense in addition to credit card and mail fraud, she cancelled my membership and sent a refund to my credit card.  We'll see...but I WILL follow up and file charges against this company.  What was once Good Swedish coffe has turned into a terrible, greedy company.  Whoever created the coffee should be ashamed that it has turned into this. PLEASE DON'T BUY...IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD!  VERY ACID!!

review/summary: My husband's favorite!
review/text: My husband has tried about six different varieties of coffee from the Tassimo and he didn't care for any of them.  He actually thought the machine  was the problem.  Then he tried this brand/blend and he loves it.  It's actually too weak for me, but I like a really strong cup.
