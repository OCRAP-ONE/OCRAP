review/summary: Disappointing for a NV product
review/text: I love Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars and I love chocolate. But these new granola thins are disappointing and not up to the same standards of other Nature Valley products, imo. They're simply granola wafers with chocolate on top and the granola wafers taste old (something that I've never experienced with other Nature Valley products.) To top it off, they're actually expensive in comparison to Nature Valley's other, much better, products. If you want a good granola and chocolate product, try Nature Valley's Crunchy Dark Chocolate bars, which offer a mixture of cocoa and oats, with chunks of dark chocolate. Unlike these, they're delicious!

review/summary: Creates a ridiculous mess
review/text: Between the crumble factor and the extremely messy "chocolate" (which tasted more like MOCK-olate) coating, these snacks are a ridiculous waste of calories, effort and money. The chocolate sticks to the cardboard tray and melts immediately upon contact with your fingers. The bar itself disintegrates all over the place when you bite into it. A terribly executed idea.

review/summary: Taste good but amount of packaging is ridiculous for a 'nature' conscious company!
review/text: I have to say these taste really good but if you have any kind of environmental conscience then you can't help but feel guilty about the unnecessary individual packaging! Each thin is in it's own plastic wrapper and has a thin piece of paper attached. I just feel it's a bit rich when the companies website says 'Enjoy Nature' and they so obviously play on the nature conscious theme. They are tasty but there are other nice things out there so for this reason I won't buy them again.

review/text: These snacks are very good for portion control, half the size of a playing card, so they are small. I could definitely eat more then one, but they do curve the sweet tooth so instead of a piece of candy or soda, opt for this instead. Wish the amount was more then 10 in a box would buy them again, well for on the go.

review/summary: Could they possibly waste more packaging?
review/text: I didn't realize each would be individually wrapped or I wouldn't have bought it, too much waste and too much mess spills when you open. I also don't taste dark chocolate, and it says milk right on the ingredients, so I think they're full of it. I have to eat over the garbage can because everything spills, then wash my hands because the incredibly thin layer of milk chocolate melts immediately. Refrigerated, it's not nearly as bad, but that's silly for a simple snack.<br /><br />As a single, it's entirely unsatisfying. It's so small that it's almost inert, it does nothing to stave off hunger or bring back alertness. They should have packed two to a pack, that would at least put a dent in it, while still being at comparable to all of their other bars; buy one of them instead. Just assume you'll need two at a time. Hey, there's such a thing as too few calories.<br /><br />What amazes me is that the label contains four different sugars: One sucrose, and three different ways of saying maltodextrin. Obviously NV believes consumers are stupid and will gladly try to hide the actual level of sugars (it would be the first ingredient if all four were added together).<br /><br />Note that they've just started selling boxes of 48 instead of 36 in stores, so Amazon might get them soon.

review/text: The "chocolate" is definitely not dark chocolate or even milk chocolate. It's some kind of chocolate cream that just tastes like sugar. I was very disappointed by this fake chocolate. I'm unsure as to the quality of the granola as it's not very filling. Also you get just one thin per pack.<br /><br />I will stick to their Oats 'n Dark Chocolate bars in the future.

review/summary: Delicious but overpriced
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers regarding the price. I just bought a box of 36 at Sam's for $8.98 including tax. I eat two each day, Monday-Friday, so these should last me at least 3 weeks.<br />As for the comments about them being messy, I am convinced that these reviewers are either parents or just plain incompetent snackers. There's nothing difficult about eating them. All you have to do is rip the package down the middle, break off a piece using the package itself if you choose to, pick it up and eat it.<br />If you stick one squarely on your face, you will get chocolate on your face.<br />If you open the package and flip it upside down, you will get crumbs. It's granola pressed together, and it will make crumbs; if you want cardboard, go buy Kashi.

review/text: I am not big on granola so I didn't know if I would like these or not,these things are great! My husband and I bought them from the grocery store and they were 2.98 for a box. So the price of a 3 pack is a horrible price, I would tell everyone to buy from a store instead. The chocolate does melt kind of fast, and it can be messy with crumbs but well worth it to me.

review/summary: Good but no CaliFig
review/text: So right off the bat i should let you know that i have IBS. my symptoms have gradually gotten worse over the years and my doctor(s) have no idea what is wrong with me. My bowels are so irregular that i have been afraid that i'm developing a dependency on my medicines.  When i was in the UK for new years this year i had an episode...a bad one.  Pharmacies in Scotland are a tricky place but very cool since they are more concerned with preventative care then we are.  the dude (chemist) said i should try CaliFig, it's an all natural fig syrup that helps keep you regular.  i bought some and it was like a miracle! Both types of irregularity as well as many of my other symptoms literally disappeared. if i had known that finding it and getting it shipped to the US was so difficult i would have bought a case but alas i foolishly thought it was easy to find i just had never seen it before.<br />When i ran out of the syrup after arriving back home i decided to try this Baar version.  it works but i wont lie to you; not as well. I'll keep using it till i can find a CaliFig source that is not overpriced in shipping. If you have digestion issues of any kind i'd recommend giving this a try: 2 TBL every night!

review/text: This is the stuff to buy!<br /><br />I looked up "Califig"...and that has all sorts of other stuff added: SORBITOL (a sugar), artificial colors, and Sodium Benzoate (which is related to Benzine)<br /><br />If you have digestive issues, I would not put things in my body that will irritate the issue.<br /><br />Ooooo.....Try a ginger, peppermint tea sweetened with fig syrup. That would probably do you really well, if you like the CaliFig.<br /><br />Fig syrup is great for coughs, sore throats, asthma, anemia, catarrh, colitis, gout, and digestive ulcers.<br /><br />I drizzle it over cereal or oatmeal, mix it in with juice....<br />Mix it with milk and it tastes almost like chocolate.<br />yum yum YUM!<br /><br />It is very high in vitamins and minerals..<br />Goolge it!<br /><br />I bought 6 bottles.<br /><br />My kids love it!

review/summary: Gluten Free Goodness :0)
review/text: The Pacific Brand "Cream of" soups are a great replacement for those to have to go gluten free.  The taste is as good or better than the traditional condensed soups.  The only reason it's four stars is that most often, you must add some GF flour or other GF thickener as it can be a tish on the thin side (compared to traditional soups).  Will buy this again and again and so thankful to have found a GF version that is high quality and tastes just as good, if not BETTER!

review/text: I really wanted to love this product since I use a lot of cream of celery soup as sauce and casserole base. Celery is one of the "dirty Dozen" foods that should only be eaten in their organic forms. If I did a blindfold test on this soup, I would have called it a very salty cream of mushrom, with a slightly unpleasant after taste. My original order was a "subscribe and Save, and I neglected to cancel before the second shipment arrived. Ouch! A real disappointment.

review/text: I tried this boxed cream of celery soup in 2 dishes recently and BOTH turned out fabulous.  Although I must admit it is not a very strong flavor of celery, it works just great if you add in one Rapunzel Sea Salt/Herb bouillion cube and some water to 1/2 of the package. Then I just stir it in to my rice or quinoa dish and put a little poultry seasoning in.  BOTH TIMES everyone was WOWED!! (Of course, I added in saut&eacute;ed onions and garlic in one dish and onions, garlic, red peppers and celery in the other dish.)<br /><br />Regardless, I just signed up for the Subscribe and Save for this new Pacific Condensed Cream of Celery Soup, because my husband is not only<br />GF but is allergic to tomatoes (Arrgh...).<br /><br />YAY FOR COOKING WITH SAUCES AGAIN!  THANK YOU AND BLESS YOU, PACIFIC FOODS!  You are on my "A-List" forever!!!

review/summary: The Best Taste and Easiest Prep
review/text: I have been using this product for years and it is marvelous.  Take a (boneless) chicken breast and dredge in the peanut bake mix.  Place any extra mix in the botton of the dish.I place foil over the dish, and then take it off ten minutes prior to the chicken breast being done.  This will condense down the juices that have gathered and make a marvelous sauce to put over mashed/baked potatoes. Watch closely the last five minutes so that it doesn't burn in the bottom of the pan due to sugar in the mix.  This is an easy, easy dish to prep, and it is "company worthy".  It does have a mild to medium spicy (depending on your palette) kick to it.

review/summary: Okay flavor, but awfully sweet
review/text: I love peanut sauce.  I hadn't tried a dried-sauce mix before.  This one has potential; the flavors are not bad underneath.  But the "underneath" is far underneath a lot of sugar.  I finished the original meal I made with the sauce but threw out the second packet in the box.<br /><br />Tastes differ, and clearly, this mix has fans.  I rarely post negative food reviews because many people interpret the criticism personally.  If you know that you like it, then Amazon's price is a bit lower than my local grocery store's where it is sold 2/pack. I'm posting this review to suggest that if you're thinking about buying the box of 12 on the basis of reviews alone--don't.  Try it first.  I've tried many new, locally unobtainable food items on the basis of reviews here, and usually, the reviews are reasonably accurate.  Not in this case.  But this mix is available in my out-in-the-sticks grocery store, so it might be in yours, too.  The sauce mix seems to be more widely available than the peanut bake mix.

When our 2nd shipment arrived it came as small cardboard box with no interior packaging (I mean nothing just a box) and popcorn spilling out of the seems. Gross! I don't know if someone in the shipping room or on route damaged the original grain style sack shown in the Amazon picture(which I also thought was a strange way to ship, but the 1st order was in tack).I'm not even sure if we received the full product. Dissapointment.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the product and would love to hear from Amazon or the company on this one. I'm not sure I trust their shipping on things like this. That's why I had to give it a 3 stars. Had shipping been primo I would have given this product a 5. This is my 1st ever review, hope it's helpful.

review/summary: Our Search For the Best Popcorn
review/text: Having a bowl of popcorn in the evening is a real treat at our house.  We've tried several methods of popping to perfect that just-right, melt in your mouth tenderness.  Seems that letting the steam escape while it pops is a key factor (as in the making of "kettle corn"). And then for a great cooking oil, we like coconut, which doesn't burn, and also imparts a wonderful flavor.  In addition, it is a healthful alternative. But one of the most important ingredients to the perfect batch of popcorn is the raw product itself.  We are delighted with our recent purchase at Amazon of Great Northern Bulk Popcorn, which has to be the most tender we have tried.  This is also an Organic product, and, with free shipping included, made it a real bargain!  SVM

review/text: This is my 2nd 50# bag of Great Northern popcorn that I've purchased.  Most importantly, it's organic!!  The kernels ALL pop nice and big and don't have a lot of the "kernel" left on.  It's very tasty and has become addictive!  It's my favorite popcorn ever.

review/summary: Pops well, tastes great!
review/text: We love popcorn and eat it just about every week.  We've used everything from microwave packages to Redenbacher loose popcorn, but I was looking for a cheaper way to get popcorn in bulk.  At the time I bought this popcorn, I got free shipping with Amazon's SuperSaver shipping.  My cost was .73 cents per pound.  As of today there's a shipping fee, which makes it quite a bit more expensive per pound.<br /><br />The popcorn arrived in a large "feed bag" without any outer box to protect it.  The bag was quite dirty from the UPS man's truck, but I poured it all into a food-grade 5 gallon bucket (available at Lowe's with a gasketed lid) and into a kitchen canister. The popcorn itself was clean and bug-free.<br /><br />I popped some for our weekly movie night, and everyone liked it.  The kernels pop up nice and fluffy, and there weren't many duds in the pan.  50 lbs. should last us a year or more, but we like to stock up on foods we enjoy anyway.<br /><br />Depending on whether or not you can get it with free shipping, this is a good deal on good quality popcorn.  I'll buy it again when this is gone - if they're offering free shipping.

review/summary: Amazon popcorn
review/text: As a popcorn fan I ordered Amazon's 50 lb bag,  popcorn is a good whole food that is easy to fix and easy to eat but besides that I grind it to make a breakfast dish of cornmeal mush cereal, Which is delicious with a little honey and canned milk on it.  From the ground pop corn we also make nourishing corn bread,  An all around good item for your food storage program is popcorn from Amazon. have a good one while I munch my popcorn sprinkled with olive oil and sea salt from Amazon.

review/summary: EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!
review/text: I am very VERY pleased with this purchase.  I purchased 100 lbs last week, and went and purchased another 100 lbs last night because of how happy I am with the purchase.  The kernels are top quality, and being non-GMO to boot!  I have a large popcorn machine that we use a lot, and I couldn't get over the difference in using this corn to the regular kind I usually buy.  The popcorn was fluffier, and really tasty!<br /><br />I am very pleased!

review/summary: It Doesn't Appear to Be Organic...
review/text: This popcorn is non-GMO, which means it isn't genetically modified. Nowhere on the bag does it claim to be organic.  While all organic corn needs to be non-GMO, not all non-GMO corn is organic.  Corn is genetically modified to make it resistant to pests and disease.  Non-GMO corn not grown organically is frequently sprayed with pesticides.  So Great Northern Popcorn needs to make it clear whether or not it is claiming this is an organic product, because the bag doesn't back up what is stated in the Amazon description.  If you search "organic" on the Great Northern Popcorn website, "no results" comes back.  Great Northern...is this corn truly organic, or simply non-GMO?

review/summary: Lawd!  A great taste of Nawlins!
review/text: On a sultry July morning, a few years before Katrina blew into town, a friend and I wandered into the frenetic, powder-sugar dusted Cafe du Monde for an early cup of coffee and the pastries we had heard so much about.  We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district.  It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.<br /><br />The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us.<br /><br />What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, perfectly-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection.  The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans.<br /><br />Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down.  Krispee Kream no longer cut it.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix online.  I ordered several boxes, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox.  When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the beignet mix.  The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price.  Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).<br /><br />Note:  Be sure to follow the directions precisely.  If you do not roll your dough out to the suggested thickness, the beignets will not puff properlly.  Too thin and they will be crispy and flat.  Too thick and they will not puff but will be cakey.  Also, make sure you heat your oil to 370 degrees.  Correct oil temperature is crucial to making golden, ambrosial beignets!  ****  For more information on making good beignets, you might want to visit the Cafe du Monde website.

review/summary: Simplify Making Beignets at Home with this Mix
review/text: This easy to use mix for beignets using the Cafe du Monde recipe produces delicious beignets without a lot of fuss.  It is a simple matter of adding water to right amount of mix from the box and a minor amount of rolling before frying in a shallow pan to create tasty beignets at home.  There is plenty of mix in the box for several small batches.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I love this stuff.<br /><br />Beignets are little puffs of golden fried dough, smothered in powdered sugar. It is difficult to eat a beignet from Cafe Du Monde without getting powdered sugar down your front. They are delicate, melt in your mouth morsels of yummy-ness.<br /><br />If you can get to New Orleans and have the real thing then lucky you. If you are like me and live far away from New Orleans; and if you are craving a good beignet, you can buy this box and whip up your own.<br /><br />You get this box, you follow the directions on the back exactly, don't skimp on the powdered sugar and you will have your own little pockets of yummy goodness in your mouth. Two Notes: First: This is not a calorie free, low calorie, low fat snack. This is something you do for fun with the grandkids, to impress guests, or because you simply don't count calories. Second: Be sure you follow the directions exactly. Cafe Du Monde knows what they are doing and they do it well. Do not try to improve perfection.<br /><br />Worth the money.<br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Short shelf life
review/text: I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father. It arrived quickly, but the expiration date was too soon. For someone used to complete, just add water mixes, I thought this might be a nice change. With such a short expiration date, he didn't feel he would get the time to make this special breakfast before the mix expired. It was a waste of money. I wonder how long this sat on the shelf before it was shipped out.

review/summary: INNOVA-EVO NO GRAIN DOG TREATS
review/text: INNOVA'S EVO dog treats are the best thing that has come along for my dog.  I have a Golden Retriever, who is sensitive to wheat products, therefore I am limited as to what to give for treats.  Most brands of dog treats are made with grains.  Corn and wheat are used in dog treats extensively.  Evo dog treats have absolutely NO GRAIN!  The main ingredients are turkey, chicken, turkey meal, chicken meal, potato, herring meal with numerous vegetables, herbs, supplements to name a few.  Go to the product link <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7A4OK">Innova EVO No Grain Dog Treats (20-oz bag)</a> to see complete listing of ingredients.  Besides being healthy, my dog loves them like no other treat she has ever had.  I buy them by the case as I will buy no other brand.  Try them, let your dog be the judge--he will love you for it!

review/summary: Crumbly tea! What?
review/text: Got this as a Christmas gift as I put it on my wish list. Looked pretty good. Within the price range of family.<br />However, I am used to buying premium tea from other sources. And now I know why and why I will continue to do so.<br />I was first shocked to find that the tea was in shards, crumbled pieces. This takes it down a notch for experienced, premium tea drinkers. It makes one think we're getting the leftovers of the higher grade harvests. When infused, the leaves maintain a flat, crumbled shape, they don't unfold into beautiful leaf structures. I believe this hinders the flavor of the infusion.<br />The flavor? The madarin is very nice. A pleasant, citrus flavor, subtle, delicate. However, it's difficult to detect a very noticable white tea flavor. Contrary to popular opinion, white tea does indeed carry a sweet soft tea flavor. In some ways the citrus notes overpower the tea flavor. Perhaps this is to cover up a lower grade white tea harvest.<br />It's not horrible, just disappointing. But, you get what you pay for and three tins at the price offered, you'll get a lot of cups of tea, just not the best quality. BTW, you can infuse this tea more than once, but if you want to save it in another container in the refrigerator for the next infusion, be prepared to have to scrape it out of the tea strainer because it infuses flat against the screen.

review/summary: Hmmm, well it's almost consistent..
review/text: I've been told that Vita Coco had a strange taste and sure enough I liked it!  I like trying new things and when told about the benefits of this magical drink I bought in.  The 'Natural' way to replenish your fluids etc!  Whenever I drink Vita Coco I 'feel' like it revitalizes me.. or it could be the placebo affect.. however, do believe this tonic works. Just wondering if I can go to the local Asian grocer and pick up a case of the cheaper coconut drinks and get the same affects.  I took a look at a label of a Chinese product and it had DIFFERENT nutritional values.  My guess is that they don't try to hype the nutritional value?  Either way just a consideration for frugal consumers here on Amazon..  sorry for the rant.  I just feel these drinks are pricey and have decided to NOT keep purchasing these drinks as an incorporated regiment in my diet.. OK enough ranting, now review to completion..<br /><br />So signed up with the subscribe and save and received two large cases for several months.  The first shipment was delish!  Quite wonderful taste, refreshing, and as I expected.  Now when I received the second shipment the drink was quite different..  Seemed like there was more sugar and had a strange coconut flavor.  Seemed like someone put some additives to the jungle punch..  Well this has guided me to consider the Asian grocer coconut drinks and to do research on their nutritional benefits.  More than likely will not keep drinking coconut water.. more than likely going to have it sporadically.<br /><br />Happy purchases!

review/summary: Inconsistent packaging and taste - no more!
review/text: Have to agree with other reviewers who have had bad batches.  I signed up for the subscription for once a month.  First few months were great, no problems.  I really like the taste and I loved the container that has the top you can screw back on.  Very convenient for bringing on the tennis courts or working out.<br /><br />Then the trouble began.  One shipment arrived with packaging all torn up and the cardboard soggy from the damaged bottles.  The next shipment looked fine but smelled moldy even before opening the bottles.  Once I did open the bottles, completely sour/moldy tasting.<br /><br />Overall, good taste if it gets to you intact but much too inconsistent with the packaging and quality control.  I cancelled my subscription.  I'll try another brand now.<br /><br />I do have to give kudos to Amazon customer service.  I used the chat function and they were very responsive both times and addressed my issues with a refund.

review/text: This product is good, but it is definitely an acquired taste. I was the only one in my family that would drink it again after the first box. I heard a lot of good stuff about it before I purchased it and honestly thought it would be a little more tasty. Still good. I would buy it again for myself.

review/summary: Not bad, not bad at all!
review/text: So I have several friends that have been talking about how much they love Coconut water, all in far far better shape than I. The Wife and I decided to try NakedJuice brand coconut water one day from the market and all I can say is bleeeeeaaacchhh! The aftertaste was brutal. After seeing all of the good reviews for this brand and feeling like I really needed to tap the benefits of this 'magical' substance, I decided to jump on a subscribe and save deal and bought two boxes of it. Worst case, my friends would gladly take it off my hands if I hated it. Fortunately, I found this brand to be MUCH better tasting, with a bit of sweetness to it. Paid about 1/3 the price I did for the NakedJuice version to boot!

review/text: I have tried a couple of different coconut waters, and I really prefer this one with it's light, fresh taste.

I definitely recommend it!

review/summary: Coco water second review, VITA 17 oz, philippine crap
review/text: Hello friends.  My second Amazon review.<br />Please bare with me, English has been my second language.<br /><br />So anyway, the idea for this second coco-water order was to try to avoid Philippine sources, by ordering the larger 17 oz unit, since my first order included Brazilian sourced mixed-flavor (4 flavors) 17 oz Vitas, which were ok except that i learned that i prefer PURE coco-water by far.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't work, or help any, as they sent me terrible tasting Philippine coconut juice again. Couldn't believe it.<br /><br />[Incidentally: Worse still however, with this second order came the 11 oz Zicos for a try; oh my goodness! I had to throw the whole case of Zicos out, truly undrinkable.  As another reviewer mentioned in one past read-- indeed the taste was much like dirty dish water. More on this product in its review, next.]<br /><br />SO what to do?  I reckon Im close to done with ordering coconut water from here, its such a hassle with every other case being worthless, then having to go without while waiting for the next order to arrive.<br /><br />I cant believe at this point someone hasn't offered "true Brazilian coconuts" or Thailand even, both of which are superior to Philippine sourced coconuts, in my experience.<br /><br />Hope that was helpful, :)

review/summary: Love this stuff. Replaced all other Sports Drinks for me.
review/text: I can't get enough Vita Coco. I use this as a workout drink during and after workout.  This stuff helps me go directly from the weight room out to the baseball field without feeling drained. Coconut water is great because there are relatively few calories and it is not super sweet like Gatorade. I am pretty sensitive to salt and I have found that drinking coconut water before bed helps prevent "salt hangovers". I recommend buying the 17 fl oz boxes because you can take them with you wherever you go and you get way more bang for your buck when compared to the 11.1 fl oz boxes.

review/summary: Great for a beginning runner
review/text: I came upon this product kind of by accident online. I love the taste of coconuts, and I'm really starting to get a pretty regular running regiment going.<br /><br />Because of the heat of the summer, and the fact that I'm unaccustomed to this much exercise, hydration is an important factor. What I'm particularly interested in is the potassium content of coconut water. Vitally important for avoiding cramps, especially when running in the heat. I drink about a third of a carton before a run when it is hot, then chug the rest when I'm done.<br /><br />I love the flavor. It is much better if you drink it VERY cold. I think it's as good as advertised. Only tried one other flavor, the Acai/Pomegranate and it was putrid. I've shied away from everything now but the original. Can't go wrong with just pure coconut water.

I can't find this larger 17 oz size. at first I was a little weary of buying this on amazon after reading some reviews that they received their package with leaks and spoiled drinks. but I decided to give it a try. I ordered 4-12 packs of the regular vita coco drinks. I received the first 2-12 packs. It was packaged well and each individual drink is cushioned with extra cardboard for padding. No leaks whatsoever and the drinks are delicious. I will continue ton buy vita coco from amazon. Fast shipping and great service. Thanks.

review/text: So I bought the 11 ounce and it came nice and tight and we like the coconut water better than the other brands, so I decided to get the bigger 17 ounce version because it had a twist top and I figure easier to store if you don't finish.  turns out the manufactorer didn't do a very good job of putting on that twist top.  they all came off easily like peeling paper.  my advice get the 11 ounce one or the 34 ounce one.  the packagings don't fall apart on those.

review/summary: Tastes a bit like glue..
review/text: I purchased a couple of cases of Vita Coco coconut water on a whim, having heard great things about it from others and having read positive reviews for it online.  First off, for anyone unfamiliar with the product, or coconut water in general.  Coconut water does NOT taste anything like what you'd think.  I mean, come on, coconut water.  Sounds delicious right?  I hear coconut water, see the picture on the box, and imagine myself sitting on a beach banging open a coconut with a rock and drinking the sweet sweet juices inside.  Coconut water, unfortunately, does not match these expectations.<br /><br />When I first tried it, I couldn't quite place the taste.  It wasn't until a student of mine tried it and cringed, made a face, and commented that it tasted like glue that I recognized the flavor..no, I've never tasted glue, but if you taste the Vita Coco you'll understand what I mean.  There's a slightly unpleasant aftertaste as well.  I've never tried any other brand of coconut water, so I don't know if this is specific to this brand, or just what one should expect with all coconut waters.<br /><br />With all that said, the product actually isn't that bad when frozen to a slush.  I froze a half dozen of these and took them to the ball field with me, and after a half hour of baseball, these did a fantastic job of quenching everyone's thirst, with minimal wrinkling of noses.<br /><br />So to sum up, the product, if you are purchasing it primarily for the high potassium content and as an all natural sports drink, does its job admirably.  It rehydrates you and definitely helps in preventing any muscle cramps.  However, if you're thinking about purchasing this merely because it sounds as if it'd taste good, I'd suggest you think twice, or try a single box first to make sure you actually enjoy the taste(I believe they are sold at many supermarkets, I know I've seen them at Whole Foods before).

I'm a traditionalist when it comes to coconut water.<br />Cheaper than O.N.E., and better tasting, for those who grow up drinking coconut water.  If you grow up drinking coconut water, you'll notice the distinct taste between the 2.

review/summary: Perfect drink when you need those electrolytes
review/text: I have to admit, at first I was not a huge fan of the taste of Coconut water.  That opinion changed about halfway through my first drink, when I got acclimated to the salty/sweet taste of the stuff.  It's a really nice beverage when you're tired of sugary workout drinks or need just a slight switch from regular old water.<br /><br />I've used this after workouts and hard nights out, and find that it's perfectly refreshing on any of those occasions.<br /><br />A word of warning though, Coconut water is a diuretic (look it up if you don't know the meaning, it's a fun word to have in the back pocket), so try not to overdo it ok?

The water was slightly sour and it was a real chore for me to finish a 17 ounce container.  I had to brush my teeth after drinking it because the aftertaste was strong.<br /><br />I love almost all things coconut but Vita Coco's beverage is not one of my favorite coconut based products.  I know there are many that applaud the health benefits of this water and I know those benefits are great but this stuff has a terrible taste and I don't care how spectacular those benefits are.<br /><br />This product is produced in Brazil.

review/text: I belong to  a part of India where coconut is part of our staple diet. After moving to the US I had almost given up on the thought of drinking coconut water everyday. Prohibitive costs and availability being the primary reasons. When I saw this deal, i was really happy and ordered it immediately. The first packet came in July, my concierge who collected the packet called me immediately stating there was a leak in the box that had arrived.<br />To my relief only one of the packs had a small leak. The packs were good sized and i knew  instantly that i had a months supply of coconut water.<br />When i chilled it and tasted it, I had mixed views, while it had  distinctive sweet flavor, there was certainly an aftertaste probably coz of the packing. Anyway i developed a taste for it and it was a good month. The shipping of the second package was announced late july. I was later notified that the package had been damaged during shipping. I was refunded my money and no package was sent for the month of august.<br />I received an intimation about the packet for September arriving in late august. Again, it was the same story replayed. My concierge called me to tell me the packet is leaking. I rush down to see this time not 1 but 3 packs are damaged. I decide to return the pack, and i get notified by amazon that i cannot return the product.<br />Well i have cancelled the subscription and now a happy amazon prime customer is dejected with their level of service.

review/text: Buyers beware:  Vita Coco claims to be 100% pure coconut water.  It is not.<br /><br />For years, I've drank fresh coconut juice/milk from a bona fide coconut before, and figured to try and sample conveniently packaged coconut water.  Regrettably, Vita Coco doesn't remotely come anywhere near the quality or likeness.  Real fresh and pure coconut water and juice is clear and mildly flavorful and sweet.  The water from the 17-ounce box that Amazon had shipped to us is of a tainted yellow color in quality and there's an unnatural odor and taste to it. Definitely not what I've been accustomed to drinking.  I can usually tolerate package goods to approximate 80-90% likeness of their fresh-and-natural equivalents, but unfortunately, Vita Coco water did not come close to 50% in quality or taste.<br /><br />Not sure if it's my bad luck or what in receiving a bad batch of shipment, but I am shying away from this brand.  Be careful and good luck in finding real juice.  Real pure coconut juice/milk are awesome and very refreshing, if served cold! Thank you Amazon for refunding me the money.  Amazon rocks, Vita Coco not so much...

review/summary: Catch 22 at Amazon
review/text: Vita Coco coconut water is a wonderful, good tasting, health enhancing product. I really like it, like it very much, drink it all the time. But, as other reviewers have noted, the containers are very vulnerable to bursting in shipment. My few first couple of shipments arrived in perfect shape. But then one container was simply missing from a soggy box two shipments ago. I let that go because everything else was fine. But my most recent shipment never even arrived. UPS declared it "undeliverable" and returned it to Amazon in Indiana (along with a Splenda shipment in the same box). After that . . . nothing. No refund. No replacement. No word from Amazon at all. And no way to contact Amazon to ask for a refund without my agreeing to return the package which they already had received. In my frustration, I have chosen this review to perhaps catch someone's attention at Amazon. I remain a great fan of and a great user of Amazon, but this one time . . . Catch 22. So, to repeat, I think Vita Coco is terrific. It does need better packaging however, so buyer beware. And Amazon, please fix your website so loyal customers like me don't get caught in a cul-de-sac, having to pay for products we never even received.

review/text: Of the package of 12 boxes, 2 were leaking as soon as they arrived, and 4 ended up being dumped down the drain because they were expired despite being stored in the fridge and showing no outward signs of leakage. I would take a swig of a just-opened box of coconut water, only to taste a sour, rancid, carbonated liquid. Let's do the math: I was forced to throw away 50% of what I paid for, meaning I wasted about $13.50. I'm not happy about this, and I resent even more the fact that my health may have been compromised by drinking rotten coconut water.

review/summary: Inconsistent! Some boxes good, some sour ***See appended note!
review/text: I bought a lot of boxes of vita coco from Amazon these past few months due to the sale/special offers lately. 2 boxes (both were the small size) tasted great! (1 carton had a weird taste).<br /><br />I said whatever and bought the larger size. YUCK! I drank the first two and they tasted sour. I compared them side by side with the other vita coco I had (the smaller cartons) and these taste really different. I opened a few more to try, and some were okay, and others sour.<br /><br />UGH. I don't care how good some of these boxes are! If they vary this much, it's not worth it to me to try again.<br /><br />*Edited to add:<br />I emailed vita coco and told them about this and they told me they had a bad batch. The rep then mailed me a free box of 12 cartons. This batch was good! (They sent me some funky flavors instead of the original though...still nice of them).

review/summary: Great product & great service!!
review/text: I can drink a couple of these a day! I am glad the 17oz comes with a cap.  Easier to store them once you open a pack.  I've ordered VitaCoco, One and Zico.  I find VitaCoco brand to have the best flavor.  Best served chilled.<br />I bought three cases of these on Fri and it was at my door step today (Monday) with my prime account.  Had a problem with one of the box.  Upon opening the amazon box, I see that one of the case was already opened and few of packs were damaged and leaking.  I called Amazon right away and they resolved it right away.<br />As the title says, great product and great service! thanks amazon.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Not as good as O.N.E. brand. Has weird taste -- like it came from old coconut, not fresh. Grew up in the tropics so i could tell the difference between a young and old coconut.

review/summary: Best authentic taste ever!
review/text: I grew up in southern India where water from tender coconut is sold by street vendors and it is drunk straight from the coconut. It is the most refreshing drink, containing electrolytes for very hot weathers over there. Gatorade and other artificial drinks are very poor substitutes.<br /><br />After having tried the canned coconut waters available in Asian stores, I had given up on coconut water for a decade until I chanced upon these. They are expensive, but it is amazing that one could bottle "authenticity"! No artificial additives, no sugars, no pulps, nothing!<br /><br />It is so good that I don't want to try the mixed varieties that they have. Nothing but pure coconut water for me.

review/summary: Great taste! Best brazilian coco water out there.
review/text: I prefer this resealable package over the 11oz..and by the way, the other reviewers are mad!<br />Perhaps they have never had fresh BRAZILIAN coco water before and are used to asian coco water which is sugary and watered down and completely industralized. I am from north of Brazil and can tell you this is what fresh young brazilian coconut water should taste like.<br />And how can anyone complain about the packaging? Makes no sense. Who could dislike a resealable, environmental friendly package!?<br />Overall, I am very satisfied and will continue to order this brand on subscribe and save. 3 boxes a month.

review/summary: Love this stuff!!!!
review/text: I love Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, especially on a hot day. It is the best "sports drink" you can get, because it does "hydrate every cell in your body." It is a pure, unadulterated, unmanipulated healthy drink, that perks you up. The 17oz. size is handy to take along in the car or pack for lunch. Great for leg cramps cuz of the high potasium content. Better than a banana and less calories. Better than water - totally quenches thirst!!!

review/summary: Can't Beat The Quality or Price
review/text: In response to a previous reviewer who questioned the potassium content of the coconut water, please see the product description: "High in potassium, fat free, cholesterol free, and low in acidity, no sugar, Contains five essential electrolytes--potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous" -- which makes coconut water a superior pre- or post-workout drink compared to other popular sugar-laden, artificial color-added ones (you know who you are).  I drink my Vita Coco chilled either right from the box to quench my thirst after a long run or I mix it into a delicious, awesomely nutritious smoothie with frozen bananas, papayas, strawberries, mangoes...whatever fruit you have on hand.  You can also make a super-nutritious green smoothie by simply adding a tablespoon of Greener Grasses or Vitamineral Green to a cup of the coconut water and giving it a good whirl in the Vita-Mix.  Excellent!  And with Amazon's free shipping and subscription discounts, the value can't be beat.

review/summary: From someone who grew up on coconut milk/water!!!!!
review/text: I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, "Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is". Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all', not even from an over-ripe coconut. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY.<br /><br />My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, "OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like. And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then they could also market the meat of the coconut.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we know Vita CoCo is using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare her daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)

review/summary: Three spoiled cases--Oct 2012 exp
review/text: I just love Vita Coco coconut water and have been buying it locally for several years---I like the mild flavour and love drinking it after a workout. I recently moved to a more rural area and found that the price on Amazon was much better than what I could get at my nearby grocery store. I normally purchase the 11.1 oz boxes but decided that the best price was to be had on the 17 oz tetrapak. Unfortunately, my first case arrived a week or so ago and I was absolutely appalled! The coco water was virtually undrinkable. It was very sour, slightly discolored, and nothing like the drink to which I'd become accustomed. I immediately contacted Amazon, and they agreed to ship me another box at no charge. The second case was similarly poor in quality. I told Amazon that I'd like a refund so that I could order a different size. The case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> just arrived, and it has been only marginally better in taste, if at all. I don't know if Amazon is storing the coconut water improperly, if Vita Coco has produced a bad batch (they all have exp dates in October of 2012), or if they've somehow altered their source or coco water/Vit C mixture (all boxes say they are produced in the Philippines). I plan to contact Vita Coco directly to find out the problem, and will also be requesting a third refund from Amazon. These boxes taste so bad that I plan to pour them all down the sink in order to recycle the tetrapaks. Very disappointed.
