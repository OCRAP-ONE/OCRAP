review/summary: Senseo - a nice smooth coffee
review/text: I've been buying Senseo since I first had it in a casino about two years ago.  It has a nice smooth flavor -- not like some of those popular overroasted "burnt" tasting products.  I'm buying this on Amazon's subscription plan and will continue for awhile.  My first order was offered at a wonderful price (a teaser?), but the last two orders have been comparable to what I would pay at the supermarket. I do like the convenience, however, of having it delivered to my door because it is not always in stock at the supermarket and I hate having to hunt down my favorite products.

review/summary: Senseo Coffee Pods
review/text: Buying coffee this way is a little pricier than just ground coffee for a standard coffee pot, but it has actually saved us bundles.  My son and husband always wanted specialty coffees, e.g. Starbucks, 7-Eleven.  Now they can fix their own specialty coffees at home.  My son commented just this week that getting the Senseo coffee maker was one of the best things we ever did, and that's after using it for over a year.  It's more than just a novelty.

We enjoy the full taste of expresso like coffee and the smooth foamy texture you get from the senseo coffee maker.  Its like having your own gourmet coffee shop in your home every morning.

review/summary: More options for my Senseo
review/text: I love my Senseo, and I am thrilled to have flavor options for it.  Personally I am not much for flavored coffee, and I prefer the dark roast, and that is what I drink myself most of the time.  One of my favorite things about the Senseo is how easy it is to make everyone a different cup of coffee.  The decaf folks can have decaf, the regular can have regular.  Now the ones who like flavor can have flavor.  I will definitely always have the flavored Senseo Pods in stock in our home so that we have them to offer guests.  They love it.<br /><br />Of the new flavor options for the Senseo, the Hazelnut is my personal favorite.  While the dark roast is my everyday cup still, after dinner, I now often grab one of these.  If my husband isn't in the mood for hazelnut, it doesn't matter.  It is a Senseo, he can have whatever he wants in his cup.

review/summary: New Senseo Pods
review/text: I just tried the new Vienna (hazelnut flavored) Senseo pods.  I'm not a big flavored coffee drinker, but I just wanted to try something different.  It's a really nice cup of coffee.  The flavor isn't too strong - which I like.  I also like the combination of the different flavors (hazelnut, chocolate, etc.).  I had tried the folgers flavors but they are way too artifical tasting - can't hardly taste the coffee.  If you want to try somthing differnet in your Senseo machines, you should check these out.

review/text: When I searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn't so good.  Granted I am not an avid coffee drinker,however I really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won't burn a hole in my stomach.  I usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup.  If anything - needs a little more of the flavor (i.e. hazlenut, vanilla) added to it.  But still very good.

All of these cook books recommend using high quality ingredients, such as the Valrhona cocoa.  I would never usually find this product at the store and am happy to see that I can easily purchase it on line.  It is clearly a bit more expensive but worth it!  There is a subtle yet noticeable difference in the finished product.  I am glad I bought this cocoa and will continue to use it in the future.

review/text: I use this in anything with Chocolate being the main focus. I have used Hershey's in the past because that is all I can get in town but it wasn't giving me that really rich chocolate bite that I wanted. My chocolate cupcakes seemed kind of flat. I ordered this and the difference in color alone, kind of surprised me. Valrhona is a lot darker. In my opinion it is well worth the extra few dollars. Hershey's is about $7.50 for a lb and this was $13. That $5.50 made the difference between people saying my cupcakes were good to saying they were awesome.

For the same price, you can get almost three lbs of ghirardhelli cocoa powder, which tastes decent enough. Valrhona is nice to have but I just don't feel like it was worth the hassle and expense. Ghirardhelli works good enough for me. Other than cost, Valrhona is very good! If you can justify the cost it is delicious.

review/summary: It Delivers...
review/text: I'm an avid road cyclist and have been using Cytomax for about the past three years. It does appear to make good on its claims of reduction of perceived exertion and longer sustaining of energy levels. I've sufficiently experimented with other products to be able to determine, for me at least, that the benefits obtained from Cytomax are not a placebo effect.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who've stated that the salutary effects of Cytomax tend to be especially noticeable during hot weather.<br /><br />The consensus among several of my fellow local riders is that the Tropical Fruit flavor is by far the most palatable, and I have to agree; I personally noted very little difference in taste when the manufacturer began using Stevia as a sweetener. It's light, and never cloying, even when I increase the concentration a bit for very hot days. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Definitely notice a difference when cycling
review/text: I have only used the tropical fruit, but I absolutely love this flavor! I just started using it in the last couple of weeks, so I cannot attest to the old recipe.  However, performance wise, I start drinking a 1/2 scoop per 12 oz of water (according to the company 1 scoop = approx. 3 TBL) a few hours before I'm going to exercise, and keep up the 1/2 scoop regiment probably every hour before I actually exercise. Usually I don't like to drink any fluids while I'm exercising as it upsets my stomach, but I do take a few sips of this drink during the ride, (for the ride, I do 1 1/2 scoops per 16 oz of water) and I feel it definitely helps my performance.  There were times prior to using Cytomax where I felt completely fatigued at the 13th mile of a 15 mile challenging bike ride. But after I started using this stuff, I felt fine at the 13th mile and even felt like I could another 7 miles.  I've had no stomach issues either.  I do 15 mile moderate and challenging bike rides approximately 5 times a week.

I use Cytomax exclusively.  I've tried others - Hammer, Gatorade, Accelerade, etc, but find Cytomax best for me.  It's easy on my stomach and not and provides the needed energy/electrolytes for long rides.  My personal preference is to do 1 1/2 scoops per water bottle rather than the 2 that they reccomend because 2 scoops makes it too sweet for me.  The deal on Amazon is great for the 4.5 lb container too!

Pomegranate Berry is a little on the sweet side, but all in all it is a great product.  Purchased as a subscribe and save and it is very well priced.<br /><br />The only negative to Cytomax is it doesn't dissolve well in cold water.  So, mix your drink with tap temperature water and refrigerate ahead of time.  I usually prepare mine immediately after my run so it is always ready.

review/summary: Fresh Apple it Isn't
review/text: The CytoSport energy drink is a helpful sports supplement. It does give a noticeable boost to help power through intense hour long cardio classes such as Spinning, Cardio Kickboxing and Zumba. There has been overall improvement in fitness, performance and an ability to increase workout frequency & time from using this supplement. It definitely helps in post workout recovery, little to no muscle soreness. Beats the muscle burn from Spinning and Kickboxing.<br /><br />I have previously used the Pomegranate flavored powder and it tastes more like 1980's Red Kool Aid punch than Pomegranate.<br /><br />The Fresh Apple flavored Cytomax is supposed to be a green apple flavor. Unfortunately, it tastes strongly of plastic with a hint of green apple. I would return it if I could.<br /><br />Also, if you use a sports bottle that holds 24 oz. count on using two scoops of the powder per bottle fill.<br /><br />The Cytomax works better if you drink a small amount 15 minutes before your workout, as directed.

review/summary: Not as good as original formula
review/text: "New" cytomax formula doesn't taste quite as good as original, but still not bad.  New formula doesn't mix as well, tends to clump and settle on bottom of bottle.  Requires frequent shaking to adequately mix.  Product does seem to work well for hydration, electrolyte replacement, and lactic adic buffering.

review/summary: Live off of this stuff
review/text: First off, Tangy Orange tastes like sh imho. Tropical Fruit hands down. Lived off this stuff for a little over a year now. Tropical Fruit got me through crazy work. Canvassed door-to-door seven to eight hours a day rain or shine, excessantly drank almost every day for a while, worked out and exercised like a monster or beast, and most recently been working as a server for nonstop four to six hour shifts continually active.<br /><br />This is my recover-all cure-all push-on-all. Co-workers always ask me what the hell I'm drinking, sarcastically joke I'm drinking/taking drugs, but most directly, always tell me to slow down. Without this stuff, I wouldn't be able to be the me I really am, high-energy, high-energy spending, high energy to be calm, and high energy to be active. Friend used to tell me about this stuff way back at least 10 years ago, and now I know what he means. If you have any questions leave me a comment below. -Alvin

review/summary: Experience performance and recovery improvements.
review/text: I used to drink this stuff when I had triple days (3 practice a day for 11 days straight) in college water polo.  I didn't drink this the first year and despite eating enough and drinking lots of water, I was exhausted.  The following year I drank the Cytomax just as directed I noticed my recovery was much improved as way my overall performance.  I don't compete at the same level anymore, but I still notice the benefits in my daily workouts. The taste is great as well when mixed correctly.  Even if it's a little watered down, it still tastes better than water alone.

review/text: I used Cytomax for about a month and didn't like it.  It gets great reviews from the majority of people that use it & I beleive most of them are cyclists & long-distance runners.  I play hockey, do interval sprinting, & weight training so I thought it would be good for me. I guess it was okay, but I find for my type of training that Gatorade G-2 PRO Series works better.  I do NOT use the pre-workout or the post-workout G-2 PRO Series, I use just the "Perform" which is for during the workouts. I have other supplements that I use for pre & post workout. The Seller, Shipping & Price Get 5 STARS *****.  The product, for me particularly & my experience gets 2 Stars.

Also I switched it from FRS, which is also good but the citros powder on the FRS seemed to stay longer on your mouth, not this one.  Mixes very well too-fast with no lumps.

review/text: I have been a loyal user of the Cool Citrus flavor for years, but recently tried the Fruit Punch in the new formula. The old formula Cool Citrus always had a bit of a soapy taste, but the flavoring was good, much better than gross Accelerade. I don't notice any soapiness with the new formula Fruit Punch, nor do I find it to have any kind of off-taste, which I normally notice with artificial sweeteners. I have always been a fan of Cytomax due to its lack of sugar in favor or more complex carbohydrates, plus the easy mixing. Many people swear by Accelerade, but the foul taste, pour mixing, and crazy amount of foaming have always turned me off. Looks like I will stay a Cytomax user with the new formula.

review/summary: Absolutely THE best athletic performance drink on the market
review/text: As a family, we started using Cytomax while training for a backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon, back in the Winter/Spring of 2006.  It was recommended to us by the owner of the local high-end bicycle store.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and the drink doesn't leave you with that cotton-mouth feeling that even water can produce, especially when it's hot.  I'll warn you up front, this stuff is addicting.  Once your body gets a taste of it, you WILL NOT exersise again without it. In fact, just the smell of the powder while you're mixing it will trigger a pavlovian response that you suddenly have the urge to go do something strenouos, and, you just want a huge drink of Cytomax.  Weird, I know, but true.<br /><br />About the flavors.  We've found the Cool Citrus to be the smoothest, truest, taste.  Sort of a nice lemonade flavor.  To us, all of the other flavors have some sort of a weird before, or after taste.  For example, the Tangy Orange has sort of a powdery thing going on.  The fruit flavors like the punch and the grape have a perfume thing going on.  We haven't tried the apple or the chocolate, and won't.<br /><br />I'll be honest and say that I'm not loving the "Natural" and now I see it's coming with "Stevia" as the sweetner.  Haven't tried the stevia version yet, and really, I'm not interested.  Personally, I don't think the "natural" is as good as the original, definately doesn't taste as good.<br /><br />Now for my "Cytomax Story."<br /><br />In August of 2006 we did our first backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon.  We didn't drink anything but Cytomax.  It was brutally hot down in the gorge, and being first timers, we not only brought a ton of stuff, but we brought a ton of heavy stuff.  We just about got laughed off the shuttle bus because our packs (especially mine) were so stupid huge.  Seriously, picture a Low Alpine 75L pack filled to the brim, to the point that it has to be bear hugged, lifted up onto a rock, and then backed into, in order to put it on! What can I say, we were rookies.<br /><br />The cytomax kept us alive and well, but the real story is that during the hike out, we came across a young couple on the Bright Angel Trail, somewhere below 3mi House.  As is typical for the Bright Angel, they were in tank tops, tennis shoes, no hats, and had come down with a 16oz bottle of water, each.  It was 100*F+, and the girlfriend was broke down on the side of the trail with heat stroke.  The boyfriend was talking about how he was going to run to the top to get her a soda.  She was angrily complaining about what she would and wouldn't drink (one of the signs of heat stroke is lack of good judgement).  I filled her 16 water bottle with Cytomax, and told her she could drink it, or wait for a helicopter.  She decided to drink, and in about 10 minutes her lights came back on.  We gave them both some snacks that we had, saw them one more time at one of the other rest houses, and I think they beat us out to the top!  Seriously, that's how great Cytomax is.<br /><br />We use it year round now, for whatever exersise or sport we are doing, whether individually, or as a family.  It's gone with us to the Grand Canyon, 5 years in a row, including just last week where my 70 year old mom went with us, rim-to-rim in 3 days, fueled by Cool Citrus Cytomax!

review/summary: Energy!
review/text: I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that.

review/summary: Good Hydrations
review/text: I've used Cytomax for the past couple of years now and have found it to be the best rehydration product I've used. Everyone is different but this product has by far worked the best for me at keeping myself going on those long or difficult rides, hikes, cross country ski and snowshoe outings. This also helps to prevent cramping and bonking on those hot humid days when your tend to lose more fluids. I've only had the cool citrus flavor as that is the flavor I've used for years with other hydration products as well, and the flavor though a bit sweet for me is more than acceptable. While cycling I always alternate between a bottle of Cytomax and one of water. For other activities where I carry only one bottle I use a little less the recommended amount of powder per X ounces of water. This product like others like it, require a bit more time to mix than the original hydration powders, but it's more than worth the few extra seconds it takes to get it to properly mix.

review/text: Here in Louisiana, we get hot during the summer. I started taking Cytomax about 10 years ago when I was preparing for a 100 mile ride. I trained for months riding longer and longer distances but would deplete my bodies energy. I would just run out of gas and cramp. With Cytomax, I was able to extend my miles without cramping. Because of the expense, I tried many other brands but for my body, Cytomax was the best.

Remember, never put this kind of stuff in a WATER bladder!<br /><br />I would/have suggested this to friends.

review/summary: BIG ON CYTOMAX
review/text: I am a really big fan of most sports drinks.  I had favored Powerade before I tried Cytomax and now Cytomax is all I take.  I had never tried the Pomegranate Berry flavor before and NOW I am very glad that I did.  Not just for the electrolyte balance and replacement of necessary nutrients but for the taste also. My wife and daughter, that don't usually even like any of the products, LOVE this one.  My wife told me she thought it was blackberry tea which I must admit is what it almost tastes like.<br />Great product!

review/text: This product is the same great product it has always been. These people who are slamming the product have no idea what they are talking about. Most of the poor reviews are posted by people who work for other companies who wish they had created Cytomax. There is not a better product on the market that literally and completely defeats any and all lactic acid buildup in your muscles. I would have paid twice this much too have had this product when I was still bodybuilding and powerlifting. Now my workouts consist of bike riding, Muay Thai, boxing and some light to medium circuit weight training. Cytomax never fails to alleviate the lactic acid build up from any and all of my workouts. I think it tastes great. These whiners are lucky they do not have to drink the swill that us older athletes had to drink back in the 70's & 80's when your only choice was Weider products or making your own shakes at home (which was the best option)

review/summary: New formula fails
review/text: I started using Cytomax back around 2001, and it was the most amazing sports drink I had ever had. Taste, performance, ease of use; it had it all. I read the reviews here discussing a formula change, and went ahead and gave it a shot. I'm halfway through my newest container, and it's just not working. The taste is subtly off, and viscosity/texture of it is subtly off as well. Finally, and I have no way of explaining this at all, I think it actually gives me a light headache when I'm drinking it. Performance-wise, I think it generally still works, in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts. But I don't like drinking it. All said, I will never buy it again. I will test out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054S4HMK">Accelerade Lemon Lime 60 servings</a> and hammer products, etc, and see which one is the best, and go with that. New formula fails.

So instead of feeling just sore, I feel more loose.  I drink one shake about 15 minutes before my workout and this stuff just gives me the fuel to keep me going.  I highly recommend this product.  I bought the 4.5 lb container and it lasts a long time.  Just one scoop (scooper provided) is all you need.  The orange flavor is great too, my kids (5 and 3) always want a sip before I drink it down.

review/summary: Didn't work for me
review/text: This product did not work for me. I live in New Orleans and purchased this product with the intent of increasing my electrolyte intake during/following my Crossfit workouts. We workout in a renovated warehouse w/o AC, so it's hot and I lose TONS of liquid/electrolytes daily.<br /><br />I think that there are a few reasons that this product did not work for me.<br />1) I was using it for Crossfit, not bike riding. The advertisement of this product mainly states that it's for riders.<br />2) I eat about 90% paleo. There is simply way too much sugar in this product for my body. It literally made me exhausted because my body was spending so much energy digesting the sugar.<br /><br />So, I am not sure whether or not this is a good product. I have friends who love it who ride for triathlons and Iron Man events. A few of them use a more natural product called Nun (noon: not sure of the correct spelling), which they say is amazing. All I can tell you is that if you're like me and don't take in a lot of processed sugar...ever... this will send your body out of whack.

review/summary: Tastes great?  Really?
review/text: OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not "taste great".  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.  Additionally, if you live in a humid locale, like I do, it has a short shelf-life once opened, turning quickly into a big rock.  Buy a size that will get you through a month.  You might pay a little more for three 1.5lb containers, but that's better than throwing away half of a 4.5lb because it soaked up all that moisture and is now useless.  Yep, I've been there.  Grrr.  Get the big bottle if you are an animal, share with others, or live in Colorado.  Where it's dry.  Now go ride!

review/summary: Tastes nasty
review/text: I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.

review/text: GREAT just dandy Frickin' Cytomax uses carmine as a color additive. Here's how carmine is made:<br /><br />To prepare carmine, the powdered scale INSECT BODIES are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum is added to the clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt, called "carmine lake" or "crimson lake."<br /><br />Carmine is insect soup. Yummy!<br /><br />For crying out loud Cytomax. take the danged bugs out of your mix!<br /><br />And AMAZON posts what appears to be a list of ingredients that does not list carmine.<br /><br />Cytomax, most of us are adults and aren't overly concerned with color of our drink. We are not children squawking about the color of our kool-aid being off and refusing to drink it.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about Cytomax, besides the bug soup, it would be the color is ridiculous! Who needs such a fluorescent orange color to drink it!

review/summary: Engineered for Runners, Cyclists and Athletes of all types...
review/text: As a distance runner, I have been a dedicated user of Cytomax since 1994. It's smooth, tastes great and delivers an even dose of the right blend of carbohydrates to help sustain energy levels. More importantly, it doesn't leave me with a "sugar crash" the way that some other popular name brands do.<br /><br />The effect of Cytomax and reduction of perceived exertion/lactic acid buildup is evident anytime; however, it is most pronounced during summertime, when the body is working harder during longer training sessions. I would recommend following the product's directions to consume this before, during and after the training periods to obtain maximum effect.<br /><br />Before the advent of the Internet and E-Commerce, I had tried others that were popular and commercially available, when I could not obtain Cytomax. Even recently, I obtained a sample of the EAS equivalent, which was highly touted. The bottom line is that all else pales in comparison to this product.

review/summary: Cytomax, a runners best friend.
review/text: I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now.  I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough.  It really does beat the burn.  The percieved exertion levels, the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package.  I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep (i.e. 3-5 hrs) and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated.  It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates.  I have been encouraging other fellow runners, triathletes, cyclist, backpackers, mountaineers, etc to try the product and have recieved similiar feedback.  Many nice climbing/outdoor gear shops have the individual packets available if you wanted to demo the product.

review/summary: Bring back Cytomax Classic!!!
review/text: Remember when Coke came out with their new formula. It was a disaster for them. The company finally relented and brought back the original formula after losing significant market share. This is the same situation. I have been using this drink for years (Cool Citrus and Tropical Fruit) and I have been very happy with it. I am even subscribed to these mixes through Amazon's subscription program. I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption "Now with Stevia". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy.

review/text: I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars.

I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it.  That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else.

review/summary: New Formula, 2 thumbs down
review/text: I have been using go-grape for years.  This new formula really sucks. Give me the old formula back. I will have to find a new flavor now.

review/summary: Definitely reduces cramping while giving you energy
review/text: I've been using Cytomax while bicycling for about 10 years and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Before Cytomax, I mainly used Gatorade and I would often get very painful leg cramps on long rides, especially on hot days. Since switching to Cytomax, I get cramps only occasionally, usually when I'm not drinking enough.<br /><br />I mix 1.5 measures of Cytomax in a 24 ounce water bottle, which is less than the recommended amount. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that Cytomax doesn't dissolve easily, but if you should not have a problem if you add the Cytomax to a bottle that is half filled with water so that it doesn't clump, then shake the bottle vigorously, and then add water to fill the bottle. Before drinking give the bottle a few shakes to distribute anything that's settled to the bottom.<br /><br />Taste is the most important thing when selecting an energy drink. Whatever your choice, it doesn't have to taste great, but it does have to be acceptable. If you don't like the taste, then you probably won't be drinking enough and your performance will definitely suffer as a result. I use the Cool Citrus flavor. Over the years, I've gotten samples of other flavors, some of which were OK and some that I did like at all. So if you're unsure about the flavor, try to get a sample from someone before you buy a 1.5 or 4.5 pound container.<br /><br />On long rides, I carry two bottles on my bike. For very long rides, I'll also carry zip lock bags with measured amounts of Cytomax so I can refuel as needed.<br /><br />In Summary: A great product.

review/summary: Easy on the stomach, tastes great
review/text: I bought Cytomax as fuel for a 50K (31 mile) run I went on.  Gatorade is rough on my stomach, even when I dilute it, but I had no problem with the Cytomax full strength.  It's thicker than most sports drinks, a lot more like drinking juice.  I thought it tasted great, but the important thing was being able to stomach it on the long haul.<br /><br />It was noticeably helpful.  I did one six mile loop without a drink along from miles 15-21, and I crashed for the last 2 miles of that loop.  Some Cytomax and Oreos and I was recovered and ready to pick the pace back up in 15 min.

review/summary: Did not know they had changed the formula
review/text: The new formula is horrible.  Gave me bad, BAD stomach issues the entire day after taking it.  So I tried it again just to make sure.  Yep, same thing.  Stevia is NOT natural, and should not be marketed as such.  If I wanted caffeine, I would have bought one of the 1000+ caffeinated supplements out there.  Very disappointed in both the manufacturer and in the seller for not pointing out the change in formula.

review/summary: New formula might be crap.
review/text: I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.<br /><br />I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.<br /><br />This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.<br /><br />Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan.

review/summary: New formula isn't nearly as good as the old
review/text: A year ago I bought the Citrus flavor and it was quite good! But recently I bought the "new formula" doesn't dissolve nearly as well! (it clumps and sticks to the glass/water bottle) and its taste leaves much to be desired!  I'm really disappointed in the new formula and I wouldn't recommend it!
