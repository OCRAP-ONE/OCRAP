review/text: My celiac teenager loves these.  Now in high school he does not want to carry the thermos lunches I used to always make for him so these fit in the back pack and he can get something healthy and that tastes great to get him through the day.  I love the protien and omega 3 extra he gets too!!

review/summary: Almond cashew + omega 3 Snack Bar
review/text: This is a nice snack.  It looks fairly healthy.  It's tasty and filling, especially with a cup of tea.  It is pretty chewy and loaded with nuts.  The almonds are on the hard side, in case you have trouble chewing.  The bar is mostly nuts with some cranberries and something that tastes like a date paste holding it all together.  It tastes a little on the sweet side but not too bad.  The wrapper claims 50 % each of vitamins B3, B6, B12 - 500 mg Omega 3, all natural, gluten free, wheat free, 4 g fiber, non GMO (sorry, don't know what that means), no trans fats, 150 calories per bar/80 from fat.  Total fat 9g, o sodium, o cholesterol, 190 mg potassium, 16 g carbs (I think--wrapper hard to read), 14g sugar, 4 g protein<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent snack for you or your children's lunch box, here ya go.

review/summary: Hard to believe it's good for you
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)

review/text: These appear to be pretty healthy online and after the taste test and review of the ingredients I was pretty satisfied. They could hold off on some of the sugar/glucose, maybe unsweetened cranberries. Don't get me wrong, they are pretty tasty and mostly healthy but just a bit too sweet. A little tweaking and it could be the best "healthy" snack I've eaten.

I should have known that you get what you pay for. This was the most unsatisfying Kind bar I've ever had. It's dry and lacks taste. Now I'm stuck with a whole box.

review/text: I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a "Low glycemic" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption.

The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum.

review/text: May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]

review/text: If you've got sensitive blood sugar, DO NOT eat Kind bars. They are certainly not Kind. I crashed on them a few times before I realized their "glycemic index" numbers were false and misleading. They pump a lot of sugar into these bars and then juke the numbers.

review/summary: Why would anyone buy these?
review/text: I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like "gluten free" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.

review/summary: Totally delicious
review/text: These bars are great and truly a 5 star product. Some of the nuttier varieties from Kind are a little hard on your teeth, no worries like that with these. Nice soft, chewy, tasty. Best fruit/nut or granola bar I've found. Downside, a little on the pricey side and a little high in saturated fat. But the perfect sweet "healthy" natural treat, and gluten free, a wonderful plus. You can really taste the mangoes and the macadamia nuts. A nice balance of both. These bars have calcium added but you cannot taste it, they just taste delicious.

Also, it is a delicious bar and barely impacts my blood sugar so makes a great on-the-run snack.  Note: I don't taste the peanut butter at all. I like peanut butter so was a bar disappointed but the bars are still tasty.

review/summary: price v. value: five stars, even with the peanuts
review/text: UPDATE: The five stars are for the almond-walnut-macadamia bars, peanuts and all. I gave the cashew-almond-omega3 bars a try later and was somewhat disappointed with them. Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price.

review/summary: One of the best KIND varieties
review/text: Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.

Just be advised that compared to the Fruit and Nut variety which, if you hold one sideways, will actually slowly fold over, these are thicker and MUCH more solid.  If you have sensitive or loose teeth or maybe dentures, be forewarned.  You should take your bites with your molars or break off a piece by hand just to make sure your chompers can handle it.

review/summary: Delicious & Healthy!
review/text: I have tried a number of the Kind bars at this point because I have basically fallen in love with their line of products. It started with a Cranberry Almond one from Starbucks and since then, I have started buying several boxes every month. I don't like dark chocolate very much but thought I would give the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar a try this time around.  I'm glad I did! Delicious and not at all bitter like I expected. It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.  Strong excellent flavor and loaded with healthy grains, nuts, etc. Overall, I have been very pleased with Kind and will continue to buy their products as long as they remain available.

review/summary: KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Bars
review/text: This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only....these are so good that I had to quit buying them so often because I would eat the whole box in 2 days! These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of "healthy" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!

I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste "off" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(

review/summary: Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste
review/text: On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.

The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!

They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

review/summary: Dark Choc is the dominant flavor; lots of crunch and chewiness
review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

review/summary: Delicious, but wait until fall...
review/text: These bars were delicious. The nuts were great, the honey flavor came through, and the dark chocolate was spot on. The only problem was the texture - I ordered these in the middle of summer & the chocolate had melted & wandered around in the wrapper. I hope to have better results ordering these in winter.

review/text: These bars are absolutely delicious.  I have steered clear of any of the so-called fiber bars, snack bars, etc., because honestly they all tasted like stale cereal to me.  These are completely different--no cereal similarities at all.  They are all nuts and fruit.  It's hard to stop at one!  Try them; you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

I was looking for a bar that has a low sugar content, and this one fits the bill better than the others. I eat one of these bars each morning! They are packed with whole nuts, and are absolutely delicious. I chose to receive these through Amazon automatic delivery because it is less expensive than what I was paying per bar in the "Organic" section of my local supermarket.

review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!

review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Market has a display of Kind Plus bars and I find it difficult to pass without picking one up. I like the nutritional specs and the low sugar content of the bars. Plus they're quite good tasting. I often have one as desert with my evening meal, as is the case tonight. This one was Almond Cashew with Flax. It was good, but I didn't care for it as much as several others. The chocolate one is my favorite. In any case, this is a good bar with good nutrition.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

review/text: I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/text: Clearly, no one would accuse Simply Fiber Cereal of being the best tasting cereal in the world.  After all, it contains no sugar or other unhealthy ingredients to make it taste "good."  However, mixed with a little fruit (I like raspberries or blueberries) and a handful of almonds, it is actually very good.  And, for what it may lack in the flavor department, it more than makes up for in terms of promoting good health.<br /><br />I lost 35 lbs. eating this cereal as the "cornerstone" first meal of the day (with a handful of almonds and fruit mixed in along with a cup of skim milk).  I feel full and energized until well into the afternoon each day.  It is incredibly high in fiber (14 grams per serving), which promotes longevity and good health in countless ways.  I buy it by the case.  Great Stuff!

review/summary: Not much taste, but that makes it a versatile food
review/text: Simply Fiber's taste (or lack of taste) is one of its strengths, in my opinion. I have it with fruit, cinnamon, and powdered stevia for breakfast. But it's also great as croutons in salad, tossed into soup, and crushed and used as a kind of breadcrumb substitute. Add it to a variety of foods to get your fiber. Much cheaper here on Amazon than in my local health food store.

review/summary: Looks like dog food and tastes like cardboard, but...
review/text: Stays crunchy longer in milk than many other cerials.  So, what I do is mix it 50/50 with Craklin' Oat Bran and dump some dried blueberries on it and I've got a very healthy and great tasking breakfast.<br /><br />Seriously, I think this is a great product, especially for the price, but I'd recommend not eating it straight unless you find you just love the taste.  Try mixing it with other cerials you like in order to get your extra fiber in the morning.

review/summary: We call it "Hamster Food."
review/text: I don't expect my breakfast cereal to be sugary.  I didn't grow up eating Sugary Sugar-sugars for breakfast and, frankly, very sweet cereals have little appeal to me.  Even so, this cereal is pretty disgusting.<br /><br />I bought it because I wanted to include more fiber in my diet, to keep things running a little smoother, if you know what I mean.  I've bought a couple other fiber cereals lately, but I happened to be at a grocery store that carried this one--which I hadn't seen before--so I decided to try it out.<br /><br />I do like the short ingredient list; that's great.  However, this cereal has so little flavor that it is almost inedible.  I have eaten it with berries a couple times, and that really improves the flavor.  On the box it calls the shapes "Crunchy O's", and the picture makes the cereal look like long, grainy Cheerios.  The actual product does not look like that.  The actual product looks like little logs.  It looks like hamster food, so that is what my husband and I call it.  ("I'm going to have some hamster food.  Want some?" or "I'm ready for breakfast.  Do you want me to grab your hamster food?")<br /><br />One other thing is, I wouldn't really expect this cereal to be delicious, but the box is pretty misleading about that.  On the back of the box it calls it "tasty"--twice!  It also says the cereal "is the healthiest, most effective and enjoyable Fiber cereal you can buy."  Healthiest?  Maybe.  Effective, eh, okay.  Enjoyable?  Nope; I have to draw the line there.  And then, the back of the box has a series of testimonials including: "It's the best" and it "tastes terrific."  Terrific?  Really?  What does that guy usually eat?<br /><br />So, if you're in the market for a fiber cereal and you absolutely cannot possibly tolerate a gram of sugar or some salt, this is probably the stuff for you.  I don't know whether they used food-grade inks to print the box, but if so, you can eat the box once you finish the cereal.<br /><br />If you would like a high fiber cereal that also has some flavor, try another brand.  I think the other one I was eating had 11g of fiber instead of 14g, but my point is that there are great alternatives out there.<br /><br />Or, plan to eat this with some fresh berries like the picture shows.  Since the cereal itself has so little flavor, the berries make a big difference.

review/summary: Constipation?
review/text: My daughter told me about this cereal, as constipation is a problem with both of us.  This is the best fix for constipation I have ever tried and I think I have tried them all.  I add about 1/3 cup of Simply Fiber to regular cereal along with berries and Stevia to sweeten and it is just wonderful.

review/summary: Good fiber, poor taste
review/text: Yes, this cereal has a ton of fiber and no sugar. But it TASTES like it has a ton of fiber and no sugar -- that is, somewhat like the cardboard box in which it came. I did make it somewhat palatable by adding a teaspoon or so of Splenda to every bowl I ate, but I have no intention of ever buying it again. I'd much rather eat FiberOne Original Bran cereal, which also has a lot of fiber but tastes pretty decent.
