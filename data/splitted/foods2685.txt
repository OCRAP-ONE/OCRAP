review/summary: Best crackers - and a way to manage bread addiction
review/text: I LOVE Ak-Mak crackers. They are an essential staple for me. The price here is pretty good - $20.72 as of this writing or $1.73 a box - which is close enough to the Trader Joe's price of $1.69 to make me happy about ordering them from here. Whole Foods charges around $2.59 for a box.<br /><br />If you crave bread, these are a fantastic way to get your bread fix without doing too much damage to even a very low carb diet. They are just 22 calories per each 2 inch by 4 inch cracker. They have no sugar, fat or cholesterol at all.<br /><br />I have eight boxes of them in our cupboard just to make sure we don't run out.<br /><br />Also, I think if you were a little kid, making fun of the name while you were eating them might make for a good time. I even know some adults who seem to have a weakness for saying "ACK-MACK!" just for fun.

review/summary: Perfect cracker for me, especially with brie
review/text: Title says it all. I first tried these crackers on a whim years ago when the packaging caught my eye in the local supermarket, and they've been my go-to cracker ever since. The bakers are able to ride that fine line of producing a cracker that almost looks homemade with minimal ingredients, but yet is impeccably consistent - I've never had a bad (broken, burnt, stale, broken seal, too many/few seeds, etc) batch. The flavor is mild, but distinctly sesame. For me, few things are better than this cracker topped with slices of brie cheese. With the packaging opened, the crackers last a couple weeks in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I feel like a lot of love goes into this product, and I certainly appreciate it.

Not as sugary as the cookie-like graham cracker but sweet enough to be the perfect complement to peanut butter.  Truly sublime.

Having them shipped is quick, easy, and cheaper than retail.  With cheese, jam, hummus, or just plain, they're a great alternative to breads and rolls.  They're my new "staple" carb.

review/text: Very very very yummy crackers! They hold up well to anything you want to put on them, but they're not awkward to bite into. They have a distinctive but not overpowering taste (as long as you like sesame, which all rational people should). They keep well, so you can buy a case like this and still enjoy the last box you open. They're even healthy. Plus! If you give a whole four-section unbroken one to a toddler, it will be bigger than his or her head, making for a great photo op.

review/text: The price here is similar to that at my local grocery store, but they don't all carry it.  If you live out in the boonies you may have to order it, but believe me, it's worth it!  Better yet, have your local grocer order it.  These crackers are addictive, but you don't feel like you've indulged in junk after munching on them.  The balance of nutrients is ideal, and you can taste how fresh the ingredients are.<br /><br />Triscuits, wheat thins, and other mass-produced crackers may look like they have similar ingredients, but they simply taste like cardboard compared with these little rectangles of divinity!

Great just as they are out of the box and due to the whole grains and fiber content, 5 crackers is a satisfying snack!<br /><br />As others have said, they are hard to find on the grocery store.  When I do find them, I buy them up, so buying in bulk on Amazon is a good alternative.

They also make a terrific accompaniment to soups, salads and so on. I also like them just plain to snack on. So much better for you than chips or cookies! But you won't miss them, Ak-Mak tastes better. They have a unique delicate crispiness that is difficult to explain; you just have to try them yourself. I hate running out of them, so I love getting them in bulk from Amazon. My husband and kids like them, too, and I like to keep some on hand in my car in case I need something to munch on. Delicious!

Both my wife and I agree that this is a better tasting cracker than even most crackers that are not touted as being for those who are health conscious.

review/summary: Great product, worst price available
review/text: GREAT -- for flavor.  Love the instant maple packets.  Plain Cream of Wheat is too plain, and I have to add sugar and dried fruit (blueberries, raisins, something!). Which also means buying and storing expensive dried fruits, sugars, etc.  Maple flavored Cream of Wheat is great as-is, with no additions.  I'm a serious fan at this point.<br /><br />GREAT -- for prep.  I live in a cabin (no power, water, or heat) about 1/3 or more of the year.  Boil-and-serve foods are important so I can conserve fuel use.  Also important are a fast prep and clean-up because I have to do it outside.  Yes, I do mean outside in the cold, rain, wind, sleet, snow, etc. -- because that's where my stove is.  Cream of Wheat really fits the bill:  Fast prep, fills me up for hours, gives me a warm stomach even on freezing days, and has really easy clean-up.<br /><br />PANNED -- for price.  I give the amazon product listing a LOW RATING -- 1 star on this.  My local grocery's standard price for a case is $39.86.  Amazon wants $60 for the same thing.  That's an outrageous difference -- a 50% markup from the local store.  My advice:  Call your local grocery and ask for the case price.  You'll save big bucks.<br /><br />  - tkh

review/summary: I Really Wanted to Like Them
review/text: I did read the reviews before I bought these, but I should have found them and tried them somewhere. I can't understand why people were gushing over how wonderful these were. The only bad review wasn't based on taste, so I felt secure in ordering them. My bad.<br /><br />Cotton candy is one of my favorite flavors, too. I adore it. I like cotton candy-flavored anything. Jelly beans, gum, Slurpees, you name it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these taste nothing like cotton candy to me, not even remotelyk like it. They don't even taste like plain sugar. They aren't very sweet. There is pretty much no taste to them at all, except a faint chemical/cardboard flavor. These are the most vile-tasting lollipops I've ever tried. I barely got through the one I tried.<br /><br />I have a fairly acute palate and I cannot describe the flavor of these lollipops, but it's most definitely not cotton candy, not even close.  They're not even good enough to give away, in my opinion. They're THAT bad.<br /><br />If you have not tried these before, do not buy them without trying them first.<br /><br />I think that this is an item that you had to have grown up eating in order to like. It must be one of those guilty pleasure foods. I have them, we all do.<br /><br />Also, about 20% of them were badly broken. I know I could contact Amazon and ask for a refund, but I feel that this is mostly my fault this time for not having done due diligence before the purchase. Amazon is not at fault because the product tastes lousy.

review/summary: I wish this product came in a better bottle
review/text: The product seems to work well. My hair held it's shape most of the day. The only problem is the nozzle on the bottle. It's very difficult to use. It seems to require a lot of force to get the product out of the bottle. That's the only issue I really have with this product. Although it's volumizing mousse it still works well with curling irons. I have used volumizing mousse for this in the past. I have fine hair so it's enough for me. I'm not sure how much it protects from the heat but according to the bottle you really have to use a lot of product to get enough protection. You basically have to coat all your hair with the product. I will update again on the product later on when I've used it more. So far I have only used it once. I would likely not buy this again just cause of the nozzle. It's really difficult to use because of the force it takes to use it.<br /><br />Update 4/13/2011<br /><br />I was showing someone how it takes a lot of force to get the mousse to come out and when they tried it I heard a snapping sound and suddenly the mousse was coming out easily. It seems there may be something inside the bottle that has to be released in order for the mousse to come out like normal. I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. It seems I could not use enough force to snap the release but a male friend was able to. I used the mousse with my hot tools deep waver and the waves lasted for 2 and a half days and even withstood me sleeping in them. It probably would have lasted longer but at that point I wanted to wash my hair. If you use a lot of mousse the hair will become stiffer but better protection from the heat and the style lasts longer. I would purchase this again now that I realize what the problem was.

review/summary: Still problematic for some dogs...
review/text: I know "Sweet Potato and Chicken" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are allergic to chicken, as well.  As long as you're switching to a "Limited Ingredient Diet" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for "chicken fat" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it.  The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members.

review/text: My two cockers love this formula of chicken and sweet potato. I changed to limited ingredient dog food due to one cocker having allergies. After several hundred dollars in vet bills, changed her diet to this and things have cleared up remarkably in the last couple of months. She stopped scratching her skin off within the first week. No more licking her paws constantly, which can drive a person insane. You had to feel for her, between scratching and licking, she got no rest, and neither did I! Now her coat is returning and very silky. Her skin infections have cleared up, and we are both a lot happier. I just cant find this one in a 30 lb +- size. The fish and sweet potato is a fav also. Although I havent found one they dont like in this brand.

A substitute for whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, faster and lighter for summer dishes and salads or just add some salt and butter, or sour cream or dill dip and eat when the day has been a horror and all you want is your jammies and comfort food.

review/summary: Best All-Rounder
review/text: Coming from south Texas with most of my family from generations of south Lousianans, hot sauce has been a staple condiment for most of my 50+ years.  Certainly, my family never had the mania seen by some today for the absolute hottest sauce one could stand.<br /><br />The most common hot pepper sauces are still staples in my kitchen:  Crystal, Frank's, Louisiana, and Tabasco.  They all have their uses, and I must admit I use Tabasco less than any because of its heat.  One little drop can be enough for me.  I enjoy Frank's most on meat products, not just Buffalo wings.  I really like Louisiana Hot Sauce on eggs and other egg products.  However, the most-used in my home is Crystal.  Why?  It's certainly hot, but not so overwhelming that heat drives out foods' flavors.  I really love the Louisiana Hot Sauce's smoky flavor, but it's also twice as salty as Crystal.  The garlic used in Frank's is also not desirable for all uses.<br /><br />No, Crystal gets more use than any other.  It costs a fraction of Tabasco--but then, someone has to pay for all that Tabasco advertising.  I love the fact that I can actually fill a teaspoon with Crystal and down it straight without cauterizing my oral cavity.<br /><br />Crystal may be considered the poor man's Louisiana pepper sauce, but it has been around a very long time and has endeared itself to an awful lot of people down here!  Worth a try, and quite inexpensive to boot.

review/summary: Straight, No Chaser Hot Sauce
review/text: Crystal Hot Sauce is as basic to Louisiana Cajun cooking as Miracle Whip to church basement potlucks. It's not as salty as some hot sauces or as smokey as others, and it doesn't carry any aftertaste of powdered garlic. It's essentially a "table condiment", what you reach for when the gumbo is bland or the fried catfish muddy-tasting. It's the 'on the table' pick at Angeline's Restaurant in Berkeley, CA, the closest thing to authentic Cajun in the Bay Area. I used to carry a bottle of it in my instrument case whenever I flew to the UK or the Netherlands for gigs, but "them days is gone" in the age of airport security. Now I carry powdered Chipotle chilis, and hope some day a security guard will open the little bottle and take a good sniff ...

review/summary: In Louisiana We Like Crystal
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZHPFI">Crystal Hot Sauce Louisiana's Pure Hot Sauce - 12 oz</a> is popular here in Louisiana.  We also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZMOY">Tabasco Pepper Sauce Red - 2 oz</a>, but we have both kinds and use them regularly.  Many of us prefer Crystal for cooking.  For example, my son-in-law prefers it for one of his special barbecue sauces.  I talked him into letting me put that sauce in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, but he told me not to share it anywhere else.<br /><br />Paul uses it in his steak marinade.  I had a really hard time getting this recipe from him, but I spied until I found out what it was. (He wrote it on a little sheet of paper that got grubby, and I watched him hide the paper!) This one is also in Flavored with Love.  The Crystal Hot Sauce gives heat and flavor without dominating the flavor.<br /> --<br />PAUL'S STEAK MARINADE<br /><br />2 ounces lemon juice<br />2 ounces red wine vinegar<br />4 ounces beer<br />4 ounces soy sauce<br />2 tablespoons basil<br />1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br />1 tablespoon Crystal� hot sauce (or less if desired)<br /><br />Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly.  Use 1 time and discard.<br /><br />Notes<br />Paul's marinades are splendid.  He mixes them with a whisk until all the flavors are thoroughly combined.  Then he adds the liquid to the food he is marinating.<br />When possible he allows at least 4 hours for all the delicious flavors to be absorbed.  He turns the meat or fish occasionally.<br />He adjusts the amounts as needed for the amount of food being prepared.<br /><br />--<br />With the prices of everything going up, it is necessary to save money any way we can.  Making a variety of sauces from a few basic ingredients is helpful.<br /><br />Crystal is a basic sauce, including only aged red cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, and salt.  It does not supply any vitiamins according to the label, but I suspect it does have some nutritional value that we just don't know about.  It is excellent on collard greens, and as the authors of The Collard Patch we use it on our collards.<br /><br />Here in Louisiana we can beat Amazon's price on this product.  I don't know whether Crystal is available throughout the country and how the prices compare.<br /><br />To us the bottle is a work of art, and we are delighted to serve it on our table.  We take Crystal with us sometimes if we eat in public places that do not have enough seasoning.  We are discreet about adding it because we would not want to offend a chef. We do realize that other people find Paul peculiar when he puts so much Crystal on his food.  We NEVER take it with us when we go to eat with friends.  We would not want to be rude. Maybe it would make a good gift for a hostess.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.

review/summary: Great alternative to Tabasco,
review/text: As far as Louisiana style sauces go, this is one of the best and cheapest. Most any<br />"local" type establishment you visit in and around New Orleans will have a bottle of<br />Crystal on the table. Its not hot at all, maybe a 3 on a 10 scale, but the flavor<br />particularly for your basic generic Cajun spread is fantastic.<br /><br />The best thing about Crystal is that its not only available at most retail outlets, but<br />its cheap. Locally, this 12oz. bottle can be had for $1.39. Comparatively, the 2oz. bottle<br />of Tabasco costs $1.59 at the local grocery so it pays to have a couple of bottles of<br />Crystal laying around. Its also a beautiful stunning red color that I've learned to<br />appreciate over the years of sampling all the Louisiana style sauces. Next to Chef Paul's<br />Magic Pepper Sauce, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Good in stews, gumbos, on fish, chicken and pork when you want all the flavor without<br />the burn. If you're cooking for friends they wont mind you throwing in liberal doses<br />of this stuff. 5 Scovies

review/text: My husband and I consider ourselves hot sauce connoisseurs. We have tried anything and everything there is to try in the world of hot sauces. Of course there are hot sauces that work best on certain foods and in certain recipes, so you have to pair them with foods to which they are best suited. But, one product has been consistent for all of our hot sauce needs and that product is Crystal Hot Sauce. Yes, it is considered the poor man's hot sauce, but what's wrong with buying the best for the least amount of money? Believe me, we have spared no expense in trying out hot sauces. But, we always come back to Crystal. This Louisiana-style hot sauce is produced by family-owned Baumer Foods since 1923! They have stood the test of time. One of the best characteristics of Crystal Hot Sauce is that the controlled heat level keeps the accent on flavor. And, believe me, it is one of the most flavorful hot sauces on the market. I've tried hot sauces that were all heat and no flavor. Crystal gives you the kick a hot sauce should (and I have scorched my esophagus with it on many occasions tossing back dozens of oysters laden with Crystal and a squeeze of lemon juice) but the flavor is what keeps us coming back.

review/text: My dad (who grew up in New Orleans back in the 40s and 50s), always had Crystal Hot Sauce on the table when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s (still does). I didn't have any appreciation for hot sauce back then, but as I got older, I started using it on everything like the old man does... red beans and rice plus other cajun/creole dishes, burgers, po-boys, sandwiches, field greens, beans, peas, soups, dumplings, stews, pizza, popcorn... you name it! I like other mass-produced hot sauces as well, such as Louisiana brand, Frank's RedHot, Tabasco brand sauces, Tapitio brand, TryMe Cajun Sunshine, etc., but I like Crystal the best! It has a fresh, pure, cayenne pepper and vinegar bite that's always delicious with a mild, pleasant heat... and not too salty like some sauces. I also like that it has 3 simple ingredients: aged red cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, and salt. Fortunately, I can get it almost anywhere where I live... this would be my stranded-on-a-deserted-island condiment of choice...

Tobasco and Crystal hot sauce are the two main hot sauces in Louisiana so you won't be disappointed. Crystal hot sauce is made from cayenne hot peppers which are spicy, but this hot sauce is so good I can drink it from the bottle without burning my mouth. Give it a try.

review/text: Crazy Uncle Jester's Louisiana Firestorm is the best pure Louisiana style hot sauce, but Crystal is my favorite of the original style, milder Louisiana style hot sauces that I can buy in a supermarket.  It's about twice as hot as the original Louisiana style hot sauce, which still is not all that hot but the extra cayennes add a lot of flavor and are the difference between being 99% vinegar (like tabasco) and hot sauce IMO.<br /><br />I buy this one mainly for my 8 year old son, who hasn't yet migrated up to the hotter Louisiana style sauces and he loves it. I'll use it myself from time to time as well, although I usually opt for something hotter.  It's still good tasting.

review/summary: Unique sauce, great service. Amazon is amazing!
review/text: I was introduced to this local hot sauce while on a trip to New Orleans this spring. My daughter knew a chef that she had worked with, he had opened his own restraunt, and my wife and I had a fabulous dinner there one night. His baked beans were excellent, and he shared he uses this local hot sauce in it. I like hot sauces, but am not too crazy. This was not so peppery, and did not leave my mouth blazing, but did have an earthy, smokeyness to it. I bought a bottle while in the Cresent city, and when I ran out, didn't know where to purchace more. Amazon to the rescue! You can find anything on Amazon. Thats why I say it is amazing. I purchaced two bottles of this Crystal sauce, and will always turn to Amazon for other heretofor items that my local store does not have. I live in the Pacific Northwest, so cajun sauce is impossible to find. Except on Amazon!<br />Don

review/summary: Best Hot Sauce Around--But Don't Buy Here!
review/text: Crystal's is definitely one of the best hot sauces on the market. If you're asking yourself whether or not it's worth it to have hot sauce shipped to you, the answer is undoubtedly YES when it comes to this stuff. However, you can buy it online directly from the manufacturer (Baumer) for much less!

review/summary: Crystal Hot Sauce...AWESOME
review/text: I just got back from my first trip to New Orleans ever.  I saw an AD for Crystal's Hot Sauce and since my wife is named Crystal I bought a bottle strickly on the name.  Then at a restaurant I tried it....WOW, it was AWESOME.  Great flavor, nice heat, but not over barring and did not have a burning after taste.  I bought a larger bottle the next day...only to loose at the Airport check-in because it was over the 3oz they allow for carry on.  I will be buying lots of this product!!!

review/text: I have enjoyed this coffee in the past. It's a dark roast and it tasted better than most flavored coffee pods. However, my last order was disappointing. The pods seemed less full. The third pack was the worst. One of the pods was completely empty. From the mess of grinds, it looked like others were leaking.I tried using less water to brew the pods, two different pots, but the coffee just didn't taste good.

It was warm still in Arizona in September, but this was something you would expect to happen to chocolate candy but not to gummi rings or bears.  Be warned if you order this brand in warm months you may open the box to find a scary looking surprise. This has never happened to me with the Haribo brand so I will stick to those from now on.  Amazon did refund the price, they are great about that if you call them up and whine a little.

review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: PopChips have ruined other chips for me!
review/text: I &lt;3 Popchips...maybe a little TOO much!  I was devastated when COSTCO stopped selling them, but that subsided once I found them by the case on Amazon.com.  I have subscription of 1 box per month and often contemplate increasing that order.<br /><br />BBQ is the BEST!

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/summary: good taste, a little too salty
review/text: These chips are unusual and they do "grow" on you. The taste is most like shoestring potatoes, of which I am boderline addicted. I would order these again, but they are just too salty for my taste. I ordered the plain, so I don't know if the other flavors are also salty.

review/summary: nice 100-calorie snack
review/text: These are very delicious, not quite the standard potato chip and not quite popcorn.  The kind I tried, salt/pepper, only only 100 calories per serving, little fat (no trans/saturated fat), and less sodium that I expected, about 10% of your daily value.<br /><br />If you like chips, you'll probably like these.  A little different, but also familiar.  Worth a try.
