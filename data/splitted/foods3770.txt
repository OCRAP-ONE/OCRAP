review/summary: Very difficult to get into ball
review/text: I have actually stopped buying these because they are so hard to insert.  I had to use a screwdriver to get it into the toy!  Even my husband had problems getting it into the toy.  We have 2 of these toys-a large one and a smaller one-and the smaller one has already been chewed on by one of our dogs.  Our big dog lost interest after the first couple of times and I just gave up on them.  They do keep the dogs busy, but 20 minutes to insert one treat seems a little too time consuming.

review/summary: Yummy but pricey...
review/text: If the treat would stay in the toy for awhile it would be fine (which it would the first couple times I used the toy) but the toy must stretch a bit or something because now my pup can get them right out and it's gone chomp, chomp.  So after I use these up I'll probably not buy them anymore and just let him get the little treats out of the middle of his toy.

review/summary: Barbeque treat creates dog anti- frenzy
review/text: I purchased these for my dog and my sisters 2.  They are all large dogs (46 lbs. and up)  Until these they were running around, getting in each others face - JUST DOING WHAT DOGS DO.  I gave them the "EVERLASTING TREAT'  and they went to seperate places and did not move for over an hour.<br /><br />There is only one thing - with these dogs - NOTHING IS EVERLASTING.  They loved them and I will definitely buy more.<br /><br />As usual - You can go wrong - when you go AMAZON

review/text: I bought the initial treat ball at my vet's office, and after it kept my golden busy for a LONNNNNG time I knew I had to find the refills cheaper than they sell them! She LOVES them - when she sees me get it out of the package she follows me nosing my hand trying to sneak it out of my hand. She works at them for awhile, and pops them out of the treat ball, but they still keep her busy. Would be excellant for dogs in crates.<br />:)

review/summary: Everlasting? uhhhhhh NO
review/text: These are decent treats to keep your dog busy for a while, but if the word "everlasting" is what's making you consider buying...move on.  I have two german shepherds.  They aren't mega chewers but enjoy a treat.  These things last about 10mins MAX with them.  I have two types of "holders" for the treats and the dogs manage to crack the treat part in a minute or two then just gnaw on it for a few more minutes until its done.  For the price they are asking on these, definitely get something else.

review/summary: Great treat for a great toy
review/text: My dog loves this flavor and seems to be one of his favorites, along with the chicken flavored one.  These cooklie inserts are hard and durable, taking a long while to get through, thankully!  They are obviously very tasty because my dog can't get through them fast enough, though it does take him about a week just to finish one of them.  The good thing about this cookie is that the dogs can only scrape off a small amount at a time, rather than being able to gulp down big bites.

Drink it hot for a warm all over feeling - - not in a, "I just built a snowman kind of way" - but more in a seductively, warm sexy slow building climax kind of way. Just like the Kama Sutra, this drink will leave you breathless, flush and DEEPLY SATISFIED!

So per use of a packet in your water you get ten calories. Still, its not bad by any means and much better then the amount my other coworkers take in daily from their sodas and such.

review/text: The flavor and especially the aroma of the tea is much too pungent, even burnt. It is oven-roasted, not smoked, as is traditional. And too expensive for what you get. Not enough information is available online to make an accurate choice.

review/summary: A perfect food
review/text: Oatmeal can be classified as a perfect food.  Really.  Quaker Oats offers the best oats, in my opinion.  Oatmeal has many health benefits.  It lowers LDL "bad" cholesterol while not lowering HDL "good" cholesterol levels, is a good source of soluble fiber (which helps suppress appetite), lowers blood pressure, is a good source of vitamins and minerals (especially magnesium, which is good for blood pressure) and contains the amino acid L-arginine (good for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol).<br /><br />With benefits like these, make yourself a nice big bowl right now.

review/text: Ok, let me just say that what brought me to this site, was me looking for where they sell this rice because I can't find it in the grocery store anymore & i LOVE it. Frankly-the Mexican rice just doesn't cut it.  That other person must have had a bad bag because this rice is the BEST.  I love it.  And i wish the dang bag wasn't TWO servings because I could easily eat the whole thing myself it is so yummy.  As far as the black stuff-it's called seasonings.  More for me!!!

review/summary: A Great Tasting Versatile Product
review/text: Old El Paso Heat & Serve Fiesta Rice makes a great side dish. Just warm it up in the microwave. You don't even have to take it out of the package. The rice is not overcooked, letting that final fluffing to take place in the heating process. We use the rice for other things more than the intended serving suggested. We spoon it in burritos as we make them. Add some tomatoes, garlic, onions and a little extra spice and you have a great Spanish rice. This product is great time saver and useful in many dishes.

review/text: Perhaps I got a bad bag, it was dated with an expiration of Feb 2011, and it is Nov 2010.  I cooked the rice per the directions and the smell that the rice had was horribly rancid.  I noticed some black particles in the rice which I can only assume was some sort of vegetable which didn't preserve properly and just went bad.<br /><br />Either way, this was the first time I had purchased this product.  I will be steering clear and taking a less convenient approach to fiesta rice next time.

review/summary: This is okay, but Dandy Blend is far better
review/text: I have severe reflux and a corn and gluten intolerance so finding a coffee like beverage was not easy and tea just does not cut it for me.  I tried this product and was thrilled, then the Dandy Blend, which I ordered at the same time arrived.  I got a huge bag of Dandy Blend, compared to the tiny bag of Unforgettable - you can compare the price vs the volume yourself.  In my opinion the Dandy Blend tastes better. I have not touched the whole brown rice drink since I tried the Dandy Blend which tastes like postum, which I do miss since they quit making it.  Pero is good too, but I cannot have it anymore with the gluten intolerance, nor postum for that matter.  I tried Kava for a while but the acid, even though this is an acid reduced product, was too much for my stomach.  The lack of acid is wonderful in both Dandy Blend and Unforgettable. Now I have a good tasting, hot beverage choices that I can sip on throughout the day. I suggest buying both and seeing which you prefer.

review/summary: Amazing! Smells like hot chocolate, tastes even better
review/text: I bought this tea from Whole Foods on my quest to find more loose leaf teas and it looked interesting. The packaging is nice and very much air tight (two lids to keep air out) and the second you open the canister the most amazing smell comes from inside so you just can't wait to make it. Then you open the bag and the smell just gets better. I made the tea exactly as it says and boy did it smell up the kitchen. My mother came into the kitchen and demanded that I make enough for both of us of whatever that amazing smell that was. The smell of the tea and milk together brought up memories of going out to the Christmas tree farm and getting hot chocolate after spending hours trying to find the perfect tree. However, when I tasted it, it was not very chocolatey. The taste was very complex, with cinnamon, a refreshing hit of peppermint and a bit of sweetness. I would go more into detail about the taste except I'm not very good at describing tastes but it tastes very good. You could definitely taste the vanilla and the cinnamon and the peppermint just glided on your tongue. Some teas use too much peppermint and it bombards your mouth and you can't taste anything but peppermint, but this tea uses peppermint perfectly to compliment the other flavors. I will definitely be drinking this on a regular basis, especially as it gets colder.

review/summary: A Tasty, Less Sugary Granola from Kashi
review/text: I actually like Kashi's new commercials about how healthy ingredients need to taste good to be in their cereals, and then they show a somewhat overweight guy as a food researcher going into various third world situations to find them, Indiana Jones-style. I had an opportunity to try Kashi's GoLean Crunch! Cereal in a sample packet as part of a promotional package Amazon sent me of their non-perishable groceries. Full of their Seven Whole Grains and Sesame cereal, it is indeed tasty without the overwhelming clusters of sweeter granola cereals. There is some of the sawdust taste of barley and soybean in there, but the whole oats and brown rice manage to dominate with honey, cinnamon, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup adding a dash of sweetness. A cup is 190 calories, which is higher than my favorite, Kashi's Heart to Heart cereal, but it does have only 95 mg of sodium and 8 grams of fiber. It's definitely a worthwhile entry in the granola category.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: This is a tasty, relatively healthy cereal which probably goes well with milk.  I don't know as I don't drink milk, but it works for me as a snack.  Better to nibble on this than sugar-laden or fat-laden commercial "snack foods" IMHO.  It does have some rye & wheat so if you are very sensitive to gluten, this might be a downer.  I'm somewhat sensitive, but it didn't seem to have much effect on me.  Fortunately, the main ingredients are oats & rice.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great tasting, great for you!
review/text: This is one of my favorite "healthy" cereals.  It's high in protein and fiber, and doesn't contain artificial ingredients or sweeteners that I can't pronounce.  This cereal also fills me up for most of the morning (unlike many high carb, oversweetened cereals). And, most importantly, it actually tastes good!  The flavor sort of reminds me of Cracker Jack - crunchy and slightly caramel-ly.  I like to add blueberries or dried cranberries to it for a little extra sweetness.  It's also great in yogurt.  My only complaint is that some of the clusters in the cereal are really large, so much so that I have to break them up before eating.  A minor complaint, really.  Overall, I highly recommend Go Lean Crunch!

Its taste obviously cannot compare to some sugar filled normal cereal, but as health cereals go, this one is a keeper.  I eat it 3-4 days a week and have done so for over a year and I still like it!

It's got a real "crunch!" to it, as the name makes clear -- but after the initial crunch, it's got this understated sweetness about it, a mixture of cinnamon and maybe a little honey. Mmmm. A bowl is very filling, and here's the amazing part: it actually KEEPS me full. For hours. As for the "clumps" that some people are complaining about, those are my favorite part! It's just a characteristic of the cereal -- kind of like how, sometimes, pizza will have a bubble of dough in it. Mmmm. Love the bubble, love the clumps.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

review/summary: Great to eat right out of the box
review/text: I've been eating GOLEAN Crunch! cereal for over a year now and the exclamation mark after crunch is fitting.  There are huge round clusters at the top of the box perfect as finger food, but after you get half way or so into the contents most of the rest is small and harder to eat right out of the box.  Still tasty and crunchy, however.<br /><br />Despite the great taste without milk, or in concert as a granola topper of sorts, I find that this cereal causes an inordinate amount of gas buildup in my system.  Hence the rating of 4.  It may be just me, or one of the seven grains is the culprit.  And, despite this realization, I'll continue to eat it primarily because of its great taste and good all-around nutrition.

review/text: I love this cereal so when I saw a big sale on the 4.3oz boxes of it I bought 48 boxes!  Halfway through our first breakfast my wife realized that the little black seed looking things in the cereal were actually little dead bugs!!!  Once she said that I started looking in my bowl and realized it was full of them!  I'm a big fan of the cereal but will NEVER purchase any from Amazon or probably off the internet for that matter.  Grocery store is fine with me!  Buyer beware!

review/summary: I'm Just Not Addicted...
review/text: With so many other glowing reviews, I feel a little ashamed to put my own lukewarm review in.  Kashi GoLean Crunch! has 7 whole grains in it, which means puffed rice is mixed with oats and rye and other grains to make clusters.  It's naturally sweetened, which is a plus, and it definitely stays crunchy in milk.  Really, really crunchy.  It has sort of a sweet, oat-slightly-nutty flavor to it, and it's not bad.<br /><br />However, as I said, I'm not really addicted to it.  I prefer Back to Nature Granolas, and as I wrote this review, I became curious as to their nutrition facts.  So here is the Kashi measured up against the Back to Nature All-Natural Granola, Apple Blueberry, 15-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) - measured by 1/2 cup servings.  There are definitely more calories in BTN (200 vs. 95), but there's fruit too, which the Kashi GoLean lacks.  BTN has slightly less sugar (6 g to Kashi's 6.5g), less salt (20 mg to 47.5 mg) and there's more protein in it (6 g to Kashi's 4.5g). They are equal in the following categories: dietary fiber (4g) and calcium (2%); there's more fat in BTN (2.5g=4% BTN, 1.5g=2.5% Kashi).  So there is not a lot of difference between the two.<br /><br />But as for the taste and the texture?  I'd readily take granola any day over the Kashi.  I don't like overly crunchy cereals (why buy a cereal specifically named, "Crunch!" right?) and the granola is crisp enough for me.  There are fewer sharp edges to stab me in the gums.

review/summary: More like Go Lean Chew! instead of usual Crunch! despite current "Use by" date
review/text: While I eat Go Lean Crunch! often -- not least because of the incomparable crunch -- I have been very disappointed with this particular shipment, which has been more chewy than crunchy right from the beginning.  Kind of like it had been opened and then subjected to humidity for too long.  This despite a "Use by" date of 6/2013.  Edible in milk, but otherwise, blech.  Was hoping it was a fluke w/the first box of the 3, but no such luck.  At this point, I can't return it, but if this happens again, I'll have to reconsider where I buy it.

review/summary: Flavored gravel
review/text: This cereal is nutritionally fortified gravel. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It takes a suspiciously long time to get soggy in milk and it isn't too sweet. Think of it, philosophically, as a less extreme Grape-Nuts.  With some freeze-dried strawberry slices on top it's actually even kind of good. If you are especially into eating healthy cereals or small rocks you would probably like it. I'm going to finish what I have but not go out of my way to purchase this again, because I can only consume so much gravel in a given year.

review/text: This serial is awesome. I pretty much exclusively eat cereal as a grad student with very little time, and this has to be among my favorite cereals. The crunch can be a bit too hard sometimes (I didn't think such a thing could happen), so I usually let it soak in the milk for little, making sure I get every cluster.<br /><br />I've had a hard inedible bit here and there, but very rarely. In the whole year+ I've been getting these in the mail from Amazon, I've had maybe two or three boxes that showed the anomalous hard bits.<br /><br />Also, its great with soy milk (are there things that arent?).<br /><br />As always, check the expiration date!! I haven't had a spoiled box yet, but you can never be too careful!

I love eating this cereal in the morning for breakfast or after work as a snack.  Really, as far as taste and nutrition, this cereal cannot be beat.<br /><br />However,<br /><br />There is some ingredient in this cereal that causes HORRENDOUS gas in some people.  I am one of them.  Forget beans, peppers, whole grain...all the things that usually cause gas.  This is the worst gas imaginable.  In fact, I am still in awe of how much gas one bowl of this cereal causes.  It is not just the fiber.  I eat a high fiber diet anyway and have never had problems like this...there is some specific ingredient that causes this problem.<br /><br />I would recommend trying this cereal from a store before buying a bunch to see how you react to it.

I enjoy the cereal very much; it's crunchy, sweet, and filling. It doesn't taste as processed as lots of common sweet cereals, and isn't bland at all like typical "healthy" cereals.<br /><br />For those without my specific health issues, I'd highly recommend this cereal as it's pretty darn good and relatively healthy. However, it has a pretty high glycemic index and really gives me sugar spikes, so unfortunately after this case I'm done with the product. Farewell Kashi, you sweet seductress of the cereal isle.

review/text: First let me say that I eat a healthy, balanced variety of foods, and am not prone to hardly any bodily disorders.<br />I eat lots of bread and cereal, so this seemed a good choice for supposed good benefits.<br /><br />I noticed after only one bowl, some stomach discomfort and bloating - something I never get save after the massive Thanksgiving dinner.  It lasted 1 full day, and made me wonder...  I ate another bowl 2 days later, and sure enough it happened again.  After checking online I found a vast amount of space already dedicated to the potent side effects of eating Kashi (noxious gas, bloating, diarrhea...)<br /><br />So, a word to the wise - see if any of these symptoms develop coincidentally with the eating of this cereal.  Otherwise it has good flavor - but is overly dry and reminds one of chewing styrophoam...  I guess I'll pass and keep eating my Triscuits and Raisin Bran :)

review/summary: Very tasty and filling, but save for solitary days.
review/text: AS others have said, this cereal is pretty tasty. I like the flavor, although the cereal is pretty crunchy (hard).<br /><br />Despite the good flavor and other positives, BE WARNED!<br /><br />Do not eat this cereal for breakfast if later that day you are:<br />-going on a hot date<br />-having a business meeting<br />-meeting the in-laws for the first time<br />-giving a presentation in front of any number of people<br />-going on a long road trip with other people<br /><br />This cereal is better saved for days when you plan on being a solitary hermit....or are spending the day with someone that doesn't mind (or is highly amused by) explosive flatulence! Holy cow! I bought the 4-pack of these cereal from Amazon several months ago, and I could NOT for the life of me figure out why I've been having such tremendous farts! My long-term boyfriend was initially amused by the frequency and volume of my trumpeting (farts that literally lasted 30 seconds or more), but it's since just become something for him to grimace at. Notably, I ate this for breakfast the morning on the day he proposed to me....Let me just say that our hotel stay that day was less than romantic. Hilariously awful, but not romantic.<br /><br />So, this cereal has its purposes. Despite being a 26 year old woman, fart humor is still a blast (pun!) to me. I might buy it again (I just finished the last box), but I'll just be selective on when to eat it. A Google search for "Kashi gas" reveals that I'm not alone in this.

review/summary: WILL GIVE YOU UNRELENTING GAS
review/text: This is certainly not the worst tasting cereal in the world, not the greatest, but for a health food not bad at all.  The main problem with eating it is that it is a bit too crunchy, and it leaves a very stubborn residue if left in the cereal bowl for an hour.  HOWEVER, the main problem doesn't come when you eat the cereal; it comes about 3 hours after you eat the cereal.  You will be haunted by the most unrelenting gas that you are likely to have ever experienced.  I am positive that GoLEan crunch is responsible because for the last two days that and milk were the only two things I ate and both days I experienced the same tortuous flatulence (I have never had a problem with my milk [Horizon Organic whole]).  The gas isn't particularly smelly but it is frighteningly voluminous.  If you were to consume this product along with a serving of egg curry, you could vanquish your most powerful enemies.

review/summary: Keep Dry To Prevent Clumping!
review/text: For those with clumping problems: I have encountered this too.  It happens when the cereal soaks up too much moisture from the air!  Seal the bag carefully, and if the air where you live is especially moist, you might even consider transferring the cereal to another container that can be sealed airtight.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for YEARS and I still love it just as much as I did when I started.  While I think the Honey Almond Flax variant is somewhat tastier, this one does take significantly longer to develop any rancidity.  This may be due to the omission of the flaxseed which contains polyunsaturated linolenic oils which, though healthy, are highly prone to oxidation (I am extremely sensitive to this; my friends and family can't tell and think I'm crazy).  This may be a consideration for you if you are similarly sensitive and take a while to finish the six boxes in this multipack!<br /><br />I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.  Kashi is really expensive in the grocery stores nearby, so we get monthly subscribe-and-save deliveries of the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E074">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch!

I eat it for breakfast every morning and often for a snack as well - it really is tasty and filling, has lots of healthy protein and fiber, and doesn't leave you feeling sugar-shocked like kid's cereals overloaded with high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar.  I rotate between the five cereals listed above to keep things interesting.

review/summary: Yummy and super cruncholicious--but needs less "sugar"
review/text: I find the crunch and texture of this is very satisfying when you want to get your teeth into a granola-like cereal. The flavor is a melange of grains and of sweetness. It's reminiscent of sugar smacks--but richer and more healthful. :)<br /><br />I do wish they'd dial down the sweetness. Kashi has some very nice granola medleys and cereal products, but on some cereals--like this one and the Cocoa Beach granola--its sooooooooooooooooo sweet. Too sweet. I'm assuming most of the consumers of Kashi cereals are grown-ups, not kids. Well, grown-ups just don't need cereal to have this much SUGAR...er...let's call it "evaporated cane juice". (same diff, really)<br /><br />I'll give it five stars the day they ease up on the sweet stuff.<br /><br />But I'll still buy it. I just dilute with a bit of unsweetened wheat puffs or more milk or Almond Breeze.

review/summary: Wonderful cereal if you can tolerate it
review/text: The nutritional profile of this cereal is excellent.  It's high in fiber, high in protein, yet has low fat and only moderate sugar.  The clusters are very crunchy if eaten straight, or shortly after put in milk.  In fact, they may be too hard for some people with sensitive teeth or gums.  They do soften after a couple minutes in milk, which is the best time to eat them in my opinion.  The taste is moderately sweet with mild, grainy undertones.<br /><br />For a such a healthy cereal, this is really one you could eat every day and not get tired of for a while.  One thing to note is that due to the chicory root extract in this cereal, some folks will experience very bad indigestion with this cereal.  I would advise trying a box from the store before buying a pack of 6 online.  If it plays nice with your stomach, then it's fantastic.

However, I often come back to Kashi GoLean. Good old dependable, trusty Kashi. It tastes good and it keeps me full for much longer than any other cereal (I usually feel hungry again about an hour after eating, but Kashi can hold me off for a couple hours at least).<br />My only complaint about this cereal is its hard texture. I don't like having to bite and chew so hard to eat my breakfast, especially when it's early in the morning and I'm only half awake and incredibly grouchy. But the high fiber and protein make it a good breakfast otherwise.

I'm not sure if it makes you lean because it is healthy or because it is so crunchy that it takes twice as long to eat so you probably end up eating less. I like the taste and feel good for hours after I eat it. I'm not sure if this is exactly the same as what is sold in the stores. I felt like there were maybe more defects like the super-hard balls of honey, etc in the boxes I bought. This could just be paranoia on my part. Overall I love how it tastes and was very satisfied. I highly recommend this cereal if you are trying to lose weight.

review/summary: Best Cereal to beat mid morning hunger!!
review/text: I have been eating this cereal for a month now and I must say it is very feeling and satisfying! The crunchy texture is actually the best part! I think because it takes so long to actually eat, that is the reason why it is so satisfying as well: It digests slower!<br /><br />You can't beat the 9 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber for under 200 calories per cup, astonishing!<br /><br />I would recommend this cereal to anyone who is watching their weight or would like to lose weight! Usually I add a half cup of fruit or half a banana to the cereal and one or two pieces of turkey bacon! With that I'm usually full for 4-5 hours!

review/summary: Great crunch, not too sweet or "stick-like"
review/text: I tend to like cereals that have a lot of crunch and that are lightly sweetened.  Many do well on the crunch part, but are too sweet.  Some go too far on the "sticks & twigs" type crunch without taste.  This one gets it right in my book.  I'll be buying more.
