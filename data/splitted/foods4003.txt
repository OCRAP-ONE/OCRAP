review/summary: Beware: This product contains malitol
review/text: These are very tasty bars, but if you are sensitive to sugar alcohols (especially malitol, which can often have dire effects) don't be fooled by the Splenda label on the packaging.  While sucralose is higher in the ingredient list, malitol syrup is not far behind it.<br /><br />I can't eat this anymore because of the malitol, which is a shame because they are delicious snack bars.

review/text: These sugar-free Russell Stover Cinnamon Bun Snack Bars didn't last long here!  If I had not known they were sugar-free, I'd never have guessed it.  The bars have a good cinnamon taste to them with some crunch and also are a bit chewy, which I like.  They do taste like a cinnamon bun in bar form and are a good size for a snack.  The bottom is covered with chocolate and finishes off the bar so that it tastes more like a candy bar than a sugar-free snack bar. Each bar has only 100 calories.<br /><br />Russell Stover makes several other kinds of snack bars and food items that are sugar free, and I intend to sample a lot more of them.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Not a good baking experience
review/text: I have been baking gluten free for years. I normally use a different brand but was trying to save a few bucks. You all know gluten free baking is expensive!  So I make cupcakes to take to a picnic. I have used this recipe 100 times if not more. Never had an issue. Batch 1, a total disaster. I try again because I figure I was distracted. Batch 2 another flop.  I go, cupcakeless to the picnic. I try again Monday morning when everything is quiet and STILL a disaster. I order my normal brand and it gets here Wed. (thank you Amazon Prime ;) ) and use the same recipe and it turned out great!  I was shocked that a different brand could lead to such drastic differences in the final product!

review/summary: This hot chocolate is gggllloorrious.
review/text: A while ago I had bought some caramel hot chocolate from Harry and David's. They had discontinued it, but I loved the caramel taste in the hot chocolate so I wanted to find something else similar.<br /><br />After reading the other review for this product, I had to try it. Thank you so much Nancy.<br /><br />Let me tell you, this stuff kicks the crap out of Harry and David's for a third of the price.<br /><br />If you use it as directed in hot water you'll be greeted with a rich chocolaty taste that is rich without being too dark or overpowering. The caramel taste is a good compliment to the richness of the chocolate, but is not too sweet as caramel can sometimes be.<br /><br />If you use it in milk, as I like to do, this hot chocolate is thick and decadent. When using it in milk I do not use as much as directed, as I find that it isn't needed. I only use about half as much as is recommended and it's still hands down the best hot chocolate I've ever had.<br /><br />This was such a good buy that I've also bought the French vanilla flavor as well as the creme brulee. I'm impatiently waiting for it to arrive. I can't wait!<br /><br />Flavor is always subjective, but if you buy this I doubt you'll regret it, unless you hate chocolate or caramel, in which case why are you looking at this anyway?

review/summary: Excellent canned tuna
review/text: This is a very good choice for canned tuna.  The taste is excellent.  The texture is far superior to typical "supermarket" chunk light canned tuna  brands (have you noticed in recent years they seem like a can of sawdust instead of chunks of tuna?).  While it isn't quite as "moist" as tuna packed in oil, it is far more "moist" than tuna packed in water.  There is some liquid in the can (but far less than in cheaper brands or water packed tuna), but the liquid is literally just tuna juices, like a tuna broth - no added water or oils are added.  I don't even drain the juice off, I simply mix it back in while flaking the tuna; the juicy broth is reabsorbed.  All the omega-3 fatty acids are retained this way - why discard all that goodness down the drain?Wild Planet wild skipjack light tuna consists of larger and firm filet chunks, yet easily flakes with a fork.<br /><br />I could buy this very same tuna at a local store, but at much higher per can cost.  I prefer the convenience and lower cost of case buying via Amazon it's always ready for an easy and nutritious meal or snack my 5th grader can prepare himself or when I need multiple cans to make tuna casserole, tuna skillet pie or loaf, tuna patties, or tuna fritters for the family.  When I get down to the third can, I reorder for fast free Prime delivery to my door.  Saves time, effort, and money.<br /><br />As far as I've been able to determine (subject to change if I learn otherwise), if one is buying canned tuna, this is a good choice for sustainability (better catch methods) and lower mercury (smaller tuna species).  The can lining is BPA-free, too.

review/text: This brand of tuna well deserves all the 5 star reviews. It IS tasty tuna chunks w/ a small amt. of creamy pink juice that I used instead of squeezing out to make tuna salad.There is no fishy taste as it is more like fresh tuna. I compare this tuna to switching from box wine to bottle wine-once you make the leap to this tuna you will never want to go back to the typical grocery store variety or even the higher grade brands available on Amazon. The 3 brands I used to buy on Amazon were Polar's yellowfin steak, Natural Value's yellowfin, and Wild Oats light tongol, all packed in water. Until I tried this brand I was content w/ those brands. I just hope Amazon continues to carry this brand and it stays at this price point.

review/summary: Excellent tuna!
review/text: This tuna is very flavorful and I like that the product only contains tuna and salt.  No water or oil or additives similar to MSG and it is not pulverized mushy little pieces like most supermarket tuna.  The tuna is in big pieces that I flake into large chunks and mix with the juice in the can.  I prefer this skipjack to the albacore, as it is more flavorful and moister.  Great for pasta salads, pasta main dishes, on a lettuce salad, sandwiches, tuna patties or for quick appetizer dips, etc, etc.  Even good just eating plain out of the can.  I highly recommend the excellent recipe from Triscuit box by Rachael Ray - Tuna and White Bean Salad - can Google to find it online.  This tuna is a good value for the price.

review/summary: Not bad. Price increase since then
review/text: I like the fact that the cans are BPA free, the fish  troll or pole caught,  and are smaller with lower mercury.  The first can seemed a bit strong tasting and salty (I'm supposed to be low sodium).  The second time around I used a bit more mayo, added some fresh coriander, lemon juice and pepper and it tasted better.  It's only cooked once, in the can (with no water added), but it is made from tuna that has been frozen.  Don't know if that is common in the industry or not.<br />Since I ordered in June it seems the price went up about $.58 a can on the subscription plan.

It is unctuous and meaty without any fishiness at all. I also like the fact that each can lists the Omega 3 amounts (both DHA and EPA). I actually like the skipjack tuna of this brand better than the albacore. Highly recommended.

review/text: This is by far the best canned tuna on the market.  I love the albacore as well, but the flavor of the Skipjack is amazing.  The salty flavor of the natural oil just makes my mouth water.  Wild Caught Tuna has way more flavor than anything farm raised and Wild Planet is delivering a product that is not only wild caught, but sustainable.  I've eaten dozens of cans of this stuff over the last year and can only wish that I had found it sooner.  It is great for a snack or even for a whole meal.  It isn't packed in anything except for its own natural oils so you are getting 100% REAL Tuna.

review/summary: good tuna in BPA free can
review/text: Mostly we eat tuna in salad or heated in casserole type dishes, so the flavor is not as critical to us as it would be to some people who eat their tuna almost plain from the can.  However, when combined with chopped sweet onion, celery, olive oil and fresh lemon juice, this tuna is very tasty.<br /><br />I am willing to pay extra for this tuna mostly because of the BPA free can although the quality doesn't seem to me to be higher than other premium "health" brands such as Natural Sea. I have also purchased the Wild Planet brand of albacore tuna and personally prefer the taste and texture of this skipjack tuna - even though it is, as others have mentioned, quite salty tasting.

When the grocery store is selling it for 50 cents a can, you know what you're buying is garbage.<br /><br />Much of the supermarket tuna claims it's skipjack on the label, but when tested independently, it's actually a random mishmash blend of high mercury low quality tuna - you really don't know what you're getting.<br /><br />Wild planet uses slabs of real low mercury skipjack tuna from 1 fish, then cooks it inside of the can so it retains 100% of the omega-3 content, none of the fish oil is siphoned off to sell to supplement companies, you get all of the health benefits you're looking for from fish.<br /><br />I view these cans more as medicine than food, lately I've just been putting relish on top of it and eating it with a spoon. Perfect!

review/summary: Pretty Dang Good Tuna
review/text: I think a lot of this product. Very good flavor, not too strong, but distinct and with some depth. Good looking piece of fish, too. You know how some cheaper light tunas are kind of unappetizing. I don't eat a huge amount of canned tuna, but when I do, it's in a carefully constructed salad, and this tuna justifies the effort.<br /><br />The real strong point is taste. I recently tried RainCoast solid albacore. Raincoast is specifically caught AND processed in the North Pacific and Canada. I suspect Wild Planet is caught and/or processed in Southeast Asia. Both are packed in plain tuna juices. After using used to Wild Planet skipjack, I found the albacore relatively tasteless. And the Wild Planet skipjack is mostly nearly "solid," close to the kind of cut you expect in "solid" tuna, rather than chunk. RainCoast doesn't offer any but albacore, so I'll stay with Wild Planet, currently the most environmentally attractive and well-packed product.

review/summary: Best Tuna I have found, worth the money!
review/text: I moved here from Australia, and I guess I didn't realize that we were lucky in that was a great range of quality canned Tuna. When I tried Tuna that I could find in the supermarket, aside from the 'steaks' in the pouch they no longer seem to see, that the tuna was almost shredded and stuffed in the can .. with hardly any flavor. I don't know where the heck they get that crap from and I can only picture this big cauldron full of tuna mush they put in the cans.<br /><br />This is different, completely different. I almost got scared off by the couple of bad reviews, and maybe it used to be better, but I have no idea, its still pretty damned good.<br /><br />It's like they sliced off a filet of the tuna and put it in a can ... exactly what I am used to. In my opinion you need to add some salt, but I eat it right from the can, its that good.<br /><br />Its a big deal having to buy 12 cans when you are not sure if you'll like it, so I found some at a local supermarket (it was kinda hard to find) and tried one can before I bought the 12.<br /><br />Ok, onto the tuna itself, Skipjack, I'd never heard of it. I have bought and tried both. The Albacore, in my opinion is definitely better, but it has WAY more calories per can. Now, the calories are mostly from fat, and its good fat, so not the end of the world. I still think the skipjack is a healthier option, but it definitely tastes leaner (and hence kinda more dry). I ended up buying both from Amazon on subscribe and save (6 pack of the albacore, and this 12 pack).<br /><br />Go for it if you like tuna. Its a lot to shell out for tuna if you don't eat it that often, but it was $4 a can at my local store, and that made it almost too expensive (I don't like it THAT much), so this really was the best option.

review/text: This tuna is so good.  I've used it on salads for lunch, baked fish patty's and tuna and noodles.  Since it doesn't have oil it is low in fat.  This tuna comes as a large chunk of fish and when you break it apart there isn't any of the mushy or ground up tuna in the can.  This is the only tuna we buy anymore.  BPA free can is also a big plus as well as bing the lowest in mercury content.

review/summary: Would be Five Star if can was BPA free
review/text: This tuna is the best tasting canned tuna I've ever purchased in a can.  Wild Planet used to label their tuna cans BPA free.  Wild Planet paid for it's own testing of the cans and the results came back BPA positive several times so they removed the BPA Free label from the tuna cans.  The last news I could find on their website was that they were continuing to search for a solution to this problem.

review/text: During both of my pregnancies I craved tuna voraciously.  I like that this is lower in mercury and contains all its natural fats. And it's so tasty. I can eat some tuna now without feeling like I might harm my baby. I think the body craves what it needs but high mercury is worrisome<br />  I'd happily pay double for this if they would process if in the USA but I understand trying to keep prices low. For those who whine about price, you get what you pay for ;)

review/summary: BPA-Free Can + Low Mercury
review/text: There are a few inaccuracies in some of the customer reviews for this product. The can is indeed BPA-free. And Greenpeace gave Wild Planet a 65% rating for the sustainability and equitability of tuna sourcing, the highest of any other canned tuna producer. This product has a lab reported mercury content of 0.0768ppm, significantly less than the 0.4500ppm contained in most popular brands. All of that aside, however, this tuna tastes fresh straight from the can and contains only two ingredients (tuna and sea salt). At the price being offered by Amazon, it is a real value (my local grocer charges $2.99+ per can). When I buy food I want to do more than enjoy the taste and provide nourishment, I also want to support companies that are conscious of the impact of their decisions and therefore act responsibly. Wild Planet satisfies all of my purchase criteria and will hopefully continue to do so.

Not that the prodcuts isn't good, but there is no difference in my opinion, to the stuff that I eat in water or in oil. It's all good. For the life of me, I can never really find something that is just so much better that warrants the high price-- they all work the same.<br /><br />Almost $5 a can?? NO WAY would I ever do this again. I am very much happier buying my $1.00 cans of Albecore.<br /><br />The one thing that I will give this tuna is that it is very juicy!! Now that may be because I am used to the dry Albecore, but nonetheless, that is a plus!<br /><br />I still give it a 5 because it's still good and tasty!

review/text: I first discovered this tuna at a health food type grocery store. Being pregnant, the low mercury caught my eye. I love that it is sustainably caught as well. I'm so glad I looked it up on Amazon because I was paying $3.79 per can! Make sure not to drain it as the can notes. I didn't see that the first time I used it. It's packed in it's own juices-not water. My favorite way to eat it is in a salad nicoise with green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, black olives, olive oil and vinegar, and salt and pepper. Yum!

review/summary: The Best I Have Ever Had
review/text: I was running low on tuna and decided to see what Amazon had to offer.  The reviews were good for this brand, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I am so glad that I did!<br /><br />The most important thing is that this tuna tastes delicious.  For a quick sandwich, I just mix it with a little bit of mayo, and that's all it needs.  You can probably eat this right out of the can, if that is your preference.  With a little bit of diced red onion and diced celery, this is even better.  I have tried most of my supermarket's brands, and this beats it bar-none.  This tuna is also denser and comes in what I would describe as a "tuna steak."  It can be a bit more challenging to mash, but it is worth it.<br /><br />Secondly, this is some very guilt-free tuna.  Firstly, it is sustainably caught.  Secondly, this tuna has the lowest amount of mercury, so you don't have to worry about mercury levels as much.  And, of course, last but not least, this brand's canning process retains all the good-for-you omega-3 oils without adding any liquid.  There is no need to drain (and in fact, it's better for you if you don't).<br /><br />The price is higher than your run of the mill tuna, but it is worth it for what you are getting.

review/summary: Processed in Vietnam??!!
review/text: After all the rave reviews, I was excited to try this tuna, as I try to eat healthy, clean foods.  I can't say for 100% certainty, but when I ordered this a few weeks ago, I'm almost certain nowhere did it say that it was processed in Vietnam.  If I had seen it, I would have avoided it.  We all know by now that food that is imported from other countries lacks good quality control standards.  For all I know, I'm eating carp from a drainage ditch.  Too bad a US based company can't have the fish processed in the US.  In any case, as far as taste went, I had one can after discovering where it was processed and I thought it was awfully strong tasting and that was in a tuna salad of free range, organic fed chicken eggs, pickles and homemade mayonnaise.  In other words, there was plenty of other tastes going on and I could still really taste the twang of the tuna.  I'm still debating if I feel comfortable enough with this tuna enough to try any more of it.  If I do, I think I'll try rinsing it in water first.

review/text: I love tuna just plain on a piece of bread with a pickle. I was anxious to try this brand for all the great reviews, healthy stuff and good for the environment. However if you eat this tuna plain as I do, you may hate it also. I tasted and poured the broth over the sandwich which I'm assuming only made the salt worse. Maybe a decent choice for those who mix their tuna with alot of other ingredients to lose the salt, but almost inedible my way. I will stick with my favorite brand Polar and pray the extra mercury doesn't get me.

review/summary: Wild Skipjack may be my favorite FOOD!
review/text: Here's a thank you to Smashing Wool's [and another one] review for noting the can lining for this tuna is BPA-free.  I was wondering about that; I'm glad I took time to reread that review prior to posting mine. [As will be evident, I read and benefited from each of the reviews here when I posted mine. Thank you!]<br /><br />I was sparked by SW's reminder of different ways to use tuna besides immediately snarfing it out of the can [one of the reasons I was curious about BPA].  Sometimes I leave some in the can and dump the rest into a pretty glass bowl, then snarf it after setting the can down for Arzel, my godly cat. She has to wait for what I leave in the can for her when I use the first method [I don't like to torture my cat with that type of wait].<br /><br />I love this tuna so much and have missed real tuna for so many years of increasing takeover of soybean ooze, I dropped back to inhaling this TUNA unadulterated, after I [thank God, Jeff Bezos, and Amazon Customer Reviews] discovered this divine presentation.<br /><br />In my first purchase I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EYBB3A">Wild Planet Wild Albacore Tuna No Salt</a>. It sold me on all counts of its advertised positives, including the fact that the can is packed with big chunks of tuna MEAT which hasn't been smashed down into mush with lots of limp water and/or tons of soybean oil sludge.<br /><br />The Albacore was PRIME, but I missed the uniquely natural, intensely healthy saltiness which identifies tuna to me [anyone interested could read Dr. Batmanghelidj's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823">Obesity Cancer & Depression</a>, if he wants to know about the healing qualities of the right type of salt]. So I tried this Skipjack version to see if it had more of the SALTY tuna taste I crave.  A habit suddenly dissipated, a habit I had worked into with the Albacore, after a few cans of Skipjack had been digested unadulterated, with YUM in every bite.<br /><br />In my long ago history of a sort of youth, when I could still see what tuna MEAT looked like in the can by evidence of it from a few un-smashed chunks big enough for human vision to register... way back then, I relished mixing mayo, chopped onions, garlic, celery, and sweet Gerkin's, etc., into canned tuna, for a sandwich or salad.  Yeah, as a 1947 born Baby Boomer I also made curried tuna casseroles and fresh dill laced pot pies; I prepared tuna in black-olive-and-mushroom studded, black-peppered gravy [or topped with chopped onions and melted Swiss cheese], and generously slipped it over a fully toasted bun or bagel, etc.<br /><br />With this new dozen can collection of this Skipjack tuna, I found myself wanting to renew and expand that almost sacred recipe-rhapsody, minus soy, plus old-days healthy mayo; minus freshly-conjured, GMO-miasma-dredged additives; minus waste products declared illegal to touch or breathe being dumped into food products; you know, minus all that crud intelligent insects crawl away from when they'll live and flourish on genetically unmodified crude oils.  Other much older living Kindoms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, insects, etc., maybe have developed a type of sentience, even wisdom we might not ever achieve, though I do have hope [not the fake-hype type].<br /><br />Oops. I may have turned over the tuna box and set my feet onto it, lol. Maybe that's a hint I should look for some organic, non GMO, no soy soap?<br /><br />ANYway.  I searched Amazon for an organic, no GMO, NO SOY mayo so I could begin to reconnect with my yums of youth, which I may have never actually had... I did have honest "yums"; it's the youth I question.  I may be getting one of those now, an attitude of youth, even though I'm dying from anti-nutrients not only passed off as, but pushed as "food"?<br /><br />Let the blessings begin, though they probably began with this Slipjack tuna. Here's the blessing I discovered and bought [which I hope I live long enough to review with high level rapture]:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XH8T8U">Wilderness Family Mayonnaise, Certified Organic, 16 fl. oz. jar</a><br /><br />That mayo and its family of producers is clearly blessed.<br /><br />But this Skipjack tuna is so good, I finally quit adding even this mayo to it [not to worry, this type of mayo has a universe full of yum-and-yell "yes!" uses].<br /><br />I take time to scoop the solid tuna meat out of the can and into a cut-glass, fancy dish only to leave some of it in the can for Arzel, though sometimes I put hers in cut-glass, too... until I realized she likes the can method because she can lick the tuna juice clean off the inside... which brings us back to what inspired this comment turned review:<br /><br />Thank you, SW, for each detail in your review, especially for answering the BPA question I had in the back of my mind when I took time to reread.<br /><br />As has been becoming a new habit, I meant to make a brief, off the top comment under a review I particularly appreciated, and ended up with more than the review I intended to write next.  Maybe there's some type of magic in a comment box which works for me even better than the review form, though I like the ease of that setup, too.<br /><br />I opened a can of Skipjack before heading out to a local cafe for breakfast this morning; forked lifted some of the thick, lusciously dense meat into my cut-glass bowl, and left a good portion in the can for Arzel. I snarfed up several bites  [from my bowl] before storing the remainder in the fridge. I considered eating a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAO">Larabar Ginger Snap</a>, too, in defense against the varieties of soy I would be eating next, but didn't want to upset my appetite for a DENNY'S senior omelet. Hey! DENNY's is an icon from my youth. I wouldn't abandon it in its struggle through the dark ages of soy. [During one of my Dark Ages in February 1985 in Portland, Oregon, a Denny's ambiance, one-egg-breakfast helped lift my spirit out of a black hole. I began writing my first novel there, that morning, truly on the back of an envelop.]<br /><br />I believe in getting a healthy core of food into me whenever possible, to counteract the soybean overwhelm I always try to work my soul around when eating in cherished restaurants of various types and locations, where I set up my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LB4A32">Samsung NF210-A03 10.1-Inch Netbook</a> and type, type, type.<br /><br />[Actually my beloved do-everything netbook, which I bought from Amazon, is a Samsung N220 Plus, but it's not available here currently, so I linked a comparable one above.]<br /><br />Someday maybe GM enhanced Organisms will connect their significant intelligence with some of the innocent good people residing within the GMO soybean pushers paradigm... and communicate to them what REAL FOOD is and precisely why it's real.

review/summary: "Best Gift Ever!"
review/text: If you are really hoping to make a splash or want your gift recipient to feel like royalty, then these roses are the way to go.  I used the seller link to ask when I should place my order to have them arrive in time for Mother's Day, and had a helpful response from Sergio within 24 hours.  After placing my order, I received another email telling me to alert the recipient to expect a morning delivery from FedEx.  This is crucial because someone has to sign for them (or leave a note), and the flowers shouldn't be left in the sun.  My Mom was overwhelmed with the number and quality of the roses.  She said that they didn't smell much initially, but as they warmed up the buds opened and the fragrance filled the whole house.  She can't stop talking about them and has bragged to all her friends.  She insists that they are the "best gift ever!"<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between these flowers from Spring is in the Air or ProFlowers, then it's no contest.  These may cost more, but you get what you pay for--responsive customer service and roses straight from the field to your loved one in 24-48 hours.  No middleman, so the cost comes from shipping.  If you read the ProFlower reviews, you'll see that only half of their customers are happy with the results. With Spring is in the Air, I'm confident that any problem would be remedied quickly and favorably and that the only potential difficulties would be with delivery. Provided that someone is home to sign as instructed, you'll have roses worth bragging about.

If I can figure out how to permanently attach it to the wall, I would say it was worth buying, but right now, I don't recommend it.

review/summary: Good Southern Tasting Chicory Flavored Coffee
review/text: I have used this "Southern" coffee before, so my reorder speaks for itself. The coffee has a great balanced and flavorful chicory flavor. Chicory is an acquired taste, so it may not appeal to everyone. However, for those to like the hearty chicory flavor, you will like this instant coffee. I tried the same brand chicory coffee in the regular brew, but it didn't taste as good as the instant coffee version. I found that a little unusual, as you would expect just the opposite. If you like chicory blended coffee, you will like this product.

review/summary: Fresh, organic and 100% pure
review/text: It is surreal how difficult it is to get rye flour in hawaii; that is to say impossible, until Amazon started delivering it.  I have made something of a project of sourdough this year and have starters going from white, wheat and mixtures; however the best sourdough comes from rye... well, at least it is the easiest to culture, and is a natural (has a lot of wild yeast in the flour).  Sadly I was unable to get a starter going until now.  Thanks to Amazon I now have a wild yeast pure rye, as well as one started with a pinch of my wheat starter,  It says something about the freshness and quality that the starter was foaming after one day!  I have already made rye bread using a culture started from this flour, and no yeast was necessary :)<br /><br />Beyond that, I like that it is packed in small bags, as I have to store it in the freezer to combat the tropical humidity and pests.  I also like that it is 100% rye, not a mixture like so many others.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon :)  Without this service I would have the trappings of western civilization largely off limits but for when I travel.  i really appreciate having access to the foods I grew up with, and ingredients I need to cook what I like.... which is pretty much the only way to get those things here.  It is nice having fresh rye bread again :) (ah, the little things we take for granted, until they are out of reach)

review/summary: Great flour and great value
review/text: I live in a large metropolitan area, but can't find rye flour without driving all over town.  And when it do find it, the price is astronomical.  Buying from Amazon is a great solution for me.<br /><br />My rye bread recipe only calls for two cups of rye flour for five loaves, so it takes me a little while to go through a bag of rye, but I pour these bags into a plastic storage container like I do with all my other flours and grains.  That keeps the critters out of them and keeps the flour from getting too hot and rancid.<br /><br />I probably won't need any more rye flour until later this year, but when I do, I'll be glad to buy another six-pack from Amazon.<br /><br />Oh, and what about the product itself?  This rye flour is so incredibly delicious!  The flavor is really great and not overpowering.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />6.5 cups warm water<br />3.5 tablespoons yeast (heaping)<br />3 tablespoons salt (level)<br />3 tablespoons caraway seed (heaping) - plus a few generous pinches on top of the loaves at baking<br />2 cups rye flour<br />10 cups unbleached white flour (level)<br /><br />Mix the ingredients and let the dough sit overnight in the fridge in a 12qt plastic tub with a loose lid.  Then form the loaves the next day, let them sit for 30 minutes, and then bake at 450* for 30 minutes (longer for bigger loaves).<br /><br />It's the perfect deli rye.  Mmmm!

I am pleased rye flour lasts a long time in the freezer.<br /><br />Caution for anyone who places flours or grains in the freezer, enclose in plastic bags. I found out the hard way when there was an extended power failure, the freezer defrosting. The bag on the bottom got soggy and I had to toss it. I put the rest of the quantity of rye flour in zip-bags. Nice that some flours, Bob's Mills for instance, comes in 'plastic'.<br /><br />Ok... taste good - buy it!

Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice."  Sounds pretty good doesn't it?  Makes you believe you are going to receive coffee from all over the world.  And just a small notice, nothing major, but we may not have every coffee in the picture available when we put together your box.  Though, never fear, we will replace it with something equally exotic and exciting.  That doesn't sound like a terrible trade off so I placed the order.  Here's what I received, a white box with what looked like a home made label with all the coffees jumbled inside without any packing to keep them organized.  Now for the flavors, more than half are doubles, a few triples and more than 50% are some variation on "French Vanilla".  Defnitely do not recommend.

review/text: I ordered this package because 12 of the listed coffees were what I had put in my cart at bigcatcoffee.com to try and I thought it was worth paying a higher price per cup to not have to buy 5 cups at a time in case I didn't like the coffee.  I only received 10 of the products listed, there were 5 decaf coffees which wasn't listed and I do not have any use for decaf coffee. I didn't receive Jet Fuel; Sumatran Reserve; Southern Pecan; Italian Roast, Breakfast in Bed; Hawaiian Hazelnut; Jamaica Me Crazy; Rodeo Drive; Vienna Coffee House; India Spice Chai Tea.  I realize there is a disclaimer that the product may not be exactly as listed but to not have 50% of the coffees and to receive 3 of some of them when they weren't even listed was very disappointing.  The coffees that filled in the missing products had 8 I would never consider buying and only 4 that I would consider buying.  If you are wanting a sample pack to keep on hand for company or if you like a lot of flavored coffees and decaf then this might be a good buy for you; however, if you are wanting this to try coffees from all over then I would not recommend this product for you.

review/text: I enjoyed the variety of coffees that were made available.  My concern was that the K-cups were just haphazardly thrown into the shipping box which leads me to believe that they originally came from broken cases.  Not a comfortable feeling about that.  But the selection was very good.

review/summary: Not quite what I wanted
review/text: I had anticipated getting this as a gift. Needless to say the loose packaging is not going to allow me to do so (at least not gift giving to my standards). I can't give my best friend a cardboard box full of k-cups. I expected standard sampler packaging at least in its own box with labeling etc. The one good thing is that I have a keurig of my own so I will be keeping this for me and ordering her something different. The bad is that now I have to come up with something else...and more money to get her a sampler pack that is gift-worthy.

review/summary: K cup gift pack is a good value
review/text: I bought this as a gift after doing some quick comparison shopping and it seemed to be a good value. My brother was pleased with the wide variety of K-Cups and is looking forward to trying them all. I can't imagine that the included print adds value to the package though.

review/summary: World Sampler hits the spot
review/text: Travel the World Sampler Pack for Keurig hits the spot. The variety is not only fun to select from but also introduces you to perhaps your new favorite hot beverage.  If you want to become familiar with various k-cup options, Travel the World is an excellent start.

review/summary: Couldn't be happier...unless I'd bought more
review/text: I love my Keurig Elite, enjoy trying different varieties of coffee, and am always looking for a good deal on K-cups.  So despite several negative reviews, I couldn't resist taking a chance on this Travel the World Sampler on sale at just under fifty cents per cup.  I am so glad I did!  Granted, as some previous reviews pointed out, the K-cups do get jumbled around in a box that's a little too large (could hold 7 more K-cups) so the packaging is not ideal for gift-giving, but all of the K-cups looked to be in good condition, and I was thrilled with the variety.  Virtually every kind mentioned was in the box.  Unlike some previous reviewers, I got NO duplicates, and there were only a few varieties that I had already tried.  There were 8 kinds of tea.  Coffees were as follows:<br /><br />Green Mountain: French Roast, Columbian Fair Trade Select, Nantucket Blend, Nantucket Blend Iced, Vermont Country Blend, Vermont Country Blend Decaf, Kenyan AA, Sumatran Reserve, Lake & Lodge, Wild Mountain Blueberry, Southern Pecan, French Vanilla, French Vanilla Decaf<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck:  Rodeo Dr. Blend, Sumatra Kopi Raya, Chef's Reserve Colombian, Chef's Reserve Colombian Decaf, Hawaiian Hazelnut, Vienna Coffee House, French Roast, Jamaica Me Crazy, Sorrento<br /><br />Tully's: Italian Roast, French Roast, French Roast Decaf<br /><br />Coffee People:  Jef Fuel<br /><br />Caribou:  Colombia<br /><br />I haven't looked at all the expiration dates, but the few I looked at were a few months in the future, which is good enough for me.  I can't wait to try all of these varieties, so I'm sure to finish them all in time.  I only wish I had bought one for my parents (and maybe another for myself) before they went off sale.

review/summary: I'm happy
review/text: I hesitated to buy this based on many of the reviews, but the price reached a point that I thought it would be worth it even if the variety wasn't there.  I'm not here to change anybody's mind, only to report what I received.  My box came complete with exactly 35 k-cups.  I had 8 kinds of tea, mostly different brands of black tea...and one chai, one roobios and one decaf.  I had 4 different kinds of decaf coffee, different brands/flavors.  The rest were all regular caffeinated coffee-- all different types and flavors and not a single repeat in the bunch.  I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase and happy to try so many different kinds to find my favorites.  The outer box for the whole collection had an expiry label marked 04/12, but the individual cups almost all have an expiry in 08/12.

review/text: I was a skeptic about this product order from some of the reviews but placed an order anyway, I got a great deal of $17.10 for the 35 cups. All 35 cups were there, great variety no duplicates as some reviewers have stated. Love Amazon hope to run across more great deals!

review/summary: Guess I got Lucky...
review/text: I actually read the reviews of this sampler pack AFTER I placed the order so I was concerned that I would get a box half full of broken K-Cups and the other half would be nothing but decaf french roast or something. Fortunately for me, not a single cup was broken or unusable, and the selection was EXACTLY the same as described and depicted in the product description. not sure if whoever packs these boxes has improved their quality control or what, but my only criticism is the way they loosely pack them in the shipping box. Other than that, very happy with the purchase.

review/summary: Come on, Amazon, these "samplers" are a rip-off
review/text: I ordered this sampler along with the "Extra Bold" sampler, which I've already reviewed.<br /><br />This sampler was more disappointing than the other. Very different mix from that advertised. Among my 35 K-cups are 3 that are for ICED coffee - they say "Brew Over Ice." Well, most of us don't have the Keurig that does that. Nothing to do with these but toss them into the trash.<br /><br />Also included without advertisement were 4 that are decaf. That is a major foul, Amazon! Into the trash with those too. So one fifth of these - 7 out of 35 - are completely useless to me.<br /><br />There were 5 teas as opposed to the 3 advertised. Fortunately, I do like a variety of teas.<br /><br />Among the other coffee K-cups, most were included on the list on the product page, but some were not. Not a big deal. A sampler is a sampler.<br /><br />But I think Amazon should state the apparent truth on these pages: These "Crazy Cups" samplers are probably a way for Amazon to recoup losses when someone returns an opened package of K-cups, or they have boxes that are damaged, or whatever. They just count them out and toss them into a carton at random, and ship it. It's not a genuine retail product.<br /><br />Not bad if you haven't tried a lot of different K-cup varieties and just want a bunch of different ones to check out, but don't expect an exact match to what's listed on the product page. I will say, this assortment had zero duplications, whereas the "Extra Bold" sampler (MUCH of which was not extra bold) had 3 of one variety, and many duplications. However, if I ordered the same samplers again, I wouldn't expect them to match up much at all with the previous purchases. I really think this is just Amazon's ways of getting rid of hurts and returns, and you get what you get.<br /><br />By the way, "frustration-free" packaging just means Amazon is being cheap. Throw stuff into a box loose and stick a piece of tape on it. It was NOT frustration-free, because it had a shipping label that has the packing slip stuck to the back of it. It had "tear here first" tear strips that do not come off, so no access to the packing slip without tearing it up.<br /><br />I'm editing this to add that I have just noticed that another reviewer said that as of 12/31/11, Amazon was sending these in nice giftable boxes. NOT anymore as of 1/6/12. Just a plain shipping carton, with loose K-cups. DO NOT expect something you can present as a gift without some creative repackaging of your own, and if you don't mind giving some K-cups that look pretty beat up.

review/summary: Nice sampler to try different varieties
review/text: This was a nice (and hard to find!) sampler pack with a wide variety of coffee.  I was able to try a lot of varieties and figure out which ones I liked without being locked into buying a large pack of one kind.  A must for folks just getting into the kcup world ... would also make a nice gift.

review/summary: K-Cups dumped in a cardboard box.
review/text: This is not a 'pack' of K-Cups.  This is a bunch of K-Cups dumped in a cardboard box.  How am I to present this as a gift to someone for Christmas?  "Here's a box K-Cups, scattered loosely around an oversized box. Merry Christmas".  What a joke.

review/summary: Good Grab Bag
review/text: I received this sampler pack as a gift. Of the 35 cups, there were approximately 5-10 duplicates--not a bad number overall. This particular pack also seemed a bit weighted toward the Green Mountain brand.<br /><br />Yes, the packaging is rather plain, but the cups arrive in good shape, and isn't that what really matters? The expiration date was approximately two months out, but that's not too bad for a pack of 35 coffees.<br /><br />All told, it made an excellent start to exploring the variety of k-cups offered.

review/summary: I love the variety!  The included print was a bit...odd.
review/text: This is a good value and all of the coffees were different, which I like.  There's nothing worse than getting a sampler pack with duplicates.  I do wish there was a decaf included.<br /><br />  I have to agree with the first review about the print.  No added value to the purchase.  I might find a cheap frame for it, however.  But birds eating coffee beans?  I just don't get it.

review/summary: Great mix of K Cups
review/text: I got this for a great deal and couldn't be happier with the selection.  I received 35 K Cups as ordered and it was a nice mix of teas and coffees.  Perfect for someone like me who is wanting to sample many different varieties of coffee without having to buy a standard box of 16 cups.  They arrived quickly.<br /><br />There were two downfalls and they were: 1. The cups expire on April 1 which doesn't leave me a whole lot of time to drink them and 2. The cups arrived in a plain brown box.  They weren't stacked neatly or protected very well but luckily none of them were ripped open.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisifed. :-)

review/summary: TERRIFIC DEAL VIA AMAZON WAREHOUSE
review/text: I took a chance on this through Amazon Warehouse for $17 and so glad I did.  Think I will order another one while the Amazon Warehouse still has them in stock for $17!  Im a decaf drinker, but I fgured one cup a day would be OK.  I love the assortment I got, which I have listed below. They must ship different flavors with each different order.  I received NO DUPLICATES and only a few decafs.  I received 8 teas and 27 coffees.  Within coffees, only 2 decaf and one for an iced coffee which I have not tried yet.  All 6 I have tried so far are delish - but the Green Mountain Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve really wound me up - must have alot of caffeine in it.  Tully's, Green Mountain, Wolfgang Puck and Cariboue coffees.  Twinings, Celestial and Gloria Jean's for the teas.  Bon appetit!

review/summary: Good combination, just wish it was all coffee...
review/text: Several earlier reviews complained about the mix of coffees in this - I'm hoping that what I got was a result of the seller reading these reviews, as I got an excellent mix with few (if any) multiples.<br /><br />My gripe is that I also got three decaf and five teas. I really, really wish that sellers would make their combo selections regular coffee-only, decaf-only, or tea-only. Mostly because I don't drink decaf at all, and when I drink tea, I only drink simple english teas (no need for green tea or flavored teas).<br /><br />Please please PLEASE offer regular coffee only samplers!<br /><br />Thanks!
