review/summary: Great coffee, even pre-ground
review/text: I was really pleased with the flavor of this coffee. I usually buy whole beans and grind in my coffee maker/grinder just prior to brewing. It was only available on sale pre-ground, so I went for it. The flavor is smooth, full and rich. I'm very happy with it, and would buy it again.

review/summary: The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Hand roasted, Med Roast, Colombia Ground Coffee
review/text: I am a coffee nut & very particular about my blend.  I used to be hooked on Seattle's Best, Henry's Blend until they changed formula and went to the number ID for their blends, NOT the same, my endless search began.  Months later I tried the med. roast Colombian Narino blend at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf store and was quite impressed.  I purchase through Amazon subscribe & save program, the same blend.  The in store grind is more robust & sharper in flavor but the convenience of subscribe & save and taste is fine for me and I look forward to each month's delivery.

review/text: My husband & I have been on a tight budget & miss our "good" coffee(Starbucks.)  We've been drinking Folgers.  When I saw this deal I figured how bad could it be?  Honestly, I would rather drink our Folgers.  This coffee was so weak that we had to add an extra scoop of grinds.  I can't believe this stuff has good reviews.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Not only it is always delivered next day without any extra charge, but product is a great quality. My daughter has formula at a night time since she was born and we used to buy another organic brand. We switched to Gerber gentle start, because it has less iron than any other formula, but my child stopped eating it in about 2 months. I was in panic as I did not have enough of my own milk and tried all other available brands and she would not drink any formula. I have read a lot of reviews and decided to order this brand. What a relief! She loves it! As a reply to previous review: try to smell "Gerber"..........

review/text: There was a horrible smell to the formula that only intensified when mixed as directed. My son refused to get anywhere near this formula. I thought he was over reacting so I tried to taste it and nearly lost my lunch! Seemed like a great product until we recieved it. Save your money any find something else. Got this product because it was labeled gluten free. For other celiacs out there... enfamil is totally gluten free as well and my son was happy to drink it.

I am planning to use this product for her little sister as well.<br /><br />No weird smell...it actually smells WAY better than most other formula options.

review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer.  The formula smelled like the metal can it was packaged in and my son refused it as well. The ingredients are worth 5 stars and I hope the company can package it differenty (if that indeed is the reason) because it is quite pricey for such an issue and not worth it if my infant won't drink it.

Needless to say, I said "this will probably be the last time I order off of Amazon" but when I checked my mail box it was placed in there. I went back in and made myself a cup of coffee and my oh my, it was worth the wait. Next time I may get Level 4 though not to say 3 wasn't good but just to try.

review/text: I am a gin and tonic man. I like to drink them dirty with extra olives. The problem I had was I never had enough olive juice from the olive jars. So, I stumbled across the Boscoli Dirty Martini Olive Juice on the internet and thought I would give it a try. I have to say that I use it with my gin and tonics and you cannot tell the difference between using the Boscoli juice and the olive juice from the olive jar. So, if you like you drinks "dirty," I recommend trying the Boscoli.

review/summary: Fast and easy with good flavor
review/text: The iced tea K-cups are more expensive than the coffee, but even so, the convenience has made them a winner with me.  The effort to make a single glass of freshly brewed iced tea is sufficiently daunting that I was never inspired to do it.  I'm not a fan of the bottled or instant versions and don't drink enough to warrant making a whole pitcher so I rarely drank iced tea at all even though I like it, particularly with lemon, until I discovered this stuff.  When I tried the sample pack of iced teas I received with an order of coffees, this lemon appealed to me the most and I've been reordering it ever since.  It suits my need for speed and ease and I find the flavor as good as fresh brewed.<br /><br />I use a pint Mason jar since I don't have a proper 16 oz glass that can withstand the initial heat.  It's a bit rustic, but it works fine.  You fill the glass with ice cubes and using one of the lower volume settings on your brewer, you let the hot tea fall directly into the ice filled glass.  Within a few seconds, it's chilled and ready to drink.<br /><br />Even though this is supposed to be pre-sweetened tea, it's not sweet enough for me and I add more sugar or Stevia.  To me it tastes fresh brewed with just the right amount of lemon and is done in seconds.  Since there are other teas I'm very fond of in K-cups, I tried the same method to make iced tea from those, but it doesn't work because they get too diluted.  This type is stronger and stands up to the extra dilution from the ice.  It provides me just the cooling pick-me-up I need during these super hot days.  Recommended to those who enjoy iced tea and appreciate a quick and effective preparation method.

review/text: In my opinion these are quite weak and a little bitter. I think the bitterness results from the added artificial sweeteners but I am not positive. In order to end up with a drinkable glass of tea you have to brew the smallest cup size on the brewer. What you end up with is a lot of melted ice and a watered down gross cup of "tea". Not impressed and won't be purchasing again.

review/summary: Best K-Cup Iced Tea
review/text: I love my Keurig machine, but I live in Texas and iced tea is a necessity for some native Texans.<br /><br />Even if you don't like iced tea cold drinks are usually the preferred drink in Texas what with the highest recorded temperatures and the most consecutive days of 100+ degree weather in a very long time.<br /><br />This tea smells great when brewing, and even though the lemon is artificial (What do you expect? They can't fit a fresh lemon in that K-Cup) it's a very accurate lemon flavor and in a concentration that I really like; not too powerful and not too weak. If you want more lemon, then go pick some and add as needed (that actually tastes really good and almost gives it a half & half taste).<br /><br />There's a (common sense) warning not to brew into glass for the obvious reasons (hot + cold + glass = cracked glass). When adding the ice leave about a quarter to a half inch at the top of open space to avoid overflows. I also go ahead and add my 3 packets of Splenda on top of the ice before brewing. I have big crate & barrel glasses & I use the large cup setting on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO">Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. As long as I don't fill to the top with ice it gives me a full glass of tea and is already cold pretty much the second it's done.

review/summary: Tasty, Lemony Tea
review/text: I normally drink a lot of tea and coffee but find it difficult to spend the money on tea for the Keurig because tea bags are a much better price per cup and I was skeptical about how flavorful a K-Cup tea would be.  That being said, I have been pleasantly surprised about the flavor of this tea and would purchase it again.  I typically make the tea in a 24 oz Tervis Tumbler using the largest cup setting.  This ends up being the perfect combination once the ice is added to the cup.  If you like lemon flavored tea, you will probably enjoy this tea; however, if you do not like the flavor of lemon, I would look into purchasing a different flavor of tea.  The flavor is a typical black tea that has a pretty strong lemon flavor that can be a bit strong as you get to the bottom of the glass.  You can actually smell the lemon scent when you take a drink. Also, if you do end up purchasing this tea and find that it is not strong enough as prepared with ice, make the tea without ice and leave in the fridge overnight.

review/summary: Great iced tea
review/text: I love lemon iced tea and found these k-cups to be a great way to brew up a quick iced tea. I use the tall cup setting, fill a large glass full of ice and let the hot tea run down over the ice. I prefer unsweetened tea and found this tea to be just right for me, but others may like to add a little sweetener to theirs, as you would any other tea.

review/summary: Overwhelming lemon
review/text: This flavor was included in a variety pack we received with our new Kuerig and I was very excited to see I could make iced tea. This flavor has an overwhelming lemon flavor and bitter after taste. I love iced tea with lemon so I was pretty sure I would like it but my entire family thought this did not taste like tea, rather bitter lemon.

review/summary: VERY bitter
review/text: First, I wantg to say that I am a lemon fanatic. I eat lemons like oranges. So I would assume the bitter taste that I get when I drink this tea is not because of the lemon. It is the tea. It is so bitter to me that I will give these away or throw them away. The first word that came out of my mouth after I took the first sip was NASTY!!!!!

review/summary: Kong Paste
review/text: This stuff is fabulous.  I have a real chewer, and she knows how to break up the cookies almost immediately by throwing the Kong against the walls and into the air.  By spraying some paste on the inside walls of the Kong, she has to spend some extra time with it, keeping her busy longer!  They absolutely love this stuff - I can hide them anywhere and they know the minute they enter the room that they're around.  Wonderful product.

review/summary: Oh, the gas! The horrible, horrible gas...
review/text: Let's get one thing straight first: dogs love this stuff. I mean they REALLY LOVE IT. Not just my puppy, but every dog in my office - the second this stuff comes out, my desk is surrounded by noses that smelled it from across the office. And they want it so bad they'll watch wistfully as my puppy devours it, just a little bit, from his Kong. When he's done, they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there's any left.<br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench. By the time we get home, even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end, not entirely sure what's going on back there but knowing it's probably not good. By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow, no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done, I won't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.<br /><br />I think today was the last time he'll be getting it, and the rest of the can is going in the trash. It's just not worth it!

However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!<br /><br />However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!

review/text: Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6">KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>) first, then "anchor" it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz.........

review/text: This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale.

review/summary: Careful with this!
review/text: When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this "puppy goo".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!

review/summary: Using to give my dog her daily medicines
review/text: My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.

That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs.

review/text: I haven't tried it, nor will I.  There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me.  90% of the soy and corn crops are genetically modified (RoundUp Ready--gee they come with their very own pesticide grown in!) and unless it says organic or non-GMO, it's guaranteed to be GM.  I won't eat GM products, and I don't feed them to my livestock or my pets.

review/summary: Convenient, delicious, and long shelf life
review/text: We've used Yoder's canned meats for several years, mainly for quick meals when we come home late from the ball field and everyone is hungry.  We also keep some on hand for emergencies since the meat is fully cooked and ready to eat without any lengthy preparations.  I like that the cans contain only meat and salt, no added ingredients or preservatives.  The liquid you find in the can is from the meat itself.  I especially like that the cans have a very long shelf life if kept at normal household temperatures.<br /><br />This variety pack is a great way to try canned meats and see for yourself how convenient and delicious they are.  One thing to remember is that the meat has been pressure cooked in the can, so it won't be all firm chunks when you use it.  It has recognizable chunks, but some of it will be more like shredded meat.  Each can contains 28 oz., which is plenty to feed a large family.<br /><br />The beef chunks are great in curries and chili.  I use the turkey and chicken in noodle casserole dishes, although the chicken also goes well in curry.  The pork makes an awesome pulled pork sandwich with the addition of BBQ sauce.  The pork sausage is wonderful in omelets, although I usually fry it a little and pour off the grease before adding eggs.  I do the same pre-cooking with the hamburger, since it does have a little fat in it.  After draining, I use the hamburger in dirty rice or spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />I can't recommend Yoder's canned meats enough - the wholesome ingredients, the convenience of having precooked, shelf stable meats, and the variety are well worth the cost.

review/summary: not too much chocolate flavor
review/text: I purchased this chocolate sauce mostly to make mocha drinks at home with my espresso machine. I love Da Vinci syrups so I thought I would be pleased with the taste. I know you should expect some degree of difference between regular and sugar-free syrups but this one just tasted odd. When I add it to a latte it just doesn't taste too great. When you try a drop of it by itself, the flavor is nowhere close to regular chocolate sauce either. Probably is just hard to do sugar free chocolate sauce that taste similar to the regular. This is not the case though with Da Vinci's sugar free syrups (i.e. vanilla, caramel, almond, etc. flavors). Like I said, these I love and use everyday.

review/text: Unfortunately, it didn't have much of a chocolate taste, had a very strong chemical aftertaste, and didn't dissolve well. Ultimately, I gave it to my wife, who made chocolate muffins from it. (The baking seemed to evaporate the funny tasting chemicals, and a healthy dose of additional cocoa gave the batter more of a chocolate taste than the syrup had.) Wouldn't use this for drinks, though. Neither the consistency nor the taste is appealing.

review/summary: Great Sweetener but learn about the product
review/text: I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.

review/summary: This is a great product - (Dog owners be careful)
review/text: Great product, great company.  High quality xylitol made from corn, not birch.<br /><br />However, this stuff is very toxic to dogs.  Don't let them have any of it, not even small quantities.  If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone...".  When I tried to return the odd smelling product to them citing their money back guarantee, they went around about it and then finally agreed, but said then they would never sell anything to me ever again (!).  Wow.<br /><br />I'm sticking with NOW Foods at this point.

review/summary: Can't live without it
review/text: Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively "tested" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back.<br />I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night  to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to "testing" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom.

review/text: As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe. This will add about 4 grams of total sugar to the recipe.

review/summary: Most of the sweet, none of the yuk
review/text: I can taste artificial sweeteners from across the street.  Hate the stuff.  In a restaurant I sent a Coke back three times because they kept bringing me Diet, assuring me it was the real thing.  After the third time I suggested they check their hoses.  Sure enough, they were switched.  Hate the stuff. One sip and my mouth says, "Yuk!" for hours.  This doesn't even get into the fact that aspertame isn't fit for human consumption.<br /><br />Enter Xylitol.  I bought a box of packets to use at the office where I drink coffee.  I find I need two Xylitol packs to replace one sugar.  No matter.  It tastes fine.  I detect no aftertaste.  And it's actually good for my teeth and blood sugar level.  This is something I can like!<br /><br />My only complaint was the shipping packaging.  The box of packets was stuffed into an envelope which, of course, arrived flattened.  Packets were all over the inside.  I reformed the box and reloaded it. No biggie, but putting a rectangular cardboard box in an envelope isn't the best idea.

review/summary: Natural Sweetener
review/text: Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in "Xylichew" chewing gums.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It is commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This "NOW" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates.<br /><br />Each teaspoon contains:<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Sugar Alcohol 4g<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Protein 0g<br /><br />"Now" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes.<br /><br />When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: So this stuff taste great. It feels a lot better mentally knowing that it's a natural product and has roughly the same consistency/viscosity as real sugar/sugar crystals. There is one caveat with this product, you will likely have diarrhea until you get used to it. If you use this for coffee like myself and you like to have that coffee before work or something, i would advise you to use it when you won't have issues with that. Supposedly this will stop once you develop some kind of tolerance, but i can't vouch for that since i've used it for the last few days. Other than that i think this is a great alternative to real sugar and the chemicals in other artificial sweeteners.

review/text: I really like xylitol, it doesn't have a bad after taste like other sugar substitutes. I've tried just about all of them, even Stevia - can't stand the taste of it. The only drawback with zylitol is it doesn't mix in cold drinks - but I found a way around that. Put the zylitol in water, heat it up till it dissolves, and then put it in your drink - tried it in tea this way and it worked perfectly. It can give you gas and diarreah if you use too much - just use a small amount till you see how you react to it. This brand seems to be really good - never have had problems with it. As an added benefit it is good for your teeth.

review/summary: Great sugar substitute!
review/text: This is a great sugar substitute that is almost identical to sugar. I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry. I have had no negative reactions though by using this product. I am very happy to discover Xylitol which came from other people's reviews.

I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.  I finally tried it on some plain cereal.  I expected something like the flavor of Splenda, or maybe Equal.  At first, it was sweet like sugar and it was noticable, but it did have an aftertaste.  It was like the old articifial sweeteners.  I tried using less another time, but the result was the same.  I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad.  So, overall, it takes some getting used to.  It's not bad for being healthier than regular sugar but don't expect to be "wowed."

review/text: Yeah, don't feed it to dogs. Ok, since I'm human and I don't own dogs and if I did I wouldn't be feeding them sweetened things anyway because dogs are carnivorous, I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the plastic bag my Xylitol came in (I bought the 1 lb size) had a very strong chemical odor. I moved the Xylitol to a metal bowl for storage. NOW should use packaging that doesn't have such a strong plastic off-gassing.<br /><br />Work your way into eating Xylitol (gradually increase consumption over a period of weeks) to avoid gastrointestinal issues. Also be careful of eating too much inulin and other products that can cause a laxative/bloating/gas effect.<br /><br />This tastes good unlike NOW Erythritol which tastes rather horrid, except when making bitter chocolate.

review/text: I cannot eat sugar.  So, my alternative is Stevia or Xylitol, and my Iridologists reccomends Xylitol.  This is my second 15 lb. bag, I always give my daughter-in-law 5 lbs.  She even cooks with it.  I sparingly use it in green vegetables that tend to be bitter, but have not baked with it.  She loves it and so do I.  Have to be careful when you are a new user of Xylitol because the side effect of diarhea is real.  My son got it bad from putting it in his coffee the first time.  He uses more sugar than I do in my coffee.  Will order again

review/summary: Value!
review/text: This is a huge bag of xylitol.  We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea. I was not loving the sugar, though! My husband is diabetic and I was worried about my son having all that sugar. Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage. The large, good quality, food storage containers are expensive, but it a one time cost. We also have a smaller container for general family use that we re-fill from the larger one.<br /><br />Overall:  I will definitely buy this again!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I purchased this based solely on the reviews (highly unlike me) and I have to say I have not been disappointed with this product.  I do not recommend using a lot of it at first.  I suggest using a little bit at a time to learn your tolerance and avoid getting an upset stomach.  If you are trying to use less sugar (or no sugar) give this a try.

review/summary: Great for what it is.  Use with caution.
review/text: I think xylitol is great.  But... I gave my daughter a little in solution in the concentration tested and said to be tolerable for toddlers in a New England Journal of Medicine article.  Still, my daughter began vomiting everywhere almost immediately.  She never normally vomits.  I think the intense sweetness triggered a kind of protective response in her body.  Perhaps she thought it was poison.  Anyway, don't be dumb like me and try it on your toddler.  Reserve this product for older children and adults.
