review/summary: Dissapointed in this brand
review/text: Sad to see that these are made in China. China's pet products have horrible backgrounds, you can easily look that up anywhere. They don't treat their animals humanely and they have been caught using dead dogs to feed to dogs. If you love and respect animals, don't buy pet products from China. I like American made products because it keeps jobs here as well.

review/summary: Delicious, but would not buy again
review/text: I love the Chimes Ginger candies... or so I thought.  The sampler pack has some winners and some losers in my book, and I would just buy my favorites in the future.<br /><br />Peanut butter: the best!  Strong ginger flavor tempered by mild peanut butter.<br />Original: Unadulterated sweet ginger flavor.  The one that got me hooked.<br />Orange: Interesting sweet/sour/heat thing going on, would eat again.<br />Mango: It would help if I liked mango in the first place.  Others like these, but not me.<br />Peppermint: Ye gods, this tastes like mouthwash.  It's not well balanced and tastes more like medicine than candy.<br /><br />If you're curious about all the flavors, get this once.  Otherwise, pick your favorite flavors and stick with those.

review/summary: Great biscotti, sources harder to find
review/text: Like other reviewers, these are most enjoyable to me.  Until fairly recently, the 1-lb 14-oz container was available at a great price from our local warehouse club.  Today however, only the chocolate flavor and in some stores for the holidays the gingerbread flavor is available.  I do enjoy these but the "Originali" is my runaway favorite.  The sources for the 1-lb 14-oz container show prices 40% higher than the warehouse club, and then you have to add unreasonable shipping amounts.  So the deal now is the 12-pack of boxes of 8 for a total of 96 biscotti at a price rivaling the warehouse club.

review/summary: Nonni's Biscotti, Toffee Almond
review/text: I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive.

review/text: I've just bought this biscotti at Walmart for $2.88 an 8-pack. Wonderful flavor! Chocolate flavor, with more chocolate on the bottom, deliciously crisp, and has a nice almond flavor, too.<br />However, if you buy 12 pack at Walmart it comes to $34.56, so the price here is not that great. I just don't like when they put a price here, then cross it and make you believe there's a deal you are getting.

review/summary: Nonni's Toffee Almond & Lemon Biscottis
review/text: great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere.

review/text: This is a wonderful snack to have whenever you have a craving for something to munch.  Each box contains 8 individually wrapped biscotti.  I normally don't like biscotti, finding it too hard on my teeth and too boring for my taste.  This brand's biscotti, however, has the perfect combination of sweetness, crunchiness, and chocolaty goodness!  It's made from Kosher ingredients and 100% trans fat free.  I bought a case (pack of 12) so I can share them with my family and friends.  Highly recommended!

All are fresh, delicious and enjoyed each day. They are individually wrapped, have 100 calories each, do not have strange ingredients...and they are perfect when they are dunked into iced coffee!!!!

Occasionally supermarkets have sales on Nonni's Biscotti, and when they do, It is much more cost effective then buying their product online which is higher priced. Overall, It is a good buy when Amazon can compete with those sales prices.

review/text: This biscotti is graced with a thin layer of limon (lemon) frosting sweetness.  Not the tough biscotti that has to soak for 10 min. before it can be eaten, these are easy to eat like a cookie, or quickly absorb your hot beverage.  My Japanese exchange student loved these, and when she returned with some to her home in Nagano, her mother wanted more!  So I purchased a case of my own and have sent her a couple of 8-count boxes as a present.  I have been unable to find them in the local grocery stores like I used to.  Other flavors are still available in stores, but not my beloved limon!  But they can be ordered!

review/summary: Not a fan of biscotti in general, but Nonni's get two thumbs up!
review/text: I am not normally a fan of biscotti. Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste...This one however, is different! Let me start with the price: on Amazon I paid 40% less (!!!) with free delivery, then in my grocery store! Hurray! Other then that, why Nonni's?<br /><br />1) They are not as dry and crumbly as other biscotti I have tried over the years. The toffee adds a bit of moisture without being gooey. They are gentler on my teeth, but still with enough cruch to make one biscotti a satisfying snack (at 110 calories), and allow for dunking.<br /><br />2) Individually wrapped, they keep fresh and moist (as moist as a bicotti can possibly be...) for quite a long while. It is good to have an extra box or two for unexpected guests.<br /><br />3) MILK chocolate!!! (I HATE dark chocolate...I'd rather eat spinach...but that is what most biscotti are covered in). There is just enough of it to give you a taste without making you feel you are eating a chocolate bar!<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/text: My husband is the ultimate food snob and I would find him crunching on these biscotti all the time.  Also my daughter would pack these in her lunch, they are not too hard, so you don't have to dip them into coffee, they are perfect.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: First, I love Nonni's..I buy the chocolate and plain ones all the time, but never saw the Limone. The order arrived and I noticed a somewhat musty smell on opening and then noticed the expiration date on the boxes is just 8 weeks off. The biscotti in the store are much fresher. Also found one box with a wierd mound of dried glue on the box with dirt and hair imbedded in the glue. I managed to forget the above and enjoy the biscotti...I tossed the box with glue mound. At least I hope it was glue.

THE CHOCOLATE DECADENCE AND THE ONES WITH THE TOFFEE BITS AND ALMONDS ARE VERY GOOD. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COST. IF I DID NOT GET THE FREE SHIPPING AND HANDLING; I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM. THEY'RE GOOD; BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SPEND AN EXTRA $20 TO DELIVER.

review/summary: A worthy substitute...
review/text: Not as crisp as an actual Root Beer; oogave Agave Root Beer possesses a more mild and subtle taste, one that rests easy on the tongue.  The aftertaste of natural sweetener doesn't have the same artificial chalkiness that is brought on by soft drinks containing aspartame.  In fact, the balance of sweet and savory is pretty well done here.  Sure, when you stack it up next to an actual Root Beer it may not come out the victor (the subtle differences are enough to swing my vote to the more unhealthy beverage; taste-wise) but I won't complain one bit about drinking this puppy.  I will admit that it does taste slightly watered down, which may be why it lacks that `freshness' or `crispness' of the original beverage, but it is a slight flaw; one that is easily overlooked.<br /><br />:-D

review/text: *****<br />These dried mango snacks are sweet, chewy, and yummy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. There are 2 servings in every 2.2 ounce bag (not 2.6 ounces--the vendor is in error here), with 103 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack. They are almost as chewy as fruit leather, though (about the same as jerky), so you'll need good healthy teeth to be able to chew them. I think they are a great value for what you're getting.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Not for all cats
review/text: I'm still getting to know my cats, but in three months they have happily eaten everything that I have put in front of them. Chicken, salmon, trout, herring, duck, turkey, quail, beef - and so on. One of the cats took a couple of bites and gave me a dirty look - the food sat there. The other one, who I call my little piglet, ate a third of it and walked off. Several hours later I pitched it all.<br />Glad some like it, I liked the variation in protein source, but it does smell very rich and my cats prefer anything else.

This one is somewhat of a coarse textured pate and it doesn't contain fish. But still my cats love this one.<br /><br />This is one of the entrees from Addiction that hasn't been available from their website and most cat food suppliers. I'm not sure if they want to discontinue this or not but I hope they keep this one as well as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QZGSOA">Addiction New Zealand Venison & Apples Entree, Hypoallergenic Grain-Free Canned Cat Food (Single 6.5 Ounce Can)</a> since the newer products from them aren't as well received by my cats.

review/summary: Great food for cat
review/text: Our elderly cat was quite sick and we were told she had less than a year to live.  I decided to take my own approach after every vet specialist we saw had nothing to offer.  This food seems to be the magic trick for her.  She's off all her meds and is feeling much better.  She was already on a  grain free diet, so I eliminated the usual cat proteins like chicken, fish, turkey.  She now eats venison, some duck, and this brushtail food which is by far her favorite.  No more blood in her bowels, no more diarrhea, no more sick cat.  She is still quite old, but she has greatly improved and is feeling a lot better!

review/summary: Now that's a nice cup of tea!
review/text: I'm hooked on this Taylors of Harrogate Assam tea.  It's really good in the 50 bag form.  It holds up so nicely to milk, has a nice, strong flavor that isn't at all bitter or perfumey.  Good solid tea.  Amazon has become my most reliable source for this staple.  Get the case of six boxes and you'll not have to do without!

review/summary: Excellent proper tea
review/text: We had been buying tea bags in bulk yearly whilst in England from the Wallingford Tea Company, a firm that selected and purchased tea and then processed and bagged in Wallingford.<br /><br />The Taylors of Harrogate Pure Assam Tea packaged in bags of 50 each is outstanding and considering the free Amazon shipping, is every bit as satisfactory without the expense of a trip to the UK or having friends post it to us in the US.  Great product that is difficult to find anywhere in the US at a great price.

review/summary: Makes Full-Bodied Iced Tea
review/text: This tea is full-bodied, but never bitter.  It's great hot, but I make my iced tea from boiling water and 3-4 of these tea bags in a glass pitcher, then I mix in Crystal Light lemonade.  It is absolutely awesome.  The tea is wonderful and reasonably priced. You won't drink ordinary (supermarket) tea after you taste Taylors Assam. I ordered my first batch of 6 boxes last January.  I am reordering it six months later.

review/summary: Clear Crisp Tea Good for Home Use and Gift
review/text: As a couple we drink lots of hot tea, so much so we use up these six boxes in two to three months. We searched for a good Assam tea and found Taylors of Harrogate Pure Assam Tea Bags very satifying. My husband drinks his tea "as is" and I put a teaspoon of sugar in mine.<br /><br />Having extra boxes of this lovely tea around, makes it easy to bring as a gift for a lunch or dinner, especially if the hosts as tea-tottlers!

review/summary: Amazing...Just like if I was in Pakistan
review/text: This tea is expensive.  Let us be honest.  But it is worth EVERY PENNY.<br /><br />WOW...and backwards...WOW.<br /><br />The flavor is amazing.  My wife and I search for a tea that tastes like the Lipton Yellow Label Tea that you get in Pakistan.  That just has such a great flavor...epsecially with Nestle Everyday (couldn't live without that creamer).  Until now, my wife usually buys Tetly, which we thought was pretty good.  For some reason, it just seemed better than the Lipton Yellow Label tea that you can purchase at international stores here in the U.S.<br /><br />But then I ordered this, and again, WOW.  There is NO comparison.  We make tea the typical Pakistani way, but for comparison purposes, we just took two cups of boiling water and put a Tetly bag in one and one of these on the other cup.  The color and smell of the Tetly seemed fine...UNTIL you look at this one, and then smell it.  This is just spot on.  I can't say enough about it.  It is more than I'd like to pay for tea, but until there's another option, this is what we'll be getting.<br /><br />Give it a shot...but make sure you get Nestle Everday, that is, if you can find it anywhere.  At best, it will be available in some International/Pakistani grocery stores.  Good luck.

review/summary: These are sooooo good!!!
review/text: These are so good.  Really.  I love them.  You can't stop at one.  I can eat almost the whole bag by myself.  Okay, so you know, I am Filipino, grew up in the States.  They are an "Asian" snack but my kids and non-Filipino husband like them too.  I fight over these with my kids.  If I open a bag, I have to hide it so they don't know it's open.  :)  I have to drive 3 hours round trip to the store to get these so I have to buy like 6 bags at a time and those are gone by the next week.  Seriously.  I LOVE THESE THINGS!!!  Yes they do stink when you open the bag but the taste is nowhere like the smell.  They are lightly flavored, not too salty.  When you get to the bottom of the bag, there is a bunch of highly concentrated powder down there so shake up the bag maybe to distribute it.

review/summary: Make it with tuna instead!
review/text: This is the best flavor of the whole Helper line. Like another reviewer mentioned Betty Crocker has messed with the formula and included less noodles. A good solution, especially if you want but can't find the Tuna Melt flavor, is to just add a can of tuna instead of beef and your meat/noodle ratio is pretty good. You'll still end up with less servings but this is so tasty. Real comfort food. What makes it is the small flat lasagna-style noodles instead of the elbow macaroni in the Tuna Melt variety. It's great to get some over-cooked cheese in between two noodles...kind of like the crust around some homemade mac 'n cheese. Highly recommend this but keep in mind Betty Crocker stupidly decided to remove all microwave directions from the Helper boxes. Check online for the old directions, cut the water and milk measurements in half, and make sure to add the butter if you are using tuna.

review/summary: Might as well not buy the product and just eat ground beef instead
review/text: A few years ago, Hamburger Helper was a nice product. There was a goodly amount of noodles, enough to balance out with a pound of ground beef. The Cheddar Cheese Melt flavor had a yummy cheese-sauce topping mix in addition to the seasoning mix. None of this is any longer the case, as Betty Crocker has cut the product size over the past few years while leaving the required amount of ground beef the same and the item the same price, likely in an effort to preserve profits without customers "noticing."<br /><br />The only problem is, it's noticeable. The product contains so few noodles that it's really no better than eating mouthfuls of ground beef in cheese sauce. The noodle package is very small, something more appropriate to two servings than the five advertised on the box. And, needless to say, there's no more sauce topping.<br /><br />If you plan to eat just the noodles in the box, don't add a whole pound of ground beef. The beef overwhelms the noodles. Use between a half to 3/4 pound ground beef instead. If you plan to add a whole pound, you'll want to add your own noodles. And, either way, add some cream of mushroom soup for a nicer sauce.

review/text: Yes, the "noodles" picked up the flavor of the Pad-Thai sauce I used, I got over the smell which went away as soon as they were rinsed, but I just can't get used to the texture.  They are very gelatinous and I'm not even a fan of Jello, so for me I had to force down these jelly-like noodles.  If don't mind the texture, they would be great.  Zero calories.  Oh well.
