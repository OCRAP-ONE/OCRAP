review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: IDEAL No Calorie Sweetener is ..fantastic.  Have been  using it exclusively in pie baking.  Even though it says use in same amount as you would sugar, we find about a quarter more is needed to achieve the same sweetness.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie, fruit pies, even the filling for cream puffs.  You can't tell the difference and "sugar only" lovers do not have a word of complaint.<br /><br />Have not tried the brown or confectioners sweeteners yet, but will soon and expect them to be just as satisfactory.<br /><br />Delicious Cranberry Sauce:  One bag whole cranberries, one cup diet cola, one and a quarter cups Ideal and some grated orange peel.  Cook to boiling, simmer about half hour and set aside to cool.  Refrigerate overnight and enjoy the next day.Thickens up nicely and is really really good.<br /><br />Amazon is best place to find this, I bought 6 large bags last time as I never want to be without it in the house.

review/summary: now my sugar of choice
review/text: if you need or want a sugar substitute, this is by far the best tasting one, and that is what really matters.  Splenda can be too sweet, especially in tea and sprinkling matters.  Others have that funky after taste, like stevia does.  I hae baked with it and though it doesn't rise as well as sugar does it is better than the splenda does.  Xylitol has good dental reviews too.  And Ideal is a 99.95 % natural product and is common in many foods and natural items. I love it and Ive tried most of the products out there.  I buy it here on amazon becasue the one I can get at the local is more $$ and they don't have the brown or confectionary.  Can't wait to work with those too.

review/text: I am diabetic and I have tried all of the sugar substitutes and there is nothing out there that compares to IDEAL. I use Ideal every single day. There is absolutely no other product that even comes close to IDEAL. I have recommended this to all of my friends, diabetic and non-diabetic. No after taste, great flavor, ease of use and highly recommended. I honestly love this product. Some have said that the price is a little high but I think that it is worth every single penny. Thank you makers of IDEAL. Time to retire the rest because IDEAL is the BEST!

review/summary: Best sugar substitute, great for baking and canning
review/text: Ideal sweetener is the best sugar substitute I've found.  I even use it for canning, such as making sweet pickles, a light syrup for peaches, etc.  I've tried Splenda, but didn't like it as well, and got poor results in baking.  When I use Ideal for baking, the results are much improved.  One little hint:  Use Ideal in place of regular sugar, but also add a small amount of real sugar to the Ideal portion (say 1 Tbsp of sugar on top of 1 cup of Ideal) to get a better consistency in your baked goods.  The only problem I have found with this product is availability.  Our local grocery stores sell all kinds of Splenda, but have discontinued selling Ideal.  I wonder why.  Now I am forced to buy online.  Amazon's price has more than doubled since I bought it two months ago, so what's up with that???

review/summary: The best artificial sweetener!
review/text: Ideal is a must try sweetener for those who rely on artificial sweeteners. It contains the same sweetening ingredient as sugar-free gum (xylitol) and is absolutely the best I've tried as far as imitating sugar. There is no after taste! It comes in a granulated, powdered and brown sugar version. The best!<br /><br />Warning: this product can be very hazardous to pets! The package is labelled as such (it states along with chocolate,grapes etc.) so be very careful not to leave it out where they can get at it. Their digestive system does not handle the enzymes the same way as humans.

review/summary: Favorite non-sugar dry sweetener
review/text: I have used xylitol for many years, and it is my favorite dry alternative to sugar. It is great for sweetening beverages, and can be used in some baking situations. Although, I will say this: sugar not only caramelizes (which makes cookies yummy) but it lends moisture to baked goods (which helps muffins and cakes be yummy). If you intend to use these things in baking, please keep these things in mind and adjust recipes accordingly. A cookie with all xylitol in it won't caramelize, and cakey things with all xylitol may end up dry and crumbly (depending on other ingredients). Hope this helps!

Closest taste to sugar, and will make a diet easier to follow. If i used splenda i would go back to sugar, if i used stevia i would be broke, if i used sweet n low or equal i would vomit. Ideal is not better then sugar but it is a great substitute and will keep those insane amounts of sugar out of your diet if you drink your coffee like i do. I bought a bag today and i'm gonna clean out my sugar shaker and fill it with ideal.

I have used both the white and brown sugar in everything including drink mixes, syrups, cakes, pies and caramels and couldn't be happier. The taste is fantastic and is indistinguishable from the real thing in cooking and baking! No one has even questioned the taste of drinks and foods I have prepared with it. I only wish Ideal sold larger bags of their sugar products!  Ideal sugars do not leave any strange after taste and are a welcome alternative to other "faux" sugar products available on the market.  Best of all...they have NO CALORIES!!!

I like the taste of it over Splenda and so far the scientist haven't found any bad things about it.....yet.  If you want to know how Ideal tastes just chew a stick of sugar free gum, it's got the same sweetener in it as Ideal.

review/text: This is a fantastic product, I wish that it were more readily available.  I won't buy anything but this product, I believe it's the closest thing to real sugar that you could ever find.  Earlier in 2010 I decided to eliminate sugar from my diet as much as possible and watch my carb's.  Using only this product as a sugar substitute and limiting sugar & carb's from other products and without excercise I was able to lose 18 lbs.  My husband added excercise and he was able to lose 35 lbs and quit taking insulin(he is a diabetic). It is the best, most natural sugar substitute I have ever found(with the best taste)...also...I believe by eliminating the other chemically based sugar substitutes, no more headaches and appetite is more manageable.

The muffins were flavorless, but I'll try something at a lower baking temperature before I make a final decision.<br />One of the bags had a slight tear, and sweetner coated everything inside the box, although not a lot was wasted.  Since there was no sign of damage to the box, it appears the package was torn before it was packed. Be more careful, please, guys.

review/summary: Better for baking
review/text: I like this product because it is more like actual sugar in texture and weight, so it does better in baking.  Unlike another person's review, I would say it doesn't dissolve quickly in cold liquids.  It dissolves maybe a tad faster, but if you are a Sweet n Low person like me, you will have to remember to stir more. I also don't think it is as sweet as regular sugar, but I'm a person who likes things very sweet, so maybe for others it is fine.  Over all, I found it to be the best of the sugar substitutes, but like all substitutes, it costs too much.  When I first started using Sweet n Low way back when it was only $.79 a box (bulk - not in little envelopes).  Now it is around $4.00. Amazing. Also, Ideal isn't easy to find in my area (Los Angeles) so the internet was the only route for me.

But no matter what I use it in, I can tell it's not the real thing.<br /><br />I may purchase it again but I am just as likely to try a different brand of Xylitol.<br /><br />Today there is a photo of the brown 'sugar' version, that is wrong.  This is a white 'sugar' substitute.

review/text: I found the same box of Dove dark chocolate bars at a local bulk warehouse store for 35% less and didn't have to pay the extraordinarily high shipping to boot which put this box at 100% more than what it costs to buy it locally.  Go figure why this seller doesn't offer it thru Prime.  The box of chocolate we bought from this seller arrived melted which caused everything to separate once it cooled.  Do what I did and shop around... unless you live somewhere you have to buy it over the internet.

review/text: If you haven't had Dove dark chocolate bar yet you're in for a treat!  They are smooth, rich, and chocolatey.  Truly delicious!  I just love them. The only drawback they have is the possible weight gain you might experience if you eat too much of them too often!  Dove does a great job with dark chocolate!

review/text: Ordered two boxes of these Dove Chocolates to send to my husband on his business trip. Supposed to be 24 in a box. Deceptive and not  what I ordered. Only 18 bars not 24 as advertised in a box and one box was taped shut with only 17 bars total. Should have been 48 Dove Bars and we received 35.

review/summary: Best New Idea from Coke in a Long Time!
review/text: It's my understanding that this product has been pulled from Coke's lineup of products.  If that's true, it's rather disappointing news.  As a self-proclaimed "Diet Coke-aholic" I was thrilled when I heard they were adding vitamins and minerals to Diet Coke.  While it's no substitution for a well balanced diet (and you still should take a vitamin supplement if you don't get the RDA from your diet), it was an added benefit for someone like myself who drinks a lot of Diet Coke.  The addition of vitamins and minerals did NOT affect the taste, so it was the same as drinking a regular can of Diet Coke.  As I usually purchase at least 2 cases of Diet Coke each week, I'd buy 2 12 packs of Diet Coke Plus and 2 12 pks of regular Diet Coke and alternate my consumption.  Last week I discovered that there was no Plus on the shelves and the place tag for the item had been removed.  When I asked our grocery manager about this, he told me he believed that Coke had stopped production of Diet Coke Plus.  I hope that this is not true and that they're just repackaging the product (I understand that the FDA had concerns about how this product was labeled).  The added benefits of Plus would seem to outweigh any packaging discrepancy, so I hope this is something that Coke plans on fixing and soon!

review/summary: An exotic delight
review/text: I recently went to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there.  What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish, and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk, along with cardamom, to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted, orange blossom water is and acquired taste, and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions, mixed with fruits, nuts, coffees, teas, and pastries.  A superb product!

I found a recipe that called for it that I wanted to try so I ordered a bottle.<br /><br />the water looked clear but when I opened it up I was greeted by a smell reminiscent of stagnant pond water. I was ready to throw it away, but my mother insisted on tasting it, in case it tasted better than it smelled.<br /><br />She spent 10 minutes over the sink spitting and gagging. Is orange flower water *supposed* to taste and smell like this? Please tell me this is a mistake. I can't imagine why anyone would want to cook with it.

review/summary: Great Etouffee Base, Closest to Making Your Own
review/text: This is a great shortcut if you don't have the time (or the energy and resources) to make a blond and dark roux from scratch.  If you're the kind of person who does make from scratch, this base gives you the flexibility to add your own personal touch.  I've let this base stand alone and I've added my own mix of spices.  In both scenarios, everyone who ate (even some folks who've frequented New Orleans for cuisine) were honestly pleased.<br /><br />Of course, keep in mind, this is a shortcut.  It won't match up to true blue creole cooking, but for folks like me who live hundreds of miles from Louisiana, this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Amazon priced it well, keep in mind, it's a box of 12 and the expiration date might be within one year of your purchase.  While that would seem like a downside to some, I think etouffee once a month is not enough etouffee at all.

This is a definite winner.<br /><br />I bought Zatarain's in the local grocery stores for years, but I have been unable to find it lately. So Amazon to the rescue. It's much cheaper by bulk anyway.

review/text: Really fantastic stuff.  I have been baking bread at least once a week for a few years now.  Some recipes call for potato flakes.  You know the packets of dehydrated potato flakes for instant mash potatoes?  What they really mean is this potato flour.  I guess maybe it is hard to find??  Comes in small plastic bag.  I thought that it would be bigger.  Like the size of a sandwich bag.  In most of my recipes I use 2 tablespoons in place of the instant flakes.  THIS STUFF REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.  I also recently purchased some gluten.  I now add in 1 tablespoon for everyone cup flour.  These days all my loafs and rolls really turn out like a professional quality. I will be buying again soon!!

review/summary: Just Made for Lazy Cooks Like Me
review/text: I have a fraternal twin sister who always uses fresh garlic when she cooks, which is not as often as I cook. As for me, I found buying jars of crushed garlic in my grocery store eons quicker and less messy than doing it myself. However, my store stopped carrying it, carrying only minced garlic. I liked the pasty texture of the crushed better and was relieved to find it on Amazon. I could have ordered a single bottle but it would not be Prime, so I elected to buy the case since I do use garlic a lot, and I do mean A LOT. When the shipment came I used some for the shrimp I was sauteing and it flavored the product with plenty of garlic flavor. I use it on steaks, chops, mushrooms, in spaghetti sauce and anything else I want to add a garlic flavor to. Needless to say, this product will be used frequently. The McCormick name deserves its reputation and I am very satisfied with the quality of their product.

The oats, because of the way they are toasted, shatter in your mouth rather than sogging up like thicker oats do (for example, those in the Bear Naked granola, which is also terrific, but not on quite the same level). The amount of cranberry and walnut is just enough to keep your taste buds interested.

review/text: I have an obsession with Udi's Cranberry Granola. So much so that I have Amazon deliver it to my house in 6 packs every month! I literally eat this every morning for breakfast. Some people look forward to their morning cup of coffee...I look forward to my morning bowl of Udi's!!

review/summary: Don't break you teeth on cranberrys
review/text: I loved the Hawiaan mix, and when it was no longer available, I decided to go for this one.  I am so disappointed, and spend my mornings picking out the cranberry rocks.  Ussually all Udi products for the gluten free are superior, but this cranberry granola should never leave the factory,

review/summary: best granola evar!
review/text: you get what you pay for, this isn't the cheapest out there but it's the highest protein, lowest carb/sugar, highest fiber of any of the store brands carried locally and doesn't taste like you're eating wood chips. I love this stuff, the dried cranberries are fantastic, I normally have some of this with a 1/3rd cup of blueberries and a 1/2 cup of yogurt. Fantastic. I got a 6 pack of this stuff when the local grocer stopped carrying it for a month and I'd tried the "next best" offering that they carried and it was horrible, I HAD to have my Udi's!

review/summary: Incredible Granola
review/text: This granola is spectacular! It is crunchy and flavorful, the cranberries are zingy and add the perfect touch. It is lower in fat than most granola and tastes just as good, if not better! I have been eating it with yogurt, with milk or just plain out of the bag and I can't get enough! The ingredients are simple- no hydrogenated oils or corn syrup, just oats, honey and canola oil. Fantastic!

review/summary: Excellent refreshing tea
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker-we're talking several cups a day, so I am constantly buying teas and looking for new and exciting ones to change/spice things up. My normal favorite is the Lipton Green Tea "Superfruit" collections, but came across this one, and decided to give it a try. (The fact that it was Egyptian Mint and in the "pyramid" shape made it more appealing since I'm an Egyptian Pagan, but it was the Green tea peppermint combination that caught my eye originally-really. :)<br />The flavor is very nice, not overwhelming nor too bland. The pyramid sachets are individually wrapped in a supersealed plastic/cellophane type wrapper that truly seals in the freshness (and keeps them dry if you accidentally drop them into a wet sink, or water etc)(Yes, I've done that with the lipton bags before ruining a whole box, as well as dropping the pitcher on the counter and soaking everything within run off range. These are accident proof, though!)<br />The ingredients are: Green Tea, Peppermint, and Licorice Root. Peppermint is good for the digestive system, and Licorice Root is good for metabolism (as is Green Tea.)<br />Plus for those of you who are Mother Earth-wise, the sachets are 100% biodegradable, so they won't add to the landfill problem. And lastly but equally important, all three ingredients are certified organic-no pesticides to pollute your body!!!!

review/summary: A Very Good Snack Chip
review/text: Flavor is good, not excellent. I really like these but I have to stay accurate here with the review. They are very good but not the best. I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though.<br /><br />Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down.<br /><br />All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good.

review/summary: The best veggie snack
review/text: These are THE original veggie stix.  If you go to to a major grocery chain store or Whole Foods, most have resorted to selling veggie "straws," which are like veggie stix but hollow, hard, and overly salty.  The Good Health veggie stix are a lighter snack and simply, just taste better in my opinion.<br /><br />I was happy to find the product on Amazon, but learned quickly that 10-7oz bags is a lot.  I bought the product in the beginning of Summer and it had an expiration date for August.  Unless you really love snacking on these things, it's probably more worth it to buy in the store if you can help it.

They are a terrific alternative to potato chips or fries as a side "dish" when serving hotdogs, hamburgers or a simple tuna sandwich.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a light, tasty, not-too-salty or oily snack food, this product is just the ticket. But be forewarned, it can be addictive!

review/text: Overall one of the better veggie stix I have tried. I liked that they have much less of an oil taste than other brands I have tried; very fresh tasting. Also better than store bought price especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />I got these in late December and they had around a 3 month expiration date. The have the standard potato, tomato, and spinach flavors. And like most brands I have bought in store they are not evenly placed in the bag, the potato flavor dominates. But not more than other brands, and these taste better and better priced at Amazon. Recommended.

review/text: Trying to break the frito habit, I tried veggie chips.  Really yummy and no greasy aftertaste.  Buy them by the case and put on monthly auto-delivery.  You will always have something appropriate for late night snacks and those take-along snacks to the lake or golf course.  Each bag contains only 140 calories - with much better ingredients.  Unfortunately, I'm now addicted to Veggie Chips, and so are my five children and 12 grandchildren.  But I don't feel guilty.

review/summary: A surprising find
review/text: I was grocery shopping two days ago at the local Wal-mart. My daughter went down the chip aisle looking, of course, for potato chips. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bag that read Veggie Stix. I picked them up, glanced over them and said to myself "Naw, probably tastes like crap.",and walked away. I was trying to find a snack for myself and everything was high in sodium or contained additives. So, I went back and decided to try the Veggie Stix. That was the best purchase that I made in the store that day. I got them home, tried them and had to force myself to stop eating them. And the BEST part is that when I let my grandkids try them they LOVED them. That was the only bag that I saw in the store that day, but believe me I will be checking to find out if it is an item that Wal-mart regularly stocks. If not I will be ordering from Amazon.com. Very Good.

review/text: I liked the taste of the bags that were sealed good, but probably about half of the bags were not sealed properly.  The ones that were not sealed correctly tasted stale, so I was really disappointed with these.  I have had this brand in a larger bag, and really liked them, so I don't know what happened, but I do know that I won't be buying these smaller size bags anymore!  There were openings in a couple of the bags on the end, but most of them just did not have the air tight seal in the bag.

review/summary: The best chip I've EVER had
review/text: I'm not even going to lie, I learned about these delicious little snacks by snagging a couple from my roommate's bag.  I go to the store that is almost 10 miles away--on the bus--just to get a bag of these.<br /><br />As one commenter suggested, they can be a little bit greasy, but since I bring them to work in a paper towel and inside of a baggie, I don't have a problem at all.  I don't think they're too salty.  They're about as thick as fries from burger king and they taste EXACTLY like french fries.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, almost 40 straws is one serving and its only 130 kCals!  I've switched to eating these as a snack instead of any alternative and I don't even need to portion them out by serving size.  They're so filling, I usually don't even eat 25 at once.<br /><br />I hope these are sold all over the country because the prices here are pretty steep and I'd love to share Veggie Straws with my family back home.  I get them at the grocery store for about 3.50/7ounce bag.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Potato Chips
review/text: If you want a low-fat and low calorie natural snack, these veggie stix are tasty and have 55% lower fat than potato chips.  They are fun to munch on.  I was surprised, however, that they had no Vitamin A as some vegetable snacks do.<br />No fiber, and only 1 g protein.  So, they are more healthy for what they don't have, than what they do offer.  And that's fine for a snack.  If you want snacks that offer some nutrition, popcorn chips offer fiber and sweet potato chips often have Vitamin A.  I'd get these for fun for a party for something different, but it would be great if they had a little more nutrition in them.

review/summary: Love this product/Glad Amazon sells this
review/text: Most everybody loves chips, but don't want to feel guilty (at least I don't), about eating them. These chips are a good way for me to get the crunchy/salty flavor and satisfaction from eating "chips", yet these are healthier than just regular potato chips. I love the hint of salt and garlic. For those that are afraid of the "spinach", you really can't tell that you are eating spinach. I love the convenience of the size of these. Since it's just me , I can sit and eat a whole bag (bigger), without even thinking about it, but with this size, it's easier to control the portion. Since not all stores carry this product, it's great that I know that I can order from Amazon. I think the price is reasonable also.
