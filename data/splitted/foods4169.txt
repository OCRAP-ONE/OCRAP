review/summary: Good Morning Coffee
review/text: We have to say, great taste, and a wake up in the morning. Due to our commute each morning we are limited during the work week on how much coffee we can consume before leaving the house during rush hour.  This coffee provides a rich taste, and is not bitter.  If you love the taste of coffee and a quick wake up this coffee is for you.

review/summary: great-tasting coffee!
review/text: This is one of my favorite K-cup varieties, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006586QXG">Starbucks French Roast</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XE0LWQ">Barista Prima "Italian" Dark Roast</a>. The price of this coffee is usually quite a bit cheaper than the other two, but the quality of it is very comparable. If you're a fan of dark, bold roasts, you will like this one. I have always liked coffee from Starbucks, and anyone that has had their coffee knows that they brew their coffee really strong. Hence, that is why I like the dark, bold roasts for my Keurig. Even though I use creamer and sweetener, I really like the taste of coffee to be prominent. The lighter roasts just don't do it for me. This is a great-tasting bold roast!

review/text: I received a Keurig brewer from my wife for Christmas.  I like a nice, bold, coffee and had never tried this one but went for it based on great reviews.  This stuff is delicious and it is a perfect cup every time thanks to the Keurig brewer.  I have been happy with all Green Mountain k-cups I have tried thus far.  Highly recommend this to those that like a bold cup of coffee.  My wife doesn't like hers as strong and she went with the Green Mountain "Nantucket Blend" and she loves it.

review/summary: Not as full bodied as I like
review/text: In my mind, coffee should be strong, bold, and well balanced.  Not so much a slap in the face, but more a strong limb to grasp (I guess I'm feeling poetic).  If you feel the same way, you may be a little disappointed with Dark Magic.  While it comes close, it has a slight acidic after taste which I'm not fond of.  In other words, it doesn't meet my criteria for "well balanced".  I hope that helps.

review/summary: Strong but flat, lacking definition
review/text: These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin.  It's lacking in overtones after the inital dark wave.  I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.  But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish.

review/summary: A welcome beacon drawing me into the kitchen.
review/text: Ok, so let's get one thing straight. I'm addicted to coffee, but it has to be good coffee or I'll wish doom and gloom on all that cross my path. Nothing is more disappointing than going into your kitchen and realizing there is nothing really good to brew in your Keurig. I have turned into a hoarder of delicious extra bold k-cups. Lord help me if I ever run out of this stuff. Dark Magic is aptly named and eagerly consumed many times before 5AM. When you get up that early, you need great coffee.<br /><br />Now let's address rising prices. I recommend searching daily for your favorite k-cups because the prices are getting ridiculous. I picked up 24 of these for a little over 15 dollars. Yep that is expensive, but the 50 count when averaged out was even more. Coffee is much like stocks, buy low!<br /><br />Please please please, never ever change this brew! It is dark and unctuous on your tongue, it leaves this smokey afterglow in your throat and all around satisfies a person in the morning. There are not enough adjectives to tell you how good this stuff is...so I won't try.

If you buy several at once (because free shipping is at the $60 level) 11th Street Coffee is a couple of bucks cheaper.  Coupon codes are also easy to find for them.

review/summary: "Tres intense" K-cup blend stronger than the usual fare
review/text: Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast.<br /><br />I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Fair Trade Gingerbread</a> I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a> but no more bitter.<br /><br />If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot</a>.<br /><br />In summary, I like "tres intense" roasts and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a> is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup. I will post an update should I try a stronger blend than Dark Magic.

review/text: Green Mountain's Dark Magic Extra Bold is my go-to coffee for use with my Keurig coffee machine. I go through more of this particular flavor then any other type of coffee. In fact I don't think a day goes by that I don't have at least 1 cup of this flavor, if not more. Don't let the words dark and extra bold scare you off - this coffee is rich, smooth and in many ways mellow. Its not overly acidic, it does't taste burnt, its just a good cup of "coffee flavored coffee". It works well with most flavored creamers, sweeteners, but is a pleasant cup in its pure and unadorned form as well.

review/summary: It will singe your nose hairs!
review/text: I like a lot of crap in my coffee, and yet I still like the flavor of coffee. Generally, with as much crap as I put in it (think half and half, flavored creamer, truvia and flavored syrup), I can no longer taste the coffee. *DUH* I bet you are saying, "well clearly she doesn't like the taste of coffee" but really I do! So I am usually left thinking "why did I put so much crap in my coffee??" Well, problem solved with this Dark Magic. The [great] coffee flavor comes through loud and clear, even with all my additions. I can only imagine that if I DIDN'T put all this crap in it I might singe my nose hairs because boy is it strong! You people who drink it without diluting it, a lot, are my heroes.

review/summary: Good, strong cup of coffee
review/text: This is my daily morning cup of coffee.  I like strong coffee and this has become my favorite. I do not like the coffee at, say, Dunkin' Donuts. In the afternoons, I like Coffee People decaf or Timothy's decaf Hazelnut.  But for a good, regular cup, Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold is it.

review/summary: Not bad, not great either.
review/text: I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down.  This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.

review/text: This is the perfect coffee for me.  I like my coffee on the strong side and this makes a strong 10 ounce cup of coffee in my Cuisinart K Cup breweer.  The taste is fantastic and if you preferred a weaker brew you could make the 12 oumce cup. My brewer has 4 size choices based on your taste preferences.  I have had a problem with some of the K cups being on the weak side and having to brew two small cups to make a full coffee cup, but with this brand I am completely satisfied with the taste.  I recommend it to anyone.  Very flavorful and full bodied...

review/text: is a perfect match for the Keurig Brewer because Green Mountain invented the Keurig Brewer.  The Extra Bold coffee is truly a deep but smooth coffee that's just right for that first "cup-a-joe" in the morning.  There is NO bitter aftertaste and with a Keurig, the water/coffee ratio is always perfect.  Green Mountain is also listed on the stock exchange and they have been doing very well for good reason - they offer fantastic coffee blends and the means to brew perfect coffee.  What more can you ask for?

review/text: I have purchased quite a few K-Cup blends for the Keuring, well over a dozen.  Some were for company and friends but this one was for me and I LIKE it!  I have to be honest and say that it not my favorite but it's up there among them.  Even when I have one coffee that I like above others I try to vary my K-Cups.  Sometimes it makes me appreciate my favorite better, other times I just want something different.  Green Mountain Dark Magic is always in my Keurig carousel.<br /><br />This blend is not as complex as Newman's Own Bold or Coffee People's Organic Bold Roast, however it doesn't hit you over the head like Timothy's Extra Bold Rain Forest Espresso.  I have not found a K-Cup that is as bold or full-bodied as coffee that I brew in traditional methods (a French press is my favorite) but this one comes close.

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: As I have grown used to my Keurig over the last year, my tastes have changed to bolder and darker flavors. Dark Magic has become my very favorite, order by the case, morning-ain't-right-without-it blend.<br />Dark Magic is in the same league as Sumatra Reserve and Black Tiger, to name a couple of other favorites. However, I think it holds up best to the Keurig process and avoids the pitfalls of watery taste or bitterness that some other blends suffer from.<br />There are also some extra bold flavors that seem to go for sheer overpowering strength, at the expense of complexity and flavor. Dark Magic has it all.<br />Highly recommended to fans of very full strength and bold-tasting coffee.

If money is no object, consider plugging Kona Coffee into Google, then select a seller and order Peaberry Kona. At about $17.00 for 8 oz its the most expensive available.  But I absolutely frigging guarantee it'll be the best, richest and most satisfying cup of coffee you've ever had.

review/summary: Best I Have Found
review/text: I have been using K-Cups for about 2 years now.  During that time I have tried several dozen different brands / flavors.  This is by far my favorite, and if you like bold coffee you will probably agree.  I now just stick to this coffee when reordering and also enjoy the decaf version when I feel like a cup in the evening.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: This was my first K-cup coffee and it was great.  I am a Starbucks Americano or Sumatra drinker by nature and like rich, dark coffee.  I use this all the time in my office now.  Had tried Starbucks VIA, also a really good product, but this is less expensive and just as good.  It's definitely cut my costs but not my pleasure in coffee.

review/summary: Truly Rich
review/text: This is truly rich and satisfying cup of coffee. I have been drinking it for years. It is truly equal to the best coffee I have tasted in any coffee shop.Another surprise is that is always consistent from order to order. My newest favorite coffee is now the Emerels Big Easy. Just a tad richer with a wonderful aftertaste. I will be alternating these two wonderful blends, for years to come.

review/summary: Bold for Green Mountain, but not BOLD
review/text: If you are looking for a BOLD k-cup, try the Coffee People "black tiger" or their "french roast" bold... they are about the closest thing to a cup of Starbucks that you can get in a k-cup.  This is fine if you like Green Mountain, McDonalds, or Dunkin' Doughnuts coffee.  It has a classic GM slight nutty/sweet taste that I am not overly fond of but it is okay for an evening cup or when you are in the mood for something lighter.

review/summary: Magical
review/text: A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.  After several cups, one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker, more fulfilling blend out there somewhere, perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest, or the side of a volcano.  Perchance there is, but until that is discovered, I must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds, and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup, knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured.<br /><br />Salut.

review/summary: Arrived as described
review/text: I ordered these K-Cups with points from my credit card.  They arrived as described, but without much packaging - - they were just sitting loose in the box, which works for me.<br /><br />The coffee is what I expected after trying a cup from a co-worker.  It's a fairly dark roast, but not as bold as the Newman's Own roast.  I like it for my breakfast coffee.<br /><br />I don't have anything negative to say, although I'm not sure the K-Cup route in general is the way to go for me because of the cost.  I purchased 50 cups just so the cost would be somewhat reasonable.<br /><br />I think you can get a good single cup in other ways, by using something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B194FY">Cilio Porcelain No. 4 Coffee Filter Holder</a>.  I haven't tried this yet, although I saw one at World Market for $7.  You can heat up your water with a water kettle like this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBV0IM">Bodum Bistro 17-Ounce Mini Cordless Electric Water Kettle, Black</a>.<br /><br />The convenience of the K-Cups is awesome, but I think I'd like the flexibility and cost savings of a different way.

review/summary: Nice Cup That's a Little Stronger - But Not Too Strong
review/text: If you're looking for what I consider a true "bold" cup of coffee, I think you are going to be disappointed and may want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but this one does just fine for me with no bitter aftertaste.  I enjoy this one more so than most breakfast blends, and if you like this kind of coffee you might, too.<br /><br />To put it in perspective, I seem to alternate between the bold and what I consider a "regular" cup of coffee with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LSM98O">Newman's Special Blend Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)]], and (believe it or not) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>.  Divergent, yes, but alternating between different levels of taste depending upon the time of day (or attitude, I guess).<br /><br />Bottom line is if you enjoy any of the other brands I mention above, give this one a try - I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: OK - BUT NOT A WINNER IN ROBUST FLAVOR
review/text: The "experts" say that the k-cup method of making coffee is wonderful for its ease and quickness and makes a very nice brew for those that like favored and/or medium roast coffee, but is not capable of making a robust cup for those that like their brew powerful!! I would have to agree!! I have tried just about every dark roast, french roast, italian roast coffee sold by Amazon and the only one that comes close to robust, in my opinion, is Coffee People's "Wake-Up Call". "Dark Magic" has a sweetness to it, which is not to my taste. Overall, OK, but not a winner in robust flavor!!

Soon after the purchase, finding that Perfection in "Starbucks Verona".  Wonderfully Bold and Strong, but oh-so-smooth!<br /><br />Three months ago, I bought a 3-month supply of Starbucks Verona (not cheap), and then a week ago... to my dismay!!!  I find that Tassimo (Kraft) and Starbucks have parted ways... like a couple of Hot-Tempered, Irresponsible Children... with absolutely no regard to their Loyal Customers... dissolve their relationship and quit shipping the "Starbucks Verona" ...... AAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHH !!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Back to this Dark Magic crap.... Strong... but very acidic, bitter and this very unfavorable "flavor' sticks with you in the form of a lingering aftertaste!<br /><br />Those of you who thought that this was actually a "good coffee"... you really need to... well, find some good coffee to make a comparison!<br /><br />I mean... who samples and then actually approves this stuff for production????
