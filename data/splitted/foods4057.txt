review/text: Good cookies. They're made with Splenda. I guess that makes them sugarfree. They certainly don't taste like they are. I despise the taste of fake sweetners, but the folks at this company did a great job. The cookies are very yummy! I only gave it four stars, because I prefer soft  and chewy oatmeal cookies.

review/summary: wonderful alternative
review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/text: I found this product originally at Williams Sonoma and realized my quest for the perfect cornbread was finally over.  I'm a baker and have never found a recipe or a mix that makes the truly delicious cornbread I dreamed of.  Not dry and nominally tasty like Jiffy.  Not overly sweet and fake corn tasting like Marie Callendars. Clean,clear corn taste, perfect crunch on the edge and so flavorful!  And dead easy to make. The directions are clear and simple.  Like any quick bread or pancake, don't overmix.  A few small lumps are fine.  I bake it in an 8" cast iron fry pan.  No problem in buying the case, friends and family are always begging to take a box home.

review/summary: Wonderful flavor treat, glad to find it available here.
review/text: My sister is a Canadian, where it seems there is an English population who crave their lime marmelade. I have had her bring this to me on her too-infrequent visits to Michigan from Ontario, but she pays about the same price per jar, and the seller included free shipping. It was packed with sturdy shrink-wrap in its original 6-pack case, bubble wrapped to make breakage impossible, then put into a sturdy second box. The quality and flavor of Rose's preserves is unrivaled, and with a bit of rationing and self-control, this 6-pack should last me many months. I don't understand why a product this wonderful is so hard to find at typical retail outlets, including imported gourmet shops, or why an American supplier does not offer a similar product. Key Lime originate in the Florida Keys, though they can be grown in any suitable climate zone. If you like plain ol' Orange Marmelade, you really need to experience this treat!

review/text: This is the best hot sauce I've ever tasted...unless you count the other flavors/varieties available from Boulder Hot Sauce. There is a habanero version that is amazing. Hot but flavorful and you can eat it without dying! This price is little higher than I've paid for it off the shelf BUT it isn't available everywhere. So if you can get it sent to your home, I say go for it!

It does not harden or thicken at all in the refrigerator!  I contacted the company via e-mail on their web-site and conveyed my concerns but they did not respond at all.

I used turbinado sugar for sweetener, and cut down on the sweetener called for, even though the coconut is unsweetened, they tasted so creamy and flavorful, my family never knew the difference. The recipe doubled, used I package of the coconut, which was worth it to have the yummy cookies.

review/summary: Not like Mom used to make, but OK occasionally
review/text: I understand what reviewer Natasha was saying; this isn't a prime quality roast beef hash, but it is the most available hash on the market, delivers a large amount of protein, calories (not a great diet food), and is a classic stick-to-your-ribs canned food.<br /><br />For the above reasons, it is a good idea to stock some this at home. It is, as she mentioned, more greasy, salty than you might like, but it microwaves well (use a splatter cover). Or fry it in a covered pan to serve with eggs, soups, veggies etc.<br /><br />I think this does what it should do: it suggests what real homemade roast beef hash should taste like. But it isn't the same. If you want that, you'll have to roast some beef, grind it up, add some boiled potatoes chopped fine along with some onion chopped and a little gravy. There you have the real thing. Look up the recipe in old cookbooks. Consider this useful canned food to be a substitute. If there is a better one on the market, I'd like to know.

review/text: I guess I am in the minority, but this hash product tastes like cheap fatty meat and stale potatoes.  It splutters out so much grease while browning that you need to be prepared for a very stinky house and a stove that needs A LOT of 409 to get clean.  Maybe this is a nostalgia food I missed the boat on; I bought a can to try to see if our family wanted to stock some in our emergency food box since I have never had canned hash before.  This roast beef flavor has less salt than all others which is why I bought it, I cannot imagine how salty those must taste. If you like canned hash, listen to the 5 star reviews; if you never had it before, buy one can at the store to try before investing money and pantry space -- I am so glad I did!

review/summary: Good Gravy! :-)
review/text: Although I was looking for fat free gravy, I did wonder how it would taste without any fat. That's not your usual gravy by any stretch of the imagination -- gravy generally has a lot of fat whether it's chicken, beef or turkey. But my family is calorie-conscious and I decided to give Campbell's Chicken Fat Free Gravy a try. When it arrived from Amazon and I gave it a taste test, I was delightfully surprised at its very good flavor. I served it without announcing that it's fat free until I noticed that the family had enjoyed it and I even received compliments.<br /><br />Well, 24 cans are not staying around as long as I expected they might, so I'm ready to order another case. Opening a can with the pop-top lid, heating and putting it on the table has become a last minute thing. Buying by the case from Amazon is a terrific deal. Campbell's fat free isn't available in my area and there's only a generic available at one local supermarket costing $2.89 for a 12 oz. can. Don't think I'll bother taste testing that one.<br /><br />The calorie count is 15 per serving size (1/4 cup). That's even considered a "free food" on the ADA and Weight Watcher's exchange lists. The sodium count is a bit high at 13%, but I find that to be true in any prepared foods. I must admit it doesn't have that golden color you get from chicken gravy that contains fat, but I've solved that by occasionally adding a couple of drops of Kitchen Bouquet when it's meant to be ladled over potatoes, rice, etc. I don't bother when using it in recipes. All in all, the flavor is good but it doesn't overwhelm the taste of the food it's going on or into.

Even though I had tried many excellent quality dog foods, mealtime was frustrating as he would refuse to eat and I would end up throwing the food away and trying again next mealtime.  My local pet store recommended this for finicky eaters.  They were right, he loves it.  You measure out the dry food into a bowl and add water to reconstitute.  My lab's nose immediately went up sniffing when the water was added.  It has a nice aroma, it doesn't smell like traditional dog food.  Now when the bowl is placed down, he's right there eating and he even comes back to the dish once or twice to make sure there isn't any left.  I finally found something he likes and mealtime is peaceful again.

I work out doors and I eat sunflower seeds every day. There have been times when I have been forced to purchase other brands of seeds, and over the years I have tried them all. It is amazing how much better David's seeds are than every other brand. Their seeds are not toothpick thin like some other brands, they have the best flavor, they are not too salty, and they don't fill the bag with empty shells.

review/summary: Great Quality, Good Stop Smoking/Diet Aid, Price Fluctuation a Problem
review/text: I've tried many other brands and only DAVID brand sunflower seeds is consistently good. Yes, all items that are minimally processed from plants can change slightly in flavor from bag to bag (as each plant is an original factory of it's own) but DAVID seeds have consistently good flavor (fresh, not rancid or chemical tasting). I trust DAVID products, always have.<br /><br />Eating sunflower seeds is good for many reasons. Cuts down on smoking, over eating, and is good nutrition. The salt is not too salty, just enough. If you read the nutrient label you'll see one serving is only 6% of sodium for one day, not high at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: My earlier recommendation of this item was partly due to the quality and partly due to the low Amazon.com Subscribe & Save price, which was $7.34 when I subscribed and first wrote this review. But as of 7-5-11 the Subscribe & Save price has gone up to $11.03. Most likely will not be ordering any more or might have to cancel our future orders if this price hike remains. Sellers need to understand that quality AND price matter. And if they are going to hike up the price just because a reviewer says it's a good item at a low price, they will loose customers and sales!! It looses one star and I can no longer recommend this item until or unless it comes back down below $7.50.

review/summary: Salty happiness! (When in season)
review/text: I love these soft salty seeds, they're the only ones I can munch on all day and never get tired of them. I must have gone through a hundred bags in the last year.<br /><br />But though every store carries them, I still have trouble finding what I'm looking for. That's because many bags (maybe 50%) are duds, filled with these little pebble shaped seeds, hard and awful-tasting. This is especially bad when Sunflower isn't in season, and of course at its very worst in early Summer when it's been almost a year since the last planting. That's when David really scrapes the bottom of the barrel and gives you 100% dud bags. Late summer is the harvest, and then the blood pressure induced heart attack stats spike. :)<br /><br />You can tell just looking through the window on the packaging whether you should buy the bag or pass. Nice long seeds are great, round pebbles are foul. I'm skeptical that the savings of ordering online outweigh the ability to inspect the goods before payment.

review/summary: I love salt...like...a lot.
review/text: Sunflower seeds are my drug. Some people crave cigarettes or alcohol, I crave sunflower seeds and Coke.<br /><br />What mystifies even me is why I love seeds so much. At one point I thought it was because of the seeds themselves, but now I find I enjoy sucking all the salt off more than I do eating the seeds. Heck, if I find a shell that has that salty flavor INSIDE the shell too? Oh man, I'm like a ray of sunshine.<br /><br />That's why I love David brand sunflower seeds more than any others. The chances of finding that delicious dose of outside AND inside saltiness is far greater than others. I used to like Fisher's better but I had a run of bad luck with those in which I kept getting bad, rotten seeds. In David's, if I find two per bag I'm usually surprised. Add in the fact that Fisher has so much 'dust' at the bottom of the bag (I call it dust because I don't really know what it is...excess salt maybe?), I'll go for David everytime.<br /><br />If you're a sunflower seed lover, if you have a bad enough craving brands don't matter. But time and again I've found myself craving not just seeds, but David seeds in particular. Each brand has their own thing to offer, but these are all around my personal favorites.

review/summary: Great Price, Great Product
review/text: More than likely, you have experienced David Sunflower Seeds before. If you have not, give them a try, they are probably the best you will find.<br /><br />What really makes this particular product great is the price. If you eat sunflower seeds on a regular basis, have a family or friends who like seeds, or have a baseball/softball team, this is for you.<br /><br />If you buy this and subscribe, you get the case of 12 packs for $10.66 with free shipping. That comes out to about $0.88 per bag of seeds. Most stores charge $1.59 or more for a bag of seeds, plus tax!<br /><br />When I ordered my seeds, the expiration date was almost a full year in the future (plenty of time to tear through 12 bags of seeds).<br /><br />This is the deal to have. Eat. Spit. Be Happy!

review/summary: There is David and Sons, then you roll the dice
review/text: I don't know if there are different grades of sunflower seeds, but no other brand comes close to the consistent quality of David and Sons. I have been eating an average of a bag of seeds a day since I was 10 (30 years)..  I will drive to multiple stores to find David and Sons. They are extremely addictive. I like the original best but they have done a great job with all the flavored seeds, especially the ranch.

My son prefers the flavored varieties, but these are my favorite.

review/text: I don't know what's up with the David company but they sure don't make sunflower seeds the way they used to.  They used to be thick and tasty.  Now they're thin and you're lucky if you can find a seed at all.  And they don't taste very fresh.  I just cracked open two that had no seeds.  These sunflower seeds are very skinny, like there's nothing in them.  It's just not as fun as it used to be.<br /><br />Maybe they just need some good old-fashioned competition....I'll go look for some.

review/summary: messy and salty shells, but there is a solution
review/text: I am disappointed to see that the sunflower seeds have very messy shells. They literally stain your fingers with some kind of dusts.<br /><br />Also they are covered with salts so your tongue will feel the salt each time you crack shells with your teeth.<br /><br />The seeds are also small compared to seeds I usually buy from Asian stores.<br /><br />But I later found a solution: rinsing the seeds before eating them!<br />Rinsing will wash away the salts and dusts on the shells and make shells softer, easier to crack. I can even crack the shells with my fingers now.<br /><br />Now I can enjoy sunflower seeds.

review/summary: DEPENDS UPON YOUR TASTE, BUT IN GENERAL THIS IS OKAY STUFF...
review/text: I suppose that horseradish is like everything else, it is all in they eye of the beholder; although in this case we are talking taste buds and sense of smell which really work hand in hand and rely upon each other.  Anyway, we each have different taste expectations when we buy a product billed as "Extra Hot."  This is particularly true when it comes to horseradish.  I suppose this all boils down to what you have experienced in the past; both good and bad.  All of our tastes differ so much that it would be quite impossible to create a product like this that would make everyone happy I should think.<br /><br />I like horseradish and will not eat a roast beef sandwich without it.  Both my wife and I use it in making certain sauces and dressings.  I cannot remember a time when we did not have this stuff in our fridge.<br /><br />Anyway, I most certainly have mixed feeling about this particular product.  It is most certainly NOT the hottest of the hot horseradish I have had in my life.  Now this is not as important to me as it is to my wife.  She likes things extremely hot, whereas I am a bit of a wimp at times.  This stuff is just about right for my taste...although even I could use a degree or two of extra heat here, but it is not to her satisfaction.<br /><br />My primary problem; if problem you want to call it, is that I feel that this stuff is ground too fine.  I like a bit of texture to my horseradish and this stuff is almost creamlike.  I personally would like to find a bit less vinegar taste involved...hey, it I want vinegar I will put it on myself.  This causes a problem with some of the dressings we make.<br /><br />Now don't take me wrong.  I am not really complaining all that much as I do like this product; its just that I feel it could be better with a bit of tweaking here and there.  We will continue to use it. I do like this stuff on my roast beef sandwiches and have even been known to add it to my Italian sub sandwiches I purchase at the local deli.<br /><br />This is a good product but keep in mind that ever one has a bit different taste.  I think if my wife reviewed this product she would give it a much lower rating than I have.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: More like Extra Bland
review/text: I recently purchased this at the grocery store hoping it would live up to its claim of "Extra Hot".  Sadly, it doesn't come close. I put it on my sandwich today that includes 2 slices of country white bread, 3 slices of roast beef, and 1 slice of swiss cheese.  I liberally applied the horseradish, as I really like the taste of it, and sadly I can't even taste the horseradish.  I would at least expect to be able to taste it, given there's really nothing else on my sandwich, let alone have a slight singe in my nose, but no, I get nothing.  I might as well have put bland cardboard paste on my sandwich.. in fact when I get home I'm going to double check the bottle to make sure that it's really not cardboard paste cleverly disguised as horseradish, and then return it to the store.<br /><br />Advice: avoid.

review/text: It is not often that I write a review for something that already has a following, but this time I felt really compelled.  If you are looking for a vegan, organic, and tasty superfood addition to your protein shakes or smoothies, look no further.  I mix it with ground flax seed, vanilla whey protein and Loclo for my morning shake and ever since I started adding it I have felt a surge in energy and physical/mental focus ( i an avid Kettle-bell enthusiast and cross fitter as well as an active duty US Marine ).  This energy stays with me throughout the day.  The taste is a bit overwhelming  by itself, but when mixed with a vanilla protein powder creates this spicy kind of veggie flavor that paris well with the vanilla flavor in the way.  I consider my self a convert to this awesome powder and will probably set up a subscription.

review/text: As soon as I kept noticing my 16-year old cat by the water bowl, I knew.  Kidney failure.  (Chronic Renal Failure)<br />The vet said we caught it early but my cat's appetite started to change and lessen.  I feed all my cats and dogs the organic and free-range foods and preferably "human'grade."<br /><br />For my cats, they all liked Fromm's brand in cans (Fromm Four-star Duck & Chicken Pate) which cost more than $2 a can.  When my cat stopped eating it, I panicked and ran to the vet to get the horrible prescription canned cat food for CRF cats.  They were not cheap and my cat wanted nothing to do with it.  Ditto for all the other premium brands such as Wellness, Wellness core, By Nature Organics, Newman's own organic.<br /><br />When I finally turned to the Halo brand, I was desperate.  My cat did not like Spot's stew but I could tell she liked some of it. So when I noticed Spot's Pate grain-free ground chicken, I bought two cans for her.  I was shocked to see her actually eating it and not just "tasting" it.  I ran to the store and cleaned out their stock of this flavor.<br /><br />Now I no longer have to remember to go to the store, or waste the gas & time.  It's cheaper here at Amazon and it gets delivered to my door for free.  I save even more now that I'm on the subscribe & save plan.
