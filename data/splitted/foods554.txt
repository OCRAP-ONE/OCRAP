review/summary: Fabulous, minimal mess, healthy snack!
review/text: I found these at my local grocery store for a LOT more per pouch and I bought a few to try them out.  My kids LOVED them and my friend told me about Amazon's Subscribe and Save option.  I immediately subscribed for both the regular and strawberry ones (for my non-allergic child).  My 3 1/2 year old and 14 month old children both love to have these as snacks and I love that they can enjoy them without extra sugar and with minimal mess...even in the car!  They also travel well in the diaper bag, which is nice.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: My daughter loves this applesauce. We originally found it at Whole Foods but have since switched to Amazon as the price is slightly better and we love being able to buy it by the case. The product description doesn't state that it's Organic, but this is a product from France and is labeled as being All Natural. The EU actually has higher food safety standards than the US and this meets or exceeds our Organic labeling requirements.<br /><br />The product webpage:[...] has the following brief description of the product "GoGo squeeZ is the first squeezable, re-sealable, no-mess, 100 percent fruit, no sugar added applesauce snack for kids on the go in the US."<br /><br />She loves the taste, and we appreciate that there is no sugar added. The no mess pouch is just a nice bonus.

review/summary: why so expensive -- and what's with the texture?
review/text: I usually buy wheat berries in bulk but had no other choices yesterday and bought the only brand (Nature's Earthly Choice, packaged) carried in my local market. Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a "cooks in 15 minutes" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff.

review/text: One of the things that I missed the most when I went gluten-free was a good, spicy molasses cookie.  This offering from Nana's definitely fits the bill.  I took off one star simply because it is pricey.  On the plus side, the cookies are quite big and it is nice to have an option for vegan treats.  I have tried to make gluten-free cookies of my own and have failed miserably because I try to make them healthy.  I appreciate Amazon for offering these because the company offers low prices, free shipping, and excellent customer service.

review/text: I ordered these off of amazon after reading several reviews.  I discovered I have multiple food allergies and this is the only "treat" I have found that I am able to have.  I think these cookies are great.  Good texture, if a little dense (aren't all gluten free products?), with a nice lemon flavor.  The cookies are also big, so if you want to eat just one serving, which is half the cookie, it is satisfying.  I have also tried warming them up and dipping them in a bit of rice milk, yum!  Liked them so much that I have ordered these again and have also decided to try the ginger ones too.

Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other "healthy" cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not "wheat flour", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies.

I've tried Alternative Baking Company's double chocolate cookie, which I loved, but per cookie they charge $2 a piece. I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as  the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. For any vegans or anyone looking to decrease their sugar intake, this is definitely worth trying.

(The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)<br /><br />Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had:  360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.<br /><br />Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie.

review/text: I love these cookies!  Talk about getting to eat guilt free.  I gave these cookies four stars because someone used to sugar and processed foods could not appreciate these cookies as much as someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords.<br /><br />I can't wait to try some of Nana's other cookies!  If you are used to a whole food diet you will give these cookies five stars!!!!

review/summary: WARNING: NOT Gluten Free
review/text: WARNING WARNING WARNING! I searched for gluten-free oatmeal raisin cookies on Amazon and these cookies came up on the list. These cookies are NOT gluten free. Yes, they contain no wheat, but instead, they have barley flour. Wheat, barley and rye all have natural gluten and *must* be avoided. Do not buy these if you have Celiac disease -- that is, are gluten intolerant.<br /><br />Amazon should fix their search engine to NEVER display products that are not truly gluten free when people search for such. Even now, on the review form, Amazon is suggesting "gluten free" and "celiac" as tags for this product. That is flat out false.

review/text: Yes... i will have to agree with many of you that whom ever gave the poor reviews MUST not have any tolences. I being allergic to all forms of dairy, eggs, all forms of wheat appreciate the taste of having chocolate in my life again. This have far out wayed any other cookies i have tried. Everytime i try a new one, i'm never disappointed. SOFT tasty, taste like a real brownie to me. I love it! I can now get my chocolate fix without getting sick! Being that most products that are gluten free are a bit pricey, these reviews help weigh out rather to try the product itself. So please if you don't have any tolences ...please state it... because you have more choices than us that do not. I would also like to let in on another product that seems to be some kind of secret cause i can't find it anymore but want to spread the word on another delicious chocolate gluten free product sof'ella gluten free chocolate cake mix and fosting mix...this is the best cake i have eaten....just passing along the info...:)

While they are called a cookie, they remind<br />me of my Grandmom's lemon pound cake, and so very soft.  I am a huge Amazon shopper,<br />so when I found them here, I was delighted.  So far, I have probably ordered them 12 times and<br />right now I have two boxes in my pantry.  I've learned to keep plenty on hand so I don't run<br />out of them.  Amazon's price is great, shipping is great and they arrive just perfect.  Thanks!!!!

review/text: This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity. Ah well... lesson learned.

Gluten-free is challenging and getting the best texture is difficult.  Seems like too much reliance on rice flour (cheaper).  Maybe an increase in another gluten-free flour would help.  I ended up donating them to the local food bank.

review/summary: The devil is in the details...
review/text: Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware.

These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past!

And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.  But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;)

For those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions...vegan, sugar substitutes, etc. these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we've been led to believe we want.

review/summary: Yummy and healthy!
review/text: These are the only cookies I have found that I can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a "real" chocolate chip cookie. I try to limit refined sugars, wheat flour, and dairy products in my diet for health reasons, but oh, how I miss cookies. The ones I bake myself just don't taste that great, but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating. I don't know what I'd do without them! I like to freeze them, and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream "ice cream" on top. Yummy!

review/summary: The BEST cookie in the world!
review/text: Nana's Oatmeal Sunflower Cookie is not only the tastiest cookie, it is REALLY healthy! I follow a weight watchers diet and it's only 4 points for the entire cookie.  It tastes soooo good I feel like i'm indulging in something that I shouldn't be eating but I can eat it feeling guilt free!  I now live in the UK and I wish they sold them here! I have to get my mom to send them to me from the states!

review/summary: this cookie is awful
review/text: Are you kidding me???  The 90 positive reviews must be the owners relatives.  This is the worst gluten free product I have ever eaten. It is dry and it is mealy.  The only way it was marginally tolerable was to smother it in chocolate icing.  My wife told me to complain to the company and I told her I didn't want them sending me any free product.

review/text: My family have a lot of food allergies and Nana's cookies are always a good snack... (except for the ginger... I am not a ginger fan.)  These are by far the best.  It taste like a brownie... very yummy.  Even my friends and family that don't have allegies love it.  I have no idea why someone gave it such a poor review... guess they are able to eat a snickers bar.  And calorie wise, it's not that bad... heck of a lot better then other cookies.  I would totally recomend these.  My 2 month old loves them and so do I and my husband.  5 stars!!!

review/summary: Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it..
review/text: These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say "one" cookie, then "half" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth.

review/summary: Really, really sandy
review/text: I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it.

He wanted to continue to eat healthily but wanted something decadent and yummy. I found these cookies. He eats one everyday. It satisfies his sweet tooth, and his numbers have remained within the normal range. These cookies can really be part of a healthy lifestyle, and they are delicious. Both my 12 year old and I eat them as well. My favorite is the coconut-chocolate chip.

review/text: As other reviewers have said, this flavor tends to be slightly more crumbly than other Nana's No Gluten varieties, but certainly not enough so to phase me.  It is also exactly as spicy as most of us know and love about any ginger baked good.  Nana's does a beautiful job of making, packaging, and preserving (naturally) their product.  If you tend to shy away from pre-packaged cookies, trust me, this one will not disappoint!

review/summary: A Great Find!
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with asthma, & can no longer eat wheat products. I must also go extremely light on dairy & any sugars, if I want to avoid severe illness.<br /><br />This cookie is a wonderful solution. It is tasty and chewy, just sweet enough, but it causes no negative symptoms for me. The fat content is from canola oil, which is so much healthier than the usual fat or shortening sources, even in 'healthy' cookies. It also gives me a sense of having had something from the 'bread' food group; but without the negative physical consequences.<br /><br />I am delighted to have found this cookie, & I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Okay, but not great
review/text: I tend to love orange cranberry cookies, but this cookie recipe is not the best. It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S. Only the first ingredient, the whole wheat flour is organic.
