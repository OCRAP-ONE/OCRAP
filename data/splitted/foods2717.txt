review/summary: This ISN"T Sugar Free
review/text: I ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free. It's not. The first ingredient is "SUGAR". It's too much of a pain to return, so I'll keep it and drink it (because it's a pretty good K-cup hot chocolate). I will think twice about ordering it again though. I'd really like to get what I ordered.

review/text: I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic-y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.

review/summary: YUCK!!! Artifical sweetener
review/text: As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.

review/text: I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack.

review/summary: Nice tasting cocoa
review/text: The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.

review/summary: Good taste, bad product
review/text: I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.

review/text: I'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.<br />p.s. 11-27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost!

This does taste greener somehow, but in a good way.  This also has some yerba mate blended in, with additional health benefits.  I have heard the traditional yerba mate isn't the best tasting, but in this blend it tastes good. I highly recommend it.

I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

But all of a sudden the local stores in my area were no longer carrying the Ginger O's but were still carrying other products from Newman.  After researching the web I found that Amazon had them and was so glad to be able to have them in my pantry again.  I am on a special diet (not a diabetic) for my stenosis and have to watch my sugar intake.  These are much lower in sugar than regular cookies and much healthier.  If you like the taste of Ginger you will love them!  (NOTE)  I only eat the cookies, not the filling in the middle - it lowers the amount of sugar and I still get that great Ginger taste).

review/summary: Very spicy!
review/text: If you've had the ghost chile, then you know what you're in for with this salt.  The pepper itself tastes similar to cayenne but is much hotter.  With this salt, you can't really taste the pepper that much, but the spiciness is extremely potent.  I use a small amount of this salt for spice and finish the dish with regular salt.

review/text: I purchased two of these salts.  One to keep and one as a gift.  I received the shipment on a Saturday and there was a small problem with my order.  I contacted the Spice Lab directly and they responded back that same day (on a Saturday).  They were very professional and corrected the issue immediately.  Thank you!!  I WILL be ordering again!!<br /><br />On to the product..  it is amazing!  As described.. VERY HOT!  Two or three granules shared with my mother in law.. she was in tears.  I love heat so I was very happy with the product.  Highly recommended!!

I now buy in bulk at my local store, MUCH cheaper.<br /><br />If you like it milder or as candy these are good.  But I use for upset stomach mainly and although enjoy them like candy dont eat them for that reason.

review/summary: Great Red Sauce
review/text: Having spent most of my life in the Southwest I am very picky about my Mexican food.  For a canned sauce I would rate this the best of the no-transfat sauces.  It has a full flavor that isn't overbearing.  The can says to use it for four enchiladas but I get 8 - 10 out of a 10 oz can.  If you want a great salsa to go with it definitely try La Victoria's Salsa Suprema.

review/text: I have loved this brand for ages, and couldn't help but snag up the blueberry flavor too. Now, I bought this on impulse I guess, because I had no distinct purpose for it upon ordering. However, I have had it a week and already have found that it is great to mix into oatmeal and as a flavorful sweetener when I make homemade sangria. I also plan on mixing it into green tea once the weather cools down again. Overall, this is not as versatile as the Vanilla one (which is my favorite!), but still very tasty and useful.

review/text: I am an avid (or more likely, the world's most loyal and enthusiastic) Tabasco hot sauce lover. I use Tabasco everyday, multiple times a day, and douse it on just about any consumable good. I bought these from the Tabasco Country Store expecting them to be real Tabasco-flavored lollipops (to satisfy my Tabasco cravings independent of food), only to be completely underwhelmed because these are NOT Tabasco-flavored! They are "hot" cinnamon flavored candy, and not only that, but the back of the packaging states that these lollipops may contain lead in them and so you should not consume them! What a let down. I wish there were real Tabasco-flavored Tabasco lollipops out there.

review/text: Lemme just say, it's every bit as miserable as the label and gossip suggest it is. Put a dab of it on a cracker, chomp away, and wait a few moments before you're eyes, nose, and pores start running. This sauce isn't the absolute hottest in the world, but it's right up there. It's a heat that will last a good hour if you "man up" (take it w/o any other food/drink: milk, water, sugar) or about 30 minutes if you throw in the towel and do the aforementioned. This stuff tastes good initially but sneaks up on you with a vengeance. It's for the borderline hardcore. It's the kind of sauce that you pull pranks on people with or challenge "tough guys" with. Plain and simple, it's a hot mess (in the nicest way possible).

review/summary: Great sauce for heat enthusists!
review/text: I actually bought a bottle of this a few years ago from a local Mexican place and have been loving it.. I have about a third of the bottle left and was hoping I could find more here on amazon. Sadly it's not the exact same kind I bought. When I got it, it happened to be during the 20th anniversary of blairs so it was actually a special blend that was 20% hotter then the standard one. Like the others have said is is VERY HOT!! I use it in many things but mostly when making pasta sauces and taco meat. Just a few drops in a whole pan will seriously turn up the heat on anything.. I would really suggest using it like this and not putting it directly on food like you would with Tabasco or franks. This makes even the habenero Tabasco seem like water..Although I do admit is is a great sauce to use on expecting friends for dares or whatnot.. If you have friends who love hot food it's really fun to get them to try it. It always seems to sneak up and surprise people who haven't had it before. Also, this isn't even the hottest sauce blairs makes. They also have their "ultra death" sauce as well as a reserve line that gets even hotter. Although at that point I doubt you'll even notice a difference.. In summation This is about as hot as you could imagine.. You shouldn't be disappointed if that's what you're looking for!!!

review/text: First, be warned that this is VERY HOT, over 100 times hotter than Tabasco sauce, and one should heed the disclaimer that says to use with dilution.  That being said, it is an excellent sauce to use to spice up pretty much anything.  I add a bit if it to buffalo wing sauce and can basically make them as hot as I feel like eating.  It certainly has flavor to go with the heat and has some thickness to it, which is good as I am not a fan of overly watery sauces.

When the six glass bottles arrived in a cardboard box with no padding, one of the bottles was completely crushed and the contents were spilled over the other five (still sealed and intact) bottles.  So the packaging's not great, but moreover the taste is quite unlike the Goddess dressing.  Even if you don't compare it to the Goddess dressing, it's still disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend it.

Just add boiling water to dry contents inside, re-close lid and 3 minutes later you have a hot soup ready to eat!<br /><br />This product is not the healthiest thing you might find yourself snacking on, but is certainly not the worst either.  The worst thing in this cup of soup is the 59% sodium, which is actually quite a lot of sodium compared to most packaged foods.  More sodium, even, than packaged macaroni & cheese, which packs a whole lotta sodium - 41%!<br /><br />So this isn't the kind of thing you want to eat all the time, and seriously do not expect this item to have enough nutrients to keep a body healthy, by eating it as your only item for meals.  I recommend this as a snack item only, and only a few times a week.<br /><br />As a snack-item only, this soup is very tasty and satisfying - and simple enough to make that anyone able to heat & pour boiling water can have a warm, substantial snack!

review/text: Very attractive packaging, lots of almonds, order arrived in a very timely fashion.  However this white chocolate was disappointing.  The flavor suggested they were trying to make up for this not being dark or milk chocolate by adding way too much sugar.  Kept tasting it trying to find that signature white chocolate consistancy and flavor...  disappointing.  Hershey's white has a better consistancy and flavor.  Too bad.

review/text: These delicious mini-crackers are small enough to grab a satisfying handful. Yep, it's got all the organic requisites, organically-fed cows whose lips never taste hormones or antibiotics (well, maybe these are injected, I don't know), and the crackers contain non-hydrogenated, trans-fat free organic palm oil.<br /><br />The taste is mild but you can taste the cheddar, and the texture is more flakey than hard or brittle. If you grab 30 crackers (one ounce, there are 5ounces, or 150 crackers per box), you'll get 310 mg of sodium, or 13% of the Recommended Daily Value (RDV) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Now that's by any means low-sodium, but you can easily eat half of that and feel you've had a snack. Per 30 crackers, there are 4.5 grams (g) oftotal fat, of which 1.5 are saturated, and none are trans fat. Total carbohydrates are 19g, including less than 1g of sugar, but also less than 1g of dietary fiber. Hey, noone said this is health food, but compare this to what you're snacking on now (and that cheese gives it 3g of protein).<br /><br />Full ingredients and nutritional information may be found at latejuly.com/products, but other good stuff includes organic wheat flour, organic whey, sea salt, and organic evaporated cane juice. Nothing artificial, no corn syrup, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, and they're both Kosher and Lacto Vegetarian (gotta make sure there's no meat in your crackers...). If that's not enough, "Late July" is independently owned and family operated.<br /><br />Mainly, though, it's the light taste, the organic ingredients, and that enticing small size you can grab by the fistful.  Full information at the above-mentioned website.

review/text: I have loved Cheez-Its since I was a kid and was very skeptical that an organic cheese cracker could taste as good.  Well, these taste as good if not better and are organic and, although I did not compare the nutritional information, they seem less oily.  The only problem is, they are just as addictive, so buyer beware.

review/text: I love the texture of these crackers and the cheese flavor, but I gave it four stars opposed to five because they were quite salty.  Too salty for my taste, but once I start to eat them it's hard to stop (kind of like the oh so good potato chip).  I would enjoy them much better and would buy them more frequently if they could loose about half of the sodium content.

review/text: We liked this product and so bought bulks from Amazon.  This was our second box of 12.  Now we find quite some crackers are in clumps which are not fully baked due to their size.  These days machines should have automatic senors that can reject the poorly formed crackers.  It makes me wonder the condition of the factory and how organic products are qualified.

review/summary: Pineapple lovers will be disappointed
review/text: If you're looking for the thick chunks of dried pineapple this is not the product to get. I picked up a bag of these from my local Trader Joe's because I didn't know any better and was extremely disappointed. If I was to describe what these dried pineapples were like I would say they are like thinly sliced cores of pineapples that did not fully mature and instead of discarding them the farmers found a way to salvage them by renaming them "baby" pineapples. However, baby pineapples are indeed a real variation of pineapples. But like I said, if you're looking for thick pineapple chunks, don't look here. Also if you have a Trader Joe's near you and you really want to try them, just get a bag for $4.

review/summary: you'll never think of mayonnaise the same way again after trying Kewpie
review/text: I never liked mayonnaise until I went to Japan, where I gained a new respect and appreciation for the condiment. The reason? Japanese mayo is different. And it tastes better.<br /><br />Before that, I was only familiar with standard American supermarket varieties like Hellman's and Kraft, and the idea of putting them on things like leaf salads and fries wasn't particularly appealing.<br /><br />Kewpie, though the ingredients are similar, has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture, making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods. They go great on fries (Belgian style), leaf salads, and grilled meats. Japanese people put mayo on a lot of things, including okonomiyaki, takoyaki, yakitori, even pizza.<br /><br />There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle. It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob. The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag, with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti. This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food, letting you control its distribution as well as design. Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns, like the pattern you see on the bag. If you remove the cap, the inner opening is star shaped, allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.<br /><br />It is far superior to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5EAK">Kraft Mayo Real Mayonnaise, 18-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles</a>, which come in an overly-rigid bottle with a horizontal slot that easily introduces air into the bottle as it re-inflates for the next squeeze, causing frequent splatter. Mayo also clings to the bottle's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze. Kewpie doesn't have this problem. It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube. Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy. The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels, making it easy to see how much is left, and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.<br /><br />Nutrition values are similar to American mayo. 100 calories per tablespoon (90 from fat), 20mg cholesterol, 100mg sodium. It does not contain any preservatives or artificial additives besides MSG. Kewpie is made in Japan, not in US subsidiary factories, so this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite. Give it a try and see why this is loved by so many people in Japan and Japanese food lovers the world over.

review/summary: A must-have for dynamite sauce
review/text: I purchase this mayonnaise regularly, usually more than one bottle at a time. I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce, although it is very nice in sandwiches as well. This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it, and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise.<br /><br />The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever. You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.<br /><br />A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises.

review/summary: Best mayo of all!
review/text: We lived four years in Japan and love Japanese food.  Was so happy to find this on Amazon as it's the only mayo we use.  It makes yummy potato salad.  We boil potatoes in a large pot, drain water, pour on some Japanese rice wine vinegar, add some finely sliced onion, cover and let this sit for a while.  When it's cooled a bit, we add chopped hard boiled eggs, some salt and pepper, a bit of Frenches mustard, and Kewpie mayo.  We prefer the potatoes in our potato salad to be more creamy than chunky, so tend to cook the potatoes a bit longer and stir everything together adding more mayo til it's the consistency we like.  This way is similar to what one buys in Japan.  Kewpie mayo also makes great deviled eggs!

review/summary: Just tastes better
review/text: I always used to hate mayonnaise, and couldn't imagine using it as a regular condiment.  Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise.<br /><br />Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto, which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami.  Umami is a special flavor, found mainly in Asian cooking, that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness.  Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking, especially for making salad dressings.  That hint of umami makes all the difference.<br /><br />Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans.  Aside from tasting great, it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge, knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better.

review/text: Mayonnaise is something I usually associate with salads, (read boring rubbish here, in my opinion). However, I have been surprised just how much it is used in Japanese food.<br /><br />Although you can use it with normal salads, I have also enjoyed it very much with takoyaki, (octopus dumplings in a ball shape). It also mixes well with other sauces, such as with Japanese barbeque and so on. Even dipping things like chips, (health food, really!), for a snack works.<br /><br />It is a bit different to other types, but it is very nice with a pleasant and creamy taste to it. Recommended!
