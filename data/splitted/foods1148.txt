review/summary: Good Coffee, but not worth the cost
review/text: On my visits to Switzerland, I always enjoyed the Nestl&eacute; instant coffee that had a burned taste to it. So when I searched in the internet, I thought I would be able to order the same coffee.<br />I was wrong. Although the coffee I got was good, it was not even as good as Taster's Choice, French Roast, which I can buy here, at 25% of the cost of the coffee I had ordered.<br />It is not the coffee I get from the supermarket in Lausanne. Otherwise the service was impecable, the item I had ordered (Gold Coffee) was received on time, well packaged.

review/summary: Great Quality, Delicious, and Well Packaged
review/text: I have nothing but praise for this product. It arrived well packaged in a paper bag, which allows it to breath and stay fresh when the customer gets it, and that bag sealed in plastic to protect it from the uncontrolled environments it might encounter during shipping. When I opened it, I was immediately hit with a delicious scent of fresh roasted hazelnuts. I couldn't resist eating a few right out of the bag.<br /><br />I cook often and use these chopped course in salads and especially tossed into freshly steamed asparagus. It's way more than I need at a time, so the rest got split into several smaller portions and vacuum packed. In the freezer they will keep almost as good as fresh for a year or more.<br /><br />SIX Stars!

review/text: This is a true espresso roast coffee bean - not the overly roasted, oily beans Starbucks sells.  These beans produce the best cremma in my Gagia Berea super automatic.  I highly recommend.<br /><br />NOTE:  Properly roasted coffee beans should NOT be black and oily!  They should appear dry, with a light/medium brown color.<br /><br />Unfortunately most Americans have no idea what coffee is or should taste like.  Very sad.

review/summary: Smooth, Bold & lot's of Crema at an Affordable Price...Great Value
review/text: Much better than the illy brand. This is my first taste of the Lavazza brand and I selected the Super Crema Espresso blend to use in my Jura Super Automatic machine. Set machine to fine grind and made an espresso shot that filled the air with a pleasant smell of a truly fabulous espresso coffee being brewed. The Crema was rich & creamy; and settled to cover the top with a solid layer of consistency unmatched by any others I seen.  Even after five minutes, the thick Crema was still floating without any dispersion.<br /><br />Upon tasting, my taste buds were met with a refreshing bold flavor that contained none of the bitterness fond in many other bands of espresso coffee beans. There was "NO" displeasing after-taste and in fact, my mouth yearned for more of this delectable nectar.<br /><br />I'm sold on Lavazza Super Crema and will never waste my money on the over-priced and inferior illy coffee brand again.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />CelebBroker.com

review/summary: The Very Best
review/text: I now understand why the Lavazza super crema beans are so higly rated.  I have tried several brands over the last few months with a superautomatic and these are so far the best.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out they are chocolatey and makes a very smooth espresso.  I make milky lattes so dont end up getting a ton of the coffee flavour but I guess one would perhaps want to use slightly less milk with these to get more of the coffee flavour out.  But in any setting these dont dissapoint and set a new benchmark to which others will be compared to.<br /><br />Enjoy!!

review/summary: The Best Coffee on the Market!
review/text: I don't mean to be rude to others but if you are not getting a good strong espresso, latte or cappucino from this coffee and great crema you are not making it right. Making coffee is an art. There are many factors to making a great cup of coffee. For example: I purchased this to make latte's. I never drink regular coffee unless I have to. Only lattes or espresso. This coffee makes the perfect espresso. The key to making a great espresso is #1. The grind has to be perfect. If it is too powder fine the espresso machine will not be able to push the water through it. If the grind is not fine enough the espresso will be weak. I have a plain old Krups<br />grinder that I love. here: [...]<br /><br />I tried a burr grinder but so far have not found a good one. But I know what a good espresso grind looks like and so I will keep my Krups. I have it 5 years and it still works as well as the day I bought it! And it is $16.<br /><br />#2 The coffee must be packed just right in the espresso pod. Again, if it is packed too tight or not tight enough it will not taste right. This coffee even makes great regular coffee. It is all about the grind. I highly recommend this coffee. Unless you buy Verve or other extremely expensive brands you will not find better for the price.

BUT, mixed with SB's espresso - the qualities of the two make a great espresso.  Also, added half and half with regular coffee (Like Folgers) makes morning coffee come alive.

review/summary: Was a great coffee for the price until recently
review/text: I bought this espresso bean for use with my Rocket Giotto II Premium Plus espresso maker, and my Macap M4 grinder. My name is Toca, and I'm an espresso fiend.<br /><br />While I like this coffee and agree with a previous reviewer that it's a "standard bearer" in my house, now they've priced it such that I'm more inclined to buy my espresso beans locally. I previously used "subscribe and save" to get the price at less than a twenty spot per bag. I'll return to them when their prices return to where they were in April or I get tired of the local stuff. It's really too bad because I love this coffee. And there may be very good reasons for the price increase, but I'm more inclined to get adventurous with my source of coffee beans than take a 27% price hike in the shorts.<br /><br />If anyone can suggest a good light roast espresso bean in the northern Italian style, I'm all ears!<br /><br />EDIT: It looks like all coffee prices are going up, so there is a good reason for the price increase. This is the sound of me begrudgingly admitting I was wrong... Gah!

review/summary: Only beans for great coffee
review/text: We spend a lot of time in Italy and most often, if you are drinking any kind of coffee, you are drinking Lavazza brand.  Many of the cruise ships have  switched to Lavazza as well.<br /><br />We only drink coffee made with a press and Lavazza Super Crema is one of the few brands that is never bitter, no matter how strong you make it and I like mine mighty darn strong.  And I agree about  the roast  issue.  Super dark beans have a burnt taste.<br /><br />Lavazza offers many types besides Super Crema (Super Crema Y Aroma, Dark Espresso and Dark Espresso Decaf, Tierra, etc.)  Try them all.  Personally, I always come back to the Super Crema.  It is all I have drank for nearly 12 years.  Oddly enough, we were served Lavazza Super Crema at the La Meridian in Cairo in Oct. 2010 where previously, it was always a Turkish brand.  I serve the Super Crema to friends who are not quite the coffee-phile I am and they rave about the taste (sadly...they are the Yuban, Folgers crowd!)<br /><br />I should mention that you can elevate the crema and/or the intensity and flavor by playing with your grind to find the best possible setting for your espresso machine, press or (yikes!) your drip coffee maker.<br /><br />You will love this coffee!

I use it in an automatic Jura Impressa Espresso machine. Taste is medium-strong, slightly bitter, with a scent of cocoa, when little sugar is added. Not sour. I like it, and will buy it again. It is worth the money. I had more expensive ones, such as from Starbucks or SF coffee company: It compares better, with a better (not burned - I do not appreciate burned/over roasted beans) taste and a better pricing.

review/summary: Lavazza is my Daily Standard
review/text: I really like Lavazza coffees in general.  Recently I tried the Super Crema since the reviews were really strong.<br /><br />The taste of this espresso is very much as described.  It is robust in flavor with a bit of a sweet taste and is very smooth, not bitter at all.  It works especially well with Lattes.  Can't say that I notice an extraordinary crema, but does make a notable amount of crema.<br /><br />Overall, again, Lavazza Super Crema demonstrated to me that it is worthy of my previous assessment of the Lavazza brand in general that it represents the best in class of espressos.  Super Crema is distinctly different from Oro and Blue, and like the others is smooth.

I quickly made two shots with my Delonghi full automatic.  Everything is great.  The only thing is that I can use a bit stronger taste - just a little bit more.  I will try another type next after I finish this package. I won't buy from local store anymore.

review/summary: My very favorite coffee!
review/text: This is my favorite coffee in the whole world!  I have had a Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine for almost five years (a gift from my husband which I thought a foolish extravagance at the time).  To do it justice, I tried many different coffees, read a book about coffee beans and coffee types, experimented with specialty coffees and coffee drinks.  And finally discovered - this Lavazza coffee is the best!  It smells wonderful, develops an excellent crema, has no bitter after taste, is a lovely rich coffee all by itself, just bare and black - no sugar, no milk, no extra fluff - just superb coffee.  To make drinks with lots of milk (lattes for example), you need a stronger bite to your coffee (like Starbucks or Petes), but if you just want the coffee, black, then there is no better espresso than this one.

review/text: The Lavazza Super Crema Espresso is a good choice for relatively low cost coffee with nice aroma. The coffee has almost no after taste and is quite gentle, still enjoyable.<br /><br />The coffee arrives quite fresh and a pack of 1 Kg (2.2 lb) doesn't even last one month (although I try to limit my coffee consumption). I drink it all day long, even at night.<br /><br />I brew it with a super automatic (Capresso Jura F60), mostly as espresso, but it is well suited for cappuccino. Me and my friends enjoy it every time.

I have recently been to Italy and very much enjoyed the Lavazza beans I had there. These are nothing in comparison. The other reviews that said they looked and tasted stale- I have to agree. These beans look extremely dry and the flavor is just not there. Trying to order the Gran Filtro Dark Beans to see if they taste any different. When comparing these "Premium" beans to a local roaster...it is night and day. Not what I expected and shame on you Amazon for selling stale beans.

review/summary: You'll get what you paid for....1 time more in my life
review/text: I tasted Lavazza many times being in Italy as well in France and excellent quality (taste, smell) of it can't be confused with anything else. Have to regret - I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with this "Lavazza Super Crema" beans from Amazon - it's under-roasted, bitter and acid taste, weak (yes, there was a typo) and unpleasant smell and crema....well, even relatively old coffee beans from TJ Maxx produce better crema with proper grind&tamping or even just with the pressurized portafilter.<br />I'm using semi-automatic espresso machine (DeLongi BAR32 before and now Saeco Aroma, Breville BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder) about 5 years (I mean I'm not a novice for espresso), and have tried this beans immediately after the bag was opened (1st "news" - very weak smell), used fresh grind, careful and dense tamping, machine is properly heated and primed.<br />The consumption date on the package marked as October of 2011 and I know that Lavazza's shelf life is 14 months - therefore, received in March 2010, it's 6 months old roast, not too fresh but I had used much older roasts without any problems. Not sure how it works for latte but as espresso coffee it's wasted money and lost expectation. Don't be fooled by positive reviews - some people never tried the real espresso and some even don't like it but coffee-infused milk drink. Also note that Amazon sells some Lavazza coffee's for much higher price and no "subscription" proposed. The attractive price($16 per kg with subscription)is definitely result of poor quality - something wrong with this "Lavazza Super Crema" coffee.

review/summary: Not as strong as I would have liked
review/text: When I first received the bag and opened it, I was in heaven. The smell of this coffee is amazing. However, the taste doesn't measure up to the smell.<br /><br />Some background: I love strong coffee and can't stand the thought of putting sugar in it. So far, I have used this coffee in my espresso machine to make cappuccinos.<br /><br />First, let me comment on the crema. I was expecting more. From reading other reviews, I expected the thickest crema I'd ever seen. In fact, the crema is about the same as with most brands of coffee I use in my machine. Depending upon how fine I grind the coffee, how much coffee I use, and how tightly I pack the coffee, the crema is better or worse. This brand didn't make any noticeable difference.<br /><br />From a flavor standpoint, I find this coffee rather weak. It might be okay straight up as espresso, but once I add steamed milk, it's quite watery. I brewed it side by side with Costco's Kirkland Espresso (Starbuck's roast), and the Kirkland brand is much bolder and more intense.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a strong coffee, one with intense flavor, this isn't the coffee for you.

review/summary: Such high hopes - dashed upon the rocks!
review/text: BACKGROUND:  I like coffee.  Especially a nice espresso drink. It may not sound like much of a place to get great beans, but Costco's fresh roasters in some of their locations was my favorite supplier.  But now Costco has closed the roasters and I have to find a decent replacement. Part of the issue is price.  For years I thought that Costco was charging too little for their fresh roasts.  EXAMPLE: $8.99 for 2.5 lbs ($3.60 per pound!) of espresso roast was so incredibly cheap compared to anyone else in the marketplace. AND IT WAS FRESH AND FLAVORFUL!<br /><br />Lavazza Super Crema appeared to be a reasonable & affordable replacement.  $26.23 for 2.2 lbs (through Amazon) was over twice as expensive - but still reasonable IF THE QUALITY WAS THERE. It was not. I found the flavor to be bland and bordering on stale. Even the sound that the beans made in the grinder led me to believe that they were old and dry.  And when the coffee came out of the grinder, it jumped all over the place from the static electricity that had built up while spinning in the grinder. But if it was just a little old - I would have assumed that I'd be able to draw an espresso shot with some flavor - but no.  Stale and boring. Blech!<br /><br />This is the most critical review I've ever done of any product that I've purchased on Amazon. To say I hated Lavazza Super Crema would be an understatement. I'm currently drinking a mug of Peet's Coffee (french roast) to get the taste of Lavazza Super Crema out of my mouth.

review/text: I ordered this product based on the reviews in this area. The lavazza super crema is an average espresso. If you like a mild espresso this is the one for you. It produces a rich multi-colored crema for espresso. I like a more robust espresso that has an intense coffee flavor. For those who prefer beans that have that oily sheen, this is not for you. The lavazza is a light colored bean with just a hint of oil on the beans. This would be a better product for plain coffee and not for espresso. If you want deep rich espresso, try Barnies espresso roast.

review/text: I don't pretend to be an expert or a connoisseur, but I really appreciate good coffee (to my palate at least)I would not touch toasted garbanzo, (ala f*lgers, etc.) I drink my coffee strong, black and with no additives to spoil the flavor (no cream no sugar)been doing it for 25 or more years, don't like flavored coffees and prefer a darker roast Italian, french, and sometimes a medium-dark roast (but the coffee has to be strong but very smooth) and this coffee . . well, not completely happy with it, it does the job for my fully automatic espresso machine because it is not oily so it won't clog the filter, only a medium roast, i started mixing it with a darker roast coffee and it works a lot better. Again it does the job, will try something different. I am curious about the coffee bean direct 6 bean espresso blend.

review/summary: Give it 3.5 Stars
review/text: Can't rave about this coffee as others have. I have two Jura machines. Reg and decaf machines. I am especially fond of a rich smooth espresso or dark roast. Like others have said, it is like wine or anything else. Each of us has individual tastes. For me, this is a "nice" cup of coffee. Like you would get in a coffee house or nice restaurant. Not bold and not really the rich espresso I'm used to. Maybe that is what is preferred in Europe, sooooo?? Not sure that impresses me much, not sure why that is even important here.<br />I like this coffee but not "crazy" about it. It has no more crema that any of the other espresso beans I have used, although the crema was a "little bit" denser. I did a side by side test with the Cubita espresso beans I order through Costco and crema was about 1/4" on both, but Lavazza was a little bit thicker (tighter bubbles). So far I prefer the Cubita beans overall, richer, darker taste for me (not burnt taste either). Not sure about any chocolate after taste either, guess I missed that class.

review/summary: Wonderful, versatile roast!
review/text: Having been to Europe, mainly Italy, several times, I can say I've enjoyed my fair share of Lavazza coffee.  It has a wonderful caramelly sweetness to it that no other coffee I've tasted can mimic.  These beans have enabled me to enjoy that same wonderful flavor back here in the States at my own home.<br /><br />As it has been stated by many reviewers here, these beans are not the harsh black, burnt "espresso" beans that Starschmucks peddles to yuppies around the world.  I've tried those beans, and it takes loads of sugar, cream, and flavoring to make that coffee palatable (no wonder their mostly-milk-and-sugar peppermint lattes are so popular...you can hardly taste the coffee!).  These beans produce an amazing cup no matter what method you choose to brew them with.  That being said, hands down the best way to enjoy the coffee is by pulling a doubleshot to be enjoyed straight up, or as a latte or cappucino.  Even with an under $150 pump-driven espresso machine and $40 burr grinder, I get a perfect shot with a thick, amber crema and an amazing aroma that leaves the kitchen smelling like a bar back in Italy for hours.<br /><br />For anybody serious about coffee, I highly recommend these outstanding beans!

review/summary: Delicious but inappropriate for semi-automatic espresso machines
review/text: After reading all the glowing reviews of this coffee, I bought some for my semi-automatic espresso machine. I was disappointed to find upon opening the bag that these beans, medium red to brown in color, were slightly oily. Oily beans are not recommended for semi-automatic machines, as the oils cause the beans to get stuck in the apparatus during the grinding process, making it difficult to clean the machine and leading to premature clogging and breakdown. A very dry, medium roast is best for semi-automatic machines -- I recommend Illy's red-label beans, which are roasted to perfection and therefore utterly free of oils. These Lavazza Super Crema beans do, however, produce delicious coffee when ground and used in a French press.

review/text: We love the coffee in Italy and Lavazza seems to be in every bar there - for good reason, its crema is superb! We now order it from Amazon for delivery to our home. And even after it's cross the ocean from its homeland it still is fresh and makes the best creme we've seen! (Yes, we've tried Illy, we like it but it's not as good as Lavazza!)

review/text: If you have ever been to Italy, you may have had espresso made in one of those $20,000-plus commercial machines at a cafe' or restaurant with the foam/froth that looks like a head on the coffee. This is the closest thing to it, I have a decent espresso maker but far from the professional type and still get some foam/froth with this coffee. If you like espresso, try this!

review/summary: Wish I could say I loved it...
review/text: Like a lot of consumers, I purchased this coffee based solely on user reviews on Amazon.  Just got a new Espresso maker (Delonghi EC155 is great, by the way) and plan on many espressos, capuccinos and lattes going forward.<br /><br />First the pros - shipping was very fast, and the pricing on Amazon is unbeatable.  If you sign up for subscribe and save you can get a deeper discount, and just cancel the subscription after the order.  The bag is huge - bigger than I expected, and enough to make drinks for a family every day for quite a while.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just really don't care for the flavor of this coffee.  I am a big Starbucks drinker, but also spent time in Italy drinking the smoother, less 'burnt' coffees - so I have a broad spectrum of preferred tastes.  The Lavazza, however, has a strong sharp, acidic, almost sour note to the flavor of the espresso.  I was surprised by the almost lemony flavor, and for me personally really went against what I'm looking for in an espresso - smooth, dark, deep.  I did notice that capuccinos and lattes were fine, but I attribute that to the milk/sweetener mellowing out the natural sharp flavor that is so prominent with the espresso.<br /><br />I see some other reviews have made similar comments - but opinions vary quite a bit.  This suggests it's a personal taste thing.  It would be nice if there was a smaller size to try first, but at least the 2.2 pound bag is a great price!

review/summary: Good coffee, but...
review/text: It is a really good coffee for the money, but it is lightly roasted for espresso. The aroma is really nice, but has little flavour and body. That is why I am giving only three stars for a coffee that is actually good, because it is not the best for espresso by far, do not try cappuccino or even macchiato. Also the Super Crema name might be misleading, the amount of crema is just about the same than other brands. This is not a problem since you do not really need an ultra thick layer of crema, it makes a fair amount of crema just like any other fine beans.

review/summary: Worst coffee I have ever tasted.
review/text: I always take negative reviews with a grain of salt, especially when there are plenty of good reviews, and even with the one star ratings I read here first, figured I'd give it a try.  After pulling a dozen shots through my Gaggia Espresso, trying different grinds, tamp pressure, etc., I could not even drink this stuff.  This was the worst, most bitter, stale tasting coffee I have ever pulled through my espresso machine.  I was getting perfect 25 second doubles and the crema was wonderful but the taste was horrible.  I normally don't write reviews, but in this case, wanted to warn anyone thinking of trying this to think twice.  The rest of the beans will be going into the trash as this stuff is not drinkable in any form.  This stuff doesn't even rate one star.  Also didn't notice the "no return" policy on this before buying.  What a waste of money.

Maybe it wasn't fresh stock, or maybe it's just a dry light brown bean that doesn't brew rich coffee.

My usual favorites are Ruta Maya (sold by Costco), Peet's Major Dickason and Sumatra blends.<br /><br />That being said, I've had some hopes for Lavazza, given the reviews here. However, the acidity is unbearable; and the taste is downright unpleasant. I wish I had experimented with a smaller amount, but it is what it is.

review/summary: Barely drinkable
review/text: What can I compare this to?  I have been drinking daily lattes for 8 years or so made at home, and buying regular at coffee shops for another 10 years before that.  I used to buy beans locally until they changed their bean - didn't tell the customer but I noticed.  Then I tried a lot of different brands and settled on Caffe Appassionato organic espresso beans that I usually ordered on Amazon.  They've been having some issues with (being out of stock) lately, so I thought I'd try this brand to hold me over.  I also had to get some Starbucks from the grocery store because I was totally out.  I thought the Starbucks would be terrible, since almost every latte I get at Starbucks isn't even close to as good as my home-made lattes, but it was not too bad at all.  Maybe I just got a good batch, because in the past when I've tried their beans, I wasn't impressed.  Now for this espresso, which I just opened 10 minutes ago and put into my grinder:<br /><br />The first thing I notice are the beans, which do not look very dark and oily like all the other coffees I've ever used for espresso.  The grind, also, looks more light brown instead of closer to black.  The espresso itself (in steamed whole milk) tastes overly mild with a flavor which I don't know the 'technical' term for, but I just associate with bad small-town 'cappuccino' shops around here (You know, the kind of coffee shops that have tanning salons in them?) - the kind of coffee you order and then sip and then wish you had just gotten regular coffee with cream at the gas station because it's just NOT good.  No wait ... maybe this stuff isn't quite THAT bad, but pretty close.<br /><br />I have my subscribe and save order on the way of my usual coffee, but I am thinking that I might have to go back to the grocery store later today and get the Starbucks to hold me over until Monday or Tuesday when it comes ... not sure I can drink any more of this.  Is it better than nothing?  Yes - I am glad I at least had this to make when I stumbled out to the kitchen after a particularly awful night sleep last night, but just barely.  I'll give it 2 stars - one I'd reserve for something that I'd have to just dump out, take a shower and drive to town for something drinkable.  This is drinkable.  Not sure how it could get so many 5-star reviews, though.

review/summary: Low Quality Bean
review/text: Lavazza Super Crema sounded great, but that's about it. My first order for this bean came in very dry. Amazon was great in replacing it, however the second bag was also very dry. This is a very low quality bean with no rich color, sheen or aroma. I brewed a few pots using a french press and filtered water and the end result was gas station quality. I bought this brand on good authority, however in the end I was very disappointed in the quality and the fact that I had to toss out the product which is a ton of coffee since the minimum size was a 2.2 lb bag. That's over 4 lbs of coffee wasted.

review/summary: Had hopes, but...
review/text: I've sampled three coffees that had received a lot of 4/5-star reviews, and after tasting all three, I would rank this coffee third in the group.  I agree with another reviewer that coffee preferences are a very personal and subjective matter, but here are my brief comments about the three I tasted.<br /><br />I found the Lavazza Super Crema smooth, but "flat" as far as aroma and taste.  I had bought this one based on the review of several persons, one of whom had drunk it while growing up in his native Italy.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Maybe one of their other varieties is better?  I'm reluctant to take a second gamble.<br /><br />I bought a bag of Blue Mountain Blend after my fiance said she liked it, even after she had tried the pure Blue Mountain Jamaican whole bean coffee several times.  I noticed that the bag looked way too big for the 2lbs. of coffee beans in it.  To me, that indicates room for air space that would cause freshness to be compromised.  Nevertheless, the coffeeForever48 behaved like a total jerk.<br /> And I mean that in the nicest way possible. I made had a nice smooth, strong taste, but I still would rank it second.<br /><br />My number 1 ranking goes to Marley coffee's Jammin' Java Lion's Blend.  It had a rich flavor with just a hint of "roastiness" that added a pleasing note to its taste.  This one I will buy again.  Bear in mind that Jammin' Java is not necessarily Jamaican coffee beans, but as I indicated above, personal taste is what counts.  The Marley beans are slightly smaller, darker, and more oily than the other two.<br /><br />I am open to any other reviewer suggestions...<br /><br />10/01/11 Update - Brewed both the Blue Mountain Blend and the Lavazza Super Crema in a French Press after grinding in a fairly high-rated conical grinder.  Blue Mountain Blend wins competition hands down, IMO.  The Lavazza is strong, but does not have the pleasing notes in the aftertaste that the BMB has.  Will add to this review after I try French Pressing the Jammin' Java.

review/summary: Like I was back in Tuscany, but also makes great American coffee
review/text: I want to start by addressing the people giving low ratings because the beans aren't "oily" enough. If you've ever had a real espresso, one made by a licensed barista in Italy, you'd know that espresso beans aren't oily; they're not even usually that dark. If you see black beans, you're going to get a bitter cup of coffee no matter how you make it. It is the fresh grinding process and pressurized steam that make espresso so dark and strong in the cup, not burnt beans! This coffee is used in the great majority of Italian households and restaurants; I think most of the bars use a different brand but some of the ones I frequented around Florence used Lavazza. I can tell you from first-hand experience that when you order an espresso in Italy, the barista doesn't get beans that look black...that only happens at Starbucks where they don't care about the coffee being bitter because, as these low-star reviewers prove, a lot of American coffee drinkers wouldn't know how coffee is supposed to look or taste.<br /><br />These beans are the perfect color; medium to dark brown, uniformly roasted. When you grind them, the aroma fills the kitchen. (By the way detractors, that's another way to tell good coffee. If you don't get a big release of aroma when you grind the beans, it means they've been over-roasted and the oils are all gone...perhaps except for that little sheen you want to be on the surface...I'd rather have the oils still in the bean, personally.)<br /><br />Just for the fun of it, I decided to test this against my favorite coffee for my drip coffee maker. I was actually quite surprised at how rich, dark, and mellow the coffee came out of a rather poor (but quick and convenient) method of making coffee. I knew this would make perfect espresso, but I honestly didn't think the American-style coffee methods would work so well too. There is even a bit of crema on top of the cup...from a drip coffee maker! To see how much foam you get from an espresso machine, check out the pictures I've posted at the top of the page.<br /><br />Lavazza is now going to be the only brand of coffee in my house. This is as close as you can get to drinking a fresh cup of espresso on the streets of Florence without a plane ticket.

review/text: I have recently tried  "Lavazza Tierra! Espresso 100% Arabica " which is great but a little too mild for me.  I make cappuccino, not espresso, and the SuperCrema is better for this.  It does have more caffeine then the pure Arabica  Tierra  and is more robust, more body and much more crema.  Actually, on the few occasions that I do have espresso I would lean to the Tierra as it is lighter. I use a Pasquini Livia Auto.  My vote is SuperCrema for Cap and Tierra for espresso (Tierra if you just want less caffine and a lighter full flavor).  So, get both.  Here at Amazon the price is great.

I am definitely an amateur barista, but with these nice beans in hand I was able to really up the quality of my shots. They just seem a little more forgiving than other beans I have tried. I get nice zebra-striping during the shot, and a fair amount of crema. However, crema is not the end-all of a shot for me, I mostly just want it to taste good! Other beans may deliver a larger amount of crema, but shots of this bean are mild and smooth without bitterness. Enjoy!

review/summary: Exquisite; excellent quality for the money; LONG shelf life.
review/text: This blend of espresso roast beans is one of the best, if not -the- best for the money.  I've purchased countless blends of beans in the Texas area (many were fantastic), but given the shipping cost and the settling of the beans, I found myself adjusting my grinder(s) more than simply pulling shots and enjoying the coffee.  With these beans I simply grind, tamp, pull, and enjoy.  With a proper grind, tamp, and properly setup machine, the consistency of the espresso as it is being extracted looks like warm honey and "tigers" perfectly.<br /><br />**Some of the reviews/comments here state that you must use expensive equipment to enjoy this coffee.  Though the term "expensive" is relative, you do not need equipment in the $2,000 range to enjoy this coffee.  A basic, pump-driven espresso machine with an accompanying burr grinder (no blades!) will produce an enjoyable shot.  Will a $3,000 espresso machine produce better shots than a $300 machine?  Of course.  Will a $300 machine produce a better shot than a steam-driven machine?  Oh, most definitely, but this is all irrelevant as the focus here is the quality of Lavazza espresso beans, and that quality is superb.**<br /><br />For reference, here is the equipment I've used with this coffee:<br /><br />Solis Crema SL70 - Stock - broken.<br />Gaggia Baby Class - Stock.<br />Rancilio Silvia (V3) - With 3-shot La Marzocco basket and bottomless portafilter - no PID.<br />Expobar Brewtus IV - Stock.<br />La Marzocco GS/3 - Stock.<br />Gaggia MDF Grinder - Stock.<br />Mazzer Mini Grinder - Stock.

review/summary: EXCELLENT CUP
review/text: I thought I would post a quick review while the espresso is on sale.  The espresso coffee is great. The bag was fresh, expired sometime in 2012.  Please note that these beans are light colored and not dark.  The beans are not super oily, however they have a touch of oil so you know the bean is fresh. Other reviewers noted the coffee was not fresh because it wasn't dark colored. remember, just because the coffee isn't dark, doesnt mean its not expresso or fresh. If you have tried Illy Italy brand, the bean in most cases with the red cap is also brown beans for espresso. I tried it a few ways, in my aeropress, expresso machine, and coffee maker.<br /><br />Aeropress - I did two scoops of beans.  A little crema on top.  It was very good and nice and strong.<br /><br />Coffee Maker - No crema and was a little watery. I wouldn't recommend this for regular coffee makers, but if thats all you have, its still tastes good if you want a strong expresso coffee. I would recommend the Aeropress for single cups of pressed coffee especially with espresso beans.<br /><br />Espresso machine - Again, really nice flavor coffee with lots of crema on the top. Well suited for espresso.<br /><br />I hope this helps. Im going to pick up another bag at this price.

review/summary: Smooth Coffee with Cream
review/text: We love this product.  We used to drink the best Columbian, but this Italian coffee when used with creme is absolutely wonderful.  I can't praise the flavor enough.  We use a melita method of pouring hot water over the grounds to avoid any tanic acid response.  It is the only way to make coffee.

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: Although I've never had Lavazza before, I've certainly had a lot of espresso in Europe and in Italy where Lavazza is supposed to be very big.<br /><br />These beans barely rate as what I would call a "medium" roast. Quite blonde in color. They also lack body and intensity of flavor, with high acidity (and I suspect very high caffeine as well).<br /><br />If you like a very mild, light roast, and low intensity flavor for your espresso, you might like this stuff. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.

review/summary: Awful coffee
review/text: I have a professional expresso machine and have had it for nearly 10 years. I decided to try these beans because the hype was convincing.  The express / lattes that were made using these beans was really awful. It tasted like gas station out of a vending machine coffee.  It was so bad that I had to brew all the beans to remove from my machine and it did this so that i could put in Starbucks beans. So much for experimenting.

review/summary: Horrible Coffee, heed the negative reviews
review/text: I should have paid attention to the negative reviews for this coffee, but I decided to give this coffee a try anyhow hoping to find an easy online supplier for coffee.  The coffee is tasteless.  The beans were dried out and very pale in color. There is no richness to this coffee at all.  Also if you want a caffeine jolt, you will not get it from this coffee.  Don't make the same mistake I did, pay attention to those negative reviews... they are all true.

review/summary: Cheap but sour
review/text: Normally, I'm too lazy to review products. However, this time I had to warn those on Amazon. For some reason, the Super Crema is a popular buy. While it is inexpensive, it tastes terrible. I honestly spit out the first shot after a sip. It has a terrible SOUR taste that does not change even as I increase the temperature. Anyway, Starbucks espresso beans taste better than this and that's saying something.<br /><br />I did give it two stars since the crema is quite nice although that's probably a result of the cheap Robusta beans.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying two bags. Steer clear of this coffee!<br /><br />By the way, I use a Jura-Capressso Impressa Z5, if anyone is wondering.

review/summary: Best espresso roast for the money
review/text: I'm amazed, at its price point, that anyone would criticize this bean.  I notice one review that criticizes it, but then describes the reviewer as "(I mean I'm not a novice for espresso) i own a semi-automatic espresso machine (DeLongi BAR32 before and now Saeco Aroma, Breville BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder) about 5 years" ... well wait ... he owns an $80 Delongi upgraded to a $250 Saeco, and a $90 grinder ... yuch!  You cannot get a setup that will do these beans justice for under $2000 (my setup is bare bones with a $2000 Quickmill Anita with PID and filtered plumbin; and a $700 Mazzer Mini ... all cleaned and adjusted obsessively).<br /><br />OK, if I had all the money in the world, I'd always get Black Cat from Intelligensia (the best bean in the world), but it is twice to three times the price of Lavazza.

review/summary: HORRIBLE COFFEE: DO NOT BUY!
review/text: This espresso was a disappointment from the start: unpleasant aroma, coffee beans not oily at all. Smelled like the beans were old.<br />Anyhow, I made espresso with it and tasted it. Like how it looked, the taste wasn't good either. This coffee is more on the acidic side. It sort of smelled and tasted like instant coffee. I use Rancilio Silvia espresso machine and Rocky grinder so I cannot blame the machine for a bad espresso coffee. Do not buy this espresso beans if you are espresso drinker because you will know right away that you wasted money on a crappy coffee. If you have not found good espresso coffee beans, I suggest going to local Peet's Coffee shop(if available), and ask for Espresso Forte. Because the company roasts coffee beans every day, they have very nice aroma and taste awesome too.

review/summary: Huge disappointment
review/text: I would say I am a professional coffee drinker.  I have been grinding my own beans for over 30 years.  I like strong dark coffee.  At Starbucks I usually order 1/2 cup of regular coffee spiked with a double shot of espresso.  That being said this product was a huge disappointment.  I don't doubt the quality of the beans they used.  The beans looked like they were of excellent quality.  My complaint is with the roast.  This was supposed to be an Dark Espresso roast and clearly it was not.  I think this company needs to re-evaluate there roasting quality control.  There finished product was light in color and coffee brewed from confirmed this.  I tried several different methods of making coffee.  I doubled the mount of coffee used per cup, I doubled up the filters.  The coffee roast was not a Espresso Roast plain and simple.  I have been disappointed with the whole bean coffee I have been buying at my local market and was looking to improve on what they sold.  This coffee did not even reach that goal.  I know all this sounds very critical and it is also my honest opinion!
