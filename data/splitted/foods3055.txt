review/summary: Fun for the whole family
review/text: Though a little pricey for the size (reason for 4 stars), this was a fun item to buy.  We had a great time on Christmas daring all of the family members to eat the different flavors that come in the boxes.  These are Jelly Belly jelly beans with flavors like vomit, soap, ear wax, booger, etc.  My son swears a bubble came out of his mouth after eating the soap flavor and drinking water.<br />Great for all Harry Potter fans that enjoy a good laugh.

review/text: I didnt buy it from amazon I found it in Borders Book stores, seriously they had a whole Harry potter section just like Barnes and Nobles. I digress, I dont know what the heck possessed me to taste the vomit flavor one but blech...it was so gross, although there were some good ones too. Grass taste just like grass lol, I was too chicken to taste any other flavors after getting vomit and the earwax..it was gross...gross but still pretty fun

review/summary: Bertie Botts' Beans
review/text: I was told in a previous review that these beans were not good. They were right! Some were awful, and my kids enjoyed every miniute! During a Harry Potter themed birthday, we had an "every flavoured bean tasting" The dirt and grass were pretty realistic, but the vomit was a bit coconutty in taste. (Hmmm. Makes me wonder.) Anyway, they were not all meant to be delecious, yet some were (think, Tutti-Fruity) I would def give them a go again should we have the urge.

review/summary: A little disgusting... a lot overpriced
review/text: When Harry Potter first made its debut we had bought a bag of the Harry Potter Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans for our children. Yes, they were perfectly disgusting... as they should be... and the kids loved trying to get people to eat vomit and rotten egg flavored jelly beans. Now we are at the end of the Harry Potter era and we purchased these for Christmas stockings. Still just as disgusting but who knew how SMALL each box was. 1.2 oz per box seemed acceptable but for $9 plus shipping????? At most they should have cost .50 to $1 per box. We won't be making that mistake again!

review/text: Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!

Yes, they tasted absolutely horrible. But that's the point! It's fun to try the jelly beans out to see if they really are as disgusting as you might imagine.<br /><br />There are some good flavors in there too, but most of them are gross and fun. :p<br /><br />It's a great conversation starter.

However, the two boxes are extremely small and I would not pay the almost $9 +shipping for them again.  If I had known how small the boxes were (I honestly did not check size before purchasing-lesson learned!) I would not have bought them.  I had to be very skimpy with the kids on how many they could try so that each child got to eat a couple-and we only had 10 kids there!  Fun, but pricey!

After giving it a try, I must say that I liked it. With the exception of the Blueberry, Herbal (Caffeine Free) and one of the dessert-based teas, which I can't remember the name of, most of the other teas from CS were brilliant. I never remembered Lipton having a variety of tea this large, or having a variety that tastes as good as the selection CS offers. You won't like every single variety of tea they offer (who does?), but I think there's a lot of them you'll really enjoy. CS is highly recommended. No more Lipton tea for me!!

My dog has a chicken sensitivity and would've gotten the runs like mad had I not read the label before giving it to him.  Rather than return it because the shipping would've cost the same as what I paid for the item, I took the filling out and gave him the plain bone.  I'll refill it with some regular Jiff if need be.  It would've been helpful for the company to disclose the ingredients in these so-called peanut butter flavored things.  Chicken is not peanut butter.

He is still carrying it around, but I imagine within a couple days he'll be bored again.  I tried this bone as an alternative to the messy but meaty mammoth bones.  It wasn't a totally failed experiment...he does like the bone, but the mammoth bones are only a bit more expensive and last ages longer.  This is a nice solid bone, though.  My dog chews through rawhides in less than an hour, so we don't get him anything too soft or it's gone immediately.<br /><br />In short, very hard bone that will last a while, but the filling can be removed very quickly.

review/text: I just fostered a dog a few days ago, and he loves this toy.  It definitely keeps him distracted in his grate when I'm either at school or work.  I would however recommend you keep an eye on your dog when he plays with this.  Mine finds it enjoyable to toss across my hardwood floor which creates a lot of noise and can also scratch the flooring.  Ultimately, I would strongly recommend this for all dogs.  Some treats have a filling that is very sticky and can cause the dog to choke, this dose not, and I don't have to worry about his safety when I'm away from him.

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I bought a few of these at Pet Smart but Amazon has better prices so when I run out, this is the place to buy them. I have four dogs, two young and two older.  All of them love these bones and the bones keep them happy for hours.  Even after they get all of the peanut butter out, they still love to gnaw on the bones.  I would highly recommend these, especially if you have dogs that love to chew.

review/summary: Good product but dog lost interest
review/text: After my dog could no longer get to the remaining filling in the center of the bone, he seemed to lose interest. However, the first few days he had it he wouldn't leave it alone. He still picks it up every once in a while but doesn't chew it very long.

review/summary: Irish Wolfhound loves it plus long lasting and no mess
review/text: My Irish Wolfhound loves to chew but her powerful jaws make short work of bully sticks and vet does not like her swallowing too much rawhide.  She does enjoy her Nylabone but was looking for a new treat; I did not like the mess (or price) of most bones with meat product and she would break off the ends leaving choking hazzards.  These seem to be the perfect find!  Even my smaller (13 and 19 pound) dogs love to chew on them and the Wolfhound adores them - going to buy more!

review/text: I'd been warned about giving dogs "real" bones, so I gave my Lab mix puppy Nylabones.  I caught her outside chewing on rocks.  The nylabones were virtually untouched.  I figured this product can't be any worse than chewing on limestone.  She loves them, as does my other Lab mix.  It has pretty much stopped the chewing on the garden hoses, sprinklers and house.

review/summary: Lifesaver!!
review/text: This is an amazing product.  Safe, durable, and so satisfying to my dog! I recently adopted a two year old German Shorthair from the SPCA.  Unfortunately he is heartworm positive.  The recommendation was to get him comfortable in my home then have the treatment.  This requires him to be confined in a crate for most of the day for at least a month.  I have been getting him adjusted to the confinement and the Redbarn Filled Bone has been a lifesaver!!! He is kept occupied and challenged for hours.  As I need to I refill the bone and even freeze it to give him even more satisfaction.

review/summary: Thought this would have been a great find
review/text: I was so excited when we got this in and even though i tend to only give my baby "new" treats, etc. when she is close to finishing one or gets tired of the one she's had i couldn't hold myself (i mean who doesn't LOVE peanut-butter??!!) and i gave it to her right out the box.<br /><br />Unfortunately this turned out to be such a disappointment! She sniffed it and that was all folks..For a 7 month old Labrador Retriever that says a lot to me because my baby can chew through anything. We got through toys almost on a daily bases and then all her chew bones and raw hides don't tend to last as too long either.<br /><br />She has chewed on it a few times but i think its because its been laying around for so long its just something else in the house. I'm not quite sure what the outside part is made of either because it does not seem to be real raw hide.<br /><br />I would definitely not buy again and will not recommend.

review/summary: New pantry item to always have on hand.
review/text: As I've kind of moved ahead in my cooking I am finding that I use stock a lot more in my cooking. I use it all the time for things like risotto, as a substitute for water on regular rice for more flavor, in sauces and stir fry's, etc. It felt like every time I was making a trip to the grocery store I had to remember to pick up more stock, particularly chicken stock since I seem to go through it much faster than other types of stock. This stock is great tasting with good ingredients. The packaging is good and convenient to use. The size is just about perfect for most things and you can refrigerate what you don't use for a couple of days. The quantities that a standard order contain don't overwhelm you with too much of it, but is enough that I just order a couple of these every few months and keep some in storage.<br /><br />Buy it if you use stock in your cooking on a regular or semi-regular basis (and you might find you use it a lot more if you have it on hand).<br />Don't buy it if you don't cook that much or are a vegetarian or something.

review/summary: Not the Best Choice for Me
review/text: I ordered a bunch of different products in this line to make a comparison between them.<br /><br />I think I was exposed to too much of whatever is now making me itch and break out all over. It started with my arms after washing and conditioning my daughter's hair in the sink (I had already washed and conditioned my own hair with different products from the line)...I noticed red spots along my arms, small bumps and itching. The kids saw red on my neck (which usually happens when I am allergic to something), but then it disappeared within an hour of first seeing it.<br /><br />For the last several years, my previous shampoos and conditioners were mostly PH balanced and all natural.<br /><br />These CLEAR beauty products have a "common thread" between the shampoos/conditioners, despite have slightly different smells...They are most abundant in ingredients that may initially detangle, but are drying and irritating on my hair and skin with accumulated usage/exposure. It is now clear that these products are not good for me to continue using.<br /><br />*Not the outcome I had hoped, but found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.

review/text: I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner and have a few pros and cons. Pros: use a small amount, good coverage, smells nice, leaves my hair soft. Cons: seems to make my hair fall out (another brand did this as well) but not sure if it's the conditioner only or a combination of shampoo and conditioner.<br /><br />So, mixed reviews. I like the product but don't like losing my hair. Since I have a lot of thick hair, it hasn't affected me much but I don't want to continue losing it just in case.

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: The "Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Total Care" is a new product. The label calls the hair conditioner a "therapy"as it gently conditions and nourishes the scalp and hair by restoring the scalp's natural moisture balance. The conditioner is formulated with Nutrium 10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C and E, sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils and aloe vera to leave the hair strong from the root to the tip.<br />My hair did feel softer and looked more silky after using the conditioner. However I needed more conditioning liquid than normal to make a lather.<br />The manufacturer recommends using this product daily. I believe this is unnecessary for most people.

review/summary: Worked well for me.  Quite thick . . . and pink, too.
review/text: This product is pretty good.  While I won't say that my hair is suddenly superhealthy or that it has improved body because of this conditioner, I will say that the product hasn't caused any damage that I can see.  The conditioner claims to be "Total Care Nourishing" with "nutrium 10" (a "moisture complex" of vitamins), but I wouldn't necessarily trust that claim, considering that a shampoo is designed to be used in conjunction with the conditioner.  That notwithstanding, the product did a serviceable job at a decent price. It's very thick, with something of a pink-and-lavender color.  Note that the product is not specifically geared towards women or men.<br /><br />With regard to shipping, expect that the bottle might arrive with plastic wrap around it and some product leakage, sort of what you experience when you take toiletries on an airplane and find that they leaked due to air-pressure differentials.  No big deal, but something that might figure into your buying decision.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: My hair is long and fine textures and tangles easily. This conditioner did the job of getting out the knots without ripping the hair. It is light in smell, even though it contains coconut, there is almost no fragrance.  If you have short hair, about one teaspoon full in the palm of your hand will be enough. With my shoulder length hair, I needed 3-4 squirts of produce to get full coverage.<br /><br />I like the shape of the container. It is narrow enough to fit on the very small shelf in my shower stall. The cap is on the bottom base, so the product squeezes out easily because of gravity. There is a very large thumb press style opener, which makes it easy to use, no lost or dropped caps. The narrow style of the bottle makes it easier to hold then some larger, heavier bottles. The smaller size will be used up quickly for me, so that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />All in all, a good product that does the job.

review/summary: My Hair is Soft and Manageable
review/text: This conditioner is very thick and rich. It's so thick it doesn't fall off of my hand when I turn it upside down, but it was still easy to spread through my 24 inch long hair. My hair feels very soft, and I can run a brush through it quite easily even first thing in the morning. During the day my hair is getting less tangled than it usually does. No mean feat for hair this long. It does have a scent to it, but it's not objectionable, and becomes less noticeable as it dries. The next day I can only smell it if I bring my hair right under my nose. That being said, I could do without the fragrance, and the red dye as well. I love the bottle! It has a very ergonomic design, and is easy and comfortable to hold. The cap is on the bottom, and is flat which the makes the bottle very stable. And I love the flip cap! Press to open. Press to close. So easy! So far, all pros and no cons. I'm looking forward to what my hair will look like six months from now, and will update this review now and again. :)<br /><br />7/3/2012: I just received the Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish conditioner. Amazon has addressed the problem of leakage by putting a piece of clear tape over the lid. It worked and the tape came off with no sticky residue left behind.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Good Scent - Not for Thick Hair
review/text: This conditioner seemed promising. It smells great and it's in a nice looking bottle. The actual product, however, was not suitable for my hair. I have thick, wavy hair and this conditioner was not up tp mositurizing my hair. The conditioner felt a little watery, not think and creamy like a good conditioner should be. I would recommend this product for someone with fine, straight hair. This conditioner would be good for that type of hair because it would condition but not weight that type of hair down. It just does not have the strength for thicker or curlier hair.

review/text: I've been very happy with the Clear line of products. They've performed as well as pricier brands and work well for my hair.<br /><br />This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and touchable even when it's been exposed to being out in the cold which can be very drying. I have long, very straight, very fine hair, and need conditioning without weight or buildup. This works!<br /><br />While other people have said "A little goes a long way"- that's somewhat true. I do use less of it than other conditioners, but still go through conditioner faster than shampoo. The light, pleasant scent doesn't rinse completely out, but also doesn't clash with any of the perfumes I wear.

review/summary: Best Conditioner I've Ever Used
review/text: This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. It outshines ever much, much more expensive brands. It leaves my hair manageable and soft. I think the most noticeable difference I have seen from this conditioner is the shine my hair has now. I am almost thru my second bottle and have been using it for about 2 months. I am completely in love. I hope that in the near future they release styling products to correspond with this hair care system.

review/summary: Works well and leaves my hair soft but scent could be better
review/text: This conditioner makes my hair feel very soft when used in combination with the matching Total Care Shampoo. I have been using this for weeks now and my hair is as soft as it has ever been. It has a nice scent but nothing amazing. I would prefer a mint scent or maybe tropical. Overall it's above average but not my favorite. I love the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner they are really great.

review/summary: It is just ok
review/text: This is one of the better CLEAR conditioners. I have tried several from the brand, and so far I like this one the best, although it still is not my ideal conditioner.<br /><br />I needed to use alot to get good detangling and conditioning. Alot more than my usual brands (Infusium23 or Redken). The smell is very nice and seems to last throughout the day. It doesn't weigh my hair down or leave it feeling coated or with any residue or buildup. It rinses out easily, but once it's out, it's out - I end up using a leave in conditioner afterwards most times.<br /><br />My hair isn't awfully dry or damaged, but can feel a bit worse at times depending what styling products I have used. If this conditioner did just a tad more conditioning it would be a pretty good conditioner. I just can't justify using so much at a time, even if it is a cheap brand.

review/summary: Compared to Strong Lengths
review/text: I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner</a>, which got fabulous results.  Total Care is also a good conditioner.  Like the rest of the Clear products I have tried so far, scent is not its forte.  Not that it's bad, it's just not memorable.<br /><br />What I look for is shiny, silky hair that doesn't break.  Although my hair continues to grow and look great, it hasn't gotten the accolades that it did with the previous conditioner.  I'm not really sure why, but it's obvious that something about Strong Lengths made people take notice.<br /><br />Other than the fact that people don't compliment my hair as much as they used to, I would have given this product five stars.  Because Strong Lengths gave me stronger applause, I'll give Total Care 4 1/2 stars.

review/summary: Great moisturizing conditioner
review/text: I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp. I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair. When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt. It was super soft and I didn't notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners. It was a nice change. A month later, I am still using both products. My scalp does feel better. My hair doesn't fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft. My sister purchased this product for colored hair and complained of build up. I have not noticed this. My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.<br /><br />The bottles are also fairly easy to use. One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice otherwise you can get the bottles mixed up (which on is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo). You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down and it snaps back in place. No mess. The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike, but like I said, they open differently.<br /><br />For the record, I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is thick and wavy. I've noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren't dragging down from build up. I really like this conditioner and will continue to use them both.

review/text: As with a lot of other reviewees, I've tried a LOT of other products... from philip kingsley to pantene.... I am asian with blabk average thickness , shoulder length hair that tends to become frizzy, wiry and unmanageable a few hours after I shampoo and condition, even if I put an after shampoo treatment ... 2 weeks ago I went to a local pharmacy chain and saw a small bottle of CLEAR conditioner selling for $1.99. I bought one and have been using it DAILY eversince. By far it is the best hair conditioner among all I' ve tried and I've tried MANY in my 42 years! It made my hair soft, shiny and smooth I am very very surprised and happy. I use it together with Fructis shampoo for color treated hair and somehow the combination worked soo well on my hair. &#128522;

review/text: I've tried a few of the "Clear" brand conditioners. Like the other ones I've tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent. I'm not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant. The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.<br />I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.<br />While I like this line of conditioners I have to say that there does not seem to be a significant difference between the various ones in this line.

review/text: I have tried several of the Clear Scalp conditioners and they have all been very impressive.  The Total Care nourishing conditioner left my hair soft with only a few tangles and it did not weigh my hair down at all.  I recommend this conditioner for people with normal hair.  I have damaged color-treated hair and this conditioner did not work as well for me as Clear Scalp's conditioner designed for color-treated hair.  However, I was still very impressed as this conditioner was as good as many salon brand conditioners at a fraction of the price.  If you have normal hair, this would be a great daily conditioner for you.

Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.<br /><br />We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  The conditioner worked exceptionally well, to the extent that with regular shampooing, we found that the conditioner was only needed every couple of days or so.  Furthermore, the product is extremely concentrated -- a little goes a very long way, increasing the value.<br /><br />This product will become a staple in our household.  Highly recommended.

review/text: This Total Care conditioner works well for my hair. I have straight, fine hair and using this conditioner daily keeps it healthy looking. It doesn't weigh my hair down and it makes my hair easy to brush. The conditioner is thick. It comes out like a paste, but it works into my hair with no trouble at all. It has a very pleasant and subtle floral scent which I like very much.<br /><br />What I like best, however, is the bottle. The opening is one of those see saw type things in which you press down on one side and the other with the opening pops up. It's easy to squeeze out the conditioner and it's just the right size so you don't squeeze out too much. This opening is at the bottom of the bottle, so as it sits in the shower, all the conditioner is moving down to be used. I'm sure there's less waste this way. And the bottom of the container is the biggest, so no worries about it tipping over because it's top-heavy. Overall, it's a convenient conditioner that works well for my hair.

review/text: I've used several; different varieties of the Care shampoo and also conditioner products and this is the one that works the least. It says nourishing daily conditioner for scalp and strong beautiful hair. My hair falls about 8" below my shoulders, so I have used this conditioner in the same manner as other brands. My hair has come out of the shower horribly knotted and it really doesn't even feel like there is any conditioner on it after a rinse off which with every other conditioner the hair at least feels soft and tangle free.<br /><br />Then there is the usual problem with the Clear line. Standing upside down in the shower, the cap seeps the liquid out, just a bit, but no other brand does this and this is 3 to 4 times the price of other conditioners I have used with much greater success.

review/summary: Lovely!
review/text: As many of you who follow my reviews know, I've had the very devil of a time with hair products for more than five years now.  I haven't been able to use cream rinse in forever and have a stash of used-it-once-but-never-again shampoo bottles practically the size of Mount Everest.<br /><br />About 10 days ago I started using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIK">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> and was utterly overjoyed to have my scalp problems almost completely disappear, literally overnight.  I did, however, wait until I had washed my hair 4 times without becoming sensitive to the shampoo before I tried conditioning with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UC">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>, which left my hair lovely and smooth.  It has a very pleasant scent, I need only a tiny amount, even though I have very long and very thick hair, and it rinses out easily.<br /><br />I'm back to using just the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIK">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> because I did have a very slight reaction to the conditioner - some minor flakes - and the anti-dandruff shampoo leaves my hair so shiny, manageable and easy to comb out that I don't really need a conditioner, but if you do I think you'll be pleased with this one.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />UPDATE:  My teenage granddaughter spent most of the month of August with Grandma.  Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly and definitely stressed - dyed, straightened, blow dried regularly.  She absolutely LOVED this conditioner and the other two products she test drove for me and they did a stupendous job on her hair, leaving it soft & manageable while taming the frizzies.  Highly recommended for damaged hair!

I don't use conditioner as the ones I've tried, and I've tried many, usually leave my hair limp and greasy, and they take forever to rinse out. This was a happy accident.

A light pleasing scent begins the experience, the bottle is shower friendly, and the conditioner is smooth and silky.<br /><br />After conditioning the conditioner rinsed out easily leaving my hair feeling clean, frizz free, and shiny. I am a convert and will be using this conditioner from now on! Love it.

review/summary: Smell like a beautiful woman, today!
review/text: Put this in your hair, and soon thereafter you'll notice a few things.  First and foremost, you'll have a subtle aroma of a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  Now really, that should be enough to post a SOLD tag on it...but what about how it works.  Problem is, I'm a guy and I can't hang out with my friends smelling like a beautiful woman, so I have to double down on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028LN1K">Grandpa Pine Tar Soap</a>.<br /><br />As far as how well it works...conditioning:  you betcha!  My crew cut has never been softer or more manageable than it is today.  Rubbing my fingers through short, luxurious hair, I can actually feel each individual hair rubbing its softness on my fingertips.  Very, very soft.  Now, nourishing the scalp?  I'm not entirely sure what that even means.  My scalp didn't feel malnourished prior, and it doesn't feel any different today.  And while I'm on the topic, my bottle says something like "proven to make your scalp healthier*."  Notice that asterisk?  Searching for the fine print, it then says something like "when shampooing first."  I take that to mean that whatever study they used to provide that statement was using some kind of harsh shampoo, and the conditioner made the hair feeling a bit less like burlap or tweed.  But...my hair is soft, and that's what's important here.<br /><br />The bottle itself is even interesting.  It stands straight up, and opens from the bottom, ensuring that you can squeeze out the very last drop of this conditioner.  The conditioner is pretty thick, so this is actually very nice - if it were to stand upright, it'd be a pain to get the last few squirts out.  Good design.<br /><br />Good product, and would recommend.  Especially for women, or men that want to smell like one.

review/summary: Gee, your mail smells terrific!
review/text: I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn't really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn't ship well.  It was sealed in a plastic bag (taped shut) and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book.  The result was a disaster.  I could smell the fragrance when I opened my mailbox.  It smelled awesome, but that's not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.<br /><br />When I opened the package, it was a big yucky bag of goo.  A lot of the product had seeped out into the plastic bag.  I washed it off, but the lid and cap had also been damaged, so it leeks if I just squeeze the bottle.  That's a shame, because the bottle is designed to rest upside down (which is normally a nice feature for a product like this--it helps get the most product out of the bottle).<br /><br />So what about the product itself?  It smells good.  It's a clean fragrance that's fine for me or my wife.  As expected for a conditioner, it helps reduce tangles and keeps my scalp from drying out.<br /><br />I like this conditioner, but I'm not convinced that it's the best online purchase.

review/summary: Leaves hair soft and manageable...just like anything else.
review/text: The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is about what you'd expect...it's conditioner and it leaves your hair more soft and manageable than shampoo would on its own. It's a good product and does the job as well as other more expensive brands (and a handful of less expensive ones). It's a thick, rich-looking conditioner, and if I have one complaint, it's that the scent can be a bit overpowering when it's on your hair. It's not a bad scent, but it is a very perfumey, "cosmetic" scent. Fortunately what's left behind after rinsing is just a hint of it, so that won't be a problem for most. My hair does seem to be better off for using it, and that's the most important thing (especially some of its renewed strength).<br /><br />As far as the packaging, this gets the same complaint as every other product in the Clear line, and that's the cap being on the bottom of the container. It's not a deal-breaker and is largely a non-issue, but I've received other products in the Clear line with the same bottle design that opened in transit, dumping a good bit of the product into the packaging. Amazon knows this, and takes some precautions (taping the cap on and wrapping the bottles in plastic bags), but it doesn't make this the most shipment-friendly product in the world.<br /><br />Over all, the Clear Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a good product at a decent price. As long as you don't mind the fragrance and it doesn't open during shipping, you'll be satisfied with it.

review/summary: Leaves my hair soft, less dry and not weighed down
review/text: I previously tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8TS">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner</a> since I routinely color and blow dry my hair.  Unfortunately I didn't see any improvements after a week of use and gave up. Knowing that each formula of a particular brand of shampoo will be different, I decided to give this a try. Again I expected to try it out for a week to really see the results, but I noticed some difference after the first day.  I have naturally curly hair, so dryness/frizz is an issue and normally if I find one that conditions well, it also weighs my hair down, but this did not. It rinsed out very well and still left my hair moisturized which I can appreciate. Besides the end results, I love the scent; it reminds me of a tropical drink or island because of the coconut. Obviously it's not necessarily important, but definitely a bonus. I'm pretty sure that when I run out of this I will buy more, either here on Amazon or locally, because the price is right for the results I received.

review/summary: Left Dyed Hair Soft and Shiny
review/text: I thought the best test of the Total Care (Clear Scalp & Hair) Nourishing Conditioner would be my daughter's hair.  This summer it's short .AND. colored a delightful strawberry blonde.<br /><br />Because we've been swimming almost everyday her hair is also rather dry and damaged.  Dye and chlorine are just a bad combination.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much but her hair came out looking fantastic.  It was very soft and even shining.<br /><br />Rather impressed with what it did to her dried-out hair.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Goes well with shampoo
review/text: I have hair that is thick and goes about 3" past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this conditioner works pretty well.<br /><br />It is smooth and goes on easily.  I also like that I didn't have to use a whole bunch to get full coverage (I only had to use about a quarter sized amount). It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!

review/summary: Basic Conditioner
review/text: Despite the description, this is a pretty average conditioner. It is thick but goes a long way as you don't need to use a lot of product to condition your hair. It left my hair soft, shiny, and clean but a lot of conditioners do that. I liked the scent, but the packaging is less than stellar. It opens at the bottom and it leaked on the shower floor.

review/summary: Just your average.....
review/text: Used this for 7 days with the shampoo also. I haven't noticed anything different about my hair, except it seems slighly less full of body. I like the smell of it and it feels nice on my hair. But after a week, I just don't see enough of a difference to switch from my regular conditioner.

review/summary: Silky and smooth
review/text: I thought this product worked pretty well. Had a nice smell and left hair feeling soft and smooth after using conditioner. I do think my hair felt stronger and better after using the product. There are some other conditioners on the market that are as good but this was up there with my favorites. Contains Nutrium 10. I'd buy it. 4 stars.

review/summary: Works great with the companion shampoo product
review/text: This new conditioner, along with the corresponding shampoo, is excellent for thin hair because it creates a fullness and body to it without leaving yucky residue.  Use both; if you like them, keep using them, and on to other things. Unless your a professional stylist, you probably don't want to spend a lot of time discoursing on shampoos and conditioners.

review/summary: Prefer Clear Scalp & Hair's Other Line
review/text: I'll start by saying that I'm a fan of Clear's products, specifically the Ultra Shea line, so I hoped I'd like Total Care Nourishing just as much.<br /><br />After trying Clear Scalp and Hair's Ultra Shea shampoo and conditioner, I was impressed. It's a family trait to have very thick, curly hair, and unmanageable describes my hair perfectly. After using Ultra Shea, my hair felt better than it has in years (winter cold, summer pool/chlorine, and coloring are all rough on my hair). I decided to give the Total Care Nourishing line a try. The product is okay, but certainly not as impressive as the Ultra Shea line.<br /><br />Like the other product, Total Care Nourishing has a light fragrance that is suitable to men or women. It rinses easily. However, in the heat and humidity much of the country has been under, I don't find that Total Care Nourishing does much to tame the frizz that humidity brings. Shea tamed frizz and makes my curls/waves look salon-perfect. Total Care Nourishing really doesn't, and I find that disappointing.<br /><br />The product may do better on straight hair, but for my thick curls, it's not a product I'd use again. I'll stick to the Ultra Shea line.

review/text: The fragrance of this conditioner is mild and pleasant. It nourishes the scalp and hair well. It has reduced my hair fall to quite an extent. After using it, the hair feels softer and nice.

review/summary: Good product for sure just cant tell beyond what it does
review/text: I am a guy so after using it it was not much better than the other brands, I gave to female friend. She is going to use it soon as her other bottles of shampoo is used. For me, it was same, softer feel maybe. I use the Salon brand like Paul Mitchell and buy a gallon of it and then pour into dispenser in the shower for use. This was good but I have short hair maybe that's why I don't notice the difference. For guys, the result is not significant compared to maybe a woman with long hair. And, well maybe it does but I can't really tell how silky my 1 inch long hair is.
