review/summary: Newton Fruit Thins Fig and Honey are a crisper version of the famous Fig Newtons
review/text: I found the Newton Fruit Thins Fig and Honey product to be very tasty. The items are cookie sized and designed to be firm rather than soft and moist. At first I was a bit turned off by this firmness as it seemed to make the cookie too dry. However, I soon found that the bits of figs that permeate the fruit thin were themselves moist enough to keep the cookie from being too dry. As a testimony to this products desirability, the people in my household consumed the cookies in less than 2 days, so I guess we all thought they were pretty good. Newton fruit thins are definitely worth giving a try. If you like your cookies on the crisp side and enjoy the taste of figs, this product is definitely for you. In fact, if you like figs but have been turned off by the soft dough on Fig Newtons, this cookie might be a good bet for you.

review/summary: Not what I expected, but really good!
review/text: Since they were made by the Fig Newton people, I was expecting a soft cake-type cookie. These are like British biscuits.<br /><br />The cookies are quite large with little bits of fruit in. They have a graham cracker-like flavour. Quite pleasant and slightly better for you than your run of the mill cookie.<br /><br />The only draw-back that I can think to mention is that the bits of fruit can get stuck in your teeth. One would think that to be called "fruit thins" there should be a bit more fruit in them. I'd call them Fruit Crisps instead.<br /><br />They are good enough that I am looking forward to trying the other types.

review/summary: It's a matter of taste and expectation
review/text: Like any food product, your opinion of the product will depend on your taste preferences and also your expectations.  I think if the product were closer to my expectations I would have ranked it higher.<br /><br />The cookies are thin and crispy.  It says that on the package, but I had expected something a bit different.  There is simply not that much fruit in the cookies.  I think the best way you could describe the fruit would be to call it very small chips or pieces of fruit.  You get a hint of fruit but not enough to really satisfy any real desire for the fruit.  I suspect the name "Newtons" and the fact that it has figs lead me to expect a taste somewhat like a Fig Newton.  The cookies taste nothing like the soft, fig laden Newtons I am used to.<br /><br />The cookies are not that sweet.  There is a strong taste of honey but they remind me more of an English Tea Biscuit than a cookie.<br /><br />The package has resealable clasps on the end which makes opening and resealing the package easy and it keeps the cookies fresh.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the taste.  In fact they cookies taste very good.  But if I want the taste of figs, I would prefer Fig Newtons.<br /><br />I cannot know your taste preference and I would suggest that my taste is probably different than yours.  Therefore if you understand that the cookies are thin and crisp, not too sweet and with just the hint of figs, you will probably be pleased with them.  If you are looking for a softer, sweet cookie with lots of figs, this will disappoint you.

review/summary: Just a hint of cinnamon
review/text: I wasn't too sure about trying these, since I have never been a fan of Fig Newtons. But I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I enjoyed them so much that I ate the whole box myself. They make a great afternoon snack, and reminded me a lot of oatmeal raisin cookies, except crisper, much like a sugar cookie. I enjoyed them as an afternoon pick-me-up, along with an iced tea. They were large enough that two made a nice snack.<br /><br />If your kids enjoy raisins, they will enjoy these. Since the figs are chopped into tiny bits, it is hard to tell them from the raisin bits that are also included.

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I quite enjoyed these 'fruit thins' from Newton. I dont really know what a fig is but it isnt really as vital a part of this product as advertised. Theres very little in each fruit thin and they are quite small. Occasionally you will taste it, they are sweet but somewhat rough/hard. The rest of the thin is tasty though. The honey gives it a nice taste. Very similar to graham crackers taste-wise (disregarding the figs). It melts in you mouth and leaves a nice aftertaste. After a 5 thins each serving though, it starts getting a little too sweet for me. Not a big deal though since the serving size isn't much more than that.<br />Theres a good amount of thins in each package, probably around ~30-40 thins. The package is resealable; but its just serviceable and somewhat fragile.  These aren't portable at all, you'd have to take some out of the package and put them in a plastic bag. I would say these are worth a try if you like stuff like graham crackers.

review/summary: Tasty easy snack
review/text: I enjoyed the fig & honey flavor of this new cookie from Fig Newton.  It was light and made for a good snack at home or to take with you.  I felt the fig pieces could have been a little bigger but the fig taste is there with a sweet kick from the honey.  The aftertaste wasn't too strong either.<br /><br />The cookies arrived whole with 1 or 2 broken in the box.  For travel I took the entire package since these may break if you just use a ziplock to have on the go.<br /><br />I'd recommend these for anyone who enjoys the taste of figs and wants a sweet cookie that isn't too heavy for snacking.

review/summary: Good snacking cracker
review/text: The Newton Fruit Thins are like graham crackers with bits of fruit. It's made with figs but because it's dried, it has the texture of currants.  It's pretty tasty and healthy snack.  It has a tendency to break easily, probably because the packaging is not sturdy enough.  This product would make an excellent midday snack or something to eat with tea.

review/summary: Crunchy and healthy honey & fig goodness
review/text: This is a very interesting addition for cookie lovers and I thought they would have more of a cookie texture but they are closer to a cracker since they are so crispy.  I love the scent as you inhale the cinnamon fig honeyed aroma and they taste a bit like a ginger snap or Teddy Graham but with bits of fig in the cookie.  I like the lower calorie count and 3 cookies can tide me over for a later afternoon snack before I go home & cook dinner. I was more impressed with my kids devouring them too as my son loved them and didn't know they were a healthier version of a cookie vs. an Oreo or chocolate chip cookie. My coworkers tried them and loved them too.

review/text: These are a new, tasty twist on on fig newtons.  I love the original fig newton, and I like these.  With the consistency of shortbread, they have the sweetness of fig and honey, but not too heavey, combined with the crunch of a shorbread cookie. They would be tasty for dunking in milk.  They're a nice generous size, too.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Very good for what it is...whatever you wanna call it
review/text: These "fruit thins" are marketed under the newton brand, but outside of the fact they have bits of fig in them, they aren't Fig Newtons in the least. Still, they are very good, with a nice unique texture. They are thin "biscuits" (as another reviewer said) -- in a sense, they are like crackers but slightly softer and sugary like a cookie (note that they are mostly sweetened with sugar, despite the honey part of the name - no corn syrup though)<br />Outside of the fact they will make one very thirsty, they are quite good. Again, for what they are. They are not a gourmet snack, nor are they indulgent. But honestly I have no complaints about the taste, texture, or size.

review/summary: Mild
review/text: This is an odd "cookie" (on the front of the package these are labelled as "crispy cookies") because it has very little flavor. The variety I tried was the Fig & Honey flavor and I had the hardest time trying to figure out what I was tasting because the flavor is so mild. After trying a few I picked up the hint of sweetness (honey) and some cinnamon (the last ingredient is listed as "natural flavor (contains cinnamon)". The taste was no great, not bad....just ok. Not really a fig flavor like traditional fig newtons. Crispier texture. The package says a serving is 3 cookies which has 140 calories, 5g of fat, 0 cholesterol. 95mg sodium. A very underwhelming snack.

review/summary: Great with tea or coffee...not that great on their own.
review/text: As people have said, these are more like typical English tea biscuits than real live cookies. With tea or coffee, they're quite wonderful for dunking and nibbling, letting the cookie part dissolve away so that the figgy nuggets remain to be chewed. Not very sweet, which I also like in a cookie. Kids aren't going to go for these, which is great -- more left over for you, while they gobble the Oreos. We really liked these, and will buy them again. A classy biscuit, reminiscent of England (and the "biscuits" we used to get up in Canada) -- cookies for adults. Recommended!

review/summary: Newtons Fruit Thins - Fig
review/text: These are good!  They are more like crackers than cookies.  They taste kind of like a cross between Fig Newtons and graham crackers.  Three "cookies" have 140 calories with 5g of fat (1g sat, 2.5g poly, 1g mono), 2g of fiber, and 2g of protein.  As of the writing of this review, they are not fulfilled by Amazon, and they come to at least $35 (incl s&h) for 4 packages.  That is a little pricey.  If I was to rate this with the price, I'd give them 2 stars because they are good, but they aren't THAT good. $35 for 4 bags of cookies is way too much.  But for taste and texture, I give them a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I hope they 1) go down in price and 2) become subscribe & save items because I really liked these.  And the blueberry ones are even better!

review/summary: Perfect Afternoon Snack
review/text: I am always looking for the perfect snack to go along with my afternoon cup of tea. I want a snack that is not too heavy, quick and easy, and does not blow my diet plan.  Newtons Fruit Thins is just right for me. I love that this cookie is not too sweet and complements the variety of teas that I enjoy. The back of the package says that the average serving is three cookies; I found that two cookies is just right for an afternoon pick-me-up.<br /><br />I enjoy the texture of cookies as they are not as messy as graham crackers so they travel well and do not crumble as I eat while working.  The fruit flavors are subtle, and are suitable for those who do not like overly sweet snacks.<br /><br />My grandchildren also enjoyed this cookie, so I will be buying more of this product for both myself and them.

review/summary: Crunchy biscuit, no obvious fig or honey flavor
review/text: This is a slightly sweet thin, crisp biscuit.  Unlike Fig Newtons, I don't taste the figs.  I know they are there, as the small dried bits of fig get stuck in my teeth.  Since this line of biscuits has little to do with Fig Newtons, I think they would be better with a different name.<br /><br />I have also tried the blueberry version.  They are a different story: you can really taste the blueberry in them, and I liked them better.<br /><br />TASTE / TEXTURE<br /><br />The thin cookies are crisp, more dense than most crackers, crunchy, not chewy. They have some sweetness; you can taste the whole grains, but not the figs.  I can't distinguish honey as one of the sweet flavors.<br /><br />NUTRITION<br /><br />3 thins is one serving, totaling 140 calories, 45 from fat (32%). The sweeteners are sugar and some honey; no High Fructose Corn Syrup is listed. The first ingredient is unbleached flour; the whole grains come later. 8% fat by weight; 5% is saturated fat. No cholesterol, and low salt (4% of daily recommended sodium). No vitamins; a little iron. 2g of dietary fiber (8% of daily recommended).  All of this is the same as the blueberry version, except this has honey instead of brown sugar.<br /><br />To put the nutrition in simpler terms, they are not bad for you, but they do not contribute a lot of what you need every day, either.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />They are ok but there is little to distinguish them, such as the fig or honey flavors I expected.  I won't be seeking them out.

review/summary: Okay taste for whole grain snack but 47 calories per cookie
review/text: This is promoted as a whole grain snack, so I guess one can make some allowance for the whole-graininess of the taste, however, I found this fig and honey combination to be just okay in terms of taste. I liked the taste of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA">Newtons Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a> better.<br /><br />Just like the blueberry, each cookie is 47 calories, so it is a good snack if a small number of these are consumed. Unlike the blueberry, opening the package did not have a distinct smell of fruit. But the nutritional content is similar to the blueberry, with 3 cookies recommended as a serving (140 calories).<br /><br />There are 30 cookies per package, in two rows of 10, in a plastic tray. The package is sealed, and opening it reveals the ready-to-eat cookies. No extra packaging material to fight through.<br /><br />My personal recommendation is for the blueberry instead of the fig and honey.

review/summary: A little chewy for a crispy cookie
review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins (fig and honey flavor) are an attempt at a lighter, crispier version of the Fig Newton.  The packaging is quite nice as the bag is easy to open and there is a tab that goes the length of the opening that helps you close it for freshness.  The quantity is nice as well.  I like that three crisps are 2 grams of fiber.  The fat (5g)and carbs (21g) per serving aren't too bad either.  The flavor is quite nice.  It's light and crispy in texture.  My only complaint is the bits of fig in the cookie.  They are quite hard.  The texture is like finding a piece of undercooked rice in a mouthful of cooked rice...they are that tough.  Although I didn't try it, it might be helpful to have a glass of milk in which to dunk these cookies as that might ease the toughness of the "fig nubs" which is what I've deemed the bits of fig.<br />I give this product three stars because of the "fig nubs".

review/summary: Perfect Light Snack
review/text: Many of the reviewers describe the Newtons Fruit Thins as bland and flavorless. This is not a sweet snack, but it has the slightest touch of fig. It's not an overpowering taste, like a fruit filled biscuit or blueberry muffins. I usually dislike figs because of their taste, but these fruit thins do not have an overbearing fig taste. The slight dash of honey sweetens them up and I really enjoy the simple flavor of these.<br />The texture is crisp and light while leaving behind a feeling of satisfaction. I expected them to cause my mouth to be a bit dry, but I could eat several of these without water and be perfectly fine.<br />I really enjoy these fruit thins because of its "blandness," but its a great snack that I will not become addicted to, like Oreos. Those taste great, but I have trouble convincing myself to not devourer them within a week. These fruit thins are great for anyone who's looking for an snack that only has a slight hint of sweetness. My grandmother enjoys them as well as my three and one two year old cousins. I will definitely purchase a box if I see them at my local supermarket. The price seems a bit steep for just four boxes of snacks, thus the 4 stars. I don't mind buying a box every so often because they are a great snack, but I feel that there are cheaper alternatives.

review/summary: These are pretty good...like a crunchy graham cracker with little fig flavor bursts scattered throughout
review/text: I like Fig Newtons, so I was interested in the chance to try these out.<br /><br />When I ate my first few they were reminiscent of crunchy graham crackers, but not quite as sweet.  As I chewed them I noticed small (not big) fig-bursts of flavor.  There are small bits of figs embedded in the cracker, as you can see from the photo on the bag.<br /><br />The experience was pleasant, but make sure that you have a glass of water or other drink handy as you will want it.<br /><br />I think these would be great snacks for kids.<br /><br />Be advised that these are not Fig Newtons though.  They are a fig cracker.  If you want a Fig Newton, buy Fig Newtons.  If you want a nice crunchy and somewhat sweet cracker, try these.<br /><br />All in all I'd say that they are good, but not what I'd call great.<br /><br />4 solid stars!

review/summary: Strangely addicting
review/text: I was a little surprised from the moment I opened my Amazon box. I was expecting the container to be a box, guess I didn't pay much attention to the picture, but it's actually a bag. The opening has the traditional Nabisco closure, roll down & bend the white tabs over to close. The "Thins" sit in a plastic holder inside the bag to keep them from crushing. I'm not sure what to call these, cookie or cracker. When you see them, they appear to be a decent size large cookie. When you bite into them, the taste is more like a cracker. My initial thought was that they reminded me a little of a graham cracker but with a denser texture. You can see the small bits of dried fig throughout (ingredients also list raisins). I wasn't amazed by the taste, they aren't overly sweet, nothing exciting, and I really don't distinguish the fig flavor. With that said, I could easily sit & munch on these while drinking a cup of tea or coffee. After my first one, I found myself craving another. So while not excited about them, I can see them being addicting. It's one of those snacks that is simple, on the healthier side, and convenient. My only big complaint was the dried fruit was a little on the tough side, very small pieces so maybe that's why, and stuck to my teeth. I'm interested to try other flavors and would probably by these again but not something I would keep in the pantry all the time.

review/summary: Bland Entry in a Crowded Market
review/text: Cookies are like a punch line.  Eat them and you get a flavor that should remind you of something.  Think of Oreos, as an example.  Oreos have this great chocolate hit and that scrumptious icing flavor (if you eat the cookie whole) that has been a life-long constant.  Fig Newtons are another example of a cookie that has a powerful flavor that I savor.  These cookies, on the other hand, are just somewhat...well...blah.<br /><br />I was looking forward to tasting these cookies.  After all, Nabisco has named these with the auspicious title "Fig and Honey."  I love Fig Newtons and I was thinking about those when I took my first bite.  What I tasted was more like a graham cookie.  Okay, any second now I will taste fig and honey.  I kept crunching and savoring and all I ever got was graham.  I tried another cookie to see whether the effect was the same.  Sadly, the result remained the same.<br /><br />I could get into all the details about palm oil, preservatives and calories, but I am just unable to be enthused for a cookie that fails to excite me.  If you are a fan of Fig Newtons, then these pale in comparison.  In fact, if you like a cookie with a taste that hits your taste buds, then move along to something else.  After all, there are many cookie brands at the supermarket superior to these.  These cookies will not be on our future grocery lists.

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: There are some 30 cookies in the bag. Each of them is about as thin as a poker chip, maybe a bit thinner. Three of these skinny minnys make up 1 serving per the "nutrition facts" and have a whopping 140 calories of which 45 are fat. These cookies are as dry as the Gobi desert and cannot be ingested without some type of liquid. I used skim milk which, of course, added to the already substantial calorie count. There is supposedly fig and honey in these emaciated sized cookies but I could not detect either one. The cookies are edible so I have to give them a three. One serving was enough for me because of the high calorie count, especially the fat count. I gave the remainder to the mail lady who actually would benefit from a cheeseburger and a side of fries along with a chocolate shake. In the meantime, she will have to make do with the cookies and I expect a larger version of her to show up as soon as she finishes the rest of the cookies.

I have the same opinion. Yum. It's for much the same reasons too so forgive me if the review looks similar to the Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor.<br /><br />These are thin, almost English tea-like cookie crackers. They're decent in the health department, with some fiber and 3 of them are 140 calories. What's nice is the balance of flavor. They are not overly sweat. The fig and honey flavors fit well together and make this another great one. I'd definitely add these to my snack list.<br /><br />What's nice here is that there is no fructose or high fructose corn syrup. There are wheat and soy based ingredients for those of you with allergies. If you are not allergic, give them a try.

review/summary: A Completely New Take on the Newton - Though the Classic Fig Newton Remains a Better Cookie
review/text: With the current trend in developing multiple products from a single brand, it was only a matter of time before Nabisco did the same with its Fig Newton products.  First off, I must say that I have always been a fan of the Fig Newton.  Its design and taste are hard to beat.  The Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey cookies are only a distant cousin of the original Fig Newton.  While the original Newton is soft, square, chewy and full of fig goodness; the new Newton is hard, round, crispy, and contains only a few specks of fig.  With that comparison, it must be said that this is indeed a very good cookie.  It has a bit of a honey graham cracker taste, with a hint of fig.  It stands up well as a unique product, and I am sure many people will like them - especially fans of graham crackers.  True Fig Newton fans will find little to compare with this new product though, and will definitely prefer the classic Newton over its newer cousin.

review/summary: Finally... a fig newton for those who don't like fig newtons!
review/text: These are great! Crispy, crunchy, little bits of chewy, not too sweet either! They have a light flavor of fig, especially when you get a piece of fig in a bite. I do recommend these, especially to those people who don't like fig newtons... whether for the goo on the inside, the texture or chewy factors. These have none of that and they do satisfy the sweet tooth.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I've tried several flavors of these Newton thins, the blueberry and cranberry orange, and I confess I just didn't like the taste of the honey fig that much. The cookie was nice and crispy though, and I like the fact that they are lower calorie and I think they would make a good ice cream sandwich, but to me, the flavor was lacking and I thought they just were kind of bland.<br /><br />The original fig newton was marketed in the 19th century by Nabisco as a health food and it was believed to be a healthy product and to aid in digestion. I don't know about that, but the calories for these cookies are fairly low, and the ingredients aren't as bad as some snack foods.<br /><br />While I didn't care for the taste, I'm sure this will appeal to some people.

review/summary: Lightly Sweet and Crispy
review/text: I like the Newtons fruit thins. These are sort of a healthy cookie alternative. They are made with wheat flour and fruit and sweetened with honey. I like the crispy texture and the slight taste of cinnamon. I actually like these cookies better than the chewy Newtons. These are thin and crispy with a slight hint of cinnamon, honey, and fruit. If you are expecting a chewy Newton you will be dissapointed, but if you want a lighter, crispy, lightly sweetened cookie then you will enjoy these. 3 of these are 140 calories, add a glass of milk and you have a nice snack.

review/summary: So Delicious!
review/text: This pack of cookies didn't last long in my house. I've liked most if not all Newtons products (the berry and apple crisps are great as is the classic Fig Newton), so I thought I'd try this new product. Delicious! These are crisp cookies with a slightly spicy flavor (think mild spice cake) and a denser consistency than a graham cracker. When I opened the bag, the smell was wonderful, sort of like gingerbread, and my dog literally came running into the room sniffing. The ingredient list contained nothing non-natural-looking (nothing I couldn't pronounce or recognize) and the cookies were devoured by my family (mostly by my husband) within a day of the pack being opened. I will definitely be shopping for more of these and trying out the other flavors.

review/summary: It's a Newton and it's got fig, but it's no Fig Newton in the strict sense of the word
review/text: If you think these Newtons Fruit Thins are just another Fig Newton I can assure you they are not. They are much different in every way. A Fig Newton is soft and chewy... the fig filling is gooey the outer cookie is soft and crumbly.<br /><br />The Newtons Fruit Thins are, well, thin and crispy. I'd  call them more of a tea cookie or something like that. This cookie is more along the lines of a graham cracker with little bits of dried fruit in the cookie. Not soft bits, but a little bit on the hard side of things. They have a nice flavor and the fruit bits add a -little- texture and flavor but mostly the bits get stuck in your teeth.<br /><br />It is a satisfying cookie. It's got a great crunch as you bite into it and I feel satisfied by just eating a few of them. I did not find the cinnamon flavor overpowering.<br /><br />Each cookie is about 47 calories. A serving is 3 cookies which translates to 140 calories, with 2g of Dietary Fiber and 7g of sugars. Total fat is 5g and there is 2g of protein. So not too bad as cookies go.<br /><br />If you like a crunchier kind of cookie without a lot of added stuff or you are a graham cracker fan you'll probably like these. If you are expecting a FIg Newton experience, you will be disappointed because these are absolutely nothing like the Fig Newton you know and love.

review/text: These Newtons Fruit thins are a great tasting cookie, with a mild taste of honey, and with just a hint of the earthy flavor of figs.  These cookies actually taste freshly baked out of the re-sealable package.  These are not your childhood Fig Newtons!  They are more like an elegant, adult cookie, to be shared with coffee or tea, but not with the kids!  These firm and delightful biscuit-like cookies are original in concept, and delicious in taste.

review/summary: Definitely Needs Milk
review/text: I love fig newtons. I have to restrain myself not to eat a sleeve at a time. I love the juxtaposition of the dry exterior with the sweet and moist fig filling. That's why I was really excited to try these.<br /><br />About the only resemblance these have to fig newtons is font on the packaging. The cookies are very thin and very crispy. They're pretty good with milk, but eating them dry would be a big mistake. I suspect that they would also be good with coffee or tea.<br /><br />One caveat is that the fruit in these is very dry and chewy. Expect to get bits of fruit stuck in your back teeth.

review/text: I don't often have store bought cookies (that's right, my wife spoils me) but these cookies are really quite good. Good enough that I enjoyed having them as my after dinner treat. My wife thought they were good too (to quote: "RELLY good"), and that's saying something. She's alot more discerning than I am about such things.<br /><br />Plus, as treats go, Newtons Fruit Thins aren't that bad for you. The ingredient list doesn't read like a chemistry experiment, they are made of whole grain and real fruit, and there is absolutely no trans fat. There's a little sugar (7g) but even that is trivial compared to most snacks. Plus some of that doubtless comes from the honey and fig--natural sugar.<br /><br />All in all, I'm surprisingly happy with these cookies. Give them a try!

review/summary: Tasty with natural ingredients
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to read the list of ingredients as there was not a bunch of fillers or chemicals listed..just natural ingredients.  I like the taste too but the premise of the fruit is a bit misleading as it is just tiny bits of fruit mingled in the cookie.  The cookie itself is thin and almost like a shortbread but not as crumbly.  The sugar content is 7 grams which I think is pretty decent and some of that is from honey, although sugar is listed as an ingredient as well.  Wheat is listed as the main ingredient, but there is also some oat and rice flour.  No artificial anything!!!  Tasty and wholesome cookies.....seems Nabisco is listening!

It is just literally - flour, oil, sugar, fruit, and mysterious natural favor. They are vegan. However I still found them to be too sweet and they should be called cookie thins, not fruit thins since it is a cookie and should be considered a treat and not a health food

review/text: These cookies really do taste a lot like Newtons, but not as sweet. One problem with the regular Newton cookie is it can get a little too sweet. I found these cookies to be a bit more addictive than the Newtons. They have a great natural flavor, with all natural ingredients(Nabisco has taken some time to finally come around with healthier ingredients). The quality and freshness are also excellent, along with attractive and practical packaging.

review/text: These are pretty good, as thin crisp cookies go. The biscuit has a nice not-too-sweet flavor with a pleasant mouth feel. The fig bits are a bit firmer than I'd like, and don't present much of a fig taste. On the whole, a pleasant enough product, though the Newtons identification is clearly more for marketing purposes than as any kind of real indication of the eating experience.

I also appreciate the healthy ingredients, like whole wheat flour, dried fruit, honey, and there is NO corn syrup added.  Three of the delicious cookies contain only 5 grams of fat and 8% of your daily fiber.<br /><br />Bits of the dried figs tend to stick in my teeth, but I still really enjoy the flavor and texture of this snack, and I will definitely buy them again and try the other flavors as well.

But I hate to say that these cookies don't taste much different than the generic butter cookies you've been getting at your local grocery store for decades ... with a hint of cinnamon. I could convince myself, even, that they taste like those generic packaged oatmeal cookies ... minus the frosting. I didn't really detect the flavor of fig and honey. I suppose that if you like those other cookies and would prefer the same thing made a bit more healthily, this is the cookie for you.

review/summary: mediocre cookies
review/text: I don't usually review food, but since I've a fan of most things fig and/or Newtons, I figured I'd try them and share. Bleah.  These cookie things aren't really anything to write home...or Amazon...about.  The cookies, or 'thins', are about the size of an arrowroot biscuit, but less satisfying.  There are 3 in a serving size, packing 5 grams of fat and 140 calories.  For 5 grams of fat I either want something yummy enough to be worth it, or filling enough to make me believe I just consumed 5 grams of fat (some of which is saturated).  So this is not a snack to hold you over between meals, dieters.  I suppose the 8 grams of whole grains are attractive, but that just translates into 21 grams of carbs and only 2 grams of fiber.  So this is not really a healthy fiber treat either.  Now you might say that this isn't a health food, so I shouldn't be judging, but by calling them 'thins', Nabisco is looking to aim at the dieting market.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping for something more chewy than crunchy.  Unfortunately, the 'chewy' is the little bits of fig scattered throughout the cookie.  So little and chewy, in fact, that they get stuck in your teeth and have you uncomfortably nomming around like a dog with peanut butter on his tongue.  The fig and honey variety had a taste and consistency somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker, but a little drier.<br /><br />So I'm not a fan of these, and I probably wouldn't buy them while roaming around the grocery store, but I'm giving them 3 stars on the strength of Newtons *other* fruit products, the Fig Newtons and the Newtons Fruit Crisps.  Both of those are chewy, delicious, and amazing.

review/summary: Call it a Cinnamon 'Thin' with fig bits for a more accurate name.
review/text: I thought this was a fantastic idea - I've never liked the mushiness of Fig Newtons so I hoped this would be a tasty way to get the flavor without the fuss.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the strong flavor of cinnamon.  I mean, it's really strong - I can smell it before I take a bite and it dominates the cookie flavor.  This certainly isn't a problem if you're a cinnamon fan, but it isn't what I expected, based on the package's description.  The cookies themselves are very thin and crispy - rather like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029YA89S">Moravian Cookies</a> if you've ever had those.  The honey's not really noticeable, other than a vague sweetness that could easily be sugar or some other sweetener.  The real disappointment is the fig.  I can't exactly taste the tiny diced fragments of fruit, because they're so little, but they're sticky enough that I still find them stuck to my teeth after I've swallowed the cookie.<br /><br />I love thin "cracker-like" cookies generally, so I was pleased with these overall, but the little fig "chips" were disappointing for flavor and mouth feel. I might have to try the other Fruit Thins in the Newton family - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEP5VQ">Raspberry Chocolate</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA">Blueberry Brown Sugar</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968">Cranberry Citrus Oats</a> - to see if the execution was better with another fruit.

review/summary: Tastes like a digestive biscuit with vestiges of fig
review/text: This was a very odd product; a definite re-imagining of the traditional Fig Newton.  I was excited to read "real fruit" on the front cover, but after consuming a thin, was rather disappointed that the bits of fig were rather sparse.  Additionally, those words make you wonder as to what kind of "fig" the traditional Fig Newton uses...<br /><br />The cookie portion is tasty, albeit a bit dry.  It's a cross between shortbread and graham cracker and a digestive biscuit, leaning more towards the latter.  There was so little "fig" per cookie, that I was primarily eating a cookie.  At least the cookie portion was delicious.  And the little bits of fig that I did have ended up getting stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />In conclusion; I'd call it a cookie with bits of fig.  Not a worthy successor to the venerated Fig Newton.

review/text: There is no question about the joy that Nabisco has shown over the years with their delightful Newtons cookies. But with so many people looking for a new way to market the fruit newtons series to dieters, they are trying it with the new fruit thins fig & honey cookies. They do taste good, but you honestly don't get as much taste from the original figs, as you honestly do from the honey. While you do get some taste of the figs in each of the cookies, it could've been a little bit more. I didn't find it to be a bad cookie, but I was expecting more from the taste. In the meantime, I'd rather prefer a bit of the original fig newtons in my mouth.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/text: I don't know what the value of the phrase "fruit thins" is to most people, but they're crackers. And to me, they taste like honey graham crackers with little tiny bits of dried fruit in them. What makes these less pleasant than honey graham crackers is that the little tiny bits of fruit are hard and get stuck in my teeth. They don't really add anything positive to the honey graham experience.<br /><br />Some people have said they expected these to be a "healthy" snack. Don't expect that. For one thing, the sodium amount per ounce is the same as the brand of potato chips I buy.<br /><br />It's the hard and sticky bits of fruit that put me off the most. So, while I might begrudgingly say these "newton fruit thin" crackers are (merely) OK, I won't be buying them in the future.

It was my "sixth sense" telling me that I wasn't going to like it.<br /><br />Biting into the fruit thin, I expected it to be soft like the Original Fig Newton. Nope. It's crispy, kinda like a cracker. Because of the thinness and crispiness, there's hardly any gooey fruit goodness in the cookie. I missed the soft, chewy center of the Original Fig Newton. And the Fruit thin barely had any taste. It was bland and dry. I think Nabisco needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.

review/summary: I don't get it.
review/text: I can't figure out what these things are!  They have the texture of a cracker, but have a sweetness on the outside like a cookie.  They kinda have these chunks of stuff in them - fig I guess - but they're not sweet, really, not do they add much flavor.  They're really crumbly and thin and look like they need to be dipped in something or covered in something - but they're not.  They're like a bland cracker-cookie thing and I just don't get it.<br />-<br />Sorry, I'm not a fan of these things.  These are like crackers with a sweetness on the outer part with chewy bits of whatever distributed throughout.  The bits of fig stuck to my teeth really badly - which was bizarre.  The cookie themselves have a very crumbly texture and break up in your mouth into nothingness.  No real strong flavor here and hardly sweet at all.  The term "fruit" is used loosely here, as the "fruit" is just these tiny bits throughout each cracker-cookie that you can barely taste anyway.  PASS.<br />***<br />Update:  I'm giving these 1 star.  Been eating them for a week now and they're just terrible.  I keep trying them, hoping they'll grow on me, but the weird texture and stuff sticking to my teeth have made me grown to hate them.  These are garbage.<br />***

review/summary: Meh
review/text: One way to review these crackers is to compare them to something similar, say, graham crackers, which are also sweet, crispy crackers.  Graham crackers are not as flavorful, but they also don't leave bits of fruit, whether raisins or figs, stuck between your teeth.<br /><br />Also, neither type of fruit niblet stuck between your teeth tastes like any particular type of fruit, i.e., the little bits taste just as much like raisin as fig or vice versa.  The "fig and honey natural flavor and other natural flavor" -- which is exactly what the box proudly if confusingly says on the front in the upper left corner -- could just as well be labelled as "strawberry and caramel" or "peach and cinnamon" and it wouldn't make any difference to what you taste.<br /><br />Unlike graham crackers, these Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey dip into milk nicely, without breaking off to frustrate you.  Also, they do not readily crumble when snapped into pieces or bitten.<br /><br />Another consideration is price.  Graham crackers cost around $3.25 for a 14-ounce box, or 23 cents an ounce.  These "fruit thins" crackers cost around 60 cents per ounce, or 160% more, not counting your toothpick and dental floss expense<br /><br />If you're expecting a lot of fig flavor or a lot of honey flavor in a cracker, and especially if you're expecting to discern both, and even if you're expecting only a little of one or the other, this is probably not your best choice.  A better choice would be to spread a saltine or a graham cracker with fig jam and drizzle it with honey.<br /><br />Of course, I'm pretty sure that involves getting fig jam and honey.  And, unless you have really unusual table manners, a knife.<br /><br />Anyway, meh.<br /><br />P.S. I just noticed that on an Amazon decription page for this product, as of right now you can buy "6 used & new for $18.22."  The only meaning I can come up with for a used cracker involves the digestive system and what I'm pretty sure is a medical impossibility.  If it is not an impossibility, I would pay a lot more than $18.22 not to have to consume even one used cracker, no matter the brand.

review/text: With the density and shape of a cookie and the fragility of a cracker, it's an interesting combination. They have a shortbread-like consistency, slight fig chewiness, and a bit of oatmeal flavor as well. Each time I open the box (which has re-sealable tabs I've never seen before), I get a waft of sweetness.

review/text: I tried the Fig and Honey flavor of the Newton Fruit Thins, and really liked them. They are slightly soft, like a good homebaked cookie, and the flavor is not too sweet, just enough. They would be perfect for an addition to a child or adult's lunch box. And when you want just a little something sweet, they would be great for an afternoon or midnight snack. They are packaged like cookies in a slide out plastic tray, with a resealable bag, so they stay fresh after opening. Love, love these.

review/summary: A Crunchy Cookie with Mixed Results
review/text: I'm not a fan of fig newtons, mainly because of the figs, so when I saw the new Newton Fruit Thins I thought I would give them a try.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The fig wasn't overpowering and it tasted a lot like a graham cracker.  I could easily have one or two of these as a snack.  However, I doubt I could eat more than that in one sitting.  While they were good, they were a bit on the dry side and even the dried fruit didn't help with that.  So I would have to say, if you're trying to diet and looking for a quick snack, the Newton Fruit Thins are a good choice.  For a larger snack, not so much.<br /><br />I did have my husband and son try them, with mixed results.  While my four year old loved them and wanted to have more, the hubby wasn't sold.  He thought that the dried fruit was barely noticeable and they could've definitely use more.  Also, the crunchy factor took away from the whole experience.<br /><br />Edited on 5/3/11: One thing I have noticed, if you leave the crackers/cookies out, unsealed, a lot of the crunchiness disappears; they are a little softer without taking any of the flavor away.  I'm actually liking them a lot more this way too.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I love fresh figs, great honey...and all types of cookies. So it's no surprise that I quite like the Fig and Honey Fruit Thins.<br /><br />They remind me of some European-style biscuits I've had over the years, but they are less sugary and you can really taste the dried figs (and raisins) that are in them. There is real flavor and it's not cardboardy at all as some biscuit/cookies can be. You could eat just one and get a real taste and be satisfied. I hate to use the RR word, but these are "Yummo."<br /><br />A 3-cookie serving is 140 calories and 5 grams of fat, so you don't want to go crazy and gobble them up (it's a temptation for me!) I like that the sugar is only 7g and that each serving has 8% of dietary fiber/whole grain (hey, if I'm gonna be eating these, I want some benefits!)<br /><br />My favorite way to indulge with these is with a pot of tea in the late afternoon. But on the fly, I'd much prefer three of these to any sugar-laden energy bar/breakfast bar. Eaten slowly, they are filling. (THese are now gonna be part of my to-go bag with water and small snacks.)<br /><br />Another way to enjoy them: I crumble them up and add to my fat-free, low-sugar greek yogurt. If I want to rev it up, I add some fresh honey (just a bit).<br /><br />Given how good these taste, I'll probably check out the other two versions. But for now, I hope I can find these locally at a reasonable price. (I live in a major city but the supermarkets are woefully behind when it comes to new products.)<br /><br />One last thing. I like that it comes in a 10.5 ounce bag (about 10 servings.) So many cookies today come in such small sizes that you barely get a serving or two out of them. This package can last for awhile (if you're disciplined!).

review/summary: Great Tea Biscuit/Scone type treat!
review/text: I just received these and couldn't resist opening them.  THese are great for people who<br />enjoy a scone without the mess and they are a lot more compact for traveling.<br /><br />I say scone as they are not overly sweet which I count as a real plus.  You can actually taste the fig<br />and the slight honey taste is enjoyable without being overwhelming. They are crunchy without being<br />too hard and the "cookie batter" part has an almost buttery flavor.  There's 7grams of sugar in 3 thins with<br />unbleached flour and oats.  There is NO corn syrup which I was very glad to see, because I don't eat<br />GMO (Genetically Altered) food if I can avoid it.<br /><br /> These come in a plastic tray inside the package, so the breakage was minimal in my order.<br /><br />These really are excellent with a cup of tea, maybe coffee although I would think they might be a bit<br />delicate in flavor for coffee.  Great with a glass of milk, though.<br /><br />So if you are looking for the perfect fruity tea biscuit this is really very good.

So I get these newton fruit thins, and although they are ok, they are no original by any means. My mom in law seemed to enjoy them, and she hates fig newtons, so take it for what its worth.

The cookie is very tasty and moderately nutritious considering it is a cookie.  It comes with 2 gms of fiber in each serving and the Carbohydrate to sugar ratio is a very reasonable 3:1.  While I did expect more fruit, I would seriously consider buying this product.  Since I am always on the hunt for nutritious snacks for the family, this would probably meet my needs and those of the grandkids for great taste.

The Fruit Thins have a texture and flavor much more reminiscent of oatmeal cookies than of Fig Newtons. Still, everyone thought it was a great snack: crunchy, without being dry; a definite treat without being too sweet, with tiny pieces of figs and raisin throughout. At 47 calories per cookie, how can you go wrong?

I'd love to try the other flavors available- cherry, blueberry and raspberry.

review/summary: Newton fruit thins
review/text: This cookie tastes really good.  It is crispy and buttery.  It has simple sugar so the flavor tastes more natural.  I like the fact that it contains whole wheat and oats, it gives it a little nutty flavor but is not overpowering.  The first thing I noticed was the fragrant smell while opening the bag.  They smell fresh and almost homemade.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because you can hardly taste the fig in it.  I like fig newtons a lot, so maybe I was expecting more fig in this cookie, but this is more cookie than fruit; still, it tastes really good.  Another comment that I have is the amount of calories.  It has 140 calories for only 3 cookies, and there is no way you'll be satisfied with only three cookies (well, not me hehe) but I didn't take this into consideration because it is not advertised as a healthy cookie. Overall, I like the flavor and texture.

review/text: This is not a traditional cookie!  However, it is a good thing: it is its own little niche of yumminess. The fig flavor is very subtle--if you want full on fig, get the regular Newtons. This is a thinner wafer cookie, nicely crisp without being too dry.  It tastes healthy without tasting bland, if that makes any sense? You feel good eating these things--a treat but without the guilt.<br /><br />I'm used to making my own cookies so to me anything store bought suffers a bit tastewise (compare a Chips Ahoy to a homemade cookie and you'll know what I mean), but these are tasty right  out of the box.<br /><br />I do prefer the regular fig newtons, because I like the chewiness of the figs and the stronger fig taste, but these are a nice snack packable option.

review/summary: What happens when fig & honey tastes like oatmeal?
review/text: Fig Newtons by Nabisco are an American staple in the realm cookies and snacks.  I can remember in the old days when the only flavor they came in was fig.  Then came "Apple Newtons" and all bets were off!!  I have always found these little Fig/Fruit Newtons to be really tasty and really no room for improvement.  Yet here is a new incarnation of the Fig Newton.<br /><br />This cookie is just that, a cookie.  There is no fruit center, not as soft as the traditional Newton and isn't shaped half dome.  This looks like a standard cookie.  The flavor of this cookie is fig and honey.  However the taste, at least to me, doesn't taste like the former or the latter.  Actually this tastes a lot like an oatmeal cookie.  Now I love oatmeal cookies, the frosted ones are to die for.  Notwithstanding, it seems odd that a cookie that promotes itself to own the flavors of fig and honey shouldn't taste like oatmeal.<br /><br />So final verdict, do I like the cookies? Yes, I find them very tasty and a nice treat. Do they live up to the "Fig Newton" name?  Not really, they seem a bit disconnected from the original cookie and taste too much like oatmeal cookies.  Again this isn't a bad thing, but these cookies are a bit pricey to taste like oatmeal.  Would I buy these again?  Hard to say, I just might grab a package of oatmeal cookies first.

The package says "crispy cookies", and that's what they are, thin, crispy, rounded confections with scalloped edges and bits of embedded fig and raisins.<br /><br />I like the taste and the kaleidoscopic swirling of tastes and textures that please the palate. Even the fussy Mrs.Spudman likes this new Newton with no reservations. The Newton Fruit Thins are a satisfying blend of the crisp and the chewy, sweet but not overly so, and even embellished with natural flavor which is the last ingredient listed. I like that the ingredients are all real, all recognizable, all pronounceable. Not a bag of chemicals or artificiality here.<br />On the bag: "Natural flavor with other natural flavor." Sounds like an abundance of natural.

review/text: "Newton's Fruit Thins" (the "Fig and Honey" type)are a WONDERFULLY tasty cracker-cookie.  Not as thick as a cookie, but thinner - but a little thicker than a typical cracker.  Doesn't easily crack like a regular cracker.  Really tasty!  My 83-year-old mother really enjoyed them, and my 85-yearo-old father said: "really awesome".  There is just the right balance between fig-fruit and honey; the sweetness is there, but not at all overpowering.  Not as heavily "figish" as a Fig Newton, but one can fully taste the fig flavor.  The sweetbread-like cracker doesn't give it an overly bread-cracker taste; the fruit flavor definitely comes through!  I'm going out to locate the other three flavors, too!

review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are half amazing, half awful! The Fig & Honey flavor have an amazing scent of fresh baked oatmeal cookies. Each cookie is a thin round wafer, crispy and almost like a shortbread. Three cookies, a nice portion, is 140 calories. These could have been a satisfying treat for the sweet tooth.<br /><br />Sadly, the bits of fig embedded in each cookie are hard as rocks! When I first bit into the wafer, I thought I broke a tooth. I was relieved to realize that I hadn't, it was just the fruit bits. To be sure that I hadn't gotten just a bad cookie, I tried two more cookies. Again, I found the flavor to be wonderful, but I couldn't get beyond the texture of the pieces of fig.<br /><br />To be sure that my impression was accurate, I did ask a few family members to give me their opinion. The consensus was that the crumbly texture of the cookie didn't match the hard pieces of fig.<br /><br />The combination just didn't work for anyone!

The cookies are large and nicely shaped, good to have out on a platter at a party.  The taste is....healthy, which that in itself is fine, if the cookie was healthy.  At 140 calories for 3 with 21 carbs and 7 grams of sugar, it really isn't all that healthy. I am currently counting calories in an effort to lose weight and giving up 140 calories for 3 cookies that don't taste sinfully delish just doesn't work for me.  If I am going to cheat with a snack, I could have 3 Oreo's for 160 calories, no comparison there.  They are crisp and tasty with a graham cracker texture, I just wish they were lower in calories and then they would really be a winner!

review/summary: Newton in Name Only
review/text: Mark Twain once said, "The difference between the almost right word & the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning."<br /><br />This quote came to mind when I first tasted Newton's Fruit Thins, which are trying to ride the name recognition of Fig Newtons.  Don't be fooled.  The difference between Nabisco's Newton Fruit Thins and the hallowed Fig Newton itself is of lightning bug/ lightning proportions.  The Fig and Honey Newton Fruit Thin is not only thin, but pale by comparison, especially if you like the taste of moist figs such as the old-school Fig Newton provides.  THIS cookie is as dry as an animal cracker, if somewhat sweeter.  It is advertised as containing raisins (which I like) and figs (which I also enjoy), but they amount to mere flecks in the cracker -- too little fruit to impact taste and just enough fruit to get caught between your teeth (they were a bit hard and dry).<br /><br />Nabisco tries mightily, trumpeting the lack of high fructose corn syrup (this product uses old-fashioned sugar instead) and the fact that it provides 8 grams of whole grain per three cookies (for those taking notes, that's 2 g. dietary fiber and 140 calories with 5g of it from fat).  Trumpet away.  When I eat a cookie, I'm being willfully bad; and if I'm being willfully bad, I want to REALLY enjoy the taste of my cookie, calories be damned.  Using that as a barometer, this cookie scores a 2-star rating at best.

review/summary: Moderately sweet biscuits are a filling, healthy snack
review/text: The Newton Fig and Honey Fruit Thin may be hard for an American to peg.  Nabisco calls them "crispy cookies" but the English would likely label them as "biscuits."  An English biscuit is the closet I've seen to this wafer shaped, very thin cookie.  They are mostly crunchy, but slightly chewy when the small piece of fruit is bitten into.<br /><br />"Slight sweet" as Nabisco characterizes them probably misses the mark.  Certainly, many cookies are much sweeter.  But after a "serving" of these (three cookies), the accumulated sweetness is pronounced.  I would characterize it as being moderately sweet instead.<br /><br />Comprised of mostly pronouncable "good stuff," e.g., flour, sugar, soybeans, oats, figs, raisins, honey, etc. these are some of the healthier "cookies" you'll find.  At only 140 calories per three cookie serving, they're pretty lean for what amounts to a satisfying snack.<br /><br />Best of all, they'll likely satisfy your kids' cookie cravings in a manner you'll feel better about than many alternatives.  No one will characterize these cookies as "delicious" but there's plenty to at least "like" about them.

I had the Fig and Honey variety and, as with other Nabisco products, liked the quality very much.<br /><br />The cookies are not overly sweet with a honey flavor dominating the taste. Bits of dried figs are embedded throughout the cookies and some bits of raisins are also included. Unbleached wheat flower is the base and sugar is added.<br /><br />The cookies taste great with milk and hold their crispness as you chew. You might consider the potential problem of the figs sticking to your teeth. I did not consider it a negative given the nice fig accents to the honey whole wheat flavor.

review/summary: If you really like graham crackers...?
review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins (Fig and Honey) / B004FELBH8<br /><br />I was really excited about receiving these cookies through Amazon Vine - I'm a big fan of the Newtons "fig newtons" line of products and always have been. It seemed like a transition to "cookie" would be inevitably good, but... these cookies just didn't do it for me or my family.<br /><br />I guess I should have been concerned when my husband bit into one of these and said, "These taste like sand!" I didn't feel like they were quite *that* bad, but it's true that these are *very* dry and somewhat crumbly. They remind me a little bit of dry graham crackers or dry "nilla wafers" - I ended up dunking these cookies in milk to make them a little more palatable.<br /><br />The dried fruit bits in these cookies are nice, but not anything to really write home about. The fig and honey flavoring is very subtle and seems to come across more in the scent than in the actual taste.<br /><br />Overall, I like the sweetness balance of these cookies - they're not overpowering, and the flavor is nice - but the intense dryness of the cookie combined with the sticky chewiness of the dried fruit was just too toothsome for me. If the cookie had been softer, I would have liked these a lot more - as it was, I felt like I was eating very dry crackers and I didn't enjoy the experience.<br /><br />I don't like to waste things, so I'll try to finish the entire bag, but the rest of the family has already informed me that I'm on my own.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: wonderful cookie
review/text: My daughter received these through the Amazon Vine program.  I hadn't seen them in stores, so I didn't know they were available.  I like Fig Newtons, but they are not one of my favorite store bought cookies.  So, I was surprised to find these were delicious!  I enjoyed them with a cup of tea - they hold together even after dunking.  They are a crunchy cookie, and reminded me of a ginger snap (not in taste, but in texture and lightness of flavor).  I enjoyed them so much, I will definitely look for the other flavors.

review/text: While I imagine that these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELBH8">Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a> were not served at many of the afternoon teas in London this past weekend, they are, none-the-less, a tasty, delightful treat with any warm beverage or even a cold glass of milk. Perfectly sweetened with honey & fig (I selfishly chose this variety because I'm the only person in my household who likes figs,) they are a  marvelous twist on an old favorite, the classic Fig Newton. In fact, I can feel the call to have a few with what remains of my morning coffee!<br />Try some & enjoy!

review/summary: A matter of taste
review/text: After seeing the reviews on these fruit thins, I was afraid they would be a big disappointment.  However, I was delighted to find they were delicious.  I think it's a matter of taste, and expectation.  I was not expecting these to even be comparable to Fig Newtons.  I expected, and wanted, a cookie - not "fruit and cake."  And this is definitely more of a cookie, with a crunch.  I agree with another reviewer that they smell wonderful.  They are a good size (about the same size as Chips Ahoy cookies, only thinner), and you get three cookies to a serving for 140 calories. I found them to be similar to a tea cookie.  In fact, I enjoyed them with a cup of hot tea as a nice treat.<br /><br />Yes, the fig is a subtle flavor (despite the bits of it in the cookie).  Yet, I didn't find this to be a detriment; they are a lightly sweet cookie, which make for a reasonably low calorie snack.  If I wanted a strong fig flavor, I'd just buy Fig Newtons!  Overall, I loved them and would buy them again.

review/summary: Tasty Little Snack
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9XBIE">Fig Newtons</a> are some of my favorite cookies. I like them because of the nice balance between the fruity filling and the chewy cookie. When I ordered these thins I expected them to be similar in flavor to the other Newtons that I was familiar with, but they turned out to be an entirely different type of sweets. They are very similar to the other kinds of thins. The fig flavor is noticeable, but it's not overwhelming. I haven't been able to discern the honeyr aroma, other than in terms of the general sweetness. I actually like these thins a lot, and I have to restrain myself from eating too many at a time. They make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee. Overall, these are very tasty thins.

review/summary: Not very figgy
review/text: There's a fig in the picture and it says Newtons on the package, but these are definitely cookies and not cake. Instead of just being figgy cookies, Nabisco added a lot of honey, so much so that the taste of honey completely overpowers the taste of anything else. If I wanted honey cookies, I wouldn't have chosen something with figs on the covers. The figs are there, I think, just to lure the people who want the real Fig Newtons. As such, each cookie has very little fig at all.

review/summary: A tasty snack, with one small caveat.
review/text: I tried 'em, I liked 'em.  I'm not normally a big consumer of cookies or similar products, but these are most definitely worth a try.  They are a curious cross between a graham cracker, both in taste and texture, and an oatmeal-raisin cookie, but with figs instead of raisins.  The result is decidedly yummy.  They're kind of on the dry and brittle side, so you'll want to munch these with a glass of milk close at hand.  Not a whole lot of nutritional content, but not particularly bad for you, either.<br /><br />My only problem with them is that the fig bits are more than a little annoying.  They tend to be excessively firm and chewy in that "stick to your teeth like hard candy" kind of way, and in one instance I bit into what felt like a piece of pit.  I shrugged that off and kept munching away with great delight.  I vacillated between three and four stars, but opted for three due to the figgy mischief already described.

review/summary: Newton + graham cracker = win
review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are sort of like the love child of fig newtons and graham crackers.  The texture is similar to a graham cracker, although a little chewier because of the fruit, but the flavor is sort of "newton light".  Definite fig flavor with a lot of cinnamon and hints of sweetness from the honey and raisin.  They're not too sweet, and not as powdery as a graham cracker.  Three cookies is a "serving size" but I found I couldn't stop at three.  These are great between-meal snacks.  No high-fructose corn syrup, and really nothing bad in the ingredient list.  Overall, I recommend these if you like fig newtons and graham crackers and want to see what it would be like to eat them together.

review/summary: The new Fig Newton!
review/text: Fig & Honey Newton Fruit Thins are a graham cracker-like cookie made with whole grains, real fruit, and no high fructose corn syrup. A healthy alternative to the all-time favorite Fig Newton, the nutritional value is a good selling point. Unfortunately, the taste does not live up to the hype. The tiny bits of fig are similar to the skins of popcorn kernels which get stuck in your teeth. The honey flavor seems to be missing. Overall, the cookie is bland. On the plus side, the packaging is quite nifty with the re-tie clasp top. Perhaps the Blueberry Brown Sugar or Raspberry Chocolate varieties are better options.

review/summary: Not bad, but overpriced for the quality
review/text: Let's get this out of the way first: the "Newtons" moniker on the package should not fool you into thinking these are anything like Fig Newtons. Newtons Fruit Thins taste like honey graham crackers, have the overall texture of a sugar cookie, and boast only 140 calories and a full 8 grams of whole grains per three-cookie serving.<br /><br />Once you know not to expect a chewy cookie, the taste is not that bad. The honey really comes through, and the bits of fruit add a nice ancillary taste. The fruit is not consistent between cookies, however - some are loaded with fig, others have one or two small specks. I also bit into a couple fairly hard chunks of fruit that annoyed me. The first three cookies out of the package were incredibly bland, but the rest of the bag was consistently good.<br /><br />If these cookies were $3, or even $4, per package, this would have been a four-star review, because at that price I'm willing to put up with some minor annoyances or variances in taste. However, at the prices listed currently (April 28, 2011), you'd be paying at least $6.75 for each 30-cookie package, and that's not counting shipping, which at current rates leaves you shelling out $8.75 per pack, or 30 cents per cookie! At that price, I expect a quality better than what I've gotten.

review/summary: Mediocre at best.
review/text: When I opened my package the smell was enticing, sweet... and really familiar. It was like a slightly sweeter honey graham cracker.<br />But the taste didn't live up to the smells promise. It was bland. Not graham at all, which wasn't what I was expecting until I smelled them, and not the adult cookie taste I was expecting from the description. Big let down, not bad, but not knock my socks off great either.<br />The 'fruit thins' did have nice bits of fig/fruit in it, but they were too sticky. While nice in taste the fruit bits just didn't contrast well with the thin crispy cracker texture.<br />I will probably serve the rest of these with, say, tea. When there is an expectation for a not too sweet, crispy accompaniment. But, I won't get these again otherwise.

review/summary: Don't go in expecting a Fig Newton, and you'll be content
review/text: For some reason the incorporation of the Fig Newton product name in these didn't trigger enhanced expectations in me, even though I am a Fig Newton fan.  I looked at some of the other reviews here, and found a number of reviewers who seem bitterly disappointed that this is not some kind of thinner Fig Newton.  Just to get the idea out of the way, this is NOT a Fig Newton!<br /><br />What it is is a dryer, thin cookie.  I found the taste to be decent, not too sweet, and for some reason the texture is interesting, much more so than on a true Fig Newton.  There isn't a sign of the oozey filling that a Fig Newton has.  I like them fine, but they didn't rock my world.  Thanks to the hard reality of weight control and middle age, I don't allow myself to have cookies or Fig Newtons very often anymore, but when I do give myself that guilty privilege, I'll consider this product in the future.

review/text: I think that these cookies are great to go along with a cup of tea or coffee.  They are very crispy and the flavor is light, I thought they would taste like a crisp fig newton but they aren't. I don't think that they would be consider to be 'diet' food either, so if you are looking for a low sugar cookie this isn't it.  This cookie is something that I think would fit in with a sensible eating plan in that you can have 3 cookies and only consume about 140 calories. Which makes them a good indulgent snack that isn't the same old thing.

The ingredients read like something your Mom would make:<br />wheat flour, enriched flour, sugar, whole grain wheat flour, soybean or palm oil, rolled oats, dried figs, raisins, honey, salt, baking soda, rice flour, soy lecithin, cinnamon.<br /><br />Three cookies are four Points Plus points as calculated by the WW calculator, which means you can have a few without blowing your whole day.  They're really good with coffee or tea.  There are some kinds of bread that don't taste good to me (Wheat hot-dog rolls for example) because of the wheat.  These cookies don't give away that they're made with wheat flour, and I like that.  I get to feel like I'm cheating when I'm not!<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: Plenty of heft for a cracker - more like a cookie,  healthier than a Newton
review/text: I was prepared to pooh pooh these and say not bad, but I was really quite impressed. A single cracker, which looks like a bog standard cracker, actually has tons of flavor, texture, and heft, and the fig and brown sugar (really raisin, don't tell anyone) flavor lingers. It smells like a graham cracker, which is no means a bad thing.<br /><br />I actually have some fig newtons to compare with here, so I'd note that for the serving size (30g) the Thins are 140 calories while the Newtons are 110 calories, so the thin is only in one dimension.<br /><br />The Newtons have 'Enriched Flour, Figs preserved with sulfur dioxide, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, ...' while the Thins have 'Unbleached Flour, sugar, ...'. This is a big win for the Thins for me if true.<br /><br />Okay, let me eat a Newton here. *HOMF* The sacrifices I make for you people. The Newtons very clearly have more 'fig' texture and fruit mass, but the mealy soft bleached wheat texture of the Newton shell has never been a plus in my book. I much prefer the crunchiness of the Thins and the way the gooey fig and raisin tastes linger - I assume because they're more dried in the Thins.<br /><br />Eating another Thin now. *MONCH*. Oh yeah, that really is better. Okay, stopping here for tonight.<br /><br />So other than the 30 extra calories per serving for the Thins I give the win entirely to the Thins. I have no problem ditching the Newtons for these - they've got more fruit, but much more extra crud crammed in as well, so even with the extra calories I'd deem the Thins healthier, or at least as healthy as mass produced food products can be. And heck, they taste better. If you can restrict yourself to eating just one, it's quite a satisfying snack for 50 calories.

review/summary: Less fruit, more delicious cookie
review/text: Expectations are important - I generally associate Newtons with a soft fruit-filled cookie, but these Newtons Fruit Thins don't match that description whatsoever. They're neither soft nor fruit-filled.<br /><br />That said, they ARE delicious!<br /><br />The Fig and Honey cookies are just the right level of crispy, with a fresh taste and just sweet without being over the top. My girlfriend said they remind her of pinwheel cookies her grandmother used to make, and I recognize that flavor too, a little zing of ginger and cinnamon and a touch of sweet honey. Tiny pieces of dried fig mixed in give the cookie a bit of texture without being chunky.<br /><br />And dipped in coffee? Divine! This is the ideal cookie to complement your morning cup of caffeine.<br /><br />The Amazon price at the time of this review is a little steep for my taste - about $27 for a bundle of four packages, meaning almost seven dollars per package. I'd pay more like four or five dollars per package as a treat for myself and my family.<br /><br />The name is something of an enigma - these cookies have little to do with the Newtons I know. But they are a delicious surprise, and I'm sure we'll be back for more, especially if the price comes down.<br /><br />The first package we got was gone in only a few hours. I'd better think about stocking up!

The honey is subtle, not too sweet, and the whole grains add some substance. The bits of fig and raisin are small--about the size of caraway seeds--and chewy. I was able to recognize the figs, but then, I like Fig Newtons, so I probably knew the flavor from that. Package says serving size is 3 cookies, but I found just 1 or 2 make a satisfying snack to nibble on without being too many calories or too much sodium. I'll probably buy these again.

review/text: NABISCO NEWTONS FRUIT THINS CRISPY COOKIES comes in a 10.5 ounce package.  In side, is a clear plastic drawer that can be pulled out and pushed back in.  The drawer has two compartments.  The bag is made of foil, and it has a sturdy aluminum clasp for re-sealing.  Now, this is about what is inside. Inside, there are about 28 cookies.  I cannot be totally sure, since I already consumed a few.  The cookies are colored light brown and they have a wavey, scalloped edge.  The cookies are not soft and they are not particularly crisp.  They are in-between.  There are little flecks of dark stuff here and there, which are bits of figs and raisins.  The flavor can be characterized as "generic."  The flavor is like JUICY FRUIT CHEWING GUM.  In other words, it does not have any particular flavor.  The fruit component of these cookies is not convincing.  Using the term "Newtons" in the name of this product does not do justice to real fig newtons.  Real fig newtons, as everybody knows, is mostly fruit.  But I would guess that the quantity of fruit in these cookies is under 0.5%.  And so, what I say to the food scientists at Nabisco (Kraft Foods) is, "Nice try, food scientists, but you have not in any way improved upon the classic fig newton!  And you have not even come close to the original!"

review/text: One of the great pleasures of a Fig Newton is the wonderful chewiness of the outer cookie and the filling.  I was a bit suspect about a thin, crunchy cookie under the Newton name, but I have to admit the cookie is good.  It has a nice crunch and a balanced sweetness.  Three nice-sized cookies are only 140 calories, which is another pleasant surprise.  My only complaint is that the cookie leaves a bit of a chalky feeling in my mouth after eating it.  I can't say this will topple the original Fig Newton from its perch near the top of the cookie world, but it is a nice complement to the product line.

I might have been too full from dinner (pulled pork with broccoli slaw and potato salad) and I was jonesing for chocolate, nothing satisfies a chocolate craving but chocolate, so these fruit thins seemed a bit bland for me.<br /><br />But I grabbed one to go with my coffee this morning and it went down all right, in fact the overal crunchy, lightness of the thins were the perfect counterpoint to my overly creamed and sugared coffee (I'm a coffee-with-my-cream-and-sugar coffee drinker, don't judge).  My son didn't care for them, he didn't like the little chewy bits of dried figs or the honey-vanilla taste of the cookies themselves, but I really like figs (and honey, too) so, to me, they were just about perfect.<br /><br />The packaging could be a little better, my thins were mostly broken when they arrived, not a huge problem, a broken cookie never hurt anyone, but if I'd wanted to share these with guests it would be nicer if most of them had arrived in one piece.  Also, they were a tad stale.  It is the rainy season here and the reifastenable bag should be a little more airtight to preserve the crunchiness (also, not a huge problem, I popped them on a plate into my toaster oven for a couple of mins to 'recrisp' them).<br /><br />As an added bonus the thins have 2g of fiber (3 cookies per serving) at 140 calories per serving.  Not exactly diet food (which I really hate, btw), but compared to the dark chocolate covered oreo truffle I ate with my coffee last week, these are healthy and filling.

review/summary: Absolutely horrible!
review/text: I was really excited to try these cookies when I first saw them in the grocery store. We didn't buy them right away and when I found them offered through the Vine program I was quite pleased. Fig and Honey wouldn't have been my first flavor choice, but as I do like regular Fig Newtons, I figured I'd give them a try. How bad could they be? The answer is...very, very bad.<br /><br />I like cinammon but the cinammon in this cookie was both overpowering and artificial tasting. Something was just "off" and "too strong" about them. It might be whatever other "natural flavors" are in the cookie and not just the cinammon, I'm not sure, but something just didn't work and the cookie had a bad aftertaste. My 11 year old son said he thought they had a bad "before" and "middle" taste too! I can't argue with him there.<br /><br />The dried fruit bits were equally bothersome. They made the cookie difficult to eat as the bits were too chewy and stuck in my teeth. I don't want to have to pick fruit bits out of my teeth when I eat a cookie.<br /><br />All in all, this cookie was a huge disappointment.  My children wouldn't even take a second bite of the cookies and I wasn't too thrilled about eating more myself.  As a fan of fruit newtons (both fig and other flavors), I had high hopes for these cookies. If the basic cookie for all of the flavors is the same, I won't bother trying any of the other flavors.

review/summary: Mom and kid approved!
review/text: I wasn't so sure I'd like these cookies.  Fig and honey sounded like it would taste alright, but when I opened the package, the cookies looked more like wafers or crackers instead of a cookie.  I'm not really a fan of those more healthy cookies that look like crackers, so when I opened this up, I was skeptical of trying it.  I gave one to each of my three children as well to try.  I have very picky children yet each of them wanted another one.  They were very tasty and since they have real fruit, you could surely taste that in each bite.  My pickiest daughter proclaimed, "Those cookies were really good!"<br /><br />These cookies also have no high fructose corn syrup in them at all and contain about 7g of sugar for 3 cookies.  They are a healthy alternative to other sweet snacks that contain undesirable ingredients.  Overall I thought this product was healthy and tasty. I liked it and so did my kids!

review/summary: A tasty cracker with a hint of fig
review/text: I enjoyed this tasty cross between and cracker and a cookie. I've always loved Fig Newtons, and expected the taste to be more like one of those cookies. The one thing it didn't have was much fruit--probably a good thing for many people, but I love the taste of figs and would have liked more. The cookie itself had a great flavor and texture. My husband didn't have any trouble downing several along with a glass of milk.

review/summary: A Fig Version of A Graham Cracker
review/text: The cookies (crackers - something) are about as round as a baseball.  They are crispy and crumbly like a graham cracker.  I shared both boxes I received with my co-workers and the comment I heard most often was that they tasted like a graham cracker. I also heard quite often, "Mmmmm, I would buy these."<br /><br />I thought they tasted very nice. The fig part was subtle and a great burst of flavor that complimented the cookie part.  If healthy was a taste then that is what I would describe them as. They aren't unhealthy from what I can tell but they aren't exactly low fat or low calorie.  5gs of fat. 140 calories.<br /><br />They really did make for a nice little snack.<br /><br />While I thought these were good, I did prefer the taste of the orange cranberry ones better.

review/summary: Better than I thought they'd be!
review/text: Okay, first, you need to know that I usually don't buy cookies, we try to really limit our sweets intake and we also try to eat things that are 100% whole grain, so cookies just don't fit into that, we also shop almost exclusively in the natural/organic section.  I love regular Fig Newtons, but stopped eating them when we started eating more whole grain and no/low sugar and over all healthier.  Also please know, I do not like crunchy cookies, I like soft cookies, period.  That said, I was surprised by how much I liked these.  They are thin and relatively crispy without being dusty/messy crispy.  I definitely taste the fig but not so much any honey, nothing wrong with that.  Over all the flavor is nice and there is enough flavor, some plain cookies of this type are just like sugary cardboard, but these have flavor.  I think I prefer the flavor of the cranberry ones to these because the flavor of these is not as strong and is warmer flavor than the citrusy cranberry ones.  Now, what surprised me the most, how not-that-bad-for-you these are.  There are no preservatives which is nice.  The first ingredient is enriched flour, but they do have some whole wheat flour and whole oats in them too, the are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and has fructose listed near the end.  We won't buy treats or sweetened cereal where a serving has more than 9 grams of sugar, and guess what?  These only have 7 grams of sugar per serving which is three cookies.  I will not at all feel bad letting my kids eat these cookies, especially since a serving for a preschooler would be one cookie.  I also like that they bag is re-sealable.  Now, while I said I preferred the cranberry flavor that preference is not enough to make but the cranberry ones over these and the reason is that the fig ones have one more gram of fiber and one less gram of carbs per serving, that little extra is enough that I'd choose the fig over the cranberry and why these got 5 stars instead of 4 like I gave the cranberry ones.

review/text: Newton's Fruit Thins are a wonderful new addition to the Newton's family. I'm a big fan of fig and I loved their Fig and Honey cookies. They are made with whole grain and real fruit, which is a big thumbs up for me. The are not overly sweet, which also is a plus in my book. I hate when something is so sweet that you get that sick feeling after eating it. The are crispy, but not too hard.<br /><br />I highly recommend these crispy cookies! They're very good and everyone in the family will like them!

review/text: I didn't know what to expect from this new product in the Fruit Newtons line, but I find this Fig and Honey flavor Newtons Fruit Thin to be a very tasty cookie.<br /><br />It's crisp but not brittle, infused with pockets of fig and honey flavoring.  It's also not too sweet -- kids may be disappointed that they'll be denied their usual sugar rush, but adults will be pleased, and indeed you could serve these without embarrassment alongside some posh European biscuits at a tea party.<br /><br />Newtons Fruit Thins also don't seem to have too many chemical ingredients.  I recognize almost all the ingredients listed, and the cookies are low in saturated fat and offer zero cholesterol.<br /><br />So I give these a thumbs-up, and I would be interested to try the other flavors in the line.

review/summary: The Perfect Tea Biscuit!
review/text: These Fig and Honey Newtons Fruit thins are the perfect tea biscuit! Made with whole grains and real fruit, this is one biscuit I am happy to let my little one snack on.  She does not even like figs, but says, "These are by far the best cookies ever!"  The fruit thins are delicious, with a delicate fig flavor, not too sweet, and wonderfully crispy.  Just 140 calories, 7 grams of sugar, and 5 grams of fat (only 1 gram of saturated) in 3 nicely sized cookies.  And best of all...no high fructose corn syrup!  I look forward to trying the other flavors.

review/text: These are passable thin cookies.  The packaging was sealed tight and they were fresh with a honey taste that wasn't cloying.  However there were bits baked in (I'm guessing the figs) that were a little on the tough side.  I don't see myself getting these again; I'd much rather stick to the Fig Newtons.

review/summary: Fig Newtons are Better
review/text: Having grown up on Nabisco Fig Newtons, I was eager to sample this latest Nabisco fig product. After trying these fig and honey thins, I wondered "what was the point?" Although tasty and good for dunking in coffee, they pale in comparison to fig newtons from the standpoint of taste, nutrition, and overall appeal. These thins are pleasantly sweetened with honey with specks of dried figs, but they can hardly be called "Fruit Thins" since the figs are so insignificant. I and members of my family enjoyed them with our coffee, but we all decided that we probably would never purchase another bag. We found this product too understated. We'll stick with our Fig Newtons, thank you very much.

review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey, 10.5-Ounce<br />I love fig newtons and thought this would be a great, low-sugar snack food. I was surprised to find that there was only a hint of the fig newton taste. There are bits of fig in the cookie, but it is hard and not really appealing. The cookie itself is crisp and a pretty good size but the overall taste is bland to me. Also, it isn't overly sweet which is nice but I wish it tasted more like fig newtons. For the price and taste I will be looking elsewhere for alternatives to cookies and the like.

review/summary: Better alternative to traditional graham crackers or Teddy Grahams
review/text: I found these to be a better option to comparable snacks...<br /><br />For the GOOD:<br />*quite yummy...reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EPZY">Teddy Grahams Graham Snacks - Honey, 8 oz</a><br />*Ingredient list is completely understandable...no super multi-syllabic preservatives or flavoring agents or hygrogenated oils.<br />*sodium level is pretty good -- 95mg per serving (about half that of traditional graham crackers).<br /><br />Now the not so good:<br />*figs -- it's really more fig bits.  It's great that real fruit is used but I doubt I could've ever figured out what it is based on the tiny bits.<br />*The second ingredient is sugar:( and contains palm oil:(<br /><br />The thin cripsy cookies/crackers are about 2" in diameter (actually slightly smaller than the picture on the package).  And three of them (30g) = 140 calories...about the same as traditional graham crackers.<br /><br />Overall, I would choose these over the traditional graham crackers or the Teddy Grahams.
