review/summary: Coffee worth drinking
review/text: Not only is this coffee worth drinking, it is a bargain, besides.  Having had real Hawaiian coffee on a trip to Hawaii, I quickly became much fussier about what  kind I drank.  I started ordering from a grower there, but the price was out of my range for an everyday drink.  When I tried the Maui brand, I found it was an excellent coffee, and I could afford for it to become a fine daily vice!  Good flavor, good price, great delivery, what more could I want?<br />Well, aside from wanting to go back and sip it on the beach at Waikiki!

review/summary: If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!
review/text: I first tried this coffee while on vacation in Maui two years ago. At the time, I would drink about two cups of coffee a week, always with cream and sugar. Much to the consternation of my Seattle area friends and family (also home of Starbucks), I don't like strong, bitter coffee. This has the smoothest taste I have EVER had in a coffee. Please note that this is DIFFERENT than Kona coffee, even if it is still Maui BRAND. I can't find it anywhere on the mainland so unfortunately I have to order it on-line and Amazon has the best price. By the way, now I drink coffee every day and without sugar to mask the flavor.<br /><br />**As a special note - I had originally bought this at Wal-Mart on Maui because it was the cheapest when I wanted to bring several home from vacation. I got more when relatives went over and bribed them to bring some back. My family just bought me some on-line from the Maui Coffee store and for some reason it was not so smooth. The roast seemed to be slightly darker. I am only through the first bag but hopefully the others will be even better. I am addicted to this coffee!!

When in Maui we purchased a 20% Kona blend at the Maui Coffee Company that we also liked much better than the typical 10% Kona blends.  I have not seen this 20% blend for sale anywhere else.

review/summary: This stuff is NASTY
review/text: Amazon should have given the option of NO rating, because that is how badly I feel about this product. This product has been tasted with several brewing iterations and were hoping that we were just not brewing the grounds correctly. My family have been to Hawaii, had Kona, and fell in love with it. We certainly are not coffee snobs, but this is absolutely the worst coffee we've ever tasted.  Not sure if this was even Kona. There was absolutely no nutty Kona fragrance to this coffee after brewing. This stuff is just plain nasty in taste. I've had stale coffee before and it was better than this. When I purchased it I couldn't wait to get hold of it and have some. This was one of the most disappointing products purchased. Costco had another brand of 100% Koan last year during the holiday season and it was most wonderful. Will never purchase this product again!

review/summary: Conversion Complete
review/text: As a long-time user of McCann's steel cut oats (quick version), I had that on Subscribe & Save here in order to get the best price.  I did not like the price rising, so gave Country Choice Organic Quick a try.  I may never go back.  I don't find Country Choice better than McCann's, but it is different, very good in its own way, and has a more pleasing price.  I'd read reviews here about the container being inferior, so I saved one of my McCann's containers to transfer the product - but now I see no reason to do that.  This paperboard-type container is just fine, a bit floppy, but it works.  I also read a review that Country Choice is good if you like to chew not-so-soft oatmeal, and that could not be further from my experience.  The standout difference between McCann's and Country Choice is that the latter is much softer, almost fluffy, and I cook them the same way.  My proportions are a cup (generous, sometimes I go a bit over) of water to 1/3 cup oats (also a hair generous at times), and I cook the oats for 7 minutes.  Surprisingly enough, if I had to choose which of the two brands is better for clean digestion (euphemism - lol), it would be Country Choice.  I say it's surprising because one would think that a rougher oatmeal would do a better cleaning job.  Boy oh boy, my days have been going great, because I have a good start in the morning!

review/summary: not so quick cooking
review/text: I like steel cut oats, and got this brand because of the 5 minute advertised cooking time. However, for me it takes more like 8-10 minutes before it's cooked to my taste. Otherwise, it takes much chewing and works your jaws to a great extent! Good exercise for your jaws! Taste is ok, but not spectacular.

review/text: I took a chance by ordering a case of this. I've been eating Quaker 1-minute for years and never really considered another brand, but after hearing so many good things about Country Choice, I gave it a shot. Frankly, I'm not going back to Quaker. This is so much better, with a better taste, a thicker consistency (at least the way I cook it), and a longer lasting full-stomach feeling.<br />I pair it with brown sugar, frozen raspberries, and skim milk.<br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I'm a recent chai drinker, and tetley masala brand is definitely my favorite brand. I need to have it every afternoon, else the day feels incomplete.<br />Our neighbourhood grocery store(namaste plaza) doesn't have sufficient stock of this flavor, so I'm glad to have found it on Amazon. I've tried other flavors like Elaichi and Ginger, and also masala flavor by other brands(Tea India), but nothing comes close. Having said that, chai tastes are highly personal, so i wouldn't be surprised if others felt differently. But hey, this is my review!

review/summary: The perfect blend of spices for a Chai
review/text: I have tried multiple brands of Chai (masala tea) and found this one to be the best so far.<br /><br />Ideally an authentic masala(spiced) chai contains Ginger, Elachi (cardamom), Cloves, Nutmeg, Mint Star Anise - add/remove a few other spices, but I've just listed the major ones.<br /><br />This particular brand (Tetley) seems to contain most of the major ingredients, particularly Elachi/Cardamom, Ginger & Cloves which are the most essential.<br /><br />The other brand that I have tried is Tazo chai (the ones you get in Starbucks) - which is good, but a slightly different set of spices.  I personally like the Tetley better than Tazo, but which one you like is dependent on individual tastes preferences.<br /><br />And the Tetley works out a lot cheaper, no artificial ingredients, no sugar, no preservatives - compared to the  Tazo Chai.

review/summary: Great for cream and sugar packets
review/text: I have a coffee station set up in my bedroom with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B40 Elite Brewing System</a>. I use this to hold raw sugar packets and shelf stable half and half. I hold my K-cups in this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4TL8E">Keurig K-cup Storage Drawer Coffee Holder for 36 K-cups</a> (note: many are for sale, as always, check for prices and reviews if you are going to buy, I got mine at Bed, Bath and Beyond when they were really expensive here, the price has since come down)<br /><br />Quick Tip: I use a binder clip to keep the expiration date of the cream clipped to the top basket (I tear it from the creamer box). That way I can see quickly and easily if my cream is still good. I came up with this idea the hard way. :(<br /><br />I really like these baskets they are easy to reach into, the front is slightly slanted and there is a cutout in the front, it's not really hand sized, but it's big enough to make it easy to get the contents out. I like that they are mesh because the sugar packets don't fall through. It took me a short time to figure out how the "Unique stackable locking design" worked to attach them, but once I did it was easy to do, and they are not going to come apart unless I take them apart. They are relatively compact, but hold an entire 16oz box/100 raw sugar packets, and 2 /24 count boxes (for a total of 50) Land o Lake mini moos (although I tend to use one box at a time unless I get two with the same date) Mini Moos are a bit smaller than other creamer cups so if you use another brand your results could vary, on the other hand raw sugar packets are bigger than most other kinds of packets, so if you use other brands you should be able to get more in there if you need to.<br /><br />I don't use this for K-cups, but I filled it with them to see how many I could fit. Stuffed to the gills I got 24 in the top. And I mean stuffed, I had them balanced on top, but not so that they would easily fall. I wanted to see if I could get my entire box of 24 in it, because if I WAS using it for K-cups that is how I would use it (that is not how I use it for creamer). I got 18 in the bottom basket. To be fair I looked at the reviews of the other non-mesh baskets that I link to below and the most someone says she got in them was 15-20 The average was 15 so I probably over filled it, but that IS how I would use it, so I am leaving my numbers.<br /><br />I don't think this would be a great K-cup holder for multiple kinds of K-cups unless you are willing to have it not hold very may cups, you are going to need space to move them around and find the one you want. That could explain the difference in my numbers and the other reviewers I suppose. Although I think fishing for your K-cup would be fun, kind of like a claw game every morning with the prize being a cup of coffee. So I guess it just depends on what experience you are looking for... a lot of storage, or some style and fun... Personally I like my Storage Drawer for compact K-cup storage, but if I would have had more room I would have gotten this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UC7CMS">Nifty 54 Coffee Pod Drawer</a> (don't worry it's not for pods) and my drawer. My personal philosophy is "one can never have enough storage" and that thing holds 54 K-Cups in slightly more space than 2 mugs, but it's not as pretty as this.<br /><br />If you are sold on this for K-Cup Storage and you are not going to use it to dispense sugar packets I would suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KRNI0E">Nifty Single Serve Coffee Baskets</a>. They are exactly like this, but they aren't mesh and it is less expensive. Sugar packets will fall through it though.

review/summary: Vitamin Water Grape-Raspberry
review/text: I really like Vitamin Waters.  They make me feel healthy, and keep me from chugging down another soda.  So multiple wins there.  Often they taste quite sugary, but there are quite a few good flavors.  This is one of them, the Grape-Raspberry.<br /><br />The Mega-C, grape-raspberry vitamin water does taste a lot like grape.  In fact, it kind of reminded me of those squeeze grape drinks you drank as a kid, or maybe cool-aid.  I definitely liked it as it added a bit of nostalgia to my day.  Or at least made me think of warm summer days with popsicles and fun at the pool.  The sugar was maybe a little too sugary, but again, that kind of fits with the kids drink profile.  I didn't really taste the raspberry, my guess is that it is overpowered by the grape taste.<br /><br />Vitamin Water is known for it's ingredients.  It isn't organic by any means, but it does have a lot of good ingredients.  The sweeteners are fructose and rebiana.  Which are ok as far as sweeteners go.  There are also natural flavors and some vitamins added in.  Surprisingly, even with some of these ingredients, there are zero calories in this drink.  And no fat or sugars either counted in the nutrition facts.  But there is Vitamin C, some Vitamins B, Zinc and some other vitamins.<br /><br />This is a good workout drink, or water substitute, or other kind of drink substitute.  It tastes good and is reasonably good for you.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: This is absolutely wonderful chile! It has a great flavor unlike most chile powder that is sold in grocery stores that is grown in Mexico.  There is more to chile than heat and while this has a nice bite to it there is also a great flavor which carries thru in whatever you use this for. I'm tossing the store bought brand I have in my pantry and using only this brand from here on out. I gave a bag of this to my sister who lived in New Mexico for a few years and she raved on the flavor as well.  This brand is definitely a 10 out of 10, can't wait to try some of their other products.

review/text: I was not sure if this would leave my food smelling and tasting like potpourri because of the lavender. I was wrong. This is an excellent product that can be used on more than just meats. I used it on fish, chicken and on scrambled eggs. Full of flavor without adding salt. This is a great blend of herbs and spices. I only wish I bought a larger amount before. Getting the large bag with my next order. Highly recommended!

review/text: Excellent "real" coffee taste, unlike many decaf brands.  Great for evening to keep the buzz from bothering sleeping.  Seller shipped in a postal bag and the pak was crushed - like a truck ran over the package and then someone stomped on the package.  No pods were damaged but the box was totally destroyed. NOT nice presentation which would be embarrassing if this was part of a gift to someone.  When I order directly from Melitta, the packaging is perfect.

review/text: Fantastic balsama glaze.  I am an exceptional home chef and have been pricing this item at stores like William Sonoma Sur La Table etc and this is by far the best bang for the buck.  I love this type of white vinegar glaze especially when preparing appetizers like watermelon, goat cheese, balsma, olive oil, and mint.  A darker glaze would take away from the appearance and taste of the salad.  Just love Amazon and all the great items I buy.

review/text: I'd never heard of a white balsamic glaze so I had to try it.  I'm not a gourmet chef by any stretch of the imagination so I'm still trying to figure out how to use it.  Its lighter and milder in taste but still sweet.  So far it has been a salad dressing but come summer I'm sure I'll figure out how to make the most of it!

review/text: I was told that white balsamic vinegar was a nice change in salad dressing. I'm not positive this is what I wanted. It was surprisingly sweet to me. It may be different from white balsamic vinegar because it is a "glaze" . I read other reviews and tried to see if this was what I had wanted. still not sure. I do mix this with olive oil and add seasoning and like the results but I go easy on the glaze as I don't like my salad dressing too sweet. It has a good flavor. If someone could inform me as to if this is the vinegar I wanted, I would appreciate it.

review/summary: No kitchen should be without at least two cartons of this stuff!
review/text: Hands down this is the best beef stock on the market. Forget about Emeril's and Wolfgang Puck<br />or the generic crap you get at the grocery, this is far and away the king of the commercial stocks.<br /><br />A good stock is the key ingredient in soups, marinades, sauces and is used to flavor veggies like<br />mushrooms and rice dishes. This stuff is just perfect for all of the above, especially for making<br />soups like French Onion,  vegetable soup, or chili, or to make the best Bloody Mary you've ever had!<br />It just doesn't get any better. Available locally for between $3-$4.<br /><br />One other thing I like about this product is that it is heart healthy, low sodium, and the entire 32oz.<br />only carries 80 calories with zero fat!

review/summary: Perfect drink on a warm day!
review/text: I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well.

review/summary: OUTSTANDING quality and value!
review/text: I am thoroughly pleased with Blue Buffalo dog food (specifically, the chicken & brown rice recipe for large breed, and large breed senior dogs).<br /><br />I have a 72 pound Black Labrador Retriever (very small for this breed, but still "large") - He is 8 years old, and EVERYONE thinks he's under 4 years of age.. . .. He runs around like a puppy. . .. Full of puppy-like energy and has has the nicest sheen on his coat; he actually looks purple when the sun shines on his fur. All of these great things have happened since switching him from other "premium" dog food brands.<br /><br />At roughly $50.00 a bag, one might be tempted to go with a less expensive brand, but here's my particular take on this - My dog, again at 72 pounds, only goes through 5 bags a year (that's only $250.00 a YEAR!) . . . . Here's why:<br /><br />The conversion rate of this this food is amazing!  With cheaper foods (which contain fillers and binders), a lot of stool is produced.  On Blue Buffalo, I've noticed that my dog's stools are MUCH smaller (better conversion in the digestive tract), and his portions are super small, since his body is actually USING more of the food, not just passing it through. The stool isn't mushy and large. (A lot can be judged about overall health with monitoring your canine's poop)<br /><br />Bottom line:  At $50.00 a bag, I'm saving A LOT over the course of my best friend's life, while giving him what I feel is the best food out there. Portions are so small, that I actually feel guilty when I give him so little at meal time (that's from being conditioned to seeing larger portions when feeding a lesser quality food).  His body and mind are years younger than what the calendar shows. Money saved, since I'm not buying a "cheap" $25.00 bag of dog food every month.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I switched to Blue after the chinese melamine debacle in 2007.  After a lot of research, I decided on Blue for two reasons: their ingredient list, and a phone conversation I had with one of their representatives.  They were very concerned about the melamine issue, and after I made it clear that I was looking for a company that cared about dogs, I was assured that Blue was what I was looking for.  Big deal, right?  They all say that.  However, three days later I got a call from the president of the company, who explained their manufacturing process, named their suppliers and partners, and pretty much convinced me that yes, this company does indeed have my pets' best interests in mind.<br /><br />My German Shepherd was five years old at the time, and was getting about 3 1/2 cups of Iams large breed a day.  I switched her over to Blue Large Breed Adult immediately - I didn't want to risk using any more Iams because they were so heavily involved in the recall - without the recommended gradual introduction.  She had zero problems with the new food, and she seemed to like it a lot more.  We settled on 1 1/2 cups to start with.<br /><br />Here we are five years later, and she still gets the same 1 1/2 cups per day, but since she turned nine she's been getting Large Breed Senior.  Her weight has never gone down.  She's as active at age ten as she was at age five, and people are always surprised to find out she's not a pup.<br /><br />We adopted another GSD shortly after the recalls, and immediately started him on Blue.  We had fostered him for a couple of months some time before, and during that spell he was eating Iams.  All he did was poop.  And the gas!  Ugh.  His digestive tract was so sensitive that we didn't dare give him anything but his nightly kibble; any kind of treat would give him diarrhea.<br /><br />After we formally adopted him and switched him over, his system became much more stable.  No more rumbling, no more loose stool.  Both dogs reduced their stool output significantly, and the vet gushes over the consistency and size of their stool samples as only a vet can.<br /><br />Both dogs have full glossy coats, energy to spare, and their weight doesn't fluctuate.  They both receive high dental grades from the vet - and we don't brush their teeth.  They're fed once a day (of course they get various healthy treats throughout the day too).<br /><br />The short of it is this: canines don't eat corn.  Corn is virtually non-nutritious.  If your dog food has corn in it, you're not only wasting your money but you're upsetting your dog's digestive tract.  Blue might be more expensive than some of the corporate "premium" brands, but it's much more nutritious and calorie-laden, so you can actually save money by feeding less.  Plus, your dog will be healthier.  I was buying a 30-pound bag of Iams every 2-3 weeks for my 65-pound Shepherd.  Now I'm buying a 30-pound bag of Blue every 2-3 weeks, but I've added a 95-pound eating machine to the mix (he gets about 3 cups a day).<br /><br />I'm very happy with Blue Buffalo.  My dogs love it, they're healthier than ever, and the company stands behind their products.

review/summary: House smells better!
review/text: We switched our dog from the Royal Canin large breed senior food to this. Our dog made the switch very easily and I've noticed fewer bowel sounds from him and less odors. The other reviewer was mentioning the portion size; I don't have as much evidence but I haven't been able to reduce the amount of food we're feeding our dog. In fact I recently increased it some because according to the scale at the vet, our dog lost a bit more weight than he should. I've also not noticed any increase in his 'production' so perhaps different dogs react to the food differently. Regardless, the base ingredients are better than other similarly-priced foods. If you're going to feed dry and need to use a mid-range priced food, I think this is the best out there.

Seems odd, as many people have large dogs.<br /><br />I can't say I see any marked improvement using this food over any other, but I feel better using a higher end food for my trusted companion.  We give him one fish oil pill twice daily.  We just plunk it in his bowl and he eats it.  We also give him a Glyco Flex III pill daily.  THAT we saw a marked improvement with.  Amazing actually.  He's an 11 year old Golden Retriever that just won't stop moving, and the glyco flex really helps with his joints.

It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)

review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

review/text: Until trying this salt, I hadn't noticed the "metallic" edge to most of the "table salt" I've used in the past.  Even the "sea" salt had it.  In any case, a worthwhile investment in good taste. :)

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

review/text: We rate this right up with high"er" quality sea salts. It has a strong flavor, but tastes clean. Far better than any typical table salt for sure. I'd rather buy this than kosher salt (we don't use regular iodized salt) for anything you add salt to at the table. For cooking, though, standard kosher salt is preferred by us.

review/summary: SALTY  SALT I HAVE EVER TASTED
review/text: This salt is pink in colour and upon recieveing it I used a tooth pick and dampened the end of the tooth pick and stuck the tip, JUST THE TIP, of the tooth pick into the pink looking salt and tasted it, and WOW! The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Very pretty, but would not buy again
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

review/summary: This salt blows away "Real" salt!
review/text: I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling. Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family! This stuff is the "real" deal unlike Real LOL. Real salt should use as their motto "Hey, just tryin' to keep it real"<br />LOL ...losers

It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...

review/text: With lots of minerals, this salt it actually works well with the body and taste amazing. The plastic bag was strong and the salt was in perfect condition. For over 10 years, Himalayan salt is the only salt we use! This packaging and quality met my expectations and I will order again.
