review/summary: I hate this new packaging
review/text: I love this coffee, but it is now only sold in single servings. I called Nescafe, and they refuse to sell the hazelnut in a canister any longer. This product is over priced at 8.00 dollars more or less, when you consider that there are only 20 servings in the box. I have loved this coffee for 20 years, so the product gets five stars, but the packing gets a zero.

review/summary: Perfect for low-carb dieters and nutrition-minded moms
review/text: At the crucial moment of temptation, when I feel I can't resist a Snickers bar any longer, one pack of these is the most satisfying thing in the world. And my 5-year-old son loves them too, which is great, because I can put these packs into his lunch and know he's getting a nutritious "treat" instead of sugary empty calories.<br /><br />True, these are not for people who hate Splenda. However, I don't find the amount of Splenda excessive. I find it just right. Most importantly, the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted. And I love the tiny portable serving sizes. Yes, I can (and have) portioned the almonds out myself into baggies from the canisters. But the pre-made packs stay much fresher and the portion control is a very attractive feature, so I don't mind buying the packs.

review/summary: Strong taste will require getting use to
review/text: Why I purchased it<br />It was featured on Dr. Oz<br />I am weeding myself off from 600 mg caffeine (daily)<br /><br />Plus<br />Seems reasonably priced<br />Caffeine free<br /><br />Challenge<br />Since the product contains chicory it takes some time getting use to. Very powerful taste and unless you are use to chicory flavor this is not going to taste like coffee. I used it in the expresso machine and it was very dark and rich but had an overpowering smell. Chicory favored coffee is typically found in some coffee brands in the southern US. I am familiar with the taste but it was too overpowering.<br /><br />Recommendation<br />I definitely recommend purchasing the the sample packet first, which is now what I plan to do.<br />So, my rating of 2 out of 5 stars is based solely on the French Roast Espresso Grind taste, not Teeccino products in general.

review/text: Our boy is eleven-months old today. He's now got six teeth (4 uppers, 2 lowers) and we're giving him more and more solid foods. My wife spots items like these Graduates Mini Fruits and just has to try them out. The boy loves them and puts a good effort into chewing them up. The only problem we've had is that if he is given more than one at a time he tries to get all of them in his mouth at once. So far there's been no choking problems, but we worry. In any case, he loves them and the small treat will often quiet him down when he's cranky.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful for Skin & Body Care
review/text: I bought this product not for consumption purposes, but on the recommendation of several women who - like me - are going through some pretty drastic skin/body/hair changes due to pregnancy.  This is my first pregnancy, and I was completely unprepared for the dry skin, the patches of flakiness and itching, and how it can even make your scalp dry and flaky.  Well, almost everyone knows about Palmer's, but I absolutely loathe the smell of cocoa butter.  I decided to give this product a try, and the main reason I chose it over others is that it's the ONLY one that (besides being organic and cold-pressed) comes in a glass container versus plastic.  Well, I have to say, it's amazing.  My skin absorbs it almost immediately, and it leaves me looking glowing and healthy - not oily or shiny.  I don't smell strongly of coconut, either.  The scent is very light, which is perfect for pregnant women whose sense of smell is on overdrive.  The oil doesn't have to be heated in any way to be used as a lotion: scooping a bit on your fingers and rubbing between your palms provides enough heat to make it easily spreadable.  And using it on your hair: wow!!!  My scalp stopped flaking and my hair has a lovely sheen without being greasy.  My hair has always been what I considered one of my best features, but I have to admit, running my hands through my hair after applying the oil to my body - just that little bit - really makes a difference.  Try this oil out for yourself, you will not be dissapointed.

review/text: I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: The best tortilla chips I have ever eaten!!
review/text: I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

review/summary: WRONG FLAVOR - got Country BBQ instead of Chili Chipotle
review/text: I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.

review/summary: Plocky's Rice and Beans Tortilla Chips
review/text: I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.

review/text: These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day.

review/text: The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.

review/text: These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.

review/text: We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice,which we really. really love, was out of stock.  After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Perfect tortilla chip goodness!
review/text: My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!

review/text: I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12.

review/text: "Yeast Extract" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing "No MSG" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities.

This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.

review/summary: Just like I remember
review/text: I've had this brand panforte several times over the years, and the order from amazon did not disappoint.  It was the usual consistency, hard and chewy, but not too hard that it hurts your teeth.  The nuts seemed fresh, and the mixture of sweet and spices seemed just right, not overly sweet.  For those who have never tried panforte before, think of a compressed fruitcake, but with a little more orange peel spice type flavor, and not as sweet and sticky, although I'm sure it contains plenty of sugar, and is in fact coated in powdered sugar.

review/text: I question whether this item was truly produced by the makers of Frosty...pkg. arrived with one bottle half frozen and only half full.  Although the bottles said Frosty, they all had generic gold caps and the 'root beer' was VERY light in color.  When opened the beverages were flat and had no carbonation.  I only purchased from Amazon because the local Rural King only sold individual bottles and they were to be a gift.  Will have to go back to Rural King and buy 12 to put in the shipping box these came in, as they are a 'non returnable' item.  Do not recommend and will not buy again.

review/text: This is a great Root Beer which we've served at parties and lots of kids and adults liked it.  Another reviewer questioned whether Amazon sold fake Frosty because it had gold caps and not the Frosty emblem.  We've bought this in a grocery store, and sometimes it comes with gold caps, so that's not a valid complaint.

review/summary: Best salad dressing ever
review/text: Heinz Salad Cream has the most divine slightly sweet, slightly mustardy flavor.  Tomatoes don't taste the same without it.  It's also great on green salad and green vegetables such as broccoli.  This is a childhood favorite of mine and very difficult to obtain in the US - but I'm hooked!

review/summary: Unusual for Gun Powder Green tea
review/text: My first cup of this fine tea was a surprise.  Most of the Gun Powder Green teas I have tried and consumed have been rather light in flavor.  The tea has a heavier, more robust flavor, much akin to Oolong tea, without the darker blend of tea.<br /><br />If you like Gun Powder green tea, I suggest you at least try some of this as a headier brew!

review/summary: Great Tasting Tea!
review/text: This is a great tasting tea!  The longer it steeps the stronger it gets.  If you don't allow it to steep for at least 3 to 5 minutes you may think it's weak; but not so, you just need to start with very hot water, add a level teaspon (or less) let it steep a few minutes (occassionally stirring) and those little pellets will rehydrate with a robust flavor!  It's amazing to see the volume of the leaves after it's finished steeping when you started out with just a small compressed teaspoon of leaves.  Very good flavor and a little goes a long way!  Enjoy!!

review/summary: Nutmegs were great!
review/text: Finding small bottles of nutmeg meant specialty stores and expense -- a couple of ounces of nutmeg for many dollars.  This Christmas, a nutmeg grinder was a gift given to all the ladies in my family -- one just as my mother hung in her kitchen -- along with fresh nutmeg.  I paid less for this pound of nutmeg, split it between our girls in small jelly jars for a fraction of the small bottle cost.  We've already tasted the added flavor in a variety of dishes. Nothing compares to the fresh grating.

review/summary: Opened package and insufficient weight
review/text: The package of Nutmeg arrived not from this vendor but a 3rd party vendor.  The package came in an unmarked open plastic bag and the weight of the product was not 1 lb.  Since this is a food item it can not be used and has to be considered tampered with.  The price is reasonable, but at the moment the product can not be used.  I will not buy anything else from this vendor until this issue is resolved.  I will try to get my money refunded or an untampered and properly labeled product as a replacement.  This just arrived today and I can not use this for catering as it violates servsafe rules regarding the use of unmarked product.

review/text: I used to buy this stuff by the case when we lived in a small town that didn't carry it in the local grocery store. Now that we've moved, I buy it 4 or 5 bottles at a time because we use it on everything. It has a great flavor, it's hot, but not too hot! I have a cheese dip recipe that calls for a bit of ketchup for a tangy tomato flavor, and I use this instead. A couple others call for Tobasco and I prefer to use Salsa Brava.<br /><br />Salsa Brava is as much a staple in the Southern Kitchen as a case of Rotel!

Been using this brand for years and it's what I prefer, and everybody that I have forced to use it when I cook have loved it as well.  I do want to make a strong point to and about Mexgrocer who shipped the first of many orders to me.  Received the order in a couple days and the packing was perfect.  So many places just toss things in a box and by the time we get it it's damaged, but these bottles were wrapped so well I have to comment on the job well done, including the hand written thank you on the packing slip.  My hats off to Mexgrocer and there staff.  Thank you for having pride in the job you do for others.  This is rare these days but we notice, even if most do not mention it.<br />We Thank You.

The colors are not as bright as they used to be.  The pieces have gotten larger, perhaps to make up for their lack of taste (?).  Nope, this is definitively not 'candy I ate as a kid.'

review/summary: Terrible cookie and overpriced
review/text: Absolutely some of the worse cookies I've ever had, and I'm sort of a cookie monster.<br /><br />The texture was dry and brittle, crumbling into pieces.  Sealed in a tin with wax paper, they should have been soft and moist.  This indicates one of a poor recipe, poor ingredients, or left out far too long before packaging.<br /><br />Even with a poor texture, one could tolerate it with good flavor.  Unfortunately, the flavor was abysmal.<br /><br />With poor texture and poor flavor, these cookies are inedible.  I threw the entire tin in the garbage, and I almost never throw food away.<br /><br />Coupled with the high price and very high shipping charge, I just had to write a review, and this is my first one.  Best to skip this item and save your money and your stomach.

review/summary: Plugra Simply the Best
review/text: Plugra Clarified Unsalted Butter has been on my radar for the past year or so. Finally its back in supply in the 5# bucket. Ordered and received within days and already in use. I baked a loaf of bread using this product and it was remarkable. Other clarified butters that I've used in the interim have all had a good taste but simply did not stand up to Plugra. Easy to use and it doesn't require refrigeration. However, be cautioned - with this amount, unless you use it regularly, you should refrigerate. One way around this is to keep about a pound or so on the counter. That way its always softened and at the ready, then scoop out an amount as necessary. Taste is rich, buttery and remains in a softened state on the counter. It works really well with making bread dough as it provides the proper consistency when kneading.<br /><br />Upon arrival there was a problem - however Parthenon Foods contacted me first thing Monday morning and explained that they included a small gel pack to be on the safe side for long distances such as mine. Their rep was very courteous, non condescending and a real pleasure to work with. I will not hesitate to reorder.

review/summary: Excellent travel food
review/text: We live in California, so I'm always looking for food for road trips (and for the earthquake kit). These are spectacular.<br /><br />Each 10-inch-long package contains ten wafers, in two layers of five. The wafers are three-ply (two layers of filling, and three layers of cracker), and bigger than you'd expect. Two make a reasonable light snack (according to the package, 140 calories worth). They're sweet, but not cloying (more cocoa than chocolate), and satisfyingly crispy. They sog up quickly when dunked, though, so I'd have the tea as a chaser, not mixed in.<br /><br />The package is not glued paper - it's heat-sealed polypropylene plastic sheet, and thus water- and bug-proof. The "best by" date indicates the wafers keep about a year (unopened). Not quite an MRE, but fine for civilian traveling.
