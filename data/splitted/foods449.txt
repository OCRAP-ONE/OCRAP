review/text: Head Country is, hands down, the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  It's not overly thick and has a "runnier" texture than most but it is simply the best!  Even good as a dip for french fries.  I bought it at Walmart when I lived in Oklahoma and now have to purchase it online, but it's worth it.

review/text: I've been buying ribeye steaks at a nation-wide store which will remain nameless.  A steak is a steak, right?<br /><br />Hubby was dying to try Omaha steaks, so I bought him a box as a present.<br /><br />I cooked up two steaks - both ribeyes, one Omaha and the other from the store.  I cooked them both with steak dust, for the same time and the same temperature.<br /><br />The Omaha steak was like butter.  The difference was so obvious.  I can't believe that both steaks came from the same species.<br /><br />This is now a once-a-week dinner in our house.  It's not cheap, but it's still less than going out.  Add to the steak the Omaha stuffed potatoes and a nice salad and you've got a dinner that's every bit as nice as the average restaurant.<br /><br />Yeah.  They're worth it.

review/text: My first concern was the condition the meat would arrive in. No problem. It came in a tightly wrapped container solidly frozen. The steaks were beautiful and delicious. Nicely marbled a good size. I would do this again. We also ordered the BBQ package at the same time. It was equally as good.

review/summary: Oh my God!
review/text: In my humble life, I have found only a handful of highly addictive snacks that appeals to a vegan diet. Most are products that no longer exist, always leaving me feeling like I was the only one in the world who loved that product. Here has arrived the latest and greatest snack in the entire world. I could eat these day in and day out and not feel an iota of guilt. These are by far the tastiest macaroons I have ever had. The ingredients are pure and simple. I kid you not, this is a product from the heavens above. If you like coconut, this is YOUR moment! Support this company and buy them often so as to guarantee they are on the shelves for many years to come! I have had the chocolate flavored macaroons as well and I do prefer these as the coconut hits the spot like no other!

review/summary: Literally the best thing I've had in ages ....
review/text: The price on Amazon is a lot higher than my local store (even excluding shipping). That said, if you live in a remote area where you can't get these, I'd still fork out the extra money. Yes, they are that good. Unlike a lot of items that don't have a tremendous amount of sugar, these taste sweet and melt in your mouth. They taste what a real treat/cookie should taste like, not some weird cardboard knock off. I've got grain allergies, so I'm always on the look out for products that I can have. I will be stocking my shelf with this product for sure.<br /><br />And also to boot, my husband who is super picky about what he eats AND mostly eats only super mainstream food, loved them. So in short "normal" people will love them, not just health nuts or us with allergies.

review/summary: Delicious but not really raw
review/text: These are absolutely melt in your mouth fantastic and taste exceptionally fresh (at least the batch I received), but I was disappointed that they are not really Raw by definition of Raw Foodists.  The front of the package says "Raw Vegan Gluten Free" but the back lists the ingredients "Organic Shredded Coconut, Organic Maple Syrup (! Cannot be raw of course), Natural Raw Almond Flour, Organic Raw Coconut Oil, Pure Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and Sea Salt" and then places an asterisk next to every ingredient except the Sea Salt and the Organic Raw Coconut Oil.....the asterisk is "* This Ingredient is not raw" (!)  ....  and of course the almond flour is further defined as "pasteurized however the oils within remain raw."  How can they label it raw and then put a disclaimer that 4 of the 6 simple ingredients are not raw?  By that logic I can call a lot of dishes raw.  It is a delicious healthy snack in moderation, but it is not a raw snack.  I will be researching all the macaroon brands now to determine if any have all raw ingredients....if someone knows the answer, looking forward to your comment.  I just feel better and younger and stay healthier with as much Raw Food as possible.  Guess I'll be in the kitchen preparing a bit more myself which is better anyhow.

They are rich and decadent and make a wonderful dessert. In fact, they are so incredibly freakin' good that I could eat way more than the serving size of two cookies. I can't wait to try the chocolate varitey!  Mmmm, coconut macaroons, you are my new best friend.

review/summary: There are hardly words to describe the deliciousness
review/text: Wow.<br /><br />These are wonderful.  Not just wonderful in the special diet kind of way (because you've forgotten what the "real" version tasted like).  These are truly delicious.  Including my macaroon consumption pre-special diet, Hail Merry's blondies are absolutely the best.<br /><br />My diet is grain-free among other things.  Almond flour is often used as a grain substitute in baking, but I usually do not like it.  I don't care for almonds, either.  If I hadn't seen almond flour on the label myself I never would have guessed it as an ingredient.  It blends perfectly with the coconut, vanilla, and maple.  The texture is just right and the size and shape of the macaroons are adorable to boot!<br /><br />I wish each pack had a few more macaroons, but then again . . . I might be at a greater risk for eating more.  I find these to be rich and satisfying.  A serving is two cookies but one is enough, at least for me.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying more of Hail Merry's products!

review/summary: I have to say, it is what is cracked up to be.
review/text: I've been making and eating rice throughout my entire life of 43 years now.  I've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything I like in my Zojirushi and Cuckoo rice makers.  Recently, I got interested in making authentic Spanish Paellas.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  Real Spanish saffron, Spanish Chorizo, and Spanish Paprika are rare and expensive items even in Los Angeles California.  Rabbit isn't easy to find either.  Nevertheless, I went through with the program and decided to build and authentic Paella.  After watching a plethora of YouTube videos, Pau Gasol on local TV, two episodes of Tyler's Ultimate, and one episode of Good Eats, I felt I had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />One thing the Spaniards stress: You can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure Saffron, (2) Calisparra Bomba from Valencia, (3) real smoky-hot Paprika from Spain, (4) Good extra-virgin olive oil.  You also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel Paella.  These are quite inexpensive.  I got a fully legit one from Valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  I also gathered that I should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />To make a long story short I purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  Chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  They called it the Rolls Royce of Rice.  They said it was unbeatable.  I was more than skeptical.  I have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and I've tried a lot of different types.  They're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />According to the poop-sheets, Bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. It's hard to overcook.  I've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  All of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  All sources said 3:1 when you use Bomba.  Bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />To make a long story short, I made my first authentic Spanish Paella 2 days ago.  It blew my brains out, and I don't say that lightly.  I've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  This was like a revelation from God.  I can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like Alton Brown, Tyler Florence, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  It's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />Bomba is delicious rice.  I've eaten a lot of rice, but this one is making me forget about the rest.

review/summary: My Favorite Hot Drink
review/text: This is my first venture into the "spice" teas, but it has become my favorite hot drink. I like it strong, so I place two of the double bags into my cup. I sweeten it with a new product called Truvia. Truvia is made from stevia, which is commonly referred to as nature's sweetleaf. Truvia can be bought online at Truvia.com and supposedly will make its way into the supermarkets this coming summer. I rated it four stars because I have no other spice tea to compare it to, so I'll reserve my 5 stars should I encounter another spice tea that beats this one without having to pay an outrageous price for it.

review/summary: Real fruit taste, no preservatives.
review/text: Real fruit taste and no food coloring or preservatives (no syrups, no processed sugar), just red raspberries, pomegranate, concentrated grape juice and fruit pectin.<br /><br />The texture of this delightful conserve is different from jam or marmalade, not as thick, more like between jelly and jam, and the flavor is fruitier. You can definitely taste the raspberries and pomegranate.<br /><br />A very good choice for those with a sweet tooth who don't want or can't eat highly processed sugars.<br /><br />Great product from France.<br /><br />BTW, this vendor is offering a very good deal on the six pack (about 4.99 each s/h included). I hope it lasts!

review/summary: Puffed Pig Ears Keep Dog Happy
review/text: These puffed pigs ears are one of my dogs favorite treats. I am not sure of the healthiness of them (although I read they contain less oil and fat than normal pigs ears) so we keep them to a once in a while treat, but they keep our 7 month old Labrador busy for a good 45 minutes (no small feat). She drools when she sees the package!

review/summary: Spoiled cat...but he loves it
review/text: My sweetheart, Ansel, is a very spoiled Bengal cat. He does love this for his wet food. He hates most other wet foods. The pate ones he will not even touch. This is just real meat with a little bit of broth, but not like a gravy.  As far as my part, I like it because it's not a lot of filler and junk. He will eat the other foods, but then he horks them up, so what's the point? My only issue, and I did not dock stars because it's not the product...but I used to be able to get this at a really decent price on subscribe & save. Now the price is so high [really. a dollar thirty nine each?] I can get them at Walmart cheaper, usually a dollar twenty four.  If I watch my sale flyers, I can get them for a dollar sometimes and I stock up cuz a buck a piece maeks kittymama happee! kthxbai.

I get 3 different kinds ,chicken,salmon, and shrimp and bass and rotate every third day start back at the first kind. There are 10 per package which is 30 for  the month. You can skip a month or sometimes I change one of them. If you want love and the tail up high showing they are happy get yours today and get the monthly shipping it is cheaper and free delivery.

review/summary: Never seen a cat that didn't like Fancy Feast Appetizers!
review/text: My cats LOVE Fancy Feast Appetizers and their favorite flavors are chicken, chicken and beef and chicken and tuna. It is great for kitties with a poor appetite because they all seem to like this and will eat it when they are turning their noses up at other stuff. This has also been good for my CRF kitty because of the limited ingredients and almost no additives which is a lot less for her little kidneys to process. It also has a high water content which is good for her, too.<br /><br />This is also good for cats with suspected food allergies because the ingredients are so limited. Please note that because these are not filled with extra supplements, it is not considered a "whole" food. But cats do not eat supplements in the wild so I think it is perfectly fine for them to have this and you can supplement it with other canned or dry foods so they can have a more well balanced diet. That is what I do.<br /><br />I hope they never quit making the Appetizers because my kitties like them more than just about anything I have ever purchased. I get this on Subscribe and Save so that I save even more and do not have to remember to pick it up from the store.

review/text: I have always been mildly amused by those that drank coffee.  My take was it was always "fake coffee" at best.<br /><br />I've since become a believer in various, quite good decaf blends.  There are some bad ones out there, so don't get frustrated trying them.  I recommend this and the Tully's decaf.  Both hold their aroma and are flavorful, without the bitterness.<br /><br />BTW, I'm also a fan of the Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain and the Blueberry blend (a different surprise in your coffee brew)

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....

review/summary: Very artificial flavor
review/text: I was looking forward to this flavor. I don't tend to like a very strong brew, but a nice light coffee flavor with a touch a vanilla is something I enjoy. This coffee was awful. The coffee reminded me of cheap Folgers with some international delights creamer thrown in. Typically that grosses me out, it's so artificial tasting and that is what I got with this. Glad it was just one in a variety pack and I didn't have money wasted. I think I'll stick to a good regular brew and add my own vanilla.

review/text: This is now my new favorite K-cup flavor!  Anytime I see chocolate raspberry truffle flavored coffee beans I buy some since it is sometimes hard to find.  I was sooo excited to see a k-cup with this flavor.  It did not disappoint!  You can definitely smell it when it brews too.  I do add sweetener, which may not be everyone's taste, but to me it makes the coffee taste like I'm eating a real raspberry flavored chocolate truffle.  It is now my favorite afternoon treat/pick me up.

review/summary: Not my favorite-  syrup artificial flavor
review/text: I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like.

review/text: This is a rich and indulgent cup of coffee, yet not overwhelming with strong artificial flavor as so many other are.  I have purchased many flavors and then don't want to finish the box, not so with this one.  It is definitely not my morning coffe, but rather the type you come home and brew after you've smelled and resisted a local Starbucks!  The main flavor is velvety rich coffee, with strong hints of raspberry and chocolate perfectly blended in.  I strongly recommend a "cozy-up" with a cup of this and a good book :)

review/summary: A good flavored coffee
review/text: The name sounded great - chocolate raspberry truffle - but would it taste as good as it sounds? Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE 2011-01-03: I don't like this as much as I use too... it's not bad, but I'm just not "excited" about the flavor as much anymore. Plus I find it leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not "wanting" it in the morning, instead preferring to desire mostly unflavored coffees - like "Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast)", which is really good... so I'm reducing my rating to 4 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.

I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup, along with a bold coffee, I get the desired flavor that I enjoy.  For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor, the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent. Thank you.

This seems to be a "hit-or-miss" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the "Large Cup" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I've tried so many K-cups. The greatest problem I have with K-cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a "strong" cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K-cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However, I'm so glad I found this vanilla k-cup. I can actually taste the vanilla and coffee in my cup of coffee with this k-cup. I enjoyed my sample of this so much that I bought 2 boxes of 48ct in addition to the Hazelnut. I hope the Hazelnut is just as good.
