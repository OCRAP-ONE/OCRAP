review/summary: Yuck! Really Gross sauce & with 900 MG sodium per serving!
review/text: My sister told me she liked this Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe.  Guess that should have caused me to not try it as she is really addicted to salt.<br /><br />Wow! It is really awful.  I followed directions and tasted it.  YUCK!!!  Horrible and WAY OVER SALTED.  Then I checked ingredients and found it has 900 MG sodium per each serving. GROSS!  The entire thing got dumped. Trash the only place for it.

review/summary: Love these for air travel
review/text: I have to keep a few of these stuffed in my diaper bag at all times!  In general I love the pouches for easy on the go food for baby, but the Just Pears are especially nice since they are light in color (dribbles don't stain her clothes) and they are small enough to go through airport security in a quart zipper bag.  (The larger pouches can also go through security, but you have to declare the baby food and they sometimes test each and every pouch that's over the 3.5 oz amount)  Thus, these are my favorites for air travel.  Oh, and my daughter loves the taste too!

review/summary: Great for when I can't make food for baby
review/text: I saw these pouches at the store a few weeks before our baby was 6 months old, was intrigued by the concept, and picked up a few to try when the time came to introduce solids.<br /><br />I make about half of our now-7 month old's food at home but as a busy working mom I sometimes run out of frozen cubes and don't have time to make more before she wants to eat, so we keep a small stock of commercial baby food on hand.  Organic food for our children is important to us, and we choose not to purchase Gerber products.  We like the Earth's Best brand of jarred food but it is heavy, inconvenient, and potentially dangerous to haul glass jars around in a diaper bag for meals on the go.  Plum Organics is just now starting to be carried in local stores and we're glad we tried the brand.<br /><br />I've sampled from the pouches of Pears, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KYM9YS">Plum Organics Just Fruit, Apples, 3.17-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KYIX0C">Plum Organics Just Fruit, Mangos, 3.17-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> and found all three fruits to have excellent fresh flavor.  Right now she eats about a half of a pouch mixed with some baby oatmeal.  It's easy to squeeze the desired portion and then just close the pouch and put it in the fridge until the next day; there is no need to try to spoon food out into a bowl as with jarred baby food.<br /><br />We are going on vacation when she'll be 10 months old and plan to bring plenty of Plum Organics pouches to feed her while we're gone, since we won't have the ability to bring homemade food.

review/text: These  Mission tortilla strips are made with Lime-treated corn, salt and either cotton seed, corn, or palm oil.<br /><br />I don't particularly care for them.  Unlike the Mission rounds and 'triangles' these chips are thick and the bag I'm currently crunching on taste pasty and not very corn-y.  In fact, while they crunch, they lack that crispness you get with a really good chip.<br /><br />Thick chips might be okay for recipes, but I can't recommend them unless you plan to pile on some really zippy dip.  Just au-naturel, this bag is bland.

review/summary: Very crisp
review/text: We just had one of these for the first time.<br /><br />The corn is more crisp than most microwave bagged popcorn.<br /><br />Because it's still on the cob, it doesn't flower out as much, rather it's a little more dense.<br /><br />The kernel skin seemed less tough and I didn't get any stuck in my gums.<br /><br />About 80% popped, which is pretty good.<br /><br />This is organic, and comes from Kansas.<br /><br />It's a little pricey, but what with the recent reports of slightly higher rates of organ failure from GMO corn, and falsified research data from some GMO corn producers, it's nice to see a tasty, organic alternitive.

I was thrilled to see that I could get it through Amazon because I couldn't find it in any other stores.  I have ordered this item several times and am never dissappointed.  You have to add your own salt and butter - but I think that makes it taste even better and you can adjust how healthy you want to keep it.

review/text: If you want a conversation item for a gathering then popcorn cobs may suffice. Everyone seems to find it interesting and fun but when it is time to eat the popcorn people have different taste and not everyone seems to like this popcorn. My sister likes it a lot, but then she likes hot air popcorn. While the flavor is good the popcorn is too dry for my enjoyment.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a conversation starter with very good corn taste, but if you don't like hot air popcorn then you may not like this. Even though I don't like it I give it 4 starts because others I know do like it very much.

You can't tell if you are getting eight of what is described (which is already 8 and would therefore be 64) or just 1 of what is described. It seems to vary by item. I thought the price seemed very high for eight cobs of corn, and very low for 64.  Turns out it's high.  Disappointing.

review/text: I ordered this and one other meat sampler from New Braunfels Smokehouse as a gift and a thank you for friends of mine.  I live in New Braunfels and have eaten at the Smokehouse many a times (old location and new) food is always good so I knew this would be perfect gift for some fellow New Braunfelers that had moved north to Ft. Worth.  I ordered this through Amazon on a Saturday evening.  I knew shipping would not take too long since staying in Texas.  I got the response that package would be delivered between Thursday and Saturday of that next week.  I later found out that they were heading out of town because of a family reunion and were planning on leaving Thursday evening.  Crossing my fingers hoping that it would arrive Thursday.  Tuesday morning got the text from Amazon that my packaged had been shipped.  Ok all sounds good but they had moved up day of leaving to Wednesday evening.  Panic...  Got the text Wednesday afternoon package was delivered.  Woo.  Called friend he was just fixing to leave house and they pulled up with it.  He said it was well packaged and all contents looked good.  He would let us know how well everything was after his trip and commented that was the perfect gift for they were RV camping from Wed to Sunday and the variety would be great.  After his trip was done he said he had just one link left and everything tasted good just as they remember.  Thanks New Braunfels Smokehouse.  Job well done.  :)

review/summary: Worth a try.
review/text: As an American, I was curious about this spread that the British like so much.  It's expensive here, both for the product itself and shipping costs, although you could save a little by ordering in bulk.  I decided I could afford one jar.<br /><br />No, you don't either have to love it or hate it; I just like it.  It does kind of grow on you, and is probably better the fifth time you try it than the first.  Very, very, salty, but I like salty things.  Other than that, the flavor is vaguely reminiscent of something, but it would be hard to say what; the point is that it's not actually a *strange* taste.  It's also one of those unusual foods that tastes better than it smells, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />I'll finish off this 125g jar, mostly on my morning toast.  After that, if it ever became available in my regular grocery at, say $2 to $3 a jar, I'd definitely keep some in the house, but mail order prices are a bit too much to make a habit of it.  I'm not blaming distributors for charging what they do for imported food, it's just a matter of how much it's worth to me.<br /><br />[EDIT] I have to edit this one more time, as I've unfortunately developed a Marmite addiction.  I said this is better the fifth time than the first.  By the time I finished the jar, it had become a habit.  One local grocery store does have this, $6.99 for a 125g jar, but at least there's no sales tax on groceries in this state.  And I've found an online source which is only $6.40 a jar, including shipping, if I buy in quantities of 6.

review/summary: A Yankee's take on a British staple
review/text: Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them "adverts"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as "Umami". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.

review/summary: Marmite, how I love thee
review/text: Even if you grow up with Marmite like I did, you either like it or you don't. If you don't care for salty food this is not for you. Marmite has a yeasty, beer-like flavour and a slightly bitter aftertaste, but is a salty flavour explosion in your mouth. If you have a big mouthful it's seriously overwhelming, but spread on toast with cheese it becomes something delicious and thoroughly yummy.<br /><br />I have not been able to convert my American husband yet, although I do have him eating salty black liquorice, so we'll get there eventually. I took a jar of Marmite, some crackers and cheese to work with me and had anybody brave enough taste some. All of my colleagues (Texans, the lot) liked it except for one lady who made a face. She has no tact, so for all I know all the rest secretly hated it but was being polite.<br /><br />If you end up with a jar of Marmite and find yourself to not be a big fan of Marmite on bread, try adding some to soup broth. It's vegetarian friendly, and a nice way to introduce a new flavour to your veggie only fare.<br /><br />I can not sing the praises of this delicious black goop enough - to be fair though, if it came to a choice between Marmite and Bovril, I'd go for Bovril every time.

review/text: I had been reading about Marmite, and decided to give it a try. I love trying foods from the UK, and since Marmite is known to taste yeasty, I was especially interested. Since being diagnosed as gluten intolerant a few years ago, one thing I miss is the taste of yeasty bread. I find if I toast a slice of gluten free bread and put a light layer of Marmite on, followed by sunflower seed butter, it takes like fresh baked sourdough bread. I love this stuff and am now finishing my second jar.

review/text: I am an addict to salty fatty snacks.  I LOVE this stuff.  I bought the 125g jar. I've had it for about a week and it's almost half gone.  Tonight I went on to order 6 more jars.  I might gift one or two of them, but I'm not sure.  I love this so much I may just keep it all for myself.  If you love salty snacks, you might as well get some concentrated  B vitamins to go along with your treat.  The taste reminds me of the Fon that is in the bottom of your skillet when you saute meat or vegetables.  Did I mention that I LOVE this stuff?

review/summary: I LOVE Marmite!
review/text: I can't really add much to the other positive reviews, but I'll give it a go.<br /><br />I am an American, and I love Marmite!  If used correctly, it is wonderful.  Don't think this is like jam or peanut butter, it's not - use Marmite sparingly, and you'll be well rewarded!<br /><br />I spread it on sandwiches (turkey, roast beef, etc..), on sliced cheese and crackers, in soups, and even as an addition to home made salad dressing.  The savoury possibilities are endless!<br /><br />Also, some might benefit from giving it more than one chance.  If you don't like it at first taste, try it again on something else.  You may find yourself falling in love!

review/text: Marmite, so they say, is something you either love or hate.  I love it and I'm suspicious of anyone who doesn't like it.  What's their problem?  Even people who do like it fall into two camps - those who spread it thin, and those who spread it thick.  What's the point of thin?  You might as well not bother.  Thick is best.  I like the way it tastes like magical burning salt and makes your mouth hurt when you eat too much of it.

review/summary: Make room for Marmite and Vegemite in your cupboard!
review/text: I come from the Vegemite school. I took a fairly quick path from disgust to craving the singular goodness that is Vegemite. I heard that Marmite was better so I thought I'd try it. For those like me who are Vegemite fans but have not tried Marmite, here is a quick comparison: Vegemite is darker (it looks like a dark chocolate) and it's a firm paste that more or less holds its shape in the can. My Marmite, which I will assume represents Marmite at large, is a viscous fluid, like a thick caramel topping, and lighter in color. Where Vegemite is quite pungent when you smell it in the can, Marmite is relatively mild. It evoked quite a range of comparisons from my family, one saying it smelled like toast, another comparing the smell to "soup", but all generally finding the smell appealing. The same can not be said of Vegemite. Yeah, it's not a scientific sample by any means but that's our story. Marmite and Vegemite both have a terrific yeasty, salty taste, but Marmite wins, for me, in the smell category, and it seems to have a little less "bite", which could be seen as a plus or a minus. I'm not sure what I think about the different consistencies. Marmite is perhaps a little easier to spread.<br /><br />I still like Vegemite and expect I always will, but given the choice in a side-by-side, I think I'd go for the Marmite. Hey, there's room in my cupboard, so why not have both?

review/text: I've been watching a lot of British TV on Netflix lately.  Show after show mentions Marmite lovingly.  I had to know what all the talk was about.  It's possible that the talk is because the British all joke about how bad it tastes.  They put this stuff on their toast so, I was expecting jelly or "marm"alade.  Hokey smokes some cultural sensibilities are different!  We like you, Britain; glad the Queen has 60 years under her belt and everything.  We're glad Marmite is working out well for you but, Americans apparently left for a reason.

review/summary: Tart, salty and savory
review/text: I bought some of this at the Vitamin Cottage after hearing so much about its infamous taste. I think it's too bitter and chalky but the savory aftertaste isnt bad. It tastes like chewing a chlorine tablet and then adding some soy sauce while you chew. It's also very salty as in dumping a salt shaker in your mouth!! It definitely tastes like it's healthy for you if you get my drift. My friend was with me when I was unloading groceries and I had her taste a little dip on a saltine cracker and after eating one bite she subsequently tossed it down the disposal. Well at least it's healthy, albeit nasty tasting, so at least I'm not chucking fatty trash down my gullet when I'm using it up!

review/summary: Awful Taste!
review/text: I bought this product after reading about the benefits of it from "First Magazine for Women." I picked it up at Whole Foods for $5.99 and a total waste of money. The magazine touted it as good for weight loss, because the protein would fill you up and it had a lot of  B vitamins. The article said it was good spread on toast. Well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter. You could never spread enough on toast to be filling, because of the awful after taste of bitterness. Also, it is so expensive, you would have to buy a couple of jars a week if you did use it on a daily basis. The taste is like eating a combo of a bunch of anchovies and beef jerky. If you have to watch your sodium, you do not want this. I will not be buying it again.

review/summary: Deliciously Crunchy
review/text: I first fell in love with the Leonidas chocolates while in Belgium and now I finally found them online. If I was in New York, you would probably find me at the Manon Cafe in the winter sipping hot chocolates. In the summer, I'd be at the Leonidas' store buying gourmet chocolates. After savoring chocolates in Europe, Africa and America - these are the best chocolates I have ever tasted.<br /><br />The crunchy chocolate squares were a real surprise and I love how delicate the crunch is when encased in a burst of delicious chocolate.<br /><br />You may also enjoy the Mint chocolates. They are delicious after dinner or anytime you want to wake up your taste buds. The mint flavor bursts from these chocolates as if it was encased in little sugar crystals. It is quite perfect and refreshing.<br /><br />I also love the Cinnamon and Orange. If you have been dreaming of the most delicious orange flavored chocolates in the world, you have to try the Orange Napolitains. I love both equally, although the cinnamon flavor has me completely seduced.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own.<br /><br />Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Mint Chocolate Oblivion. The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the best cinnamon you have ever tasted with the silkiest creamiest Belgian chocolate in the world.<br /><br />If you wish to try all the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead.

review/summary: Metallic Taste is the Deal Breaker
review/text: Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues.

review/summary: Minor's Chicken & Beef Bases-Far Superior to Canned Broth & Cubes
review/text: I first found Minor's bases at BJ's and quickly decided to chuck buying canned chicken broth and beef broth and boullion cubes. It's cheaper than canned, too, if you can find a local source. In using these to make recipes, I add the appropriate amount of base for the amount of water or liquid called for and do not add any salt called for by the recipe until the very end, when it can be added to taste. I note the amount of salt added and record it for future use.  This is especially applicable in recipes calling for boullion cubes (horribly salty usually).<br /><br />Of late, in talking with restaurant owners, I learned Minor bases are what many restaurants use.  The base keeps in the refrigerator seemingly forever.  Search the internet for sources or, better yet, ask your local restaurants if they use it and where they get their supplies locally.<br /><br />I also use them in cooking rice, not adding salt, as does another reviewer.

It adds a complexity to pot-roast [1/2 bottle of bad red wine added to the pot helps] and beef gravies.  Add to gravy made with beef base and demi-glace for something really good to pour over a steak.<br /><br />As for service: 1 hour after placing my order there was a knock on the door and here was my soupbase, hand delivered -- though they _are_, I found out, just around the corner.  That's hard to beat.

review/text: I have been using Minor's for many years now, getting it at my local BJ's Warehouse for only about $6 for the 16 oz. size (sorry Amazon).  I use it for many things, not only making soup stock.  It is the most useful ingredient I have ever had.  Sometimes when they have a sale, I get some ahead and freeze it.  In the fridge, it keeps for months, never losing quality.  You can adjust the amount of sodium in your dish by how much you use (yes, it's high in sodium for preservation purposes and flavor).  It's amazing what you can do with Minors, noodles or pasta, fresh vegetables and whatever leftover meat you have, for a very quick, tasty soup anytime.  This product has saved me much money over the years, and I love it!

I asked her to bring it in this is what is included in the ingredients:  Hydrolyzed (corn and wheat gluten, soy) Proteins, and Yeast Extract.<br /><br />Sure they don't put Monosodium Glutamate in their concoction, but hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extracts contain high levels of free glutamates. This is the same stuff that can cause headaches, muscle contractions, chest pain, mood swings, and insomnia in many people. The Truth in Labeling people have been arguing about this for years.  If you look at the picture, there is a asterisk next to "No Added MSG*". In the fine print they say: "*Other than that which naturally occurs in the hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract".  The truth is they put this crap in there to increase the glutamate content.<br /><br />So while I recommend that we all eliminate our intake of MSG, those of you that are already doing so, don't get duped by the labeling.<br /><br />For more information see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173309">In Bad Taste: The Msg Symptom Complex : How Monosodium Glutamate Is a Major Cause of Treatable and Preventable Illnesses, Such As Headaches, Asthma, Epilepsy, heart</a><br /><br />and: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173252">Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills</a><br />this review was originally posted on my website.

review/summary: Not happy
review/text: Although this is my favorite chicken stock base, I was very disappointed in this product. It cost almost as much to ship as it cost to purchase, then it arrived with the bottom of the container split apart in several places, and more than 1/4 of the product gone as a result. In addition, the packaging did not contain any traces of the product, so it was broken and missing product before it was packaged. I will not be purchasing anything like this via this methodology again.

review/summary: xylitol crystals
review/text: As everybody knows by now, xylitol tastes a lot like sugar, just a little sweeter.  It cannot be absorbed by the cavity causing bacteria in ones mouth so they ingest it and die.  It is the only really "safe" form of sugar, and can be Mixed with aspartame to become a sugar substitute with fewer calories and no risk of dental davities.  It cooks up great, no one else can tell when they eat it that it's healthy for them.  My teenagers think they are getting a treat and I'm watching out for their medical and dental health.

review/summary: Natural Balance Synergy a life saver for us!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:06 Mins<br /><br /></span>The Natural Balance Synergy line was a life saver for our 10 week old Boxer Male.  I'm a huge fan and recorded this review to tell our story.<br /><br />Our Boxer had issues with intensive vomiting.  They started at the breeder and when he came home with us, he was throwing up 3-12 times per day.  Everywhere.  A clueless vet put us on a prescription dog food that turned out to be poor quality and I finally made the switch to this product.  His issues stopped on the first day he was on this food and haven't come back.  It's a God send and I can't say enough good about it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AN7PG0">Natural Balance Synergy Formula Ultra Premium Dog Food, 28-Pound Bag</a>

Both love it and although it is pricey, as other reviewers have said, they fill up more quickly and eat less of this food than many of the cheaper products.  It is cleared up their digestive issues (we were able ready to give up for our old female who constantly had tummy issues) and they love it.  Their coats are beautiful - shiny and full, even our old female looks great.  We're sold on this food.

The children were so surprised and excited to find these Giant Peppermint Sticks.  Will definitely order again.

They are the best tasting sticks I have ever had and are much easier to unwrap than the smaller candy canes.  I am about to order more, even though they won't make it for Christmas.  We will do more p-stick ice cream for New Year's Eve.  Happy holidays!

review/text: I bought this cheese to make a Greek Spinach Pie. The first review on this product was slightly discouraging, but the price was great and I wasn't going to eat it uncooked. So I decided to get it. The cheese came nicely packed, it was still cold because of many ice packs it was surrounded with.Because of the first review, I was expecting it to smell bad. I was pleasantly surprised, that the cheese smelled like a nice fresh cheese and nothing else! It tasted wonderful, I ate most of it fresh, without cooking. My spinach pie came out outrageous. My husband loved it ( even though he's not a big fan of spinach). I'll definitely buy this cheese again and again!

Since I ordered the shelled pistachios, I was a bit worried they might taste stale, but quite the opposite, they were fresh and so much easier to eat than having to put up with shells all over the place.  Because they provide Vitamin E, eating a small amount every day is a great way to get a treat and know it's healthy too.

review/summary: The only kind I'll be buying from now on!
review/text: First off, this is very intense, just a step or two up from baking chocolate in taste,  with  the same texture as Lindt 80% cocoa bars. That's something I never thought I'd find in sugar free! It's so strong , that a smaller amount is more satisfying. If you can't get your chocolate dark enough, this is it! YUM!<br /><br />The only down side? That bag of sugar-free Dove just lost its appeal! Here's hoping that more flavors join the  line (pssst- how about mint?)

review/summary: New Flavors Review
review/text: These new flavors are awesome! I went back and bought several more canisters because the display said it was for a temporary time only. My teenaged boys even like them.  I went to buy more, and the store no longer has them!  I need to have a steady supply of these.  They are all refreshing and sugar-free, so no guilt!  I guess I might be stuck ordering on line from now on.  I can't believe more peeps aren't asking for these flavors to be permanent!

review/summary: yuck
review/text: Sorry to say but this is not to my households taste.To be honest it does take somewhat like a Margarita  but perhaps one that has been sitting around after the party is way over.

review/summary: Tastes a lot like Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix
review/text: Margarita mix is expensive and usually laden with calories (well, alcohol is too!).  I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but when I do, I almost always order Mojitos or Sour Apple martinis.  I love the taste of them and thus the alcohol taste isn't overpowering for me.<br /><br />Therefore I was delighted to discover these new Crystal Light mocktails in my local grocery store (about three bucks a canister), marked as temporarily available.  The Crystal Light Margarita mix tastes just like Jose Cuervo Margarita mix to me, even the slight salty tang.  My husband wasn't as much a fan.  This one and the Mojito are so good all on their own and I love them.  The Appletini is a bit too much like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy, so I only like that one in small doses.  They are obviously not as syrupy-thick as real Margarita mix, but that's a plus to me.  It's very refreshing on a hot summer day.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes 2 quarts.  An 8 oz glass of this is a no-guilt 5 calories.  It's great both as an option for non-drinkers and to add alcohol too if you wish.<br /><br />I went back to the grocery store and they no longer have these, so this is the only place I know to get them now.<br /><br />UPDATE: this is the response I got from Kraft when asking if these would be available.<br />We are delighted to hear of your interest in our CRYSTAL LIGHT Mocktail Powdered Soft Drink Mix. As you may already know, this product is only being manufactured and distributed for a limited period of time. For that reason, we are unable to provide any additional information on the stores that may still have the product in stock.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LJ04">Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.<br />Margaritas are my guilty pleasure. Crystal light margarita flavor is ghastly. Much too sweet, not enough lime flavor. Smells funny too . I might have to add tequila, salt and lime to make it palatable. Bought two packages because I like all the other crystal light I have tasted. Bleh

review/summary: It's OK, but to be great.......
review/text: ...double the recipe and add 4 fresh-sqeezed limes to the mix. Now we're talkin'! It's very tangy (which you want since it'll be served on-the-rocks, which dilutes it). I've made this multiple times using this recipe and it blows the socks off my friends and neighbors. I realize that this isn't the original recipe but it's worth it if you don't want all that corn syrup and sugars/carbs/calories that many of those Marg. mixes have.<br /><br />Try this and you'll never go back to Jose C. mix again!
