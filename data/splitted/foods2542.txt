review/summary: The perfect snack
review/text: My kids (2 yrs old) can't get enough of these rice cakes. I love that they are the perfect size for little hands, fit easily in snack cups for on-the-go snacking, are not messy, and one bag is the perfect amount for my two toddlers to share. These are a lifesaver when we need a quick, healthy snack!

review/text: My children (ages 4 and 7) devour these pouches! They love all flavors of the Happy Tot Plus pouches, especially the Kale Apple Mango. Yes, Kale! I know, right?! Who would have ever thought? But they do love it and it makes me happy to know they're eating a snack that is organic, high in protein, vegan, non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, and with no added sugar!

review/summary: Very tasty rice cake!
review/text: My 15 month old son loves these! They are a great healthy crunchy snack. I enjoy eating these as well, they are much tastier than regular rice cakes. The carrot adds a sweetness to it so it doesn't taste too bland.  They dissolve very easily in the mouth so I would feel fine feeding them to a younger baby that was use to eating solids. They are a great size for little hands as well. I also love the fact that they are gluten free!

review/summary: Great Crunchy Snack!
review/text: I love crunchy foods and I am always looking for an alternative to yucky potato chips! I love these Happy Munchies Rice Cakes. They are the perfect size and with just a touch of sweetness and crunchiness...yummy! I have no guilt having a bag of these in one sitting. My kids love them too who are ages 6 and 9! We love to bring them to the park and on hikes in the mountains. I highly recommend this product! 5 stars for sure!

review/text: I have been searching for some time now for a Ramen to replace the Union Foods "Smack Cup" which was tasty but is no longer made. This one comes pretty close. It has a decent taste and texture and is not overly spicy. Oddly enough, cooking it in the microwave smells like you're boiling a batch of rubber bands. Get past that though and it's a good lunch soup with about half the sodium of that famous brand canned chicken noodle.

Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.

review/summary: My Babies Liked This One Right Away
review/text: I tested this one on my twin 10-month old babies and they liked it immediately.  It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.<br /><br />I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  It's good to keep several flavor brands around too I think, to give your baby a variety.  I'm sure I'll get another case when this one is finished.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Finely Ground Beef, Organic Spinach, Organic Garbanzo Bean Flour, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Durum Wheat Flour. CONTAINS: WHEAT.<br /><br />This has 110 calories, 31% protein, 100% vitamin A, 8% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 4% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: rotten, moldy food = health risk
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained Chicken Apple Compote Dinner. It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky.<br />One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick.<br />I'll never buy anything from Earth's Best again!

review/text: Yes I read the other reviews. And given the review dates and my other experiences with Earth's Best I was not too concerned that the problems mentioned would still be an issue. And they were not.<br /><br />We have tried almost all of the gourmet line of Earth's Best and these are great for adding protein to your little one's (LO) diet. Google the Earth Best's website for complete nutrition info. Most 2nd stage food have between 2 and 3 grams of protein a serving. This one has 5grams of protein and only 2 grams of sugars. Our LO likes the taste and we like the ingridients and nutrition profile. Recommended.

review/summary: Some broken jars
review/text: When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.

review/summary: Delicious product, poor quality control
review/text: We had the same issue with this product. Half the flat was improperly sealed, and resulted in an expired food issue.  But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up & turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these "bad" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to break.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Our baby did love this meal though - it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods.

I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.

But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: Had No Problem.  They Like This One a Lot
review/text: I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.

review/text: The other reviews are very outdated & old. We never had any issues with the quality of this product. My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth's best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it.

review/summary: Small Jars and a Little Runny - like most commercial baby foods
review/text: Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much "fuller", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!

review/text: The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended.

I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the "subscribe and save" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first.

review/text: My daughter loves this!  She is picky so she doesn't always eat as many healthy foods as she should.  This flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs.  It is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months.

review/text: Earth's Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods, but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food.  Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff (it looks gritty).  He normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food...turning his head after a couple of bites.

review/text: When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.

review/summary: Just divine!
review/text: I ordered a box of these from Butler and made our first meal with them last night.  I rehydrated them per the package directions with 4 1/2 cups warm water with about a 1/2 cup BBQ sauce, for flavor, stirred in for 10 minutes.  Then I drained them, carefully pressing out the excess water.  Moved them to a pan and simmered with remaining BBQ sauce (what was left from the bottle - about 3/4 cup) for about 20 minutes.  Served them on crusty hoagies.  YUM!  The texture was SPOT ON.<br /><br />These are the best vegan meat replacement I've had since becoming vegetarian.  If I had to say one negative about this product, it would be that they are pretty sauce/seasoning dependent (so you really need to get your sauce/seasoning right!). My normally picky vegetarian teen had two servings!  These are definitely going to be a staple in our house!

review/text: Since my roommate brought home a bag of these, they've been eaten nearly daily in our house! They've got a great texture and can satisfy a meat eater without being so overly meat-like which might bother some vegans and vegetarians. We use them in stir-fry and fajitas, but I'm sure you could toss them in just about any recipe that would call for something meaty. We use Better Than Bullion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N7YKQK">No Chicken Base</a> in the water and the curls soak the flavor right in to them. They're great. They're loved and eaten by the two vegans in our household AND by all of the meat-eating family and friends we have over!

review/summary: Real food, good taste, good tooth
review/text: These were quite a surprise to me. They are very useful in many vegetarian dishes, as all by themselves they have a good tooth--satisfying texture, and a definite flavor. They kind of do "taste like chicken," only in that they have a good flavor that is a bit nutty, a bit savory. I have used them in place of TVP in recipes that call for that, by grinding them in a food processor. They are also good whole.<br /><br />And best of all, unlike TVP and other kinds of highly processed soy products, these are a whole food. They are the whole soybean, not a milled, defatted, extruded, overcooked product. They steam and roll the whole bean (a process somewhat like that which produces rolled oats), so you get everything, not an isolated component from the bean.

review/summary: Best meat analog out there
review/text: I took a chance and bought 6 bags of these, and I was not disappointed!  I really like tofu and mostly like tempeh and seitan (depends on the preparation), but soy curls are most definitely my favorite "fake meat."  They are easy to prepare and can be used in a variety of recipes - from soups to tacos and fajitas to curries.  One the easiest and tastiest ways to prepare them is to reconstitute them (10 minutes), drain them, and then dump into a crock pot along with your favorite BBQ sauce.  4 hours later, you have amazing "pulled pork" that you can serve up on a bun or over rice.  When I made them this way, a few of my kids asked if I was *sure* they weren't eating meat.  :)  The texture is just right, and since they don't have much flavor on their own, they don't compete with the flavors you pair with them (as I find seitan does, for example).<br /><br />I honestly can't imagine anyone not liking soy curls.  They are just amazing!

The best food find of the year for me.

review/text: The product description says: "Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange."<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/summary: Contains Yeast Extract
review/text: Not only does the taste of this nacho cheese leave something to be desired,(I purchased a recommended brand along with this one for comparison) but it also contains yeast extract. In short yeast extract is a substance the food industry has turned to in light of the consumer response to MSG. Like MSG yeast extract also contains free glutamic acid. I have a sensitive metabolism and will usually develop an allergic reaction to most of the unsavory chemicals that appear in processed food. I sampled half a serving of this cheese and sure enough I had the same response to MSG (the recommended brand of nacho cheese I purchased along with this one did not produce the same results and tastes better too, it does not contain yeast extract).

review/text: Perhaps it is because I had low expectations but I did enjoy the mix. It was convenient and low in sodium. Other mixes add way too much salt. I'd also suggest adding fruits like dried blueberries and a pinch of cinnamon and vanilla to the mix. I think the dash of spice helps enhance the flavor. As for texture, I used a griddle and the result was light and fluffy pancakes. If you want.need even more rise though, just fold in a whipped egg white.

review/text: I tried this despite the poor reviews because I really miss pancakes and with the low cost, thought, what the heck. But I took one bite and had to throw it away. I thought it would have a nice sugary flavor but it just tasted gross. I can't even describe it. Synthetic, maybe? Also, the serving sizes they list on the box are a joke. For example, the box says that 1/4 of mix with 3 tbs of water will make four pancakes. Maybe four nickel-size pancakes. MAYBE. I had to use a whole cup--which probably left only about a cup left in the entire boxI--just to get a pancake a little bigger than a saucer. know this is cheap but do yourself a favor and save your money. Just search online for recipe and do it yourself (you can buy zero sodium baking powder and lower sodium salt).

review/summary: NOT A LOW CARBOHYDRATE FOOD
review/text: I might have missed the nutrtional information, but just as a warning to other - this is not a low carb food.  One serving has over 30 grams of carbohydrate.  Even if you subtract the 11 grams of sugar alcohol and 1 gram of fibre, you're still in the 20 gram range for each serving.  I'm not sure what the point of this product is, but if you are trying to find food for a low carb diet, this is not your product.<br /><br />I can't rate the taste or ease of preparation as we're not going to eat it.  Because, you know, even though it says it is sugar-free, it still has over 20 grams of carbs per serving!!!!

review/summary: Great Deal for Fair Trade
review/text: If what you're looking for is the most organic sugar for your buck, then you'll want to look elsewhere.  Whole Food's has bulk organic sugar for around ~$1.60/lb.  And by 'bulk,' I don't mean like Sam's Club or Costco's.  You scoop/pour the sugar into your own jar (tagged and pre-measured at customer service) or a bag there.<br /><br />If you're looking to help your fellow man out a little more, than this isn't too bad once in a while but it's steep increase at ~$2.80/lb.  This is in contrast to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E9WB8G">Wholesome Sweeteners Fair Trade Organic Sugar, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>, which is the same exact product but around ~3.56/lb, and at best (with Subscribe/Save) $~3.03/lb.<br /><br />To be completely fair, there have been arguments made against Fair Trade and whether or not it truly helps the struggling farmers that it markets itself as protecting.  I won't link out to anything specific but you can Google "Fair Trade Debate" and find a good amount of criticism against it.<br /><br />I like to think that it does help.<br /><br />But I also won't pretend that I don't also get the standard organic sugar in bulk.

Their brown sugar is also corn and gluten free. Only draw back is the shipping.  Try getting the smaller packs or getting Amazon prime if your going to use this regularly.  That may save you cause the price for the product is right but the shipping is tough. As with any recommendation any manufacture can change what they do.  I hope these guys don't but I as a responsible corn and gluten victum would say double check with the manufacture about this product before you buy as of Christmas 2010 it was corn and gluten free.

review/summary: Good Ti Kuan Yin
review/text: This is good Ti Kuan Yin (Oolong) tea. It's well packed, and the leaves are clean. It's not in the league of the truly select Ti Kuan Yin teas out there. It's a bit more subdued on the palate, and doesn't have the deep, earthy aroma that the very best of the variety have.<br /><br />Still, I give it 4 stars. 1) Because it's a pleasant tea, easy to drink daily. 2) The price, especially considering that it's organically grown, is terrific.  It's a great value!<br /><br />I doubt that it's "slimming" at all.  If you want to get slim, eat less and move around more!  But it's a nice tea, if you enjoy Oolong.

review/summary: A delightful, gently flavored oolong
review/text: Please understand: I'm NOT expert on the varieties of Oolongs but this is my ordinary favorite -- delicious, satisfying, always.<br /><br />I gave up drinking coffees about 35 years ago when news reports said scientific studies (since refuted) showed that people who drank more than 5 cups of coffee a day had double the risk of heart attacks.  Because my coffee intake at the time qualified me for 2X double, I switched to teas.<br /><br />For many of these years, I've loved many loose leaf tea varieties (I HATE tea bag/tea container teas)--especially various estate Darjeelings, Keemuns, occasionally Lapsang Souchongs, often Assams when I wanted a 5 hr. energy boost, more often Gunpowders, Oolongs.  But over the ensuing decades, my preference has gradually drifted to teas with less (theobromines) kick -- to especially the Keemun, Oolongs, and green gunpowders.<br /><br />Over those years, I bought all my loose leaf teas from Murchies in Canada. Only recently, since the Murchies company has changed hands, have I bought from other sources.<br /><br />I AM well pleased with THIS Oolong. It's as good as any I've ever had from Murchies.

review/summary: Excellent Earl Grey tea
review/text: I've been drinking tea in the morning for over 30 years.  Taylors of Harrogate Tea is just about the best I've tasted thus far.  The tea itself is flavorful and the bergamot flavoring is strong enough but not overwhelming (and made with real oil of bergamot).  I recently had to buy Twinings Earl Grey when I ran out of the Taylors and was pretty amazed by the difference.  Twinings doesn't claim to use real oil of bergamot and you can taste the difference, it tastes like fake lemon flavor and the background flavor of the tea itself is pretty bland.  I have to say that not much compares to the quality of the Taylors of Harrogate tea.

review/summary: Mild
review/text: Two interesting diametrically opposed viewpoints below. One likes Taylor's the other Twinnings. I can't weigh in on that because if I had Twinnings before it didn't make much of an impression on me. Another reviewer somewhere said that Taylor's didn't have enough Earl Grey taste.<br /><br />I've had a lot of Taylor's Earl Grey and it is a mild tea. Right now I'm drinking a very strong Earl Grey and the bergamot overshadows the tea. So if you want a mild Earl Grey, Taylor's is the one you want.<br /><br />You should never buy a tea just for it's brand nor for it's price. Once I bought the most expensive Earl Grey I could find, and it wasn't better than a cheaper one. Having said that, don't buy a cheapo Earl Grey that's made from bad/poor tea leaves, so you should stick with something reputable.<br /><br />The one I'm drinking now is a loose leaf organic Earl Grey from Whole Foods. My wallet thanks me because it's not expensive (it's loose leaf), my body thanks me because it's organic (probably fertilized with poop rather than commercial fertizer), my conscience thanks me because it's probably free trade/living wage, my thrifty subconscious thanks me because it's a lot of bergamot for the price, and my eco-snobbery is appeased because I shopped at Whole Foods.<br /><br />However, Taylor's EG is not bad. I've had many Taylor's teas, don't like many of them, love some of them, but I think Taylor is a reputable company and produces good quality teas.<br /><br />I echo two comments from the other reviewers.<br /><br />1) This is a really good deal if you like it. Low price and free shipping. If you've previously bought a can of the stuff, you can use the empty tin can to hold a small amount and keep the rest in a cool dark place.<br /><br />2) You better try and like this first before buying a kilo of it.<br /><br />Good drinking!

review/summary: Twinings may still be  better
review/text: I thought I would try the Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey Tea and I purchased the 35.3 ounce bag. To my mind, and I have been drinking tea for<br /><br />35 years, the product is just fair. In fact, today I ordered 500 grams(16 ounces) of Twinings Earl Grey and 125 grams of Twinings Lady Earl Grey. To some extent these will be a replacement in the morning for the Harrogate. I guess this means I am putting my money where my mouth is.<br /><br />Twinings is more famous, and to be honest, you might like the taste of this standard brand tea better.<br /><br />Also, I like the German brand, Messer, Old English Tea, Earl Grey.  However, it is very difficult to get this in America. I usually have friends from Germany bring me this or I ship it to myself in the summer.<br /><br />One of the best of all is the French Fauchon Earl Grey tea, but at $13.50 a tin (125 grams), this is a little expensive for my needs.<br /><br />My suggestion is not that you should not purchase the Taylor's tea. I think only that you should purchase a little tin first and compare the taste with Twinings Earl Grey before ordering 2 pounds of the product.

I'd have given it 5 stars were it not for the poor packaging by Amazon.<br /><br />After the first shipment I blamed the tea for having too much small "dust" fall through a high quality infuser basket.  Then the second shipment arrived (Subscribe and Save is a a great deal) and I found the outer box too large, with not enough padding to prevent the 1kg tea bag from moving around freely - so the tea breaks in shipping.

review/summary: Very Good Earl Grey!!!
review/text: We very much like Earl Grey tea.  We have usually consumed Twinings brand, but recently tried Taylors of Harrogate, mostly due to the very good price and the fact that it came in a kilo, not lots of little cans...  On first opening the bag, we found the bergamot scent to be almost overwhelming.  We were amazed at the freshness, but thought it might be too strong for our liking.  During the first cup, we were still undecided, but after many cups over more than a week, we like it!  Very much!  The scent has dissipated slightly and this tea brews into a very smooth, pleasant cup of Earl Grey.  We like it more and more as the days pass.  The quality of the tea, itself, seems far superior to Twinings, which we've noticed seems to be of lower quality the past year or two.  We will be ordering this tea again!

review/summary: Half the price of xanthan gum.  Works really well.
review/text: If you are new to gluten-free baking, you should be aware that you only need 1 teaspoon of this binder to each cup of gluten-free flour.  That means that if you were to buy this in this volume, and you are baking for one person, you would never use it up before it went bad.<br /><br />On the flip side, if you are cooking gluten-free for a family, this is a bargain, not for the price, but for the availability:  guar gum can be hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Guar gum itself is a bargain for another reason: guar gum is 1/3 the price of xanthan gum, and yet it's one of the standard binders, xanthan gum and pre-gel starch being the others. (For those of you less familiar with gluten-free baking, you have to have a binder, kind of like an extra required flour, to make up for the lack of gluten.)<br /><br />Finally, hats off to Bob's Red Mill for selling this cheaply and in bulk.  The celiac community is somewhat hostage to vendors who sell what they can eat--and there are those who take advantage of that.  Selling guar gum at this price is another example of Bob's Red Mill having integrity.  Yay!

review/summary: Rainbow Mentos saved my life!
review/text: After enjoying these while in France this summer, I could not find any way to purchase them in the United States, until now!  Having these multi-flavored droplets of delight delivered to my door has enhanced my quality of life all around.  I eat 2 rolls a day, and look forward to buying more cases in the near future!

review/summary: Great way to order Gushers
review/text: We can never find this Blue raspberry flavor in local stores and my kids love it.<br />This is a convenient way to order and the price was comparable to bricks and mortar stores.  With teens, a six pack box is considered a single serving, so they won't last long.

review/summary: Odd Flavor Choice, But Strangly Good - Recommended
review/text: When I first noticed that the sample box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> (provided to me by the manufacturer for review) contained "Himalayan Sea Salt", I thought that it was a very odd choice for a jelly bean flavor, but it turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. My family enjoys different sea salts, so we were familiar with the taste before getting them in this jelly bean form, and can say that these are spot on. While not a flavor everyone is going to enjoy, the more adventurous may want to give these a try.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Best Green Tea - Ever!
review/text: My first Bigelow tea was Plantation Mint. I absolutely love it and it was the tea that got the rest of my family drinking less soda and more tea. Green tea has many benefits, everybody pretty much knows this, but I always found them to be too bland, or grassy, or overflavored with other things - until I tried Bigelow's Green Tea with Lemon. It is perfect. Fresh, crisp, quenching. I prefer tea iced with a little splenda added, and this one and Plantation Mint are so delicious. I'm a convert. I can't imagine ever drinking another brand, and I've tried several.

review/summary: Light, just right, flavor
review/text: I expected something a bit heavier when I purchased this tea, but was surprised by the light flavor that the tea actually has.  I suppose I expected the heaviness due to the caramel in the name, and how caramel tends to be a heavy food.  But the caramel is the one flavor I cannot really taste in the brew. I actually prefer light bodied teas, so expectations were low when I made the purchase, but the Caramel Apple Rooibus is now one of my favorites of all time from The Republic of Tea.<br /><br />P.S.  To add to the experience, the tea aroma is very bold and not unlike a fresh pouch of apple flavored pipe tobacco.  The aroma is actually the only loud aspect of the brewed drink, and makes non tea drinkers in the office very curious about this tea drinking experience.

review/summary: CARAMEL APPLE RED TEA
review/text: This is really good - very slight apple/caramel flavor, at first I didn't taste any at all, not too strong to make the drink cloying (I was afraid I would get tired of it quickly if it was too strongly flavored). I love the aroma in the house. I was also afraid if I boiled it for ten minutes like I normally do for rooibos it would mess up the flavor - but it didn't. I don't know if it was worth the price I paid ($12.95 for one can), but it wasn't a disappointment. Does seem to add a little something extra to Rooibos, which is naturally a mild tasting drink.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: After reading all the reviews I was looking forward to trying this tea out. I loved the Peppermint Chocolate Rooibos, so I figured this would be just as good. I was wrong. The smell is that of a strong cough syrup, like Robitussin. The taste isn't any better. It certainly didn't have any notes of caramel or apple. Just a very chemical, fake taste. I will be throwing this away. Overall, just very disappointed in this tea.

review/summary: A Delight
review/text: We picked up this Caramel Apple Red Tea sampler at Shapiro's, not being sure what to expect. I personally don't like much of anything with Carmel in it. Initially, the aroma of the dry tincture was not that pleasing. After adding 6 oz. of hot water and waiting 5 minutes to steep, my wife and I were both stunned by the taste. It has a full bodied essence that enraptures all the papilla in one unifying chorus of "Take another sip, please". I proceeded to order this canister from Amazon. We find Republic Tea exceptional over most any other brand we have tried. At least 10 to 20% better in almost every case.
