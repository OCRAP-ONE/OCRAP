review/summary: My 9 month old daughter threw these up!
review/text: These should have an age limit. I do not think that breast fed babies under one should be allowed to eat these. Babies do not need probiotics at such a young age. My daughter ate about 5 of these and a couple of hours later projectile vomited all over the place! She does not spit up ever. I wished that I would have bought just one bag of these before I bought a whole lot of them!<br /><br />I think she will like them when she is a little older and used to eating other foods. She is mostly breast fed and eats some solids.

review/summary: Artificial Ingredients Ruin This Item
review/text: We discovered banana ketchup on our honeymoon to St. Lucia in 2004. We love it and have been purchasing it for seven years, and never in that time has it contained food coloring or sodium benzoate. However, the four bottles I just received contain both. We are allergic to these items and the ketchup is unconsumable by us. The ingredients were listed as "Product Features-Water, banana pulp,Sugar,Venigar [sic],Tomato paste spices". I am disappointed to have received a product that was other than what was described.

review/text: I tried this stuff when I was on vacation in the Caribbean.  I am so happy that I was able to find it.  It is good on eggs, pasta, fries, burgers, tortilla chips, grilled anything and fruit too.  I ended up getting several bottles and it was a good thing because when I took it to work to have my co-workers try it, they all wanted a bottle.  YYYUUUMMM!!!  It has a great spicy (not hot)taste to it with a sweet finish.  If you like banans you will definately love this.  If you don't like tomato ketchup this is a great alternative. ENJOY!!!

review/summary: At least I can say I tried it.
review/text: I'm interested in trying new things, especially when they sound completely different, so when I heard of banana ketchup I had to do it. I don't really know what I was expecting, but it is exactly what it sounds like. If you don't want to pay more than the product is worth in shipping just to sample it, try putting regular tomato ketchup on a banana. If that sounds like your thing, you'll probably love banana ketchup. If not... well... at least you can say you tried it too.

review/summary: Banana Ketchup. It's not just tomatos anymore.
review/text: I have a story about banana ketchup. I was in St. Lucia in April 2011 where I was served Banana Ketchup with a sandwich. Never having heard of such a recipe I was reluctant to try it. However, wanting to show my "wild side" at age 71 I helped myself to a serving of it on my sandwich. I was amazed to find that I like it very much. It is spicy, doesn't taste like banana in any distinct way. I bought an $8.00 bottle to bring home. When packing to come back to the US I forgot the 3 ounces in a zip bag rule, and put my ketchup into my carry-on for safe-keeping. You know the rest. It was confiscated and destroyed at the airport. Later, at home, I was "haunted" by my missing bottle of banana ketchup, so I naturally went to Amazon on my computer and sure enough, found Baron Banana Ketchup available. I am now on my 6th bottle, having given away 2 of my 6 purchases so far. I will keep a spare bottle in stock at all times now. I'm "hooked". Try it. I triple dog dare 'ya.  Marcie F.

review/summary: Delicious, And Cheaper Than Therapy!
review/text: Speaking as an obese and troubled man, I don't get many pleasures in my life. But one that I can always count on, even when everything else seems to be falling apart, is the delicious and juicy taste of an Albanese gummy bear. When my wife left me for reasons that I shan't go into in this review (suffice to say the gummies had NOTHING to do with it) who was there to comfort me? Certainly not my daughter, Sheila, who went off to college nearly a decade ago and doesn't even have time to send her FATHER a Christmas card. But Albanese was there. Albanese is always there, right on my doorstep, and every month 20-pound packages of gummies are stacked to shoulder-height.<br /><br />And so I ate. I ate and I ate and I ate through the night, tears soaking and moistening the sticky gummi mountain I had carefully crafted and was now laying upon, naked. That night I learned something, as my vision began to waver and my intestines began pumping a thin, painful stool through my body while diabetes ravaged my vital organs: these bears never stopped tasting good. Haribo bears, while having their own charm, really can't put the misery of two wasted decades out of your mind like Albanese can. And while the generic Wal-Mart brand gummies are cheap, I believe they have been proven to be carcinogenic when consumed with the vigor and volume that I enjoy.<br /><br />Yes, Albanese is truly the Gummi King. Five stars all around. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I can feel a lone gummy still lodged in a fold of skin near my waist.

review/summary: Best Gummi Bears ... for serious...
review/text: Gummi bears are my stress relief.  I like to bite their heads off.  I'm not weird.  At least not exceptionally weird...  I just like the way the texture feels as I rip them to little fruity bits.  It is an excellent stress reliever that has kept me sane through two graduate programs.<br /><br />These gummis are, without a doubt, the BEST I have ever eaten.  Their texture is not similar to Brach's or Haribo or off brands... these are somewhat softer, fluffier, and more filling/satisfying.  Other gummis never filled me up, I kept wanting more and more.  That's not a good thing.  With these Albanese bears, I literally ate half a serving size and stopped.  My need to rip off gummi bear heads while tasting fake fruit was completely satiated... and that's something I've never experienced before now.<br /><br />I originally bought these to make chocolate dipped gummi bears as gifts but now, I think I'll gift the large bags as is to a few select folks who deserve this sort of luxury in their mouths.  I really hope everyone will give these a try.  For what it's worth, they aren't without fault... I wish they didn't have the artificial flavors/colors.  It doesn't bother me that their number one ingredient is corn syrup but I know that might bother some people.  Let's face it, though, if you're in the market for 20 lbs of gummi bears, it's unlikely you're a complete stickler for nutrition.

review/text: I had my doubts. It was a fools quest to start with really, what man in the right state of mind has a need for so much? An exercise in hedonism I suppose, but no one in the office said no. Maybe it was some sort of guilty pleasure we all knowingly undertook, hoping that at least one other person, someone, would say no. If only they had said no... In the end we ate 20 pounds of delicious gummy bear goodness. And even though I can't speak for everyone... I have no regrets.

review/summary: Delicious cookie that satisfies cravings for sweets
review/text: Going Gluten Free has caused the elimination of many favorite treats. Discovering this cookie has provided one great treat that is very satisfying and enjoyable. These cookies taste every bit as good as Grandmas or any of the other popular pink cookies. They are pretty large, very tasty and we love them. One cookie in the package weighs 5.7oz. This might vary slightly since they are hand frosted.<br /><br />While they are Gluten Free, they are not fat and calorie free. Here are the notes from the info label:<br />Servings per container: 2; Calories: 300; Calories from Fat: 120<br />Total Fat: 14g; Saturated Fat 7g; Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol: 25mg<br />Sodium: 190mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 43g; Dietary Fiber 1g; Sugars 23g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />At 600 calories per cookie you can see why they taste so good, so we eat them only as occasional treats in moderation. We buy a box full, or at least several at a time since they are so popular with the family. Everyone loves them, this is a treat both Gluten Free and non Gluten Free eaters will enjoy. Trust me, these will get eaten quickly!<br /><br />5 stars for a wonderful Gluten Free cookie treat

review/summary: Fly paper is fun!
review/text: We do not have fly problems where we live. But I bought the fly paper because of the potential for comedic situations. The first use I cut the paper is 8" lengths and placed them outside of my front door. And although I got a laugh out of it, the mailman was not amused, and now I get the privilege of picking my mail up at the post office. Not to be deterred the next time I put the strips inside of my front door, and I invited my mother-in-law over. As she stepped inside  she started stepping the strips, you never heard so much cursing in your life. But then my wife got all pissed off, and the next thing you know my mother-in-law falls down and breaks her hip. I guessed I should have stopped laughing at this point. Now that I am single again I take the strips to the mall, and drop them about, and hide from a safe distance. You know, I probably should have done this in the first place. It's good clean fun to watch peoples reactions to stepping into the sticky mess!

review/summary: Versatile, unique, salt free, and so much more...
review/text: My spice drawer looks like an advertisement for a high end spice store you may have heard of, but I do have a few choice spices that I still love from other companies. This is one of my favorite spices. Like other reviews have said, it is not extremely potent, nor is it spicy, but if you like to cook from scratch and add lots of different spices to your food, this is a great complimentary spice to almost anything. It works well in pasta sauce, chicken dishes, soup, beef, and so many other things. It is more of an herb blend than a garlic/onion blend, which is nice if you like to add fresh garlic and onions or have more potent garlic/onion powder separately. The other nice feature is that it doesn't contain any salt, so if you are looking to add additional flavor to already salty items like canned soup or a box of mac n' cheese this works great. A few of the spice blends I like to use already contain salt and the fact that I can use this spice in combination with them without creating an overly salty dish is wonderful. I do think you can use a much larger quantity of this spice than many others. I wasn't sure just how much I liked this spice until I ran out and my local market stopped carrying it. My lasagna tasted different, even though this was the only spice missing, and I started to notice that all my dishes tasted a little different. Now that I have my spice back I'm so happy. The subscribe and save is a great price, especially for three bottles with free shipping.

review/summary: Sadly disappointed
review/text: I purchased this pecan butter for a dear friend, who loves pecans and loves peanut butter - so I thought this would be a great treat for her.  Sadly, this pecan butter is way too "oily".  We've both eaten 'natural' nut butters before, so are aware of the separation that occurs between the nut butter & the oils, but this butter has an excess of oil in it.  No amount of stirring/mixing helped, it remained excessively oily in appearance, texture and taste.  Even after being refrigerated overnight, the butter remained extremely soft, almost runny, & very oily throughout.<br /><br />  My poor friend tried her best to "like" it, to avoid hurting my feelings, but once she brought the tub by my house & showed it to me & let me taste it myself, I can understand why she just couldn't eat it.<br /><br />Such a shame - if the amount of oil used was decreased a great deal, this would probably be a delicious butter.  But unless you love the taste of oil, you'll want to pass on this.<br /><br /> It's possible we got a 'bad batch', I suppose.  But I don't want to risk the cost buying this product again.  To the seller's credit, I must say that they delivered the product promptly & it was packaged well, so they gain a star for good service -- otherwise my rating would be only one star, based on the product alone.

review/text: We received this pet feeder yesterday and assembled it right away. It was easy to put together and it looks really great. We have cherry cabinets in our kitchen and it looks nice alongside of them. Our dog is a 1yr old, 56 pound Golden Retriever and she really seems to like the new set up. She even seems to eat her food a little more slowly and has been drinking more water. I would definitely recommend this product. One note - one of the bowls had a very sharp piece on the underside of the lip. I was able to file it smooth and it's fine now, but it would have definitely led to a cut at some point during a hand washing.

But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/text: I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.

review/summary: Yummy~My treat instead of High Sugar Cookies.
review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/summary: Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :)
review/text: It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.

review/text: Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.

Only two issues with them: serving size is one ounce (not possible! :-) and they are not tough enough to stand up to careless dipping (like most tortilla chips, it's probably just physics; but if they made these in a cup/dipping shape, it would be great).

I was so disappointed to discover the chips are coated in a powdery substance like cheap Doritos.  The taste is artificial, and after eating a few there was a film on the top of my mouth.  I will not be ordering this flavor again, and I am hoping the lime is better and more natural.  I'll have to find a different way to ingest my plant sterols because I would rather eat good tortilla chips over these any day.  I'm not recommending that any of my family or friends purchase this flavor.

I was a little confused when I picked this item up, because the label on the dye shows a red color, nothing near "true" terra cotta, but the swatch (as seen left of the dye) shows terra cotta.  I went ahead and purchased this and wasted my time and money.  My icing came out pink and and grew closer to red as I added more dye.  I ended up using orange and various other colors to get my desired terra cotta coloring.

I have tried the other brand, but find I prefer the keebler<br />Brand. The flavor is much better. Must be because it's shortbread. I would love to see these sold in Canada!

review/summary: Wrong item sent--not this 6-count of Venetian Vineyard Granola
review/text: I ordered this 6-count of Ambrosial Granola Organic Venetian Vineyard Omega-3 Plus, 12-ounce pouch cereal.  What I actually received was only 2 pouches of the Venetian Vineyard granola cereal, plus 2 pouches of Ambrosial Grecian Grove granola cereal, and 2 pouches of Ambrosial Athenian Muesli cereal.  (In other words, I was sent 2 sampler-of-three packs, rather than the one 6-pack of Venetian granola.)<br /><br />I didn't feel like dealing with returning it, so I kept the 4 packages of granola and gave the 2 packages of muesli to someone who likes it.  I found out that I like the Grecian granola (which I had not ordered) as well, if not better, than the Venetian granola (which I had ordered).  The Grecian granola has interesting orange overtones.  The Venetian granola is good, but I would back off on the cinnamon if I were making it.<br /><br />The packaging, shipping, and delivery were also problematic, but I will deal with those issues elsewhere.<br /><br />All-in-all, the cereal is good, but the product fulfillment leaves quite a bit to be desired.

It is now out of stock and I regret it.  Buy more than you think you will need if it comes back in stock because you will eat it for more than breakfast.<br /><br />It is sweet, naturally.  It is not dry.  I find the right mix of moist dried fruits and crispy nuts.

review/text: The Mint Milano cookies are wonderful. They have a light and crispy texture with a mild mint chocolate taste. The flavor reminds me a lot of the chocolate mint Girl Scout cookies although the texture of the 2 cookies are very different (the girl scout cookie is much denser).<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies usually arrive with very few intact and several of mine were even broken into multiple pieces. They still taste pretty good though.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts copied from the actual package (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 2 cookies (25g/ 0.9oz)<br /><br />Servings per container about 8<br /><br />Calories per serving 130<br /><br />Calories from fat 70<br /><br />Total Fat 7g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br /><br />Sodium 65mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br /><br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamins A and C 0%<br /><br />Calcium 0%<br /><br />Iron 4%<br /><br />FYI, I purchased my cookies during 100 degree weather and except for some of the chocolate melting onto the inner wrapper the cookies were fine (I used 2 day shipping which might make a difference since the cookies weren't in the heat that long).<br /><br />At 15.88 for 4 bags of cookies the price per bag is 3.97 which is 48 cents more than the price printed on the cookie bag (3.49).

review/summary: OK, but not up to normal Milano standards.
review/text: I guess I should've known: I checked out the prices for the various permutations of the Milano brand name and this was the cheapest.  The cookies arrived in fair condition, with some of them broken already.  Slight breakage is okay, since we break them up to eat them anyway.  However, when they are broken to the point of powder, they become useless.  I believe that these were overbaked or the mix failed.  There was a powdery texture to the cookie instead of the smooth surface.  It's a subtle difference but the 'Milano' experience is very specific.  At these prices, they better be perfect.  These cookies weren't.<br /><br />I know Pepperidge Farm products; my parents lived in Norwalk, CT near their factory.  I have shopped at the company store.  What's amazing is that their products are perfectly good at the expiration date or even one year later.  However, in the case of the product above, they were not good right out of the factory and thus they were discounted.

review/summary: Classic Cookies
review/text: All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that.

review/text: A tasty treat for those who remember what these were like when they used to sell them in the stores, now I can't find this one, but they have the double chocolate, mint, and other random flavors that I don't find quite as appealing.<br /><br />Note that this is a pack of four, but still expensive for such - probably designed to extract the emotional value from people like me. Considering the other kinds can be had for far cheaper at Target... I can do without these for a while again, especially as most of us don't eat through these fast enough to get through four packs by the due date.

review/summary: Yummy Little Treat
review/text: This review is regarding the cookie, not the price set by this seller. The cookie.... is fantastic. What a perfect little treat. Three cookies are only 180 calories. Since I am trying to watch my weight, I eat one - only 60 calories!! It's perfect for those times you NEED something sugary or chocolately. You can eat one of these and not blow your entire day dieting.<br /><br />Yum. Yum.

review/summary: Far too delicious
review/text: These cookies hardly need a review. They are so amazingly delicious. The perfect amount of rich chocolate between the cookies. Pepperidge farm sure did it right with these cookies. Stick to the classic ones, though. I've tried a few other variations and they aren't nearly as good.

review/summary: mad for movies
review/text: The cookies were delicious, chrisp and whole. I can only say they did not last long.  Pepperidge Farm Mint Milano is the only cookie I realy enjoy and would eat a lot off.  The others, even in Peppridge Farm I would only eat one or two.  But I have found that the Mint Milano is hard to get.  Pepperidge Farm should try selling in Canada and Jamaica,  West Indies.  I actually live in Jamaica, W.I. and can not get Mint Milano there so I either ask friends to buy it for me or buy it on line.  Would recommend this cookie for all those people that like a lite combination of mint and chocolate.

review/summary: Good Mint Cookies
review/text: These have minty chocolate in them, but it's not too minty, wich is good.  They're a lot like the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies in reguard to flavor, but the texture is lighter and crisper.
