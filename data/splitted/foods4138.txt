review/summary: First time catnip for my kitty
review/text: I had never given my cat any catnip before this. So the first time she had some of this she got a little sick so i immediately returned it.  However, the carpet area and the sock that i had sprinkled this on still had enough catnip on it for her to smell and play with and now she goes nuts over it (:

review/summary: lots of sharp twigs
review/text: My cats seem to like the smell of this catnip.  However, I usually crush catnip to release the scent before I give it to the cats.  With this product, I have been getting sharp splinters from the woody part of the plant in my fingers.  I have noticed the cats sometimes seem to also get jabbed.  I won't buy this brand again.

review/summary: You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?
review/text: This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.  I've used it in toys, rubbed it between my fingers as the package directs, etc.; yet our three month old kitten just doesn't seem to care.  She'll "usually" come up and take a whiff when I open the bag or coax her to see what I've got in my hand, but she quickly loses interest.  And it never manages to put her into some euphoric state, much less even settle her down, when she's running around, going crazy, as growing, restless housecats do.<br /><br />The catnip smells mostly like ground tea leaves, to me.  The only praise I can offer regards the volume that comes in the package compared to most other offerings on amazon, and that it comes in a resealable bag - not a "ziplock" bag like another reviewer indicated; it's clearly a professionally packaged product, but one with a ziplock style closure.  And, as others have noted, the bag is 3oz NOT 3.5 as amazon's title erroneously misadvertises.  Even so, it's still the best value on amazon, assuming it works as well as the other, more expensive, brands.  Considering all but maybe the most expensive has received mixed reviews of effectiveness, and that the best rated/most expensive option appears to be charging more for a tin can, I'm reluctant to invest more in a product that may only be effective for certain cats, if indeed it's not another form of snake oil.  Maybe I should have done my usual research beforehand.<br /><br />Update:  Having put this in several toys, a cardboard scratching pad and even sprinkled a little on her food once or twice per week, our kitten not only shows disinterest in this product now, but practically runs away when I open the bag as if the smell actually offends her.  We have three large, cat-eating dogs outside, which we rescued her from right after they got two of her siblings - they had wondered into the dogs radio fence boundaries and got trapped inside a tractor - so she has to stay indoors.  I was really hoping this might settle her down when she gets stir crazy.  But it doesn't, not in the least.

review/text: I bought this catnip because I couldn't find the brand I wanted on Amazon. I opened it immediately but the cat won't go near it. I've tried different ways to get her to interact to no avail. I would save your $5 and buy another brand. There is nothing spectacular about this product.

review/text: Hi.  My cats (all 4 of them) didn't react as enthusiastically as I thought they would--they seem to like the other less expensive brands just as much, if not better.<br />  Unless you can get a good deal, don't go on just what the Xtreme title implies. Do, however, try to go organic-your pets don't need the added chemicals.

review/summary: Description Needs Updating
review/text: Catnip is fine, but the packaging has changed to a zip-lock bag, and (as of Dec 2010) the bag contains 3.0 ounces (85 grams) of catnip rather than the 3.5 ounces noted in the item description.  The cats liked it enough, and it's still an economical way to purchase catnip.  A bag should last quite a while for most cat households.

review/summary: Cat Heaven
review/text: Pros:<br /><br />Good bulk for your money (3.5 oz)<br /><br />They have it in resealable ziplock foil/plastic containers now that hold moisture very well. They should update the photo. Every bag I've gotten is fresh. i.e. the nip has a little moisture left but not much. When I open it you can smell catnip even as a human from a little distance.<br /><br />My cats absolutely love it, and they leave me alone for about an hour after each pinch. They just entertain themselves rolling around on the floor.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It's still expensive compared to just growing your own catnip.

review/text: My cat recently freaked out over some catnip that came with a bed I bought him so I thought I'd order some more.  I couldn't find the same brand but this "Xtreme" catnip sounded like it might do the trick.  Not even close.  My husband swears he saw our cat lift up his paw and yawn after smelling it.  If your cat is like mine you'll probably get a better reaction out of any other catnip out there.

review/text: I have been able to find a few uses for this product, mostly to make a very sweet cup of hot cocoa but as much as I love sweets even I can only drink one mug.  Also, there is something in the powder that renders the resulting liquid sort of thick, more like gelatinous.  I will use it up because it isn't all that bad but it's far from what I hoped for - something to make the kind of rice milk you can buy in a square carton (Rice Dreams).  Now that stuff is outrageously good but for shipping purposes I wanted to try a powder.

review/summary: Dairy-free convenience
review/text: Having dairy-free beverages available when I travel has been a huge problem, until Better Than Milk-Vanilla rice powder. I keep a baggie with 4-6 Tbsp of powder; a spoon; and a wide-mouth 8-oz plastic bottle (REI) in a 1-quart baggie. With the tight lid on the bottle, I can add water to the powder and shake vigorously to mix fully. No spills. It's great on cereal & in coffee; doesn't dissolve quite well enough to drink separately.<br />  Another discovery: mix it at double-strength to create a delicious foamy addition to a cup of coffee. Poor person's latte. Foams even better if you microwave your water and double-strength rice milk, then add instant coffee and/or instant chai.

review/summary: makes a good substitute for coffee creamer
review/text: I ordered this product to use as a non-dairy (no casein), no soy substitute for coffee creamer after discovering I have some food allergies. I was pretty bummed having to give up my creamer, and plain or flavored rice milk was just not rich enough.  I use two teaspoons of this in my morning tea and it adds a nice rich flavor with a bit of sweetness.  I also tried to make my own rice milk drink according to the directions, but did not really like the flavor or texture, a bit watery and kind of gummy.  I did not bother experimenting with adding different amounts of the powder to try to get a product I liked because I have a rice milk beverage that I am happy with already.

review/summary: Economical for Rice Milk Lovers
review/text: The packaging says that each canister can make 32- Eight ounce cups.  The cheapest I've seen already mixed tetra-paks at the store is ~$2.00 for a 32 ounce package.<br /><br />The taste is pretty comparable to the pre-mixed stuff.  I'll agree with other reviewers that it is a tad sweeter than others I've tasted, but perhaps it's because I had more powder than I should've used.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that is DOES NOT mix very easily.  To make a cup, I put the powder in an EMPTY cup, then add a little water and mix that up until it makes an even paste, and then you add the rest of your water.  Never add the powder in a cup with liquid already in there, because it'll just cause clumps!<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this to other people that like rice milk and looking to save a little shelf space and $$ by buying this beverage mix.

review/text: I just received my shipment of Better Than Milk Vegan Beverage Mix, Rice, Vanilla. The company has reformulated this product, and it is much better. It's not as gelatinous as the last package I used. Also, the previous package had 6g of sugar. The new formula only has 3g sugar.<br /><br />I use this product at work to make hot cocoa. I add two teaspoons of the powdered milk to a 16 ounce mug. Then, I add one heaping teaspoon of Wonderslim Pure Fat-Free Cocoa Powder (available for purchase on Amazon). Finally, I add hot water and stir. This new formula is not as clumpy as the old formula.<br /><br />It's an acquired taste, but it's better than using the prepackaged cocoa mix that is full of chemicals and ingredients that are not good for you. Also, on the days I want a sweeter drink, I add a packet of Stevia to the mixture before adding the water.

review/summary: excellant rice milk product
review/text: We have been using Better than Milk Vanilla for some time and we really like the taste.  You can adjust the consistancy by changing the water to milk ratio.  It is always better to mix it up a day before using as the product will totally disolve by then.  Our only complaint is that the product is hard to mix, disolve into the water.  It takes a lot of hard shaking (my wife can't do it) to get the milk to disolve.  You can get it pretty well mixed when making it and finish the next day.

review/summary: Maybe OK for coffee.
review/text: Better than Milk - Rice (Vanilla) contains maltodextrin, a starchy substance, (made from rice in this case)  as its primary ingredient. After that there is sunflower oil, cane juice, maltodextrine (a bulking agent used in coffee creamers, dairy products, etc.)  and some other fairly harmless ingredients.  I am not a fan of precessed food, but  I am looking for a coffee creamer without hydrogenated oils or cow's milk.<br /><br />I would not consider this a healthy product to drink by the glass.  There is a lot of processing that goes into making this product. In addition, the sunflower oil is bound to be rancid after a couple of days on the shelf.  Rancid vegetable oil is very bad for your arteries.  I will store my open container in the refrigerator.<br /><br />For me, the rice powder is too sticky to bu useful as rice milk.  The sticky quality of this product would elicit my gag reflex eventually.<br /><br />For use in coffee, the taste isn't bad.  It is reminiscent of vanilla flavored powdered coffee creamer.  For people accustomed  to the taste of mucous products (Dairy),  it has a kind of "snot" substitute which sticks to your palette.  This is probably the attributes of the sunflower oil and maltodextrine. I would recommend using this sparingly in your coffee.  You can add a little powdered goat's milk in lieu of too much rice powder in order to keep the sweetness and stickiness to comfortable levels.<br /><br />The rice milk powder does not dissolve quickly in your coffee. (Neither does goat's milk powder.)  You will have to wait at least 5 minutes after you drop in the rice powder if you don't want to chew your coffee.  Stirring helps but does not dissolve the powder immediately.<br /><br />I found a couple of uses for the powder.  It is probably not the intended use.  The powder seems to improve the taste of chocolate soy ice cream substitute.  It also goes well in plain oatmeal with a little cinnamon.  Just add a tablespoon or two while you are cooking or heating the oatmeal and shake on some cinnamon.  Oatmeal is lumpy and sticky anyway so you can't tell that the rice powder is also lumpy and sticky.  The rice powder is sweet so if you are watching your sugar intake then you should keep this in mind.<br /><br />I don't think I will be buying the product again anytime soon.  There is probably better non-dairy coffee creamer waiting to be discovered.

review/summary: Tastes like coconut! -Not a good thing...
review/text: This product smells and tastes like coconut.  Not just a little but a lot!  I don't like coconut...hence the 1 star.  The instructions say to mix it up with tepid water in larger amounts..but I wanted it to make just a glass at a time, so I tried mixing up one glass in cold water.  It took a lot of mixing and still I couldn't get it to all mix in.  So if you like coconut and have a blender...maybe you'll like it.

review/text: We use rice milk because of my son's problem with digesting regular milk and thought this would be more convenient than stocking the liquid stuff in the box.  The problem is that it is very difficult to mix.  Even using warm water, it takes quite a bit of effort to get the powder to dissolve.  Canceled my subscription and returning to the boxes.

review/text: I should have listened to the prior reviews.  My son did not like it.<br />The Vanilla flavor was too sweet and thicker than I expected.  It also left an aftertaste. To prepare, it needs to be blended so it really would not be practical on the go...Buying a powdered form milk, I thought it would be practical for traveling. I will be going back to the DariFree product; taste is comparable to the store bought rice milk and it is easy to prepare.  All you need is hot water!

review/summary: Unimpressed
review/text: I purchased this variety of Better Than Milk as a cheaper replacement for pre-packaged vanilla rice milks.  It seems to work well enough as a liquid ingredient in cooked items, but to drink it on its own or mixed in with other beverages it is a let down.  The texture is a bit gelatinous but the flavor is fine.  Regardless of desired thickness it does not emulsify as the directions state.  Beads of powder float atop the concoction no matter how long it's shaken and regardless of liquid temperature.  I suspect that as a dry ingredient it will work fine in recipes but it does not at all meet the objective for which I intended it.  The benefits I've found with it do not compensate for the cost or outcome.

One of our favorite ways to eat these is with a broccoli parmesan white sauce.<br />The nests are a nice way to judge portions.

review/summary: Sicilian Olive Oil
review/text: This Baglio delle Saline olive oil is a golden oil and has a good, fruity taste with hints of ripe tomato, green apple, and grass.  This is not what I consider to be typical of the Valli Trapanese oils; the Trapanese oils are greener in color and have a thicker, more unctuous "pour" and a richer, heavier, more pronounced taste which is what I admire most about the Trapanese oils...as well as the oils from the Tonda Iblea olives of eastern Sicily.  This Baglio oil is under the seal of Manfreddi Barbera, producer of the exceptional Barbera "Frantoia" oil coming from south of Palermo; Baglio reminds me of a lighter "Frantoia"; I use "Frantoia" in all my cooking and consider it one of Sicily's very best.<br /><br />At $14.95 per 750 bottle, this oil is quite a steal, and is like a less expensive "Frantoia".

review/summary: This rice blend is terrific. Shipping cost outrageous!
review/text: I am fortunate to have a Trader Joe's close by, and buy this rice medley regularly. It's become our family favorite. I was initially attracted to this offer of 9 packs for around $26, but the addition of nearly $10 in shipping is offputting. I recommend this rice blend HIGHLY. It's very flavorful and really completes a meal. At the TJ store, a single one lb pack is $1.99, so this offer seems excessively expensive. At the store you could buy 10 pounds (10 packs) for $20. Find a friend with a local Trader Joe's and ask them to send it! Flat rate USPS shipping included, you'll get it much cheaper! It really is delicious! (hey, if you'd like, leave me a comment, and I'd be happy to oblige!)

review/summary: Fantastic rice blend
review/text: Basmati rice has to be one of the most delicate forms of this grain on the face of the earth, and Trader Joe's medley of rice and spices has for at least two years served as our family's standard replacement for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZY8XE">Near East Original  Rice Pilaf</a>, which we once upon a time adored.<br /><br />Even at Amazon, this package comes to 27 cents an ounce --- although at the local Trader Joe's, the one-pound bag of this stuff goes for a mere $2. It lasts for many many meals, and compares very favorably, therefore, with Near East's $2.65 to $2.95 for a six ounce boxes that serve, at most, six people.<br /><br />I'll admit that the Near East brand does taste divine, as it includes pine nuts and other such not featured in this Basmati rice medley. But the far superior cost of Trader Joe's provides a win win.<br /><br />Having said that, I must agree with the previous reviewer, who comments upon the excessive cost of this item at Amazon. It's twice as much as the cost from the store.<br /><br />Best bet, find a Trader Joe's, or telegraph a relative who lives near one, to ship you a big carton of the stuff once every six months or so.

There is an Audubon brand; also a 'bag it yourself' brand at New Frontiers. Probably Whole Foods has it too. Organic is good, but they still chop down rain forests to plant organic coffee fields. 'Shade grown' preserves the rain forest and is the ultimate Eco-Correcto.

review/text: I am not a big coffee drinker, so if you're a coffee gourmet you can probably stop reading here.  I drink one mug of coffee in the morning (16 oz mug) and, occasionally, another mug of decaf in the evening.  My usual blend is Arco (fresh roasted in Duluth-Superior since 1916), which is a medium roast without a lot of bite. My wife loves chocolate and I ordered some Ghiardelli chocolate coffee last summer.  One of the 12 oz bags was chocolate-peppermint.  Both my wife (who drinks coffee by the pot rather than by the mug) really like this coffee, especially on Saturday mornings.  Ghiardelli Chocolate-Peppermint has become our regular weekend coffee.<br /><br />I drink it with whipping cream and some Sweet'N Low.<br /><br />When I can't get Ghiardelli, I add Land O'Lakes mint hot chocolate mix to my regular Arco coffee but it's not the same.

For me, there really isn't enough of either chocolate or peppermint.  I make a fairly strong pot of coffee & used my normal amount of scoops.  Coffee seems weak, not much chocolate - has a bit of a bitter taste & mint is moderate.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to my old favorite, now I just wonder just how long it is going to take me to drink three bags of this stuff.

review/text: Bought these a few days ago.  Opened one bag.  The glue on the bag was pretty tough and actually shredded the bag itself upon opening.  No biggie, so I move on to the brewing process.  I load up the coffee and begin the brew.  I immediately noticed a strong mint smell in the aroma.  Almost too much.  I wait for it to finish and pour a cup.  I give it a couple seconds on the pallet and it just isn't quite what I was expecting.  The mint flavor has added an unpleasent sharpness that really disrupts the coffee/chocolate vibe.  I'll drink it all, I am sure of that.  But it is not quite the experience I was hoping for.

review/text: I ordered a three-pack of Ghiradelli� Caffe Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Peppermint Light Roast Organic Ground Coffee, which overall took less time than typing the name, and it arrived as promised this afternoon, which was followed immediately by making an excellent pot of it using the single-drip method at the ratio of 1/2 cup of ground coffee to 12-ounces of water at the ideal brewing temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit . . .<br /><br />And while I make coffee at a strength level which probably would be fatal for most of the people on this planet, it works for me since I have the complete array of what I like to call the "South American Coffee Achiever" genes to the point that I can enjoy several cups of coffee and then take a nap . . .<br /><br />This particular chocolate peppermint flavored coffee is outstanding with half-and-half or whole cream, which has the additional benefit of buffering it a bit when it is brewed strongly . . .<br /><br />The balance of the light roast organic coffee, chocolate, and peppermint is very nice, and no one thing overwhelms the others, which in simple terms maps to being able to taste the coffee, chocolate, and peppermint distinctly but in a smooth way . . .<br /><br />For reference, the ratio of half-and-half to brewed coffee I prefer is approximately 1:6, which for example maps to 2 ounces of half-and-half and 12 ounces of coffee . . .<br /><br />The peppermint is clearly present, but it is a bit more subtle than the level of peppermint in Millstone� Holiday Peppermint� coffee (another personal favorite), and the chocolate tempers the peppermint, which contributes to the "smooth" aspect . . .<br /><br />Basically, there are five things that work synergistically with coffee in different combinations:<br /><br />(1) half-and-half or whole cream<br /><br />(2) chocolate<br /><br />(3) peppermint<br /><br />(4) cinnamon<br /><br />(5) sugar<br /><br />And after enjoying five cups of this outstanding chocolate peppermint coffee in approximately 15 minutes, I now am completely and totally motivated to engage productively in mentation toward the triple goals of (a) composing a silly song about ladies underpants and (b) writing a short novel describing all the surreal thoughts I had over the past 25 milliseconds, followed by (c) taking a nap while listening to "Hold It Against Me" (Britney Spears) during which time I expect to have especially naughty dreams, which is fabulous . . .<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Fabulous! :)<br /><br />P. S.  This is good stuff!

review/summary: Have I told you this is the BEST soy sauce ever?
review/text: I have been sampling different soy sauces for a year or so but when I found this one...my search was over! This really is the best I've ever tried. It's more mellow and slightly lighter color. Also, the little bottles are so cute; the labels come off easily so they can be used for a variety of other liquids. My sister ran off with one and is using it for cream. Also, under the pour spout is a metal screw top that be reinserted to protect the contents and the pour spout goes right on top of it. I'm hoping I can find it in a larger bottle now that I have a lot of little bottles! Try it....you'll love it too!

review/summary: Childhood favorite
review/text: My mom loved these, and would share them with me when I was a kid. These are one of my absolute favorite candy bars. They are a lot harder for me to find now locally, and Big Cherry just doesn't compare.<br />The chocolate tastes like it's infused with the cherry flavor, it's a milk chocolate that's a bit above grocery store quality. Not gourmet, but not waxy and not too sweet, the nuts are just the right amount. It's a cherry bar with nuts, not a nut bar with cherries. The nuts add a nice crunch and flavor, the creamy fondant center is cherry flavored without being too overwhelming.<br />So much of what I thought tasted great 30 years ago doesn't taste good at all as an adult. I'm glad to say, these are still a favorite.

review/summary: Honey Colored Sugar - Nothing More
review/text: Though not especially clear in the product details here, the primary ingredient is cane sugar and the taste reflects that.  "Honey Crystals" is very misleading.  The listed details of this product would indicate that this is pure crystalized, dehydrated honey.  One would hope, great for tea or coffee drinkers who are tired of having honey packets sticky-up their purse or pockets... unfortunately that is not the case.  This is a bag of cane sugar.  Using this product in a recipe to replace sugar is pointless, because again, it's mostly sugar.  The only thing this will add to your baked goods is cost.<br /><br />Whether you're a foodie with an especially refined palate or just someone who can sort of tell the difference between real honey and a packet of Sweet N' Low, you will likely not mistake this for anything but sugar. Twelve dollar cost - two dollar standard sugar!<br /><br />If you're seeking genuine honey, in both substance and flavor, but without the sticky, keep looking.  If you have no qualms about paying nearly twelve bucks for a bag of yellow cane sugar, purchase on.<br /><br />One positive:  It does dissolve fast (but so does super-fine sugar found in any grocery store for a buck fifty).

review/text: The Whole Grain Wheat Pilaf is the last of our regular Near East staple varieties. It is much more interesting than plain brown rice --- another favorite around here --- and a fabulous variation on the carbohydrate theme.<br /><br />Still, even at Amazon's excellent low price (with super saver shipping) this flavor of rice runs nearly 68% more per ounce than the basmati, wild rice and vegetable medley we've favored of late, to which we add our own spices.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this Near East product. It's delicious and nutritious and cooks in a hurry. However, after we have consumed the last box now in our cabinet, we won't be getting this item again. It just costs too much.

review/summary: Delicious Addition To Italian Food! Autistic Resource Too!
review/text: My dear sister made a big amazon purchase and realizing how much she received, she shared with me. I'm forever glad she did. We love this herb! It goes well with steak, burgers, and any & most all italian dishes. My favorite is to boil my noodles with a tbl olive oil and a dash of crushed rosemary. A dab of garlic salt is sometimes added.<br /><br />Most delightedly though, is the fact that is one of the few safe food additives that my Autistic son can feel proud to dish out in any quantity. You might think I'm crazy but if you have a child with any syndrome associated with Autism, then you'll agree anything that brings out the best in our children is worth it's weight in gold. My child's face lights up, his posture becomes erect, and his heart sings with joy when he knows we are having meat or Italian food! He becomes a different child. It's almost as if he's been hiding his true self until that moment. Please, if you haven't tried what I call "food therapy" it's never too late! There are numerous herbs & spices that can and will attract your child! Just make sure they are the safe in excessive quantities. My son has his own special shelf in our kitchen. It even includes candy sprinkles & Angostura Bitters!

review/summary: A New Favorite!
review/text: I love Matcha and I love licorice, so this flavored Matcha should be a no-brainer, right?  But to be honest, not all licorice flavors are done right, and it's one of those flavors that if it's not right, it can be just WRONG.<br /><br />Fortunately, Red Leaf Tea did licorice RIGHT!  This is a strong, crisp, zesty licorice flavor.  It's really an exhilarating flavor.  As I sip it, the aftertaste reminds me very much of Altoid's Liquorice which is the strongest licorice flavored thing I've ever tasted.  This nearly rivals the Altoids in strength ... but this is even better because of the Matcha.  The Matcha offers its creamy consistency and slightly buttery, sweet vegetative tones to the sip, which softens the sharper notes of the licorice in a very appealing way, creating a flavor that reminds me of black Jelly Bellys ... as if someone took black Jelly Bellys and liquified them and stirred them into a bowl of Matcha.<br /><br />It is so good.  If you like black licorice, you should try this.  If you are a black licorice fiend like I am - you've GOT to try this ... this may just be my new favorite source of black licorice flavor, not to mention my new favorite flavored Matcha!

review/summary: Licorice? I barely know orice!
review/text: I have such a love/hate relationship with licorice, and I had to try this one, I just had to. Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br /><br />I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br /><br />It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br /><br />Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!

Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.

review/text: What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked, milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot, since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands, it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5, for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now, Mmmmm!

review/summary: BROKEN COOKIES, BAD PACKAGING
review/text: These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, "Don't call here anymore."

review/summary: I'm addicted
review/text: I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

review/summary: Not soft cookies at all.
review/text: I have been having extensive dental work done, and anything that says it is soft, I buy it.  However, these were very hard and dry.  I gave them away to a family with a lot of children.  They will get eaten there.

review/summary: Helps, but doesn't eliminate spit up
review/text: We switched our 4 month old to this formula to see if it would help with his reflux.  He was still being breast-fed for the most part, but we would use the formula once or twice a day.  The spitting up reduced, but not considerably.  If the price difference between store brands and this one is too much for you, adding rice cereal to the milk in a bottle had the same effect for us. Our doctor suggested this to us.

review/summary: No More Spit-Up
review/text: Breastfeeding did not work out for our family, so we use formula. The original Enfamil formula made our baby spit up constantly. We switched to the Enfmail Spit-Up formula and it worked like a charm. Rarely any spit-up. It is much thicker than the original kind. I wish special formula did not cost more though. This can be pretty expensive.

review/summary: Really helps with the spit up
review/text: After breast feeding for 2 months we switched to good start which made the already frequent spitting up become more consistent. So we switched to the enfamil, had a little issues pooping at 1st but little bit of pure prune juice helped! Happy baby! and it keeps her full a little longer due to the formula being a little thicker.

review/summary: Good Food
review/text: This is the best shredded wheat I have ever eaten.  It has no additives, which makes it important to eat prior to the date impressed on the top of the box.  This also makes ordering this product through Amazon's subscription service ideal, because on each order I have received, the imprint date is at least 4 months in advance.<br /><br />The bisquits are round like little hay bales and kind of crinkly. This is especially good because they provide a crunchy oral satisfaction--if you don't let them sit in the skim milk too long. This is a personal preference. For those who like soft cereal, the flavor is just as good, if the bisquits sit a little longer in the milk. And by the way, I use no sugar and the flavor is excellent. They are especially filling for the low calories involved.  In fact, they give satisfaction on many levels.<br /><br />I have given boxes of them to my cardiologist, because they are so wonderful.  They are perfect, for eating a healthy diet;no additives as well as providing that satisfying crunch.  I hope I have made clear, they are not like any shredded wheat I have previously eaten.  My daughter introduced them to me, and I pray Barbara's continued production. The company also makes bite size bisquits, which I am sure are just as good.  I happen to much prefer the crinkly little bales.Yummy!

review/summary: Real. Good. Period.
review/text: This is the real deal.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% Whole Wheat.<br /><br />Sugars: 0 grams.<br /><br />Forget Lucky Charms. Barbara's Shredded Wheat Biscuits really are magically delicious. I know you'll think I'm letting the nutrition facts bias my taste buds, but this is probably the best tasting cereal I've ever had (I rarely add anything other than milk). And it provides a great foundation for adding fruit, if that's what you're into. If you're used to bite-size versions of shredded wheat, you will be amazed at what full-size biscuits have to offer. There is simply no comparison.<br /><br />I haven't tried the Quaker version of this product; it seems very similar (also 100% whole wheat, similar nutrition facts, identical form factor), so I won't claim that Barbara's is better.<br /><br />Both the Quaker brand and this one are nearly impossible to find in stores (especially recently...). What you are likely to find is Post Shredded Wheat Original, which is no substitute. First of all, Post adds BHT to its packaging to "preserve the natural wheat flavor". Secondly, Post's pillow-shaped biscuits offer little improvement over bite-size varieties; unlike Barbara's hay bale shape, Post's pillow shape inhibits milk penetration, which leads to unevenly soaked biscuits.<br /><br />You really will be amazed at the rich, nutty flavor of real shredded wheat. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

review/summary: A GOOD CEREAL/ A GOOD BUY
review/text: I recently discovered a "back to basics" cereal containing no sodium and no sugar, without a significant amount of added vitamins.  While I used to eat another brand of shredded wheat, I bought Barbara's when I was traveling over the holidays and liked it much better.<br />The shape is unique and it is just a really tasty form of 100% pure wheat. The grocery store price was quite high; but amazon.com had a good price, with free shipping; so I bought several boxes.<br />I highly recommend this cereal and will buy it again.

review/summary: Wheat.........Shredded Wheat.
review/text: I was introduced to Barbara by Trader Joe. Trader Joe's has been slipping down the corporate hillside these last 10 years or so, and, in it's great wisdom has dropped Barbara's Shredded Wheat (along with many other products) which causes me to visit the great Amazon Mountain increasingly.<br />Live From Hollywood.
