review/summary: OIL! OIL! OIL!
review/text: Smothered in oil is the only way to describe these Cashews.  It looks nothing like the picture online, there is messy, oily goo on the inside of the container from all that oil.  Haven't you ever heard about DRY roasting?  I prefer to have no salt, but what's the use when you drown the &$#@!ig things in Oil!? Cashews contain enough natural oils. Stop soaking them in additional oil!  I ordered these only because my regular brand was sold out on Amazon.  What a disappointment!  I will continue to order Cashews from Amazon, but not this brand.

review/summary: very disappointed-these are not the same nuts
review/text: With the greatest satisfaction, I've been purchasing this product for over a year, but my latest purchases of this product are very disappointing. As a person that chose Emerald Harmony no salt cashews over all the other brands sold on Amazon, I am very upset that Amazon is passing off an oily brand of no salt cashews I once bought on Amazon (much to my great disliking) as Emerald Harmony's no salt cashews.  Please give me and those other people who know their nuts back the original great Emerald Harmony no salt cashews you use to sell.<br /><br /> mg(I know my nuts and hope to be able to purchase them again)

review/summary: If you like your cashews oily, you may love these -.
review/text: I have purchased a lot of cashews from Amazon but this was my first experience with this brand. I was very happy with the nuts I had been getting and I tried this one for just two reasons: [1] The brands I usually order were out of stock and [2] among the the reasonably priced cashews, this one had the best reviews. I note that one review did say they were very oily but, in the end, that reviewer gave the product a 5 star rating. Well, that reviewer was certainly correct about one thing: these nuts are very oily. The walls of the package were so oil coated that I could barely see the nuts inside. My immediate reaction was to contact Amazon for a return label. But the site said food products were not returnable. I decided to call because I thought that there was significant misrepresentation of the product and that they would make an exception for that. Then I discovered that Amazon no longer takes phone calls to Customer Service!!! While I am surprised and a bit unhappy that Amazon has cut off calls to Customer Service, their "no return policy" on foods bothers me even more because the result is that anyone who calls their product a food gets a free pass on the requirement for an accurate description of the item. In the case of these cashews, the picture in the product description shows the nuts inside the container very  clearly, whereas they are barely visible through the  oil film on the inside of the package.<br />  Well, I decided to try to make the best of it, so I emptied the nuts onto paper towels, as the reviewer mentioned above had done. and dried them off as well as I could. Unfortunately, the remaining oil had an old taste that was definitely not pleasant.<br />  I have rated this product at 2 stars just because I have not tried all the cashew brands at Amazon and there may well be some that are still worse.<br />  In fairness to Emerald Harmony, these are the only oil roasted cashews I have purchased.[Oil is not mentioned by them and most other brands are dry roasted]<br />  And in fairness to Amazon, I want to say that this is the only product I have purchased from them where i have been unhappy with the final outcome.

All my life I was told " a white tongue means a time to clean out the body". But, I had a feeling my Ph was way off too, and I was not drinking enough water each day. The first day of drinking Essentia Water I felt the difference. I did not know it would help clean me out and decrease the acid in my body but it did! Day 5 my tongue was pink again...Victory!

review/text: I've tried many brands, but Rodelle vanilla beans are hands-down the best for baking. I love baking. Vanilla is one of my favorite flavor profiles and Rodelle vanilla stands out from the rest in taste. Baking is cathargic. The process of stripping the vanilla paste from the bean, seeing the flecks of goodness in the batter, and smelling the amazing vanilla aroma fill the house while baking is something I never get tired of. Rodelle vanilla is fragrant, vibrant tasting and using it is an expressing that you care about what you're making.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269JYGY">Rodelle Vanilla Beans, 2-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: Hong Cho drinking vinegar
review/text: I don't know what persuaded me to try drinking vinegar, but it has become my favorite beverage. Fill a glass with ice, pour in sparkling mineral water nearly to the top (my favorite is Gerolsteiner, but any high quality sparkling water will do) and then top off with Hong Cho in one of its four flavors Pomegranate is my favorite, but there is also blueberry, blackberry and (I think) raspberry. Experiment with the proper ratio. Some people use still water, but I vastly prefer sparkling water.<br /><br />Be advised that Hong Cho isn't cheap. It's $13 a bottle at my favorite Korean supermarket. But then, since I mix it five- to seven-to-one with sparkling water, it's actually economical. And twice a year it goes on sale for $9 and I buy a case.<br /><br />I can't tell you how good and refreshing this drink is. It supposedly has health and diet benefits as well, but I wouldn't know about that. I like the way it tastes.

review/summary: Smarty Kat Catnip, waaay overpriced here.
review/text: This is my cats' favorite catnip. It doesn't smell as minty as the other brands I've tried. Catnip is in the mint family, but my cats like the ones that are less minty. My boy will lick the stuff up and roll around in it. It calms his anxiety, he is usually really jumpy and nervous, but when he's "high on 'nip", he's a real lover boy and more playful. I found it also stimulates his appetite, he's around 8 years old and has seasonal allergies and bad teeth, so he doesn't eat like he used to and is getting skinny. I am trying to find ways to put some weight on him before I take him to the vet. My girl likes it too, she'll eat a few licks, but doesn't get "high" off of it. About 20 minutes later, they both pass out into what looks like a very deep and relaxing nap. I grind it up into a powder in my herb grinder (coffee grinder assigned to herbs only) to refresh it and release more essential oils. This also helps it sink into the fibers of their beds, scratchers, and toys. If they're just eating it, I leave it as it is because it's in fairly larger pieces, so it's easier for them to eat, and easier for me to clean up the leftovers. I like that it is certified organic too.<br /><br />The only reason that I took a star off is that it is very expensive on this site. All the Walmarts I've been to carry it, and the last bag I bought was $2.99).I thought I might check here to find some great deal or buy it in bulk, but the list price today is over $10 for an ounce. That is ridiculous. Sometimes I find this brand at grocery stores for around $4, but that is the highest price I have seen for it.

review/summary: Great For Kitty, & An Easier Clean-Up! :D
review/text: My cat has never really been interested in any other kind of catnip. She'd sniff other brands, or toys with catnip in them, and simply walk away. A little dash of this brand though and she goes bazurk! She LOVES this stuff! It's got her intersted in toys she wasn't before, as well as scratchers she wasn't all that into before. I also like this stuff because when she's done playing with it...AKA rolling it all over the floors....it is MUCH easier to clean up than other brands. Other brands I find to be very ground up into a powder, and it's nearly imposible to clean up completely. This stuff still actually resembles bits of the plant, and sweeps up well off of hardwood and tile floors (instead of blowing all over the place like fine dust), and a quick vaccum gets any bits left behind (instead of being finely ground into every fiber of the carpet). In short, it's great for both of us! I won't buy any other brand now!

review/summary: 12 Paws of Approval
review/text: This is the only catnip that my cats like.  I've bought other brands and they just sniff and walk away.  I've bought toys (filled with catnip) from companies other than Smartycat and my cats will sniff, bat, and walk away.  The first time I bought Smartycat, they went crazy, meowing like they were auditioning for a Friskies commercial (normally, they're very quiet).<br /><br />I gave them each a little pile of their own and their reactions were so funny to me - it's totally like a person high on weed.  One cat will sprawl out in one of the perches in our cat tree, half on his back, legs going every which way, like he's just chilling.  One of the girls gets paranoid... she backs herself into a corner or into one of the "houses" in the cat tree and swings her head back and forth at every noise that's made.  My other female cat gets the munchies - she'll face-plant in the food bowl and literally lays down in bear-skin rug fashion, wrapping her front paws around the food dish.  It's hilarious... some day I'm going to get it on video.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the only catnip they seem to respond to.  If I so much as touch the bag, they come out from high and low to get some nip.  I have to hide the bag because they'll jump up on the bookcase (where I keep it) to try to get into the bag.  More than once, I've come home from work to find the bag on the floor with a hole chewed in the side.<br /><br />I haven't purchased this from Amazon before.  I usually just grab a bag at the pet store when we're out.

review/text: No matter how healthy this is, I just can't force myself to drink it.  To me, it tasted like muddy water.  Even after adding stevia, it tasted little better than sweet muddy water would.  I gave it to someone who likes their teas a little more bland than I do.

review/summary: Herbal Alternative to Caffeinated Beverages, A Different Rooibos
review/text: *****<br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea. It is also rich in phytoestrogens. It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br />*****

This jam is obviously very old and really unusable...you can't spread fruit leather on your toast!<br /><br />Amazon was very nice, as usual, and gave me a full refund.  Would love to re-order this product but afraid to.

review/summary: A Nice And Unusual Treat. Delicious!
review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Store has a variety of imported treats and I can't seem to stay away. This latest trip I bought a packet (10 pieces) of Glico Pocky Almond Crush Biscuit Sticks imported from Japan. If you haven't run into these. they're somewhat like an elongate unsalted pretzel (about 6 inches) and then this stick has been dipped into a delicious milk chocolate and rolled in crushed almonds. Only about the last inch of the stick is not covered. It's sorta like a strange elongate cookie. LOL  But they're delicious and don't last long. One box of these (10 sticks) comes to a 180 calorie serving with 100 of the calories coming from fat. Well, there's no need to eat the whole box, if you can resist. As a desert, it might be appropriate to open a box and then pass around two or three sticks to each person. In any case, they're quite a nice and unusual treat.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

They're about the size of your palm (woman's) and four inches tall. So they're a good size.<br /><br />My only problem with the cakes was they were too sweet for me. My nine year old loved hers, but the adults didn't. Very creamy and packed with flavor, melt in your mouth mousse. All good unless you're not into very sweet things.

review/summary: a mix that is better than homemade
review/text: Betty Crocker Cherry Chip Cake mix is so amazing.  The cherry flavor is sweetly defined but subtle at the same time.  It cooks up so moist.  If making a layered round cake try using Betty Crocker's cherry frosting for the between layers filling and the cream cheese frosting on the top and sides.  If making a sheet cake, I suggest mixing the cherry and cream cheese frosting together and apply as thick top layer... using your electric mixer to blend the two will not only create a uniquely delicious flavor but will make your frosting so light and airy.  This store bought cake mix and frostings creates a better than homemade cake.

I was able to make her 16th birthday cake with it, as it was delivered quickly. I also used about 5 boxes to make cake mix cookies for Christmas. Betty Crocker really needs to put this product back on the store shelves instead of the strawberry cake mix, as I feel it isn't as good as the cherry chip.

review/summary: Awesome Cherry Chip cake mixes
review/text: Wow, I guess I didn't realize that Betty Crocker Cherry Chip cake mixes were so hard to come by.  Our local stores in MI, still carry this flavor.  I was able to take advantage of a sale using coupons and got them for 25 cents a box at one store and free a week later at another store.....They are so delightfully delicious but I use a chocolate frosting on the cherry chip cakes to give it sort of a Black Forest type flavor.  I also use a whipped white frosting and add 2 teaspoons of almond extract to it, blend well, and frost my cherry chip cake with that for another awesome flavor variety. A third kids favorite is to frost the cake with a whipped white frosting that has a half pack of unsweetened cherry flavored Kool-Aid beaten in plus a few drops of red food coloring to make it pinkish in color.  I hope all these ideas are helpful.

review/summary: Bit of a Let-Down for an Earl Grey
review/text: ***<br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon". Tazo describes the aroma as "citrus, lavender, light smoke". You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />Instead of Tazo's Earl Grey, I would highly recommend Numi Earl Grey, which does not disappoint in any way and is comparable in cost. It too can be bought in bulk at the time of this review on Amazon.<br />***

review/summary: Greg's Big TAZO Story
review/text: I discovered Tazo Earl Grey by finding some "cases" of it for sale in a store up in Washington state. $9 for a case of 6 boxes: good deal. Yeah, I thought it a bit pricey at the regular prices, but when this batch ran out, I tried various other brands, even using 2 bags trying to "up" the flavor factor. None of this worked, but using 2 bags came closest. So, taking into account that I was using 2 bags of Trader Joe's Earl Grey to one single bag of Tazo's Earl, the price actually comes out to be about the same and with the Tazo I think the flavor is superiour (or I would not be taking the time to write this up).

review/summary: Tasty, sprightly and delicious!
review/text: Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blending of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are, as the box states, "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." These sumptuous black teas provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend.<br /><br />The fragrance of Tazo Earl Grey is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. The addition of cream creates a lush sensual brew. A topnotch tea blend!<br /><br />Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smoky flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

review/summary: Great Starbucks tea!
review/text: I had stopped by Starbucks one time on the road and got a hot tea, I got Earl Grey.  It was so good I had to have it at home as my regular tea.  They used to sell it at the grocery stores, but now this is the only place I can find it!<br />ORDER this and you will have a great supply of great tea!  Each bag is individually wrapped so they stay fresh even after you open the box.  And the packets are easy to take with you when you are on the go!

review/text: I'd been drinking Twinings Earl Grey for years, then someone gave me some of this tea.  I brewed a cup, took a sip and did NOT like it.  It wasn't bad, just wasn't what I was expecting at all.  I kept drinking and by the end of the cup I LOVED IT.  It has so much more depth of flavor than Twinings, I guess because there is more oil of bergamot and then of course the lavender essence, too.  It is SO good.  I'm never going back to Twinings!

review/summary: Tazo's take on Charles Grey's concoction will knock your whig off!
review/text: I use Earl Grey to help me work.  There, I said it.  It's an important, almost critical, part of my afternoon - and Tazo EG fit the bill like no other EG I've tried.<br /><br />When my local grocery store, for some insane reason, stopped stocking Tazo Earl Grey I switched to Bigelow EG - which is acceptably decent (I really like the foil packs.  I think the packaging helps keep the tea fresher.) - but I still missed that little bergamot punch in the face that the Tazo always delivered.<br /><br />I opted to try the Stash EG, the various Numi EG offerings, and even the Trader Schmoe stuff:  Weak.  Weak.  Weak.  Like other reviewers I often tried double-bagging the weaker teas, but you can imagine the looks people give you when they see you trying to wrangle two tea bags out of your mug, it was just a hassle I didn't need.<br /><br />So, I needed to find a new source for my Tazo Earl Grey fix - and I did.  Thank you, Amazon, for offering this hugely important staple of my life.

review/summary: Somewhat Disappointing !
review/text: These aren't actually bad. They just aren't as good as they should be.  -<br /><br />Stuffed Grape Leaves have always been a favorite of mine. But I have always eaten them fresh cooked, and never canned. And I just assumed that these Stuffed VINE Leaves were the same thing. So maybe that explains the disappointing taste difference.  -<br /><br />These leaves don't have the strong Tangy flavor that I expect. The rice stuffing is overcooked and mushy, and lacking in flavor. They taste best when served chilled, with some lemon juice squeezed on top.  -<br /><br />If I can't find a better tasting canned product. Then I would probably order these again.

Bars were really cheap in Europe, and available everywhere from newspaper stands to supermarkets.

review/summary: overly sweet.... totally over shadows natural flavor of the berries
review/text: I love  dried fruit and buy frequently. I have bought other products from Traverse Bay and truely enjoyed them But this product no so much.<br /><br />They berries are a generous size  and all are sliced. Unforutnately they found it necessary to overly sweeten the cranberries to the point that the cranberry flavor is totally overshadowed by the sweetness. Cranberries that are appropriated sweetened still have a slight tartness that allows the nature cranberry flavor to be perserved..<br /><br />These do not allow that..  after consumeing more than 1/2 of a one of the containers both right out of the box and also mixed in with nuts and as a add in for  cranberry muffins. I have been very disappointed..<br /><br />These will not be reordered and I orginally had this on a subscribe and save plan but canceld it after getting a good testing of this product.<br /><br />Will stick with Travese Bay Cherries or Blueberries.. going forward..
