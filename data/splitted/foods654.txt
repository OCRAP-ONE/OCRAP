review/summary: Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever.

review/text: I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog. I would highly recommend Wellness to everyone! You can't go wrong with this stuff!

review/summary: Almost as good as the lamb
review/text: After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.

review/text: I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/summary: Stinky but my dogs love it!
review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.

My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China, I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet's many other products until they are made in the US. As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs. I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all broken up and were in crumbs.

review/summary: Nice, Healthy Treat for Dogs
review/text: I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive broken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you.

review/summary: My Dogs Love These!
review/text: Ok, let's be honest. "Dogs will be dogs" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're "guilt-free"; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them "junk food", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit.

review/summary: My Maggie Lives for Her Treatie-Time
review/text: My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into "Treatie-Time." Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to "earn" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the "girls" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my "grand-dog" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a "luxury" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their "treatie-time."<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!

review/summary: Amazing dog treat.
review/text: Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be broken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!

review/text: As a Bed & Breakfast owner and a serious online bargain-shopper, I happened upon this product while searching for the best price on K-Cups.  Needless to say, I serve a LOT of coffee!  Unique in appearance, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups deliver a great cup of coffee!  As other reviews state, you'll notice a heavenly, strong coffee aroma when opening the air-tight plastic packaging.  Once opened, I store my Fog Chaser K-Cups in an empty, (clean) large metal coffee can.  It not only keeps the aroma intact, it keeps the K-Cups nice and fresh for brewing.<br /><br />If you haven't already tried these K-Cups, do!  I think you'll be impressed - and pleased that you don't have to pay top-dollar for a quality product!

review/summary: size and shape worried me- but taste is where they excel
review/text: The size and shape worried me.  I am glad that I read other reviews first.  The top of these cups are not as big around (diameter) as a regular k-cup.  In fact I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.  But they do.  Then they lack all the plastic that surrounds a normal k-cup on the bottom.  So they definitely look different and weird.  But taste is what is important.  Well taste and price.<br /><br />Taste- I have only tasted Fog Chaser.  It definitely has an upfront bitterness (or acidity) to it.  It is the first thing I notice.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually enjoy some acidity to my cup of coffee.  Otherwise I find it to be a bit bland.  After the acidity comes a great taste.  Very rich and strong.  In fact I think this is the strongest, boldest k-cup I have had.  Only real concern here is the packaging allows the coffee to go stale faster than if each was sealed individually.  It is nice that they come in three separate sealed bags.  But I think we will go through them fast enough that it would not be a problem.  If you drink very slowly and allow these to linger for several weeks I think the taste will definitely be an issue.<br /><br />Price- At 49 cents per cup this is unbeatable.  Then you have the option of buying on subscription and get them at 41 cents per.<br /><br />Conclusion= I love rich/strong coffee and I love the price.  sold.

review/summary: A hearty, fresh, and somewhat bold taste
review/text: I really like this coffee.  Rich, flavorful, bold, and very tasty.<br /><br />I was put off by the odd look of the cup at first...as many others have described, it looks strange when you first see it.  If you turn it upside down it looks like a cranium in a hair net.  But it's just as easy to use as a typical k-cup, so no problem there.  The only problem you might have is trying to place it in one of those vertical k-cup dispensers you can get wherever you buy k-cups.  This cup doesn't sit well in there.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice when you open the cardboard box and cut open the rather thick plastic pouch the 12 containers come in: the smell.  It's extremely rich, a very deep, bold smell that makes you think of your very best cup of coffee ever.  Think about it, though: that's the smell of your coffee when it's manufactured and placed within the container.  I doubt the plastic k-cups are as bold when they're tapped into by the Keurig machine...I'm sure they've disseminated some of the freshness on their way to you.<br /><br />What I do to keep that flavor is to take each cup out of the nice thick bag and immediately re-seal the bag with a strong clip.  I feel that retains the flavor.  In that sense, I'm glad they don't fit on the vertical k-cup dispensers...I like that the freshness stays intact within the thick plastic bag.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this flavor.  Keep it secure in the plastic pouch and you'll have a great fresh taste every time you want a cup.

review/text: My girlfriend and I got a Keurig a couple years ago. Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig.

I wish I could put them in my K-Cup carousel, but I guess I can live without that little perk in exchange for a more affordable K-cup that still tastes great.  I don't understand why people complaining about them going stale don't put them in a ziploc bag after opening.  We consume at least four cups of coffee per day in our house, so we go through one bag of 12 in 3 days or less.  That's not enough time for the coffee to go stale inside a zip loc bag!  Give these a try.  I am going to be sampling the other blends, for sure.

What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, "the VUE"  that uses different and patented cups.

review/summary: Good, but I don't like it black at all
review/text: I always try my coffee straight black with no cream or sugar the first time. I did not care much for it in that form. Once I put creamer and sugar in though, it is a really good cuppa joe. I probably won't be ordering again since I don't always have cream/sugar available, but I think it is still a solid 4 star since it is so good when properly doctored up.

review/summary: Good coffee, bad packaging
review/text: One of my biggest pet peeves is over-packaging, so I gave the "frustration free" pods a shot. I like that there's less waste to dump in landfills. However, the pods don't work well in my Keurig. In order to brew, I have to push down on the handle until the cycle is done, otherwise, nothing happens. I really like the flavor of the coffee, but keeping it fresh is an issue, even though I store the pods in air-tight containers. I probably won't buy coffee packaged this way in the future.

review/summary: Best tasting coffee I have had for the Keurig
review/text: The San Fracisco Bay Coffee One Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers have been the best tasting coffee I have had from the Keurig.  I have tried just about every K-cup brand.  This is not packaged in the typical K-cup plastic cups.  It comes in bulk (12 per bag) and the One Cups have the same top as the K-cup but insead of the plastic housing it is a filter material.  This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast.

review/summary: Best cup of coffee from a Keurig yet.
review/text: Tried these pods since they were on sale, and glad I did.  Very robust but super smooth flavor, almost sweet.  The only downside to these is having to keep them in a sealed bag, which isn't much of a negative...  Can't stop raving about how good this coffee tastes.  My husband loves strong coffee and I usually don't like most of them because they can be bitter.  This is the smoothest strong coffee I have ever had!

review/text: This is pretty good coffee at a very reasonable price compared with other Keurig coffees.  I liken it more to Dunkin coffee than Starbucks.  The pods work fine even though as others have pointed out, they are not true K Cups.  They come in 3 x 12-pod bags, and they stay fresh until you open the bag.  You can reseal the bag with tape, or transfer the pods to a ziplock bag.  I happened to have an OXO coffee storing container that keeps them fresh after they are taken out of their plastic bag.<br /><br />Give 'em a try, they're not half bad, and it sure beats paying $15 for 24 K Cups.

review/summary: Simple the Best Keurig Cups
review/text: This is absolutely the best Keurig Cup coffee I've tasted, and I've tried a lot of them.  (I don't call them K-Cups just because they're made a little differently -- not encased in plastic, just a little filter filled with the grounds.)<br /><br />All the K-Cup varieties I've tried seem to brew a bit on the weak side.  This actually tastes like a full-bodied cup of coffee!  The Fog Chaser flavor is bold by nature, so if you like a milder coffee it might not be your best choice.  It's not bitter like some bold coffees can be -- it's actually quite smooth and seems to have very low acidity.<br /><br />My favorite way to enjoy coffee has always been a French press, but since I found this Fog Chaser coffee I haven't used my press in months.  It's that good.

review/summary: Good value for "Kcups"
review/text: I bought these "kcups" to save money as the cost on my usual Kcups rose to 51 cents a cup on subscribe and save and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else online or locally. These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a "Kcup"!! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>

review/summary: Good quality coffee-- cheaper and less waste
review/text: I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to "chase the fog away" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste.

review/summary: SF Bay Fog Chaser K Cup - A pleasant surprise
review/text: I saw this brand for the first time at a local supermarket yesterday and figured for $6.49 for a box of 12 (that's 54 cents a cup), I'd give it a try.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, its not actually a plastic K Cup but a rigid rim with a foil lid attached to a filter filled with coffee. The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the "Keurig" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out. Really, who wants 80 cups of something you might not like? But now I know it's a winner, I'll be getting them here regularly where they are even more affordable.

review/summary: Good Coffee, Different Packaging
review/text: I love discovering and drinking a variety of different coffee's in the never ending quest for the perfect cup.  The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.<br /><br />The journey brought me to San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser.  Having had the opportunity to travel I had experienced the the brand and was excited to see it "available soon" in K-Cups so I didn't hesitate to preorder.<br /><br />As I have come to rely on, Amazon delivered on time and I was anxious to try it the next morning.<br /><br />The Coffee (5 Stars)<br /><br />- Fog Chaser didn't fail to impress. In fact I would say it over delivered on quality based on my expectations - The rich full bodied taste and smooth finish made an excellent addition to my morning routine and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Packaging (2 Stars)<br /><br />-  The K-Cupish like packaging, though innovative leaves room for improvement.  Instead of the traditional solid sealed K-Cup we have all grown use to the San Francisco Bay Coffee comes in a hybrid type packaging.  The coffee is held in a coffee filter material pouch that is attached to a K-Cup like top. It doesn't effect how you us it but it does effect a few other things.<br /><br />First off I seem to get more coffee grounds in my cup than I do with a traditional K-Cup.<br /><br />In addition the individual cups, because the coffee is exposed to air via the filter pouch freshness becomes an issue.  They come in the box sealed in an air tight bag but it is not resealable so once you open it the remaining coffee is exposed.  If this was the only coffee I drank it would probably not be an issue but because I jump around a lot it sits longer effecting the taste.  I guess I could place them in a resealable bag but call me lazy or cheap but I don't and feel I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />Lastly, though very nit-picky the individual cups will not sit in the coffee carousel I have on the counter next to the maker (you probably wouldn't want them to because of the freshness issue) but again it just makes it a little more inconvenient.<br /><br />As I drag myself into the kitchen after loosing the battle with my alarm clocks snooze button and I struggle in to make the first cup to get the caffeine flowing through my system I just don't like to work that hard at it.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />- The packaging itself will probably not keep me from reordering but it will be much less often than I would normally with some of my other favorites.<br /><br />So with all that said, if the packaging doesn't bother you or effect long term freshness, you are in for a very nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: Very good coffee with less packaging
review/text: This is very tasty coffee and a bit cheaper than Keurig-sanctioned k-cups. The pod packaging is minimal.  I agree there is very little waste.  The top looks like a typical k-cup and the bottom looks like a filter.  You will want some sort of tupperware or jar to store the onecups once you open the pouch they come in since they will be exposed somewhat to air and lose freshness otherwise.  I just use a spare ice cream tub and dump the open bag in there.  Perfect!<br /><br />Today I made myself a larger cup than usual by accident and it was still rich and delicious.<br /><br />I usually drink the Newman's own coffee that I buy at Costco to give you an idea of my tastes.  I think this is better.

review/summary: Pleased with purchase so far.
review/text: I love the convenience of K cups but I don't love the waste so I was looking for an alternative. I've already tried the reusable substitutes but I could never get the right grind of coffee beans to produce the coffee flavor/robustness that I like. This coffee is a great bargain for the price, especially with the Subscribe and Save. It is not my absolute favorite, I still prefer Newman's Own blend, but it is better tasting to me than other K Cup offerings(the Folgers blends for example).  I hope San Francisco Bay comes out with more dark/bold roasts because I would definitely try them.

review/text: I'm a coffee fiend.  I love coffee dark and strong.  I love this coffee,  It just tastes good.  Some people have complained about the packing bags that the k-cups are stored in.  I just stored the unused portions in a zip lock bag.  Problem solved.

review/summary: Better Than Most K-Cups!
review/text: I hesitated placing my first order of the San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup. After receiving it, I was impressed and thought it was rather good. So glad to find a cheaper alternative to the K-cup.

review/summary: Great cup of joe
review/text: Nice cup of coffee, I'm not a tree-hugger, but if you are, you will appreciate that it only has a plastic ring/top as opposed to the normal whole plastic k-cup.  I tried it because it is a little cheaper, but still convenient, with the rising cost of coffee (and everything else) compared to grinding yourself and using the ekcobrew (which works much better than the standard k-cup self grind accessory, but is still a bit of a hassle with clean up).  We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).  Overall a nice strong cup that is smooth, with less hassle than self grind and fairly cheap (even cheaper with subscribe and save)

review/summary: ahhh smell the coffee!
review/text: I have been on Subscribe and Save for Kcups since I bought a Keurig 4 years ago.  At the time, I thought the 'frustration free' box and Coffee People cups were great.  But over the years the price has creeped up and it was brought up my little cups weren't exactly 'green.'  HMPH!  SF Coffee Pod change everything.  First of all it tastes great.  It is the closest to a cup of coffee from a coffee house.  The pod design allows for a greener pod, but also more coffee per pod than a traditional Kcup.  But the real advantage is having the wonderful smell of coffee.  I've missed it.  I have a done of airtight plastic containers that keep the pods fresh and look forward to opening it and smelling the coffee.  :)<br /><br />if you are looking for an alternative for you Keurig, give this a try.  It wins on many levels including, price, taste and smell.  Real coffee fans will understand what I mean.

review/summary: Works in the B3000 brewer
review/text: While some products like the "My K-Cup" don't work in all brewers, the Rogers "One Cup" products are more compatible.  They work just fine in the Keurig B-3000, which is a large brewer aimed at the office market.  Sometimes you may get the "no K-cup detected" warning, but you can ignore it.<br /><br />It's great to have an alternative to the Green Mountain products.

review/summary: K-Cup that tastes like coffee
review/text: Finally, a k-cup that actually tastes like a "real" cup of coffee.  However, keep in mind you cannot use your normal k-cup "display" set up that most of you have.  You must keep these k-cups sealed in an airtight container to keep them fresh, as they do not have the plastic housing you are use to.  Perhaps this is why the coffee actually tastes like coffee.  Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.  You have a normal coffee filter-type-fabric encasing the coffee. Looks different than your normal k-cup, but tastes soooo much better.  I'm glad I read a review and purchased this product.  Hope you do too.

review/summary: Average cup of coffee
review/text: I ordered a box based on the reviews and I must say I am somewhat dissapointed. If you enjoy a full flavored medium roast you'll enjoy this one. It has complex flavors and a smooth finish.<br />That said, it's definitely not full bodied or bold in flavor. My favorite k-cups are Coffee People Organic, Newman's Special Blend Organic, Emril's Big Easy Bold and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso. If you like deep bold coffee flavor this one comes up short.

review/summary: Cheaper price and better flavor
review/text: SF Bay Coffee One Cup is a great option. I felt the coffee was stronger, or less watery, than most k-cups, and the price is a big savings.  It comes with 12 in one sealed bag, so I rolled the bag up tightly between uses and used them up within a few days. Not a good choice if you want lots of variety.

review/summary: Fog Chaser for Sure!
review/text: The name of this coffee sure caught my eye.  It is indeed a Fog Chaser.  Once or twice a week I get interested in a couple of cups of this delightful French Roast.  Amazon.com sent me an e-mail and I thought it would be fun to give it a try.  It's strong and delightful!!!!  As a senior, I find it's exciting to try new things.  And, some turn out to be winners.

review/summary: Odd package but good coffee
review/text: While the container that goes into the brewer looks odd it seems to work well.  The coffee arrived in a box with three individual bags of 12 "pods".  I used the first two of these this morning and did not have any problems with the brewing.  They seemed to work just fine.  I liked the strong robust flavor of the coffee.
