review/summary: Love This Crunchy Granola
review/text: It's organic. It's not genetically modified. It has 0 transfat. It's not surprisingly cholesterol free. It's only 140 calories per 1/4 cup serving, but try limiting yourself to such a stingy sized serving. I couldn't and didn't.<br /><br />One morning I found myself with no bread for toast and only a box of Raisin Bran in the cupboard. On the counter was my unopened bag of Love  Crunch granola. Not wanting to dilute its taste with milk, I sampled this tasty treat right out of the bag. The resealable bag resisted tearing at 6 in the morning, but I did magage to make a crooked tear across the top and gain access to my treasure. As far as granola goes, this is as good as it gets with the merging of crunch, exquisite flavor, wholesome grains, and a hint of fruit.<br /><br />With six grams of fat per decadent serving, it's probably best not to eat this heavenly food out of the bag as I did and am doing at this very moment. Many large, finger-plucking chunks of granola and chocolate are in the bag, but there are also small, sunflower seed-sized pieces that tend to slip through the fingers and fall on one's lap, desk, or keyboard. Luckily I've got a couple small vacuums within reach.<br /><br />The price here for a six bag order seems reasonable. I just don't know if someone like this Potato Head with so little will power could resist the temptation of all that goodness so near and so accessible.

review/summary: Good, not good for you.
review/text: Tasty, delicious, chocolaty, great oats and not overly sweet. Love the taste!<br />But 140 calories (55 from fat) in a 1/4 of cup? Who eats 1/4 of cup for breakfast? Because I eat cup or more..<br />So this is pure indulgence, treat.<br /><br />Also 1 bag lasted me 4 breakfasts, I guess I will stick to regular oatmeal;)

review/summary: Tastes great, but serving size is ridiculous
review/text: Despite looking good "on paper," this granola isn't very nutritious.  The recommended serving size (there must be some government regulation that pegs cereal servings at around 1 ounce) is only 1/4 cup!  Who is going to sit down and have just 1/4 cup of cereal for breakfast?  I'm thinking more like 3/4 cup.  This will put you at 500 calories if you add a cup of (skim) milk.  And most of the protein will be coming from the milk, since even three "servings" of this granola will only give you 6g.  (See the pictures I uploaded for a closeup of the Nutrition Facts label and what one serving looks like.)<br /><br />But if you do go and have yourself a 500-calorie bowl of cereal (570 if you're using whole milk), it's actually pretty filling.  With 18g of sugar in a 3/4-cup triple serving, you're going to be feeling kind of guilty, but the triple serving would have 6g of fiber, so at least that will help slow down the sugar spike.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good.  It's kind of like you went for a hike with a chocolate bar and some trail mix and they melted together.  Can't go wrong with that!  With the notes of coconut, it kind of reminded me of German chocolate icing.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like the berries, but I do, and I actually wish the mix had more (and bigger pieces of them; these are minuscule).  Watch out if you order online and the weather is hot.  My bag arrived kind of melty (made me feel like I'd been hiking!), but I take that as a sign of the chocolate's quality.<br /><br />If this weren't so carby (and expensive), I could happily sit down and eat it every morning.  But it is, so I won't.

review/summary: Is organic the new junk food?
review/text: Ah granola, I am slowly beginning to develop a love-hate relationship with it.  Love because it is very versatile and tasty.  Hate because many times granola is promoted as a healthy food and I have discovered (many times) it is not.  Therefore, I find myself on a pilgrimage to find the best tasting and most healthy granola out there.<br /><br />This brings us to Nature's Path Love Crunch Granola.  This product is a certified organic food with no trans fat and whole grains.  Unfortunately the serving size betrays the calorie count.  So while this product is made with healthy ingredients, the serving size betrays the portions.  Which I find odd because this granola has chocolate and freeze dried raspberries in it.  I have to tell you, I had to dig, no exaggeration for chocolate, excuse me Italian chocolate and raspberries.  Again if there aren't chunks of chocolate (or even raspberries) how is this so high in calories?<br /><br />As for the taste, I must confess that it is pleasant.  Nevertheless, it isn't anything to become too excited over.  I have tasted granola that is half the price that has tasted better.  I have only eaten the granola by itself, I am sure in yogurt, over a salad or ice cream and as a cereal it might elevate the taste.  I will eat this granola, but it will not be something I would attain again.  Under the assumption a person is searching for organic and/or vegetarian granola, you might have found your match.  I for one find organic products, in many cases, as a marketing ploy.  As for finding a great tasting and healthy granola, it still hasn't happened.

review/summary: 10 Servings?  Are you sure?
review/text: This product is pretty much exactly what it promises.  Granola, dried strawberries, and little bars of dark chocolate.  I definitely agree with the name "Love Crunch" because I loved it and it crunched.  But, wow, 10 servings per bag?  I read this after I had eaten about half the bag in 30 seconds.  So, at 140 calories per serving, this bag is 1400 calories.  Yikes.  I had to immediately introduce my underweight kids to it to get it out of my house because I would have eaten the other 700 calories within the hour if I hadn't.  Lucky for me, they loved it too and polished off the bag.  Whew!  Crisis averted!  But, if you need high calories or have way more self control than me, it is absolutely delicious!

review/summary: Is there such a thing as too chocolaty? Yes.
review/text: I love chocolate. If a manufacturer wants to guarantee that I'll toss a box of their product into the basket at the grocery store, just add some chocolate. Well, unless it's bacon, bacon doesn't need chocolate.<br /><br />When I saw this Nature's Path, I thought it would be a great replacement for my typical evening treat of Cocoa Krispies. And health-wise, it is a step in the right direction. A definite plus, because I can now say "healthy" and "chocolate cereal" in the same sentence.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have finally found something that I consider too rich and chocolaty. The actual cocoa-saturated oat clusters are very good, not too sweet, just the right amount of crunch (if you eat fast enough). If they'd added more than a thimbleful of the dried strawberries, I think the taste would be darned near irresistible. Unfortunately, there's not enough of the tangy berry to offset the very rich and sweet chocolate. The addition of actual chunks of dark chocolate just really take it over the top.<br /><br />This does make me want to try some of Nature's Path other cereal offerings, the quality of the product is very good, and the ingredients are healthy.

review/summary: Tasty Granola - Now With Stingy-Berries!
review/text: Actually, this granola has freeze-dried strawberries which are quite tasty...but the manufacturer is very stingy with them. I'd guess that an entire bag has the equivalent of one strawberry sliced, diced, and dried. I definitely wanted more! The chocolate chunks are also tasty but sort of few and far between. The granola itself is quite good (albeit a little oatmeal-cookie sweet). But if Love Crunch is going to make chocolate and red berries so prominent on the packaging, they really should make sure that not a mouthful will go by in which you don't get at least a taste of one of those extras. As those components are obviously added after the fact (they're not embedded in the granola itself) they really should be a little more generous.

review/summary: Very good!
review/text: This granola tastes amazing, especially if you are a chocolate lover and I most definitely am! The red berries give it a light and sweet taste and is the perfect accent to this treat. I was curious about the name and the history behind this granola is that it was created by a couple for their wedding. I thought that was so cute, but even more impressive is that they contribute a portion of their proceeds to charity. So thoughtful! Anyway, it is very tasty and I will be buying this granola because not only do I like it but my kids do, too. And the kids rule this roost! ;)

review/summary: Very good if it's what you're looking for!
review/text: I tried the Dark Chocolate and Red Berries flavor, and it tasted good, with just a little chocolate, and some berries (but not as many as I'd expected, compared to other cereals with berries).  From some of the other reviews it seems like the proportions of the different ingredients might vary somewhat from bag to bag for whatever reason.  Hopefully they can get that sorted out, but otherwise I think this is a great product IF you're looking for natural/organic/non-GMO and want to help support a good cause at the same time.<br /><br />I end up rating a lot of products 4 stars because there's no 3 1/2 or 4 1/2 and a product has to be pretty close to what I consider perfect to get 5 stars from me.  The seeming lack of berries (maybe just a result of variation from one bag to another), and the price prevent me from being able to give this 5 stars, but I do certainly like the taste, and I like the idea of supporting companies that are responsible and willing to give back to the community.<br /><br />If I had the time I'd make my own granola more often, as that allows me to choose exactly what goes into it, and save some money too, but since I don't, this will do fine for those "granola mornings" or as a snack.

review/summary: Crunchy fiber deliciousness!
review/text: There's a difference between all-natural and organic.  Poisonous mushrooms are all-natural, proving that foods that boast about naturalness aren't necessarily all that impressive.  Organic means that the food is made from some of the healthiest ingredients available, and this granola is organic.<br /><br />Now, while we've established that this granola is healthy, there's still the issue of taste.  Too often, organic food is extraordinarily healthy but tastes like cardboard coated with mud.  Thankfully, that is not the case with Love Crunch!  My taste buds tingled with every tantalizing bite of this delectable granola, and I could rest assured that I was getting a good source of fiber and many other nutrients.  There were chunks of dark chocolate and berries mingling with the granola clusters that would excite my tongue even more when I would munch on one of those.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have stated that they found this to be more of a snack food than a breakfast food; honestly, I would use it for both.  I found that I was reaching for this in the morning more often than my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52">Cheerios Honey Nut Cereal</a>, however, there were also times when I would be snacking on it in the afternoon.  It's so good for any time of the day or any type of preparation.  If you like your granola with milk or yogurt, this will work very well for that.  I ate it plain most of the time, but it really can be used any way you would normally use granola, except for maybe baking.<br /><br />Overall, I love this stuff, and I will most likely be buying more soon.  It's probably most comparable to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6KBYE">Special K Chocolatey Delight Cereal</a> but with healthier and more delicious ingredients (and granola instead of cereal flakes).  I highly recommend this to granola/chocolate enthusiasts.  It's organic, but it's also good.

review/summary: A Perfectly Delicious Snack
review/text: Upon opening the bag, the wonderful aroma of chocolate was the first thing I noticed. With chunks of chocolate, dried raspberries and strawberries, it was impossible to not want to sample immediately. The flavor reminded me of those no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies that everyone's grandma makes, but with added chunks of chocolate, coconut and berries. Delicious!<br /><br />Although too sweet for my taste as a cereal, this makes a delightful, healthy and satisfying snack, making it perfect for those days when you want something sweet or chocolaty. It is fantastic used as a topping for yogurt or added to hot cereal to give it a little sparkle.<br /><br />Perfect for gift-giving, "Love Crunch" will be a welcomed gift for any occasion. Instead of sending a gift basket to the college student, consider sending them this healthy alternative. It's organic and full of heart-healthy ingredients that will give you the satisfaction of sending something good for them. They on the other hand will be thrilled you sent them something chocolate that certainly can't be healthy!

review/text: I thought this granola tasted pretty good. It is crunchy and not overly sweet. I wish there were more dried berries though. Also, for people who hate coconut, there is coconut in this granola and the flavor is subtle but there. I tried this with milk (like cereal) but liked it better without the milk. There were some chunks that were a bit too big to eat with a spoon, but I'm sure it's easy to smash them into smaller chunks in the bag. It's also filling enough that I can eat it for breakfast and not get hungry too soon.

review/summary: as good as homemade
review/text: I'm not generally a fan of store-bought granola, and usually make my own instead. But I have to admit that this one is just as good. It has tiny chocolate chunks and freeze-dried strawberries, and just the right quantity of small clumps. The label also has less "bad news" than I'd expect--far less sugar than most breakfast cereals (6 grams per serving), is relatively low in fat unlike other granolas (55 calories out of 140), and no trans fat. The latter being more surprising because of the chocolate chunks. As a bonus, I recognize all of the ingredients too--no chemical cocktail here. It's not often you can find something packaged that isn't also heavily processed, but this seems to fit the bill.<br /><br />Incidentally, in three-plus years of getting free items from teh Amazon Vine program, this is the first item I have subsequently decided to purchase with my own money.

review/text: This Nature's Path Love Crunch organic granola is healthy and tastes great.  You could mix it in with plain Greek yogurt for a protein-filled power snack.  Or you can just enjoy it as we did- plain out of the bag.  Each 1/4th cup is 140 calories and contains 6 grams of sugar, so try not to get too carried away- you could do some serious damage to the bag in one sitting (it's that tasty).<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the amount of dark chocolate and red berries in the bag is actually very small.  You have to dig around for them.  If you buy this granola, be prepared for the lack of these treats.

review/summary: Tasty Granola
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the bag of granola from Nature's Path.<br /><br />1/4 cup (30 grams) is 140 calories, with 6 grams of sugar (or 1/5, 20% of the serving).<br /><br />20 grams of carbs, and 2 grams of fiber.  A touch of salt, and 6 grams of fat, another 20% of the serving.<br /><br />Everything in the product is Organic, other than the salt (can that even be not organic?).<br /><br />Anyways, this is a nice topper to sugar free cereals or low sugar cereals.  And also it is a nice with sugar free almond milk.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this sweet indulgence, in moderation.  The dark chocolate is a teeny bit bitter, which I like, and the strawberries add even more love.

review/summary: NO ONE can eat just 1/4 cup of this!!! &lt;;-D
review/text: I just consumed, in one sitting, about 1,120 calories of this elixir of the granola gods - and I'm not done yet -- there is a VERY good chance that in the next 30 minutes, I will have consumed another 280 calories and then the bag will be empty.<br /><br />There are ten servings in this bag  -- 1/4 cup each is 140 calories. I doubt that anyone other than perhaps someone with extreme willpower and self-control (but why!!??) would limit themselves to a 1/4 cup of this wonderful (AND it's organic and NON GMO!) granola.<br /><br />I ate a few handfuls (then a few/many more) -- I put it in a WHOLE (9 ounce) cup and added hot coffee (yumyumyum!) then tried it in a cup of hot water. Then I poured this granola into another cup into which I added cold water -- you get the idea-- I have been eating many servings of Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola (Dark Chocolate and Berries) nonstop all day at my desk in my humble cubicle and it has been a INTENSE and wonderful experience. The only thing(s) I did NOT do were to add cream and then at the next sitting, to add soy (only because they were unavailable - my office mates use that powdery fake "stuff") -- but I have NO DOUBT that either addition would have been embraced by the subtle, chocolate-ness and taste-bud-embracing crunchiness of this delightful concoction. Try it atop ice cream with WHIPPED CREAM! Try it in your Yogurt!!!<br /><br />Could I taste the berries? No, not really  -- peering into the bag gave me a good look at them -- they are there -- but I have no doubt that they too contributed to the excellence of this Granola Nirvana.<br /><br />Could I taste the delightful chocolate squares that are interspersed among the chocolate-y graola chunks in this bag? Yes, when eating out of hand they were smooth and melted in my mouth for intense chocolate flavor -- it was almost a sacrilege to pour hot water on them in the cup, but (sigh) for the sake of this review process, I did.<br /><br />I could see the little flax seeds swimming around in there -- and as for the coconut, I could barely taste it, and since I have this small problem with coconut (not really a fan of it), I was very happy to realize that it DID not impact my enjoyment of this granola -- so THAT is GOOD<br /><br />As in any granola, there are alot of calories from fat (55 calories -- about 39% of the total calories are fat). NO Cholesterol, low sodium, some fiber (of course, the coconut and the flax seeds and the oats, maybe even the fruits).<br /><br />Since this Granola was created for a wedding, then the calories should not really be a problem -- for what is a wedding but a joyful occasion where many calories are burned off? So I would suggest that this Granola not only be enjoyed as a breakfast cereal for those who are embarking on the usual stressful commute (think "run for bus" "run for train" etc etc) but also for lunchbox treats, and definitely camping and hiking. It WILL give your day a Lift.<br /><br />So what's NOT to LOVE about this? Those who have allergies should read the label -- "contains soy", and "produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts and tree nuts".<br /><br />PS-- So why did I not add milk to this LOVElLY Granola? Because I am lactose Intolerant. "Then why add Cream, Ace?" you might say. Well, because cream has alot of little fat globs in it and that makes it digest slower -- ergo I rarely have trouble digesting cream (or whipped cream either, to my delight).

review/summary: Really good chocolate taste
review/text: I usually make my own granola by Alton Brown, too, but this is decent.  My husband hates coconut so this is a good cereal for him.<br /><br />I agree that 1/4 cup sounds like not very much but granola sticks to you better than flakes and is usually the amount I eat with milk, anyway.  It doesn't get soggy but isn't so firm that you need to see the dentist after eating it.<br /><br />It's great as a snack, but you could easily polish it off at one sitting if you eat it while watching a movie or driving so portion it out.  Absolutely yummy!

review/summary: Breakfast Dessert
review/text: This "Love Crunch" is a curious product....organic dark chocolate granola. More of a deconstructed trail bar than a breakfast cereal, it tastes pretty good, as well it should. In addition to tiny dark chocolate chunks, it contains rolled oats, flax seeds, dried coconut, cocoa, tiny bits of freeze dried strawberries and raspberries, rice starch, sea salt, and natural flavors.<br /><br />Tipping the scales at 140 calories for a 1/4 cup, even before you add milk, this is not to be consumed daily by dieters. Those watching their carbohydrate intake should also beware as 1/4 cup contains 20g of carbs and only 2g of protein. On the good side, the granola is low sodium, contains 0g trans fat, and is cholesterol free.<br /><br />This product is Certified Organic; guaranteed to be grown without chemical herbicides or pesticides, or synthetic preservatives and additives. It is also Non-GMO certified, which means that the ingredients are guaranteed not to be genetically modified.<br /><br />For every bag of "Love Crunch" sold, Nature's Path Organic, the manufacturer, "will donate an equal amount in food or cash, up to $1 million".

review/summary: A Little Pricey......But Delicious
review/text: This Love Crunch taste's so good it's kind of hard to keep in mind its on the better side of snack foods.  This is a very tasty trail mix right out of the pouch.  It's loaded with all the ingredients listed without being bogged down with peanuts or some other cheap filler like other mixes.  And no doubt its made up of quality stuff all the way through.  Even the small morsels of chocolate have a rich creamy taste worthy of being called gourmet.  Add milk or cream and you have a truly delicious concoction one could really get used too in the morning, or as a healthy snack any time.  It may be a little pricey, but the taste and quality well make up for it.  Fresh, delicious, and recommended...: )

review/summary: Too Much of a Good Thing
review/text: It's a challenge to review food, since so much of it is a matter of taste.  Although I think some people will like this granola a lot, it wasn't for me.<br /><br />This is a high-quality granola, flavored with cocoa and coconut, with chunks of dark chocolate and freeze dried strawberries and berries.  The texture is excellent, and contrasts well with milk or yogurt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I thought there was way too much chocolate.  The dominant flavor is cocoa, followed by the oats, then the chunks of chocolate.  The berries are pretty sparse, and I couldn't detect the coconut.  As I said, it might be right for some people, but I found the cocoa aftertaste to be offputting and am not a fan.

review/summary: Chocolate & Berries, I think not!!
review/text: The package states that there are "chocolate chunks" and "tangy" red berries within this granola.  Well,neither I or any of my friends could taste anything but a dry rolled oats concoction.  The fact that the company states it will donate an equal amount of money to a food bank for every bag purchased is exemplary but will not make any difference to me as the lack of taste will make certain that I do not purchase this product.

review/summary: Almost TOO good!
review/text: I love granola, so I was thrilled to try this product.  I eat as a snack (i.e., right out of the bag) rather than a cereal.  Before I even tasted it, I checked out the nutritional profile, and I was extremely pleased.  Compared to other granolas, "Love Crunch" (love the name!) is relatively love in fat (6 grams overall, 1 gram saturated) and quite low in sugar (6 grams, just slightly over a teaspoon--most granolas are loaded with added sugar!).  The also are 2 grams of protein (a bit on the low side since this granola doesn't contain nuts), 2 grams of fiber, and 14 grams whole grains per serving.<br /><br />Of course, a serving size is only 1/4 cup, which is quite small--and that's where the problem comes in.  When I first tried the granola, I'm sure I ate WAY more than a serving; I could have easily finished off half the bag if I hadn't stopped myself!  (For reference, the bag actually contains about TEN servings.)  This granola has a GREAT taste: it is surprisingly sweet given the lack of added sugar (it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice), but it is also nicely oat-y, with a bit of a chocolate flavor as well (from the added cocoa).  The granola has little bits of dried berries--these kind of get lost in there, but what you DEFINITELY notice is the tiny little chunks of dark chocolate!  Finally, I also loved the texture of the granola, which included plenty of big clumps.<br /><br />Frankly, I can't imagine anyone who likes granola and chocolate NOT liking this product--highly recommended!

review/summary: Yummy! But "not for breakfast anymore"
review/text: All natural ingredients, most of which we'd consider wholesome. Great mouth feel & crunch, fabulous taste. I mean the chocolate pieces were good enough to pick them out an eat them all by themselves. (not that I did that....much).<br /><br />But, to me this is more of a healthy snack than a breakfast food. Look, for a snack, it's amazingly nutritional, and way better than almost any other snack food. It's tasty, easy to eat, has fiber, good nutrients, and not a lot of fat.<br /><br />However, for a breakfast cereal, I'd want something less sweet, with less fat and more fiber.  Of course, personal tastes differ on this.  Some folks still eat Coco-puffs for breakfast.<br /><br />I got the Dark Chocolate and Red Berries version. Score!<br /><br />However, as a snack I give this two thumbs up!<br /><br />Edited to add: I passed around the rest of the package on Game nite. Everyone agreed- super tasty, great as a snack. But several others also had reservations about it for breakfast. On the other hand, one of is a Father of some young boys, and they eat tons of over-sweet cereal.  The Dad thought this might be a good way to wean them away from junk-food cereals, he's going to order some and give it a try.

review/summary: Like Homemade
review/text: After learning the joys of homemade granola from Alton Brown, I have avoided most store-bought types.  However, it is convenient sometimes and fun to try new flavors.  The Love Crunch variety is surprising in how much it tastes like homemade, likely due both to the organic ingredients and the way it is made.<br /><br />With dried fruit, there is always the risk of the texture being too chewy or hard.  Thankfully, the berries were of the melt-in-your-mouth texture and good without milk.  The chocolate pieces are small enough to add chocolate flavor, but not weigh things down.<br /><br />Overall, this granola has a carefully thought out ratio of flavors, while avoiding the artificial texture and flavor of some competitors.  I don't know about romantic, but it is yummy.

review/summary: Very goood, much better than expected
review/text: I was really pleasantly surprised with how good this granola was. I am not usually a granola eater. Yes, I know it is supposed to be good for you - but whenever I had eaten it in the past granola just tasted dry. Tasting this and wow - this taste really good! The rolled oats have a nutty flavor with just enough spice. Okay - evaporated cane juice is the second ingredient on the label - so I am sure the sweet flavor is what is really doing it for me.<br />The dark chocolate chunks have a really good flavor - not as bitter a taste as I normally find with dark chocolate.<br />The freeze dried fruit has a nice sharp taste, but this is where my only complaint comes into play - there just aren't many of the fruit chunks in the bag. I was surprised that there were more chocolate chunks than fruit chunks - almost at a ratio of 3 to 1. While this doesn't kill the product for me, the nice contrast you get with the fruit chunks is nice so having more would be good. My young kids also like the sour "pop" they get from the fruit chunks so having more for them to munch on would be a bonus.<br />A serving size is 1/4 cup (a little small, this is good and I can eat it by the handful)<br />140 calories per serving<br />55 calories from fat<br />6g total fat<br />2 g dietary fiber<br />6g sugars<br />2 gram protein<br /><br />Nothing in the ingredients worries me - I can pronounce all the words and even the oils and sweetners are okay in my book (evaporated cane juice, soy oil). In addition to the rolled oats there is also spelt, flax seeds, and dried coconuts - things I just wouldn't eat otherwise. Another bonus - Non GMO verified which I am very happy about.<br /><br />The bags are a good size (11.5 oz) with about 10 servings per bag. Since you get 6 packs I would think it would take you a while to get through all of these unless you eat it every single day. I think the price is fair for what you get and I would actually purchase these for the family and feel good eating them. I must admit, I am still shocked about liking granola!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Yummy in my tummy! :) Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, with dark chocolate and red berries is both healthy and nutritious. Check this out:<br />Low sodium<br />0g trans fat<br />Cholesterol free<br />14g whole grains per 30g serving<br />Excellent source of omega-3<br />140 calories per serving (serving size is only 1/4 cup- but what a great healthy snack)<br />Filled with healthy organic ingredients such as: chocolate, flax seeds, coconut and red berries.<br /><br />But it is the taste that does it for me! I am not a huge chocolate lover but this super sweet mix is just the right combination of dark chocolate and sweet but tangy berries. After 1 handful I was sold and added it to my daily routine of breakfast of flax seed wheat bread and egg whites. It gives me that kick of snaking but I don't feel the guilt because of all the healthy goodness that I am eating. The only true problem that I have is that I want more then my serving size! Even my picky hubby has fallen in love Nature's Path and he shuns granola likes its the plague. Funny thing is he asked me if he could make this into a cereal, I told him to go for it, and another time he asked me if I could make these into cookies for him. I am not sure about the cookie factor for I think that would defeat the purpose of eating healthy granola but you can really see that he has fallen for it and would love to try it different ways.<br /><br />Pick up bag and enjoy a special treat without the guilt!

review/summary: Great as yogurt topper & base for snack mix but needs some extra OOMPH
review/text: If you are looking for a lower fat and lower sugar Yummy granola-based yogurt topper or snack base, this might just be up your alley.  We found the fat & sugar content to be better than most grocery store options but an area where they can still imrpove.  therefore, we limit our enjoyment of this admittitedly delicious product for use as a topping on our own homemade yogurt and as the base upon which we build our dry snacks.  WE found there weren't enough dehydrated fruit bits for the fruit taste to come through so we add some more of our own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039QW2V2">Harmony House Foods Freeze-Dried Strawberries, whole (2 oz, Quart Size Jar)</a> as well as some conventionally dried golden raisins.  That works nicely as a yogurt topping and also as good topping for either store bought or homemade icrecream of soft-serve.  If we want to eat it as a cereal, we find we need to add some more home-toasted rolled oats - any brand will do, the cheaper the better just make sure you give them a light toast on a Cookie Sheet.  it brings out the nuttiness in the flavor.  I'd say for each Cereal serving we add maybe another tablespeoon of dehydrated berries, 4 or 5 chopped golden raisins and an extra scant handful of toasted rolled oats.<br /><br />This is not to say that the Nature's Path Love Crunch Dark Chocolate & Red Berries Granola doesn't taste great AS IS, it's just we were expecting more of a berry ZING given the description.  When we eat it plain as a cereal, we want to taste more berry so that's why we left off 1 star.  As a yogurt topping, it also works fine on it's own but adding the extra dehydrated berries, like you find in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006W5WDS4">Special K Red Berries Cereal, 16.7 Ounce Box (Pack of 3)</a>,  adds even more crunch.  Some people have also said they don't find the chocolate taste coming through but I found the taste of it as a Cereal of Yogurt topper to be just fine.  if I were going to have this as a Snack, I recommend, a few inexpensive addtions to stretch the item out and add a little more of a nutritional boost:<br /><br />To make the Snack Mix that our family loves to pack in lunches, also known as "How to Hack your Storebought granola into a snack mix"  -- we have added some home toasted almond slivers and to augment the admittedly small amounts of chocolate pieces in the mix, we toss in a healtheir choice than plain chocolate and use some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071EBP2K">Nibbles Organic Dark Chocolate Cacao Nibs</a> that have a slightly sweetened dark chocolate covering over the naturally crunchy and unsweetened Cocao Nib in the middle. That punches up the Chocolate quotient nicely without adding too much to the sugar load.  To this we then add even more of the toasted rolled oats mentioned above, which are cheaper than dirt.  Oats are a whole grain, good fuel for on-the-go kids and they hardly notice when it's mixed into a "store bought fancy Granola" alone with the extra berries and Cocao Nibs!  If you still need to stretch it further or just want some variety, we have tried adding some slightly crushed whole wheat pretzels we get locally that are only lightly salted with sea salt, some toasted pepitos (pumpkin seeds), and some generic cornflakes.  That makes up quite a goodly amount of snack mix with enough crunch and taste to satisfy every snacker in our household.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I liked this Brand and Flavor right out of the bag and could have eaten the entire thing as a snack but after one or two bite, I did want more crunch and more of a Berry/Chocolate thing going on.  The simplest fix is to find the cheapest Dehydrated Strawberries you can on Amazon or locally AND  a Cocao Nib NOT covered in dark chocolate since that will save you a little bit in the sugar to carbs ratio and the calroies from fat area without sacrificing any crunch or chocolate and berry flavor.  In fact, the SIMPLEST fix is to just add more dehydrated strawberries and this would be a 5-star item.<br /><br />I've written to the company to sugest that and also suggest they consider adding plain Cacao Nibs to their forumla since those are actually a formerly under-appreciated by-product of the chocolate making  process and can be sourced cheaply if purchased in large enough quantities.  I believe those 2 rather minor tweaks to the recipe coul make Love Crunch fly off the shelves!

review/summary: Decadent Chocolately Granola
review/text: I found this to be a yummy premium chocolate granola. The somewhat sparse pieces of strawberry and raspberry add extra accents of flavor. It makes a nice addition to plain or vanilla yogurt, or even ice cream. Perhaps it is from being shipped, but there is a good bit of the granola that was crushed and crumbled, taking away from the enjoyable mouth feel and texture evident in the larger chunks.<br /><br />Love Crunch does not quite have the 'crunch' I would expect for a quality granola, and the chocolate flavor is muted somehow. The small chunks of dark chocolate seem to be of good quality however. It is fairly healthy when limited to the 1/4 cup size, though it's hard to stop munching after those significant 140 calories.<br /><br />This is a satisfying cereal that I would consider more of a dessert than a breakfast food. See if you can purchase it locally to minimize the amount of crushing I experienced. 3.4 stars, rounding down.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/text: I have to admit I never tasted Granola before in my 63 years. But after a heart attack I had spent the past 2-3 years as an avid juicer, plus bought a Vitamix & use it faithfully as well. Now this isn't the most healthy of snacks given its 140 calories in a single serving size of 1/4 cup.....but that 1/4 cup goes a LONG way in satisfying any "treat" cravings you may have. In the long run it will SAVE you calories as it honestly stops a lot of cravings. I have my serving with a cup of decaf coffee and find I don't even feel the need for breakfast, PLUS feel like I just plain start my morning on the right foot. Kind of nice to begin my day every single day rewarding myself and not feeling like I do it with junk food.<br /><br />  If it had not been for the Vine program I admit I would have gone to my grave never having ever even tasted granola. Now as it turns out I will be ordering this and plan to continue using it as my guilty free snack. Not sure why but I never feel like I am forced to watch my portions since while 1/4 cup sounds small in theory, when eaten it completely satisfies and I never feel like I "need" more. This is now one of about a dozen items I have tried on Vine that I end up buying on my own to continue. Even more rare, it EARNS an honest 5 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: Love Crunch? Like Crunch.
review/text: I'm not always crazy about granola, but this mix is sweet enough to hold my interest, and my taste buds. I exclusively ate this by the handful as a snack and did not try it as a cereal. My biggest complaint, and the thing keeping it from getting five starts, would be the lack of red berry and chocolate chunks. I rarely grabbed a handful that had both berries and chocolate mixed in with the granola, and often my handfuls had neither berry or chocolate. I assume the low amount of chocolate is for nutritional reasons, but the only reason I can come up with for them to be so stingy on the berries is cost.

review/summary: To quote Lucky the leprechaun: They're magically delicious!
review/text: Granola's always a good snack, and when you add dark chocolate and 'red berries' to the mix, it's even better. At first I was a little disappointed with the size of the bag for Nature's Path Love Crunch, but after just two handfuls of the goods, it won me over and I couldn't stop munching away. I'm not much for organic foods since I eat healthy on a regular basis, only going with fast food and snacks on the weekends, if that, but this is definitely something I'll consider buying in the future.<br /><br />The clusters of granola are big, and there are small pieces of dried strawberries mixed in, with some decent-sized chunks of dark chocolate. While my bag didn't have many strawberries, the flavor detonated in my mouth when all three of the main ingredients were mixed together. What's funny is that I started out disappointed (bag size) and when my bag was empty, I was disappointed that I was all out. Why couldn't I have been sent an entire box of these things like the Eat. Think. Smile bars and chips I got last month?!<br /><br />Not bad for you, filling, and something you could easily make a cereal out of, I highly recommend this granola mix, and I can't wait to try out the others.

review/text: In general I advocate against consuming grains or cereals.  However "Love Crunch" is made with reasonably good ingredients (the primary ingredient is rolled oats) and blended to an enjoyable chocolate flavor.  Spelt is one of the healthier forms of wheat, it's far more desirable (nutritionally) than modern wheat.<br /><br />The sugar to fiber ratio is three to one (six grams of sugars to two grams of fiber per serving) which isn't the best of all cereals but it's reasonable.<br /><br />You've got to love all the healthy ingredients: chocolate, flax seeds, coconut and fruit.<br /><br />For a "processed food" this one isn't too bad.

review/summary: Nice Snack With Some Healthful Ingredients
review/text: This granola is quite tasty for a snack right out of the bag. It has a nice oaty flavor with just a hint of coconut. Every once in awhile you find a chunk of chocolate or a freeze-dried berry. If you're eating it as a cereal with milk, you can slice fresh strawberries into it to boost the fruitiness, but as is the dominant flavor is mostly oats. The chunks of dark chocolate are delicious.<br /><br />I wanted to try this granola just because it sounded yummy, but it can be healthful too, if you control your portions. It's fairly low in sugar. The bag says only 6 grams of sugar in 1/4 cup, which is hard to believe, but it really is a lot less sweet than other granolas I've bought. There are 140 calories and 6 grams of fat in 1/4 cup, which is not low fat, but neither is it excessive. In that serving you also get 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein, thanks to the whole grains and the addition of flax seeds, which also provide some omega-3s. All ingredients are certified organic and non-GMO.<br /><br />Overall a good, wholesome-tasting granola, if you don't mind the infrequency of berries and chocolate.

Oh, did I mention a nice little serving of whole grains? This food is Non GMO-I believe this is non-genetically modified.  A portion of the proceeds of the sale go to food banks which is also way cool in my humble opinion.  I also like reading the ingredients and not seeing a bunch of words I can't pronounce and wouldn't want to put in my body.  Just good old normal ingredients that you know.<br /><br />Dislikes-um, the bag seems small now?  Really, can't seem to come up with a con on this one.  I have never purchased from Nature's Path before, but if I happen to see this I would definitely buy.  It is delicious and I normally make my own granola, so I'm a bit picky and used to a really natural granola.<br /><br />All said, great product that I would definitely buy and would recommend to others.

review/text: To answer the question above, only one thing: the soy oil. When there are so many other oils out there that are better for you, the only reason to go with soy is the price (it's cheap). But that is my only quibble with this granola. It is delicious.<br /><br />Chocolatey, with a slight berry tang, this stuff makes for a fantastic dessert.

review/summary: The granola Barry White would have eaten
review/text: This is not a breakfast granola. This is an after dinner desert granola. It's a late night romantic granola. With all its chocolaty berry-ness this granola has to be pronounced like Barry White would pronounce it. LUUUUUvvvvvvv Crunchhhhhh. C'mon, say it yourself. Uh huh. That's it, baby.<br /><br />For chocolate flavored granola this is pretty tasty stuff. We have tried Nature's Path vanilla granola as well, and it is also very good. However "Love Crunch" takes the sweetness up a few notches. Maybe you would want to eat it for breakfast, but to us Love Crunch makes a better late night snack due to its desert-like flavors. It's organic, like other Nature's Path granola, and tastes great overall. Surely it's the granola Barry White himself would eat.

review/summary: Perfect trifecta . . . every tenth bite.
review/text: I thought this was the tastiest granola I had ever eaten when I got a bite of the dark chocolate, dried berries, and granola together.  What a great combination!  Unfortunately, there were too few berries and chocolate in the bag, so most bites were just granola.  The granola on its own was good, but not extraordinary.  Although brown and chocolate-y looking, the chocolate flavor was not as prominent as I would've liked.  But it was tasty enough to keep me munching, hoping for those perfect bites of smooth dark chocolate, tangy berries, and crunchy granola.  Few and far between, but delicious!

review/summary: More than granola - call it a luxury treat
review/text: This is called a granola but it is not something I would eat for breakfast.  It does have chunks of chocolate in it, and I just don't think "chocolate" when I think "breakfast".  Never will.<br /><br />However as a snack or treat to enjoy between meals, it is really quite delicious.  I didn't even put milk on it - just grabbed chunks straight out of the bag as dessert after my main meal of the day.<br /><br />It is kind of pricey, at almost $4 for an 11.5oz bag so would definitely be a treat - not something to eat every day.

review/summary: Indian Wedding dessert-granola
review/text: This is a novelty granola, chocolate flavored with chunks of real chocolate, originally created as a confection for the wedding of an Indian couple who work for the producer. It's delicious stuff and part of the profits are donated to food banks. However, this is a very high sugar, high fat granola (the second ingredient after oats is cane sugar and the third is soy oil) and undercuts the health reasons for eating granola in the first place. Unless you run eight miles every morning before breakfast, you would not want to consume this every day. And please don't give it to your kids to "entice" them into switching from chocolate Co Co Pops. This is to granola as chocolate milk is to milk; strictly a novelty item or occasional treat. Also makes a nice gift or door prize.

review/summary: A very delicious high-calorie breakfast
review/text: Most granola cereal to me is very tasty and that is because they are sweet and have savory bits of chocolate or freeze-dried fruit (and sometimes nuts). This cereal is no different.<br /><br />You are supposed to get 10 servings in this 11.5 ounce bag and at 140 calories per serving (55 calories from fat and 6 grams of sugar), you would have to  eat only 2 tablespoons (or 1/4 cup or less than 1.2 ounces) of this cereal to get the allotted amount (and that's without milk).  I was unable to eat just one serving so I ate 2 servings with milk for breakfast.  The cereal is delicious with the chocolate and freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries but it does pack a calorie punch.<br /><br />The ingredients are organic with rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, and soy oil being the first three ingredients. The dark chocolate chunks are the 5th ingredient and the freeze-dried berry blend the 9th ingredient.<br /><br />This granola certainly has 5-star taste and is as good as most of the other flavored granolas (such as Bare Naked) that I've tried before.  However, the others I've tried have only 7 servings for the same amount of calories; they increased the amount of servings in this bag to reduce the appearance of calories and for that I take off one star.

review/summary: Really Good Tasting - Highly Recommended
review/text: This Nature's Path "Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries" is the best tasting granola snack I have tried. This is a near perfect blend of granola, good chocolate overtones, and slightly tart berry flavor. This is good both as dry granola snack or with a little milk as a cereal. That being said, at 140 calories and 18 net carbs per 1/4 cup it really isn't something I can justify eating whenever a snack mood hits but it is a very nice treat on occasion.<br /><br />Our sample bag was gone within the hour of arriving at our house and my family has demanded I order more.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: A lot of flavor
review/text: The red "berries" are very small dried pieces. They melt as powder in your mouth and then you get a "bang" of flavor. The chocolate pieces are also smaller than 1/4" square but have a good flavor. Both of these are offset by the crunch and flavor of the granola. As a taste different from the standard granola, these are a welcome treat. If you want to make it more cost effect, add fresh sliced bananas or a breakfast cereal like Apple Cheerios.

review/summary: A Nice Added Touch
review/text: I know I've purchased Nature's Path Products before.<br /><br />This Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola With Dark Chocolate & Red Berries. I think the name is perfect for this granola.<br /><br />There are a few things I like about this granola.  First of all it's organic. Who needs pesticides in their cereal, or in anything else?<br /><br />The picture on the ziploc like seal on the top of the bag which helps to keep the product fresh, it shows a heart shape with 2 delicious looking strawberries, and two small pieces of chocolate which kind of blends into the color of the bag. The bag itself is 11.5 ounces, which is supposed to be about 10 servings.<br /><br />It may look like a small bag, but when you look at the back of the bag the portion size is 1/4th a cup.  As the granola is sweet, which part of that I think is the granola itself, then added to it is the chocolate, which you can see and taste that in the granola, but the strawberries, you can see very small red pieces mixed in.  I do wish the strawberry pieces were larger, and that the flavor of them were more pronounced. To me, the flavor of chocolate and strawberries is a match made in heaven.  I have never tasted a cereal much less a granola like this before.<br /><br />So, that makes for a very sweet, at least to me granola, so you may only need to eat 1/4th a cup, which is what they recommend per serving, which should satisfy you.  It did me.<br /><br />The scent of this granola is nice.  There are different sizes of the granola itself, from larger to smaller.  The chocolate and strawberry pieces are more uniform in size.<br /><br />As to the nutritional aspects of this granola, it's 140 calories per each 1/4 cup, total fat-6 grams, of which 1 gram is saturated fat, total carbohydrates is 20 grams, 2 grams of dietary fiber,6 grams of sugar, 14 grams of whole grains, very small amounts of iron and Vitamin C.<br /><br />On the back of the bag what does impress me is that they say for every bag purchased, they will donate an equal amount to food banks in food or cash, up to $1 million dollars.<br /><br />I love companies who give back.<br /><br />I liked this granola.  While I wouldn't necessarily eat this everyday, it is a nice treat when you do eat it.

review/summary: The Best Granola Ever--Hands Down!
review/text: I have been buying Love Crunch granola at Whole Foods for over a year, so I was very excited to find out that Amazon is now selling it online.  This is the best granola I have ever had.  The dark chocolate chunks with mixed berries is a delicious combination and the coconut gives the cereal some added texture.  It is the perfect blend of grains, berries and chocolate that make it a tasty, yet not overly sweet granola.  I like to eat mine like cereal in a bowl with milk, but it is also very good mixed in with Greek yogurt.  Nature's Path has always made delicious granola mixes, but this is my absolute favorite.  And you can not beat the price they are selling it for on Amazon.<br /><br />Kudos to Nature's Path for making a donation to food banks with each purchase of this brand.  They make great granola and they are giving back to the community.  If you like granola but have not eaten this one yet, give it a try--you will love this product!

review/summary: Holy moly, don't think "I'll eat just a taste" because this is addictiive and you'll likely keep eating.
review/text: Wow, forget all the antioxidants it has and that, if you scan the package it's all organic and even surprisingly vegan which they don't advertise...well, you WILL forget everything healthy when you taste it. It's flat out decadent.<br /><br />I'm not even that huge of a fan of granola. Usually it tastes like things coated in high fructose corn syrup trying to hold out the name "granola" like a fake i.d. for their healthy card.<br /><br />This actually tastes homemade.<br /><br />The red berries are a great mix with the dark chocolate (monounsaturated or "good" fat and antioxidants. Monounsaturated fats have actually been shown to HELP ya lose weight and REDUCE bad cholesterol levels. Woo Hoo)<br /><br />I originally figured I'd keep this around for just a bite when I wanted something sweet...I'm ashamed to say, I polished it off in two days.<br /><br />With no milk.<br /><br />Great snacking.<br /><br />Yeah, a portion of the proceeds go to a charity...but the fact is, I simply love the taste so I'd eat it even if they didn't.<br /><br />Incidentally, it's low in sugar and high in whole grains. You won't guess this when you eat it so pretend you didn't just read that and don't tell the kids.<br /><br />And, psst, it's also filling your diet with flax seeds. Wonderful and healthy Omega-3 fatty acid rich Flax seeds are the holy grail of healthy ingredients. What have they been shown to do? Oh, I'm a big fan of flaxseeds:<br /><br />Anti-Inflammatory Benefits:  Omega-3 fats are used by the body to produce  anti-inflammatory hormone-like molecules, Omega-3 fats can help reduce the inflammation that is a significant factor in conditions such as asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine headaches, and osteoporosis.<br /><br />Omega-3-rich Flaxseeds Protect Bone Health:  Alpha linolenic acid, the omega-3 fat found in flaxseed and walnuts, promotes bone health by helping to prevent excessive bone turnover.<br /><br />Protection Against Heart Disease, Cancer and Diabetes:  Omega-3 fats are used to produce substances that reduce the formation of blood clots, which can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with atherosclerosis or diabetic heart disease.<br /><br />Omega-3 fats are also needed to produce flexible cell membranes. Cell membranes are the cell's gatekeepers, allowing in needed nutrients while promoting the elimination of wastes. While important for everyone, flexible cell membranes are critical for persons with diabetes and omega-3 fats have been shown to help protect colon cells from cancer-causing toxins and free radicals, leading to a reduced risk for colon cancer.<br /><br />Flaxseeds Help Prevent and Control High Blood Pressure: Individuals whose diets provide greater amounts of omega-3 such as that in flaxseeds have lower blood pressure than those who consume less, shows data gathered in the International Study of Macro- and Micro-nutrients and Blood Pressure, a study of 2,238 people<br /><br />Flaxseed Provides Comparable Cholesterol-Lowering Benefits to Statin Drugs in a study of patients with high cholesterol<br /><br />Rich in Beneficial Fiber:  A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine confirms that eating high fiber foods, such as flaxseed, helps prevent heart disease. Almost 10,000 American adults participated in this study and were followed for 19 years.<br /><br />Flaxseed Puts the Brakes on Prostate Cancer Growth:  Flaxseed put the brakes on prostate tumor growth in men who were given flaxseed daily a month before surgery to treat their prostate cancer.<br /><br />Lead author, Duke University researcher Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, believes the omega-3s in flaxseed alter how cancer cells lump together or cling to other cells, while flaxseed's anti-angiogenic lignans choke off the tumor's blood supply, thus helping to halt the cellular activity that leads to cancer growth.<br /><br />Special Protection for Women's Health:  Flaxseed is particularly rich in lignans, special compounds that are converted by beneficial gut flora into two hormone-like substances. These agents demonstrate a number of protective effects against breast cancer and are believed to be one reason a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk for breast cancer.<br /><br />Flaxseed Reduces Hot Flashes Almost 60%, as well as many other perimenopausal symptoms.<br /><br />Flaxseeds reduced dry eye in a study of over 40,000<br /><br />I likely don't have to discuss the benefits of the organic or high fiber or antioxidant rich ingredients, right? I think those are already well-known.<br /><br />Amazing and good for you? Heck yes it is.

review/summary: Best Apple Granola on Amazon
review/text: We love apple granola and try to eat Organic where we can..  So we did a shootout of Trader Joe's Organic Granny's Apple Granola, Nature's Path Love Crunch Organic Premium Granola, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDK5YY">Bob's Red Mill Granola, Apple Cinnamon No Fat, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>.  The three products list their serving size as three different sizes, 2/3 cup, 1/4 cup, and 1/2 cup.  So I normalized the macronutrients and sugars to a 1/2 cup serving for an "apples to apples" comparison.<br /><br />Trader Joes / Love Crunch / Bob's Red Mill<br />Cal 180 280 180<br />Fat 5.25 12 2.5<br />Carb 23.25 44 35<br />Sugar 6.75 12 4<br />Protein 3.75 4 5<br /><br />The interesting thing is that the Trader Joe's granola has hands down the best flavor, yet it has the lowest carbohydrate content.  Trader Joe's Granola tastes like an explosion of apples.  Next is the Love Crunch which has good apple flavor, but not nearly as good as the Trader Joes -- but with nearly twice the carbohydrates and sugar.  Finally the Bob's Red Mill Granola tastes nothing like apples.  Maybe if I held an apple slice under my nose while I ate it I could taste something -- but it really just tastes like slightly sweet granola.<br /><br />I do like the fact that Love Crunch includes Chia Seeds, but it has lots of other ingredients that I would rather avoid such as: rolled spelt (wheat)*, soy oil*, and rice starch*.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill has the fewest ingredients -- if only the taste were on!  Trader Joe's has pretty good ingredients except for the corn syrup solids -- a big nono in my book but it is just above Salt (45mg of sodium) so it is probably a very small amount.<br /><br />In the end we chose the Trader Joe's as our favorite -- the lowest carbohydrate content and low sugars with the exceptional taste being the big draw.  After that we chose Love Crunch -- the best on Amazon when we can't visit the Trader Joe's 4 hours away.  Bob's Red Mill just doesn't taste anything like apples so we're skipping it.  If they made it taste more like apples we would pick it for the limited ingredients and lowest sugars -- but seeing as how my wife reaches for the honey when she eats Bob's Red Mill granola -- the low sugar is only temporary.

review/text: This is a wonderful tasting cereal, but like many others these days it is way too sweet for breakfast.  I would never feed this to my kids before school for fear of behavior problems. :-)  I do appreciate the very high-end and organic ingredients.  This isn't a "junky" cereal like many others, but it is loaded with sugar and fat, which is a bad combo.  Don't let the label fool you.  For 3/4 cup, which is what most people eat, it has 420cal, 18g fat, and 60g carbs (18g of added sugar).<br /><br />Awesome ice cream topping!  Great mixed with plain Greek yogurt as a parfait!

review/summary: I love the cereal, but the sell- by date isn't great
review/text: We love this cereal.  It's the best.  It's just fantastic how the dark chocolate and the dried berries blend together.  And this makes an amazing granola cookie (see recipe at bottom of page).  We got addicted to this at Costco, where they had the giant bags, and then quit carrying them.  So we had to get some here.  My only issue, and the reason I took stars away (and this does NOT reflect on the granola) is because the sell-by date is Dec 12.  Usually you have a little more time to eat a cereal.  I am sure we'll go through it by then, and I guess I could throw some of it in the freezer, to keep it fresh, but I wanted to mention that issue, in case your family couldn't go through 6 bags in less than 6 months.  It is only a bag a month though:-)<br /><br />I like to think these are the best granola cookies ever, but even if they aren't, they are pretty good:<br /><br />Please do not blame me if you eat them all.<br /><br />You will need:<br />1/2 cup butter, unsalted<br />2/3 cup sugar (I use a turbinado)<br />1 large egg<br />3/4 tsp vanilla<br />1/4 tsp coconut flavoring (if you have it- it's not absolutely necessary)<br /><br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 tsp baking soda<br />1/2 tsp salt<br />1/8 cup flaked coconut<br />1 and 1/4 cup Love Crunch (chopped up, so there aren't any large clusters)<br /><br />Cream together butter, sugar and flavoring, then add egg.<br /><br />Now add all the other ingredients, and stir till well mixed.<br /><br />Drop by the teaspoon onto a parchment lined cookies sheet.  Bake at 375 for approximately 12 minutes- ovens will vary, and some people like their cookies more done.  Let cool before moving cookies.

review/text: If you're a chocoholic like me, then this is food from heaven.  My local grocery store used to sell something very similar in bulk.  The day they stopped selling it I spiraled into a deep depression.  Then I found Love Crunch sold in the big bags at Costco.  All was good until Costco stopped carrying it.  That's when I had my second bout of depression.  Now I get my fix through Amazon.  When it comes to food, it's all a matter of individual taste and my taste buds love this product.  I can see why some people would not be a fan of this because the chocolate can be overwhelming.  That's fine by me because it just means there is more in stock for me to buy!  :)<br />The only negative thing I have to say is that they skimp on the berries, but I don't really care because I'm not buying it for the berries.  :)

review/summary: Great flavor balance!
review/text: When I received the Dark Chocolate and Berries granola, I was expecting something that only lightly hinted of chocolate with a dominant berry flavor, but I was pleasantly surprise.  The product holds up well to other granolas on the market, while at the same time offering a flavor profile that's rich without being over-powering.  The granola actually tastes like chocolate (but good chocolate rather than just the overpowering sweetness of a kids cereal) and has decent size chunks of chocolate in it.<br /><br />I found it to be an excellent mid-day snack.  My recommendation is that it's not a great breakfast cereal simply because it's a little more full-flavored than you might be looking for in the morning.  In addition, I think it's a great snack without milk that backs well in a backpack.

review/summary: Quality Product
review/text: This a tasty, quality granola.  My only issue with "Premium" granola is the price, but you usually get what you pay for.  If organic makes a difference to you, there's probably going to be an extra cost.  With GOOD little pieces of chocolate and good sized berries, I'd say this qualifies as a "premium" granola.  You'll know the difference in taste, texture and by looking at the chocolate and berries.  It's quality.  I went with 4-stars, because - for me - this granola was a little too granular and sweet.  I think this would work well for those that like their granola with milk (and on the sweet side).  I prefer mine as a snack out of the bag and to clump at least a little for easier (less messy) snacking.  I'll have to experiment with their other flavors, but I don't think the chocolate one is for me.  No doubt it's a 4-star+ product though.

review/summary: Good Granola
review/text: I was impressed with Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries. There are lots og good tasting and good for you things in this box and the way it comes together makes a nice combination of flavor and texture in your bowl. The "red berries" are freeze-dried so they have the texture of Styrofoam. But as soon as they hit the milk, or reach your mouth the burst back to life and taste quite good.<br /><br />There are plenty of dark chocolate chunks which make for an interesting flavor and texture. The cereal is great in a bowl with milk, or straight from the package as a snack. The pouches keep the product well and are resealable.

review/summary: Enjoyed By Granola Fans
review/text: Didn't have many berries as hopped or maybe the pieces weren't that big.  Now and then when a berry would get in your mix, you could somewhat taste it making it a surprise flavor.  Wish there were more.  Nevertheless, the flavor of the chocolate and the mix is very good even without much fruit.  One person in the family loved it while another, albeit not much of a granola person, thought it was too dry (but no drier than normal granola).  This person thought it would taste good over yogurt.  Dark chocolate definitely helped the flavor, but would make this a poor choice for hiking when it is warm.  Packaging was impressive.  The product being organic and having healthy items in it was also impressive.  Price is very reasonable!

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: I eat granola with yogurt for breakfast most work days, and sometimes by itself as a 'healthy' snack.<br /><br />I brought this granola to work, where it lasted less than 2 days before I finished the bag. Nature's path is generous with the dark chocolate, making this great as a snack, dessert, or decadent breakfast component. The red berries and dark chocolate make a pretty tantalizing combination -- I snacked on this stuff pretty much non-stop until it was gone. It's simply delicious.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll probably want to avoid having this around at your desk or as a 'breakfast' cereal, because you'll end up eating it all too fast. However, as a different sort of dessert by itself or a delicious mixer for yogurt or topping for ice cream, you can't go wrong. I love this stuff and will probably be buying some soon.

review/summary: Yummmmy!!
review/text: I just have to say, I devoured this entire bag myself, and shared with no-one. It was just that good.<br /><br />When I ate my first few handfuls, it was mostly comprised of big chunks of delicious crunchy oats with just the right amount of sweetness (sweetened with cane juice, not corn syrup!) with a few freeze dried red berries. I was kind of meh on the berries, (the taste and texture were just "off" to me), but getting to the dark chocolate chunks made up for it. That's when this bag of granola became addicting. Lots of tasty chunks of dark chocolate mixed with this clean and tasty granola is pure heaven.<br /><br />I was very sad when it was gone, and plan on purchasing more. I've vowed to share it with the family this time, it'll be hard though.

review/text: As a big fan of snacks (and food in general) I have to say this granola was beyond my expectations! It was so delicious I wasn't sure if it was really as healthy as it is.  I enjoyed the bits of dark chocolate (and wished there were more) and the mix of berries.  It has just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the flavor and make you want to choose healthy.  I found myself eating it all on its own but this granola would be excellent in yogurt or with milk eaten as a cereal.  The package size was good for portion control as this one didn't last too long!

review/summary: YUMMY right out of the BAG (Dark Chocolate & Red Berries)!!
review/text: I am a huge fan of granola and have tried many brands.  I especially like to add granola to my Chobani Greek Yogurt.  I do have to admit that while most of the granola mixes taste good in yogurt, they do not taste as good straight out of the bag.  Love Crunch's DARK CHOCOLATE & RED BERRIES, however, is absolutely delicious and I loved it by itself (right out of the bag).  There are not a lot of dark chocolate or red berries pieces inside, but that is ok because the granola is very tasty on its own.<br /><br />My only problem is that the granola tastes so good that it is very easy to eat the more than the 1/4 cup (140 calories) serving size.  The DARK CHOCOLATE & RED BERRIES granola MIX has all of my favorite ingredients ... granola, cocoa, flax, and coconut.  I especially like that there is NOT any high fructose corn syrup.  I think I have found my new favorite granola mix.  I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors also. :)

review/summary: Absolutely delicious dark chocolate and berries granola ~ amazing!
review/text: I was pretty skeptical trying this 'Love Crunch' premium organic granold with dark choclate and red berries, but it was FABULOUS!  It tastes great, the dark chocolate bits are very tasty (I found myself digging them out - bad me!), and checking the back, and the entire package has only 60g sugar, which I found low considering how sweet and delicious it tasted!  I would not suggest this for a breakfast granola, but it'd be great for a tasty snack...anything that combines dark chocolate and red berries, two of my favorite things, and tasts this amazing I would definitely highly recommend!

review/summary: Tasty granola - but very small amount of berries and chocolate
review/text: I love the taste of the granola. It makes for a very healthy snack when I'm at work and at home. It also is very nutritious and is organic.<br /><br />However, though the product is stated to have dark chocolate and red berries, there are seldom any of those two things. In a handful of this Love crunch, I could only pick up one or two berries along with some small chunks of chocolate.<br /><br />Honestly, I hate to give this product anything less than 5 stars. But, I had to take down one star because there was just so little amounts of berries and chocolate. As dry food, the chocolate and berries are almost hard to find. However, when mixed with some milk, the berries and chocolate goodness is far more noticeable.

review/text: I cannot say enough good things about this granola blend. When I got the package I opened it and ate a few handfuls from the bag, then had a few more. The granola is so good you can eat it alone. Over the week I tried it with some milk, mixed into some yogurt, and mixed into cereal. If the bag had lasted longer I would have tried it on some ice cream. The blend is really good, just the right amount of ingredients. The chocolate is rich and melts nicely in milk. The bag is the same size as other bags at the grocery store. The price seems like a good value for what you get. Excellent granola.

review/summary: Better as a Snack than a Breakfast
review/text: The good news - this is a tasty granola, with a very nice chocolate flavor.  There are many small (3/8") squares of good quality chocolate in the mix.  The fruit, however, consists of tiny flecks of freeze-dried "red berries" - strawberries and raspberries that add very little flavor to the granola, and really are indistinguishable from one another.  You can also clearly taste coconut and flax in the granola.<br /><br />The bad news - neither my wife or I liked the granola with milk as a breakfast meal.  We both strongly preferred it as a snack to just eat right out of the bag.  Chocolate and milk are a classic pairing, but for some reason, this granola just tasted a bit off with it. And the name "Love Crunch" seems a bit cheesy.<br /><br />A note for those concerned about diets - the granola runs about 140 calories per 1/4 cup of volume.

review/text: It's hard to believe that something this good, is so unbelievably good for you as well! Love Crunch has created a perfect union of taste with health. They combined rolled oats, flax seeds, coconut, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, dried strawberries, dried raspberries and chunks of dark chocolate into an organic snack that will keep you and your heart healthy and happy.  All berries keep your artery and vein walls strong and flexible. Dark chocolate does the same. Oats keep your body really strong. My father's ancestors lived on a flax farm and lived to 107, so I know for a fact that flax keeps your cholesterol super low and your heart super healthy. The benefits you will get from this super snack are unbelievable- and the taste is beyond delicious! You will love this cholesterol free, low sodium, low calorie snack, but the benefits from eating this treat will love you even more!

review/summary: Good quality, tasty, but too sweet for breakfast
review/text: Nature's Path Organic Love Crunch is a rolled-oat granola with little chunks of dark chocolate and bits of freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  The quality of the ingredients is very good so it does tastes fresh and it is quite crunchy.<br /><br />My primary criticism is that it is much too sweet to eat for breakfast:  it even turns the milk sweet and gives it a slight chocolate flavor.  This granola is much better eaten dry as a dessert.  It would also be good as a topping for apple crisp.<br /><br />The suggested serving size of 1/4 cup has 140 calories and I would think a normal serving would be much larger than that, possibly a full cup or 560 calories. About half the bag arrived in tiny pieces from shipping so even the suggested quarter cup would probably contain more calories and it is not low-fat, either.  3/4 cup has 27% of the suggested daily value for fat.<br /><br />Note:  "evaporated cane juice" is better known as "sugar".<br /><br />Ingredients:  Rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, soy oil, spelt, dark chocolate chunks (evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla), flax seed, dried coconut, cocoa, freeze dried berry blend (freeze-dried strawberries, freeze-dried raspberries), rice starch, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E).<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving size 1/4 cup (30g)<br />Servings per container:  about 10 (total in package is 11.5 oz or 325 g)<br /><br />Per serving:<br />Calories - 140<br />Calories from fat - 55<br />Total fat - 6 g<br />Saturated fat - 1g<br />Trans fat - 0 g<br />Polyunsaturated fat - 3 g<br />Monounsaturated fat - 15 g<br />Cholesterol - 0 mg<br />Sodium - 55 mg<br />Potassium - 105 mg<br />Total carbohydrates - 20 g<br />Dietary fiber - 2 g<br />Sugars - 6 g<br />Protein - 2 g<br />Vitamin A - 0%<br />Vitamin C - 2%<br />Calcium - 0%<br />Iron - 4%

review/text: I'm always looking for healthy snack alternatives. But healthy snacks are not always very tasty. This one was. It has a good crunch factor and the chocolate and berry flavors stood out without being overpowering.  My two teen aged sons fought over the bag. One enjoyed is as a cereal, the other just as a snack.  I, myself enjoyed it sprinkled over some fat-free frozen yogurt. The serving size (1/4 cup) is a little small. It would be easy to eat the whole bag without even realizing it. But it's perfect as a topping for yogurt or ice cream. My boys have asked me to add this to my regular shopping list.

The berries that were in it tasted much better than the dried berries you normally would get in a box of cereal. The little bars of chocolate were also a nice touch.<br /><br />Definitely good, I want more.<br /><br />The only downside is that like most granola, the bottom half of the bag was crumbles. Still good though.

It stays crunchy in milk. And, for each purchase, the company is matching the amount by donating up to $1 million to food banks.

The red berries are delicious, but not many of them are in the bag . . . to be specific, the one bag I tried  had very few bits of red berries. The texture is superb. The granola has a pleasant crunch, not too hard and not too soft -- just right.

review/summary: Tasty, but not down to the bottom of the bag
review/text: I'm a bit of a granola freak. If it's nut-free and made of oats, I'll eat it. I especially like fruity granola, and who doesn't like chocolate? So this combination from Nature's Path seemed made for me. Upon opening the bag, I got a good whiff of fruit and chocolate. The first few clusters I popped in my mouth were sweet, fruity, crunchy and chewy and really, really delicious. Right out of the bag, this was some of the best granola I'd eaten in a while. As I continued to work my way through the bag over the next several days, the clusters got smaller and smaller, and the berries and chocolate bits were all but gone, with only trace fragments here and there in the mix. By the time I got to the last of the contents, I was eating granola dust with tons of flax seeds and no hint of chocolate or berry. The taste imitated the texture, as both were like chewing on sawdust. Of course the flax seeds kept getting caught in my teeth with that slimy coating they get when you eat them. It wasn't terribly disgusting, but it was a far cry from those initial delicious morsels I'd eaten only a few days before. Therefore, I think if you are going to eat this out of the bag, you will have to find some way of maintaining a few handfuls of the clusters while extracting from the dust at the bottom of the pouch to get a good mix of all the ingredients' tastes, textures, and nutrients. If you are the type who mixes their granola with yogurt or eats it as cereal, you might not have any issues with this tasty snack. Otherwise, be prepared to enjoy the top of the bag, and to suffer through the remnants at the bottom. All said, it's still tasty enough to warrant four stars.

The red berries give the granola just enough of a hint of fruit flavor without making the cereal overpowering with fruit.  The granola comes in fairly decent sized clusters as well which we also enjoy.  There are nice dark chocolate pieces scattered throughout as well.  This is definitely more of a dessert than a breakfast cereal but it's sure tasty.  We've already ordered more.

review/summary: Non-GMO, Organic, Whole Grains...and Yummy!
review/text: This stuff is delicious.  I love that it has whole grains, is non-GMO, and is organic.  But all of that would have been pretty useless if it didn't taste good.  It has only 6 grams of sugar per serving although a serving is a skimpy 1/4 cup, pretty standard for other granola serving sizes.  Fat, at 55 calories out of 140, is a little higher than I'd like, but again, I think that is pretty typical of granola.<br /><br />There is lots of chocolate taste.  In fact there is so much chocolate that when the cereal was delivered to me on a warm day after having spent the morning in a UPS truck, there were chocolate smears inside the package.  I do suggest keeping it refrigerated during warm weather.<br /><br />I would have liked a little more berry taste.  When I did get some berry, it tasted wonderful, but most bites had much more chocolate taste than berry.  It does have coconut in it, but I didn't get a coconut taste.  And although this granola tastes good as a cereal, I prefer to eat it as a snack or crumbled as a topping on a plain dessert.<br /><br />In the final analysis, I'm very pleased with the taste and ingredients in this granola and would happily keep it in my pantry.

review/text: I love granola, so I knew I would like Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola.  I just didn't know how much I would love it!  They definitely didn't skimp on the chocolate when they made this.  There are chocolate chunks in every bite.  And the taste of the chocolate!  Oh my goodness, this is creamy chocolate.  It wasn't bitter at all, the way some dark chocolates can be.  They did skimp on the berries, which is why I marked it down a star.  I would have liked it even better if they had doubled the amount of berries, but what they did put in there is quality.  When this granola is in milk, the berries almost taste fresh.<br /><br />I even like these as a snack.  Straight from the bag or mixed with yougurt, I love it!  I also like that this granola organic.  Heck, it tastes so good, I would keep it in the house, even if it weren't so good for me.  But I really like that I don't have to feel guilty while I indulge in this delicious treat!  I only wish these were available through Subscribe & Save.

For instance, I enjoy having it in my morning yogurt, but have also been eating serving size amounts of it as is. I've not tried it in milk like cereal but you could do that too.<br /><br />The granola isn't covered in chocolate but instead there are chunks of dark chocolate, strawberries, and raspberry that make up this delicious melody of flavor. I even noted the added coconut flavor which is an added unexpected bonus for coconut lovers like myself.<br /><br />I will be buying this again. It compliments my yogurts wonderfully and is easy to take along with me in it's reusable package when out and about! Not only I love it, but the kids do too!

There is a dusting of cocoa that gives it a little chocolate flavor without going overboard. If you ARE looking for a bit more chocolate, that's where those little chunks of semi-dark chocolate come in! The chocolate chunks provide a nice variety of texture and flavor that kept me going back for more.<br /><br />This was great on its own as a snack, but would also be fantastic mixed in with yogurt. There weren't as many berries in the mix as I expected, but that didn't really bother me. Obviously, I was in it for the chocolate!<br /><br />A great snack when you're looking for something just a little sweet.

review/text: If you like granola, you'll love the the crunch of this granola.  I got the kind with dark chocolate and red berries and I found these flavors to be complimentary of each other.  Though the ingredients are all natural and organic I'm a bit hung up on how many calories are in a serving and how much fat is in a serving too, but it is not uncommon for granola to be high in calories, fat and carbs. I enjoyed eating this on oatmeal, cold cereal, yogurt and ice-cream.

review/summary: Very good but where are the berries?
review/text: Nature's Path has manufactured many nutritional, delicious foods, so I'll leap at any chance to try their food for free. The Love Crunch Dark Chocolate & Red Berries Granola has a great taste and isn't as hard as most other granolas so it's easier to chew. However the shipping was rather unkind to the granola, which resulted in very small pieces and more powder than I'd expect it usually has. I don't know if it was just the batch I got, but I was rather disappointed in how little chocolate and especially berries were in the package. The chocolate is fantastic tasting, but the bits of berries were so tiny, and not due to the shipping, and there were so little of them, they may as well not been in there at all because I could barely taste any berry flavor. However, as I relayed before, the granola tastes great so I will be on the look out for more and hope the chocolate and red berries promised on the package will be more plentiful the next time around. As for the nutrition, it has 140 calories, 55 calories from fat per 1/4 cup, the sodium is low at 55 mg, as is the sugar at 6 grams. There are only 2 grams of both dietary fiber and protein so it might not be the best food to start out the day with, but would be great topped on yogurt. Besides being organic, I like the fact that there is no trans fat and it has flax seed included for omega-3s. I'm definitely a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006J4MAKY">Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries 11.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> even if I had a few minor issues.

review/summary: Very tasty - will absolutely buy more
review/text: I really enjoyed this granola, even though I do agree with other reviewers that the taste of berries should be stronger (e.g there just should be more berries in it) to provide counterbalance for the chocolate. Having said that, I LOVE chocolate/cacao taste and I really appreciated how it was chocolatey but for me not too sweet, it was nicely crunchy too.

review/summary: Yummy! Crunchy, sweet, addictive
review/text: So yummy and it's pretty too. There are little chunks of straight chocolate mixed in with the granola and berry bits, so you could pick the chocolate out if you are so inclined. (And I am!) The whole mix of flavors is nice and this stuff is very crunchy. You don't want to eat it in a movie theater - the folks next to you can hear the crunch. My Mother was delighted about the organic aspect, but I don't care one way or the other personally. I want a snack that tastes good and feels satisfying and the Love Crunch does that very nicely. The only complaint I have is when compared to average grocery store granola snacks, thie Love Crunch is VERY expensive. We'll probably buy this now and then as a treat, but it's just too pricey to be a staple in our pantry.

review/summary: Crunchy, tasty, yummy, good!
review/text: Normally when it comes to organic foods I have the same reaction that people who eat them have to non-organic foods; namely a reaction of "keep that stuff well away from me, thanks." Organic farming is inefficient and the end product isn't any better nutritionally or taste-wise than non-organic foods.<br /><br />That out of the way, I really enjoyed this! The chocolate taste is good, and not overwhelming, and the bits of berries really add something nice, even if they do have somewhat of an odd texture. I do imagine that you can probably find something that's just as good for cheaper, if you're willing to go the non-organic route. These do strike me as a little pricey.<br /><br />But price aside this is a dandy product and oh-so good!

review/summary: Addictive ...
review/text: I was more than surprised to find a non-homemade granola that managed to break away from the same generic taste I have grown to somewhat dislike over the years.  Aside from the organic, natural and health benefit shtick that accompanies most all granola products ... LOVE CRUNCH (Dark Chocolate and Berries) is simply scrumptious.<br /><br />The dark chocolate chunks fused to clusters of granola, mixed in with bits of dried strawberries and raspberries provides an initial sweetness that gradually subsides to reveal the stout flavor of the chocolate.  The wonderfully bitter bite provided by the chocolate blends well with the crunchy toasted oats and flax seeds.  LOVE CRUNCH delivers a more sophisticated flavor, rather than the sugary, candy-like sweetness most other flavored granola brands offer.<br /><br />While not sure whether LOVE CRUNCH is designed primarily as a cereal or a snack, I never got the chance to pour milk over it ... the addictive taste didn't allow me to leave much left to try it as a cereal.  This is possibly the best granola I've ever tasted and I look forward to trying the other available flavors.

review/summary: Surprisingly chocolatey
review/text: I haven't figured out how they got this granola to taste so strongly of chocolate. It doesn't LOOK that chocolate except for the little chocolate squares peppered into the granola here and there, but if I close my eyes and munch on it dry, I get somewhat of the chewiness and taste of brownie pieces. As a product to buy and eat, I like it. The only thing they could do to make it better is to add just a little more raspberry bits into it, because those are really good. I rate this a solid 4 stars for yumminess.<br /><br />What rates the five stars is the story and the heart behind the product. Certified organic and GMO-free, plus for every bag of Love Crunch you buy, Nature's Path will donate an equal amount to food banks in food or cash, up to a million dollars. I appreciate companies that care about the world they do business in.

review/summary: Chocolate Deliciousness
review/text: This stuff is AMAZING. I just got the bag in the mail today and I think I've already eaten half of it. It is super delicious - a perfect blend of chocolate, strawberry, oats and coconut. It tastes a little bit like my favorite chocolate oatmeal no-bake cookies. As an added plus, this granola is certified as USDA Organic. I like to eat it on its own, but I think it would also be delicious in some yogurt or as part of a parfait. Yummy! I definitely recommend it!<br /><br />Honestly, I think i'd eat this granola as dessert more often than breakfast :-)

review/summary: Just add milk!
review/text: I have always liked granola so when I was offered Love Crunch through the Amazon vine program I figured id give it a try.. This is by far the best granola I have ever had, it has nice big pieces of dark chocolate and they are delicious. I like that its organic, has low sodium, 0g of transfat, and its an excellent source of ALA omega 3.. For a 1/4 of a cup serving its 140 calories, 6 grams of fat, 6 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of protein. I like to add the granola to my cereal or by itself with milk and it is so good.. I got my granola at the end of march and the exp date is august 2012  and you get 6 bags of granola so its somthing to keep in mind. I also like the fact that for every bag of Love Crunch that is purchased this company will donate an equal amount to foodbanks in food or cash up to $1 million. I highly recommend this granola especially if you love dark chocolate like I do.

review/summary: Tasty, Fatty, Flawed
review/text: I'm rating this a four for flavor, which is generally all I care about when I eat. It's tasty, not too exciting but perfectly enjoyable. Sweet but not too sweet, crunchy, maybe a little drier than it needed to be.<br /><br />I looked at the nutrition info, however, and couldn't believe that a product whose packaging won't shut up about how healthy it is had such high calories and fat contents--and that was with a serving size of one tenth the bag! This food is light and not too satisfying and no one's going to be happy eating it one tenth at a time.<br /><br />Then there's the packaging, some kind of eco-unfriendly synthetic plastic.  It's very soft and has way too much give to it, no structural integrity to speak of.  I'm blaming that for my other big problem with the product, which is that my granola arrived in terrible shape. Nearly all the large clusters were broken up, and quite a lot of the granola was so pulverized that I couldn't hold it in my fingers and had to pour it out of the bag. Come on, who wants to do that?

review/summary: AWESOME!
review/text: This was soo good!  I enjoyed the texture, as it wasn't too hard and crunchy, like I have experienced with other granolas.  The flavor was delicious as well.  The "bits" were bit enough that it could be eaten out of hand as an on the go snack (which I did) or as a cereal in a bowl with milk (which I also tried).<br /><br />The only drawback I see to this is that the raspberries are quite tart, and without anything else in the bite can be almost over powering.  But, mixed in with the cereal and chocolate bits, they are quite lovely.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious and nutritious, a welcome addition to an overall healthy diet
review/text: As someone who tries to be healthy as far as food is concerned, eating whole grains has been the cornerstone of this endeavor. Along with exercise, trying my very best to eat a healthy diet has reaped rewards as far as my weight overrall health profile is concerned.<br />Making Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola a part of my diet helps me in sustaining a healthy lifestyle by maintaining a consistent intake of whole grains and Omega-3 which supports a healthy cardiovascular system. It tastes very good coupled with the fact that what you are actually enjoying to eat is good for you---14 grams of whole grain in 30 gram serving. This can also serve as a good snack in place of those chips which can be high in fat and cholesterol. Nothing indicated on the ingredients is a cause for concern, not even its sugar contents which is only 6 grams per serving. Total carbs is kept at a minimum at 20g per serving, even if you have 5 servings, you are still under the allowable daily carbs allowance even if you are under a carb restricted diet. I love snacking of this without the guilt. It is in the middle pack as far as price is concerned. But for the indicated price that you see here in Amazon, you get a pack of six 11.5 ounce bag. I am totally stoked with this product that I will be ordering more. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Dangerously delicious
review/text: Heed my advice!  When you go to eat this, measure out your portion, seal the bag and put it under a timed lock.  It's a pretty high calorie snack and terribly, terribly delicious and I think I got about 3 servings out of the bag instead of the...you know...10...it's really got in there.<br /><br />Also, bring a spoon.  I think the concept is finger-food with chunks of granola but in the end there's a lot of loose granola lying around.  I also wish it had more of the dried berries... also note that it's not "chocolate infused granola" but rather, granola clusters with small chunks of chocolate scattered throughout the mix.  My first bite was like "eh...not much chocolate taste here" but I didn't realize the chunks of chocolate were in there separately.<br /><br />It's a great mix and a tasty snack and you'll be awfully tempted to eat the whole bag in one go, which is probably not the greatest idea.

review/summary: Well balanced flavor
review/text: This granola crunch, intended to be eaten like trail mix, has a well balanced flavor between all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The chocolate chunks and dried berries are small and easily mix in a handful. And the coconut flavor is quite pronounced. It is a perfect size for storing in a desk drawer at work or somewhere climate controlled. With the real chocolate, these could have a problem if you carry it camping or leave it in your car on a hot day.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients as shared by Natures Path:<br /><br />Made with love and...<br />Rolled oats*, evaporated cane juice*, soy oil*, rolled spelt (wheat)*, dark chocolate chunks* (evaporated cane juice*, unsweetened chocolate*, cocoa butter*, soy lecithin*, vanilla*), flax seeds*, dried coconut*, cocoa*, freeze-dried berry blend* (freeze-dried strawberries*, freeze-dried raspberries*), rice starch*, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E). *Organic. Produced in a facility that uses dairy and peanuts. Contains soy, tree nuts and wheat.

review/text: Nature's Path Dark Chocolate & Red Berries Organic Love Crunch, Premium Organic Granola tastes as good as it gets in the world of granola.  We're talking real chocolate chunks, strawberries and raspberries that retain their flavor, and crisp oats.<br /><br />The ingredients as listed on the package are Rolled oats*, evaporated cane juice*, soy oil*, rolled spelt (wheat)*, dark chocolate chunks* (evaporated cane juice*, unsweetened chocolate*, cocoa butter*, soy lecithin*, vanilla*), flax seeds*, dried coconut*, cocoa*, freeze-dried berry blend* (freeze-dried strawberries*, freeze-dried raspberries*), rice starch*, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E).  All are USDA Certified Organic and contain no trans fat.<br /><br />Unfortunately for those who must count calories, no granola is a health food.  � cup of this yummy granola contains 140 calories, 55 of which are from fat.  My much less interesting daily nosh of Post Great Grains Raisins, Dates, & Pecans has 210 calories in � cup, of which 35 are fat calories.  That's Yummy Nature's Path at 420 calories per � cup serving, with 165 from fat, or less yummy Great Grains at 210 and 35.<br /><br />This puts Nature's Path in the realm of greatly enjoyed tasty treats for me and mine, rather than a daily staple.<br /><br />Five Stars for great flavor and three stars for fat high content average out to Four Stars.

review/summary: Great Tasting Organic Granola
review/text: Love Crunch - Dark Chocolate & Red Berries is an awesome granola.  I love the balanced taste that the dark chocolate, berries, and granola clusters provide.  I also like that I can easily read and understand the ingredient list.  There's no "partially blah blah" this or "modified" that.  The flavor lives up to the name.  If you like these things, there's a really good chance that you will like this granola.  The only danger is that this relatively small bag has 10 full servings.  While you could use it as a cereal, I use it more as a snack/stop gap between meals.  A few bites mid-morning or afternoon will help bridge the between meal gaps.  There's really nothing not to like about it.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: More Than Just A Breakfast Cereal...
review/text: As a confirmed chocoholic, I am always on the lookout for something chocolate that might legitimately be eaten as a breakfast food.  When I found Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries, I thought I had reached the end of my quest.<br /><br />The granola portion of this cereal is excellent - it is flavorful and tastes good.  However, the red berries - which appear to be dried strawberries - were lacking in flavor and added little more than some color to the cereal.  I found the tiny chocolate squares to be grainy.<br /><br />This product would be excellent used as a basis for a cheesecake crust or as a layer in a dessert parfait.  It might work well as an addition in basic chocolate chip cookie dough as a substitute for oatmeal and chocolate chips.  It is a granola that allows you to use your imagination andd to enjoy it in multiple forms.

review/text: This is without a doubt the best chocolate granola I've ever had. You can taste the richness of the dark chocolate, and the flavor berries are untainted by any sugar or that off taste you sometimes get if they haven't been dried properly. Chunky and decadent but not overwhelming - my only problem with this was that it didn't come in a bigger bag! Definitely will be buying this again.
