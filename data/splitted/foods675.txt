review/summary: Meh...
review/text: NOTE:  This product probably works best if you are going to put them in a thermos, but it doesn't work that well if just placed in a coffee cup.<br /><br />I purchased these back when it was a kickstarter campaign.<br /><br />I'm the type of person who likes a hot cup of coffee and I tend to sip slowly so I find myself going to the microwave to heat up my cup all the time.  I thought this would be the perfect solution.<br /><br />I did follow instructions to warm them up first.  I would pour boiling water over them for 4 minutes while my press-pot coffee brewed. I would then pour out the water from the cup and pour my coffee onto the now-hot Joulies.<br /><br />For me, there was absolutely no noticeable difference in how fast my coffee got cold - so I'd have to go through the extra step of pouring the coffee into a different cup so I could microwave it as the Joulies can't be microwaved.  What a Pain.<br /><br />I tried them every day for a week to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and then put them in a drawer someplace where unused kitchen gadgets go to die.<br /><br />I tried them in a thermos a few times and they seems to work ok (thus the 2 stars) but I don't really use a thermos all that often.  So, for my purposes (keeping a cup of coffee hot) they did absolutely nothing.

review/summary: Unimpressed
review/text: My husband was really excited about these things. He read about them in a magazine over a year ago before they were available for purchase, and decided to buy them for me as a gift (now that they're available), to replace the two ice cubes I dump in my coffee every morning to make it "chuggable". Um, I'm not impressed. My coffee remained too hot to drink initially (just as it would be WITHOUT them in it), and was cold within one hour (again, JUST like it would be WITHOUT them in it). In fact, the only thing different about my coffee with these little Joulies in it is there was a LOT less room in my cup for actual coffee because they're quite large and you need several in your cup. Maybe they're more geared for those who enjoy their coffee in travel mugs? And because I cannot speak to this I thought one star would be inappropriate.<br /><br />I will of course lie and tell my husband they're miraculous and wonderful. But secretly I wish he'd saved the $50 because my ice cubes have been working just fine for years and are what I'll continue to use when he's not around.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I just realized these things cost him $60 and decided to return them!

review/text: Haci Bekir is THE company that makes the best Turkish Delight.  I went to the store when I visited Istanbul a couple of years back and have been yearning for this treats ever since.  I tried the other brands, but they're just not the same.  It's a rarity to find this brand in the US (store or online), but I found it on Amazon!  Eating this pistachio turkish delight treats brings back memories of the best candies I've had in my life.  Thank you!

review/text: Got this as a gift for my dad's birthday because he likes pistachios.  He liked it... and mom did too!  Now I'm planning to get him two boxes for Father's Day so he can enjoy a whole box even if mom *is* 'helping'.<br /><br />We'd never had Turkish Delight before, and this seemed like a good one to try, based on the earlier review.  These are chewy but not sticky, sweet but not overly so, and have a nice overall flavor.  I'd recommend this as a gift again! Dad really liked it, and it was something he'd never tried.

review/summary: The lemon shines through
review/text: The oil itself is excellent and the lemon flavor is just right--stronger than the stuff that you might get in a local grocer's, at least here in Texas--but it doesn't have a processed, chemical taste.<br /><br />I find that using it as the only oil in a vinaigrette is too strong, and so you needn't go to the expense, but if it comprises a fourth to a half of the oil, and if the other oil is good, the balance is quite nice. In fact, if the acid in the vinaigrette is a good sherry vinegar, the flavor of the lemon in the oil is more noticeable than the vinegar.

For a really spectacular salad dressing that is sure to win rave reviews mix together Agrumento Extra Virgin Olive Oil with Pressed Lemons and "Marukan" brand seasoned gourmet Rice Vinegar Lite in approximate equal amounts (or a little more of the rice vinegar depending on taste). If desired add a little salt and pepper and wisk all together until blended. This is so easy, but so delicious! Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent flavor, shipped and packaged well
review/text: Before I post my review, I'll state the following:<br /><br />I've never been to Montreal so I can't compare this to the meat found in an actual Montreal, Quebec deli.<br /><br />This product is from the USA, but at least according to wikipedia it's from an area of the USA that does produce a "true" Montreal beef brisket, although the article also implies that some feel that only brisket from Montreal is the "true" Montreal beef brisket.<br /><br />Give the two items above, I found this product to be excellent.  Smokey without being overpowering, tender and quite fresh despite being sliced and then vacuum sealed.  The pepper along the edges of each slice add a bit as well, but again it's far from overpowering.  This works well, cold or warm as a sandwich meat, or heated as sliced meat on a plate.<br /><br />Product shipped very fast, and was well packaged.  Despite my getting home late and thus the package sitting for nearly 2 hours (I'm single and I couldn't arrange for someone to pick it up for me) it was still quite cold, being packaged in (if memory serves) a styrofoam box with "blue ice" (not the actual brand, but something similar, a gelled "ice" that is at least in theory reusuable).  As currently advertised as of June 2012, it was in (again if memory serves) individual one pound packages and again both pre-sliced and fully cooked.  Fat content is fine in my opinion, although I haven't tried making an au-jus with it like apparently one reviewer did when he possibly mistook this for pastrami (he doesn't mention au-jus, but does mention a "pastrami dip").  The one time I did reheat it though, I didn't see enough "drippings" to make anything like an au-jus.<br /><br />Anyway, when I do run out I'm going to consider this product again.  It's of fine quality and is shipped very well.

review/summary: hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options
review/text: My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.

They still taste pretty good though.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts copied from the actual package (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 2 cookies (25g/ 0.9oz)<br /><br />Servings per container about 8<br /><br />Calories per serving 130<br /><br />Calories from fat 70<br /><br />Total Fat 7g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br /><br />Sodium 65mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br /><br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamins A and C 0%<br /><br />Calcium 0%<br /><br />Iron 4%<br /><br />FYI, I purchased my cookies during 100 degree weather and except for some of the chocolate melting onto the inner wrapper the cookies were fine (I used 2 day shipping which might make a difference since the cookies weren't in the heat that long).<br /><br />At 15.88 for 4 bags of cookies the price per bag is 3.97 which is 48 cents more than the price printed on the cookie bag (3.49).

review/text: These are our favorite kind of cookies! Usually, I just buy the dark chocolate one, but Pepperidge has so many different types, I recently decided to try the others. The mint adds a refreshing hint to the chocolate, which we like. These are nice to enjoy with tea as a midafternoon snack or something of the sort.

review/summary: OK, but not up to normal Milano standards.
review/text: I guess I should've known: I checked out the prices for the various permutations of the Milano brand name and this was the cheapest.  The cookies arrived in fair condition, with some of them broken already.  Slight breakage is okay, since we break them up to eat them anyway.  However, when they are broken to the point of powder, they become useless.  I believe that these were overbaked or the mix failed.  There was a powdery texture to the cookie instead of the smooth surface.  It's a subtle difference but the 'Milano' experience is very specific.  At these prices, they better be perfect.  These cookies weren't.<br /><br />I know Pepperidge Farm products; my parents lived in Norwalk, CT near their factory.  I have shopped at the company store.  What's amazing is that their products are perfectly good at the expiration date or even one year later.  However, in the case of the product above, they were not good right out of the factory and thus they were discounted.

review/summary: Classic Cookies
review/text: All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that.

review/text: A tasty treat for those who remember what these were like when they used to sell them in the stores, now I can't find this one, but they have the double chocolate, mint, and other random flavors that I don't find quite as appealing.<br /><br />Note that this is a pack of four, but still expensive for such - probably designed to extract the emotional value from people like me. Considering the other kinds can be had for far cheaper at Target... I can do without these for a while again, especially as most of us don't eat through these fast enough to get through four packs by the due date.

review/text: The cookies were delicious, chrisp and whole. I can only say they did not last long.  Pepperidge Farm Mint Milano is the only cookie I realy enjoy and would eat a lot off.  The others, even in Peppridge Farm I would only eat one or two.  But I have found that the Mint Milano is hard to get.  Pepperidge Farm should try selling in Canada and Jamaica,  West Indies.  I actually live in Jamaica, W.I. and can not get Mint Milano there so I either ask friends to buy it for me or buy it on line.  Would recommend this cookie for all those people that like a lite combination of mint and chocolate.

review/text: We've tried a lot of Progresso soups lately, and this is one of the few I've been disappointed in. Normally even their light soups are well seasoned and thus have a strong, good flavor. That was not the case with this soup. It was just kind of blah tasting. It also had very little chicken in it. It did have their big twisted noodles, which I'm also not a fan of. They tend to be tough and irritating. It is only 70 calories a serving, which is its only real plus. However, a lot of other Progresso soups are in a good calorie range and also a delight to eat. Try one of them instead.

review/summary: Couscous, not Tabouli
review/text: First and foremost I will say that I was sorely disappointed with this item.  I purchased mine at World Market where I have previously had great success with another brand that they sadly no longer carry.  That previous brand was real tabouli.  This one was not.  Tabouli is made with Bulgar wheat.  This is couscous.  The packaging is very misleading.<br /><br />I only give this two stars because the finished product was edible, but not flavorful.  Moreover, in trying to follow the instructions for preparation, the first instruction says simply, "empty package contents into bowl and add an equal amount of water."  I tried to eyeball it and was able to come out with a decent guess at 1 1/2 cups.  Regardless, one shouldn't have to guess.  I will not buy this again.

review/summary: Very hard product
review/text: I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell.

review/summary: A New Favorite
review/text: I am impressed by Halo's products, although the canned food variety is the only thing I had previously tried, when I was babying my dog while she was recuperating after her spay surgery. I can feel good about feeding her such wholesome food, and she devours it. This was my first time buying Halo treats. Even though the package says they're for dogs 25-60 lbs, my 17 lb, one year old terrier mix is still in the puppy stage and is an avid chewer. I was looking for a product to change it up from the old reliable rawhide, for something she would not demolish in 5 minutes, and something different than meat-flavored treats (for variety). I was unsure if she would go for the pumpkin flavor, but this was an instant hit! She LOVES the taste of these treats and has no problem chewing them. I gave her a whole stick and she worked on it (kept her occupied) for about 45 minutes until it was completely gone. They smell really good, like pumpkin pie spice, and although they are dark brown in color, they do not stain like some of the red-colored rawhide products I've tried. I have gone through half the bag so far (7 sticks in a bag), giving her one every few days, and she really enjoys them. I am definitely buying these again, and I am going to try the mint variety and see if that's a winner too. I'd recommend that even if you have a small dog, give them a try to switch up your choice of hard chew treats if your puppy or dog is a big chewer.

These are for medium to large dogs, not so much for small dogs unless they're really aggressive chewers.

It turns out that our 15lb pom mix loves Spot's Chews and they smell great to us as well.  The only issue is that it's a lot of chew for a small dog, although they are labeled as being for "small/medium" pets.  They are hard to break so my husband was slicing them into thirds with a knife and we'd give a third of a chew a day.<br /><br />One cute thing is that if you look at them top down, they are actually shaped like hearts.

review/text: I ordered the 200-count box of 4-inch bones for the first time, and I'm happy with the purchase so far. My dog is small but a ferocious chewer, and supervised pressed rawhides are the only way I can afford to sate that desire. Amazon has the best prices I've seen anywhere.<br /><br />I do think I underestimated how small the 4-inchers actually are. They're not bad, but for the next purchase, I may opt for the 8-inchers, which are currently slightly cheaper on a per-pound basis.<br /><br />I ordered my bones direct from Amazon. Based on one of the reviews, the first thing I did was count the pieces. There were exactly 200 in the box. As seen in the product photo, the Ranch Rewards box has a large opening. Before shipping it, Amazon places it into another, much more secure, box. Perhaps some of the third-party merchants take less care.

It's not often an actual five star pretzel-small breadstick at a reasonable price with a hefty portion....they are a lot lighter than pretzels, so more volume.

The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: Love this coffee!  Better then Keurig brands!
review/text: I did not buy this at Amazon even though I am an avid amazon shopper.  Needless to say I went to cosco with a friend and got this exact box for $25 at Cosco.  I debated getting it and once it was in my cart I had two different people tell me how much they loved the coffee and with 80 pods at that price I figured I would try it.  I came home at 8 pm and decided to open it up.<br /><br />IN THE BOX:  Inside I have 10 clear plastic bags each with 8 pods.  The bottom has no plastic white thing I am used to and not only is the coffee in a mesh bag making it so you can not store it in the carousel (it is loose and falls out) you would not want to because it would lose freshness.  SO the other 7 went in Tupperware.  I give it 2 points for helping the environment and 4 for the price without trying it!<br /><br />TASTE:  Brew it at 8pm (not the best time for coffee but ahhh)  It smells absolutely amazing!  Super strong odor if you like the smell of coffee.  Color is very dark, smell is strong.  I taste it black and it is stronger then even the jet fuel k-cups.  Add some creamer try it again and then add a little more and it is the best coffee I have had in my life and that says a lot as Paris had some amazing coffee!<br /><br />Needless to say I grabbed the phone and called my friend who also bought a box after the two people commented on how much they loved the coffee to find out she had tried it and loves it as much as I do!  If you are debating trying this like I was I am hoping this review will help as I think I have finally kicked my expensive k-cup habit and I no longer need to worry about losing a bang for my buck!  Hopefully amazon will start matching Cosco prices as I do not have a cosco card though :)

review/summary: good coffee, cheaper elsewhere
review/text: We purchased this coffee yesterday for the first time. It's a very good coffee.. an 80 count box was under $25, that's half the price that it's listed for here. Of course it was at Costco.. The most worthwhile membership I've ever owned! If there is one near you, pay your membership.. buy your coffee there.. it will only take saving half the cost on your coffee on 2 boxes to pay yourself back for your membership! You can store your pods in a ziploc bag to maintain freshness after the celo packs are opened. If you are like us as coffee drinkers, it won't last long enough to get stale anyway.

review/text: I have actually visited the Pelindaba lavender fields a few years ago on a visit to the San Juan Islands so was thrilled to see this product available.  I was reminded of the warm smell of lavender growing in the July sun with bees swarming around the plants.  One of my best travel memories.  Love this honey- it has a more lavender flavor than some honies but is really wonderful.  Great value for the money.  Adds a wonderful something extra to Greek yogurt or to a bowl of fresh blueberries.  Fresh blueberries take very well to a little dollop of lavender honey. Try it!

review/summary: Surprisingly addicting
review/text: I've been a tea lover for a long time, though I generally drink loose leaf varieties.  I tried this for the first time at an office location I was doing some work at and was immediately addicted.  I now keep it and the caffeine free version on hand at home at all times.<br /><br />I've tried many different spiced tea's and have never found anything similar.  The spicy smell is comforting and warming while the flavor is strong and delicious.  The 25ct package is the commercial package and larger than I could find in the local grocery for a similar price making it a good deal.<br /><br />The only thing I've found is that I like it steeped longer than usual.  Typically you would steep this for 4-5 minutes, but I like it with a stronger flavor and generally leave the tea bag in the entire time I'm drinking it.  Make sure you squeeze the bag as well or the flavor can sometimes be a little weak.

I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.

review/summary: Great flavor but officially discontinued by Kraft
review/text: Our family loves the White Grape flavor of Crystal Light. In fact, if it weren't for this flavor, some members of the family would have never drank Crystal Light at all. It has a great taste that's not too bitter and not too sweet.<br /><br />It seems like the availability of this flavor has been going through ups and downs for the last few years, with many people even claiming it was discontinued earlier. It wasn't discontinued then but I stumbled upon Crystal Light's official Facebook page where someone asked for a list of recently discontinued flavors. Crystal Light responded with a list and - lo and behold - White Grape was listed as a flavor that was discontinued as of November 2011. Here's a link to a screen shot of the post by Crystal Light for anyone who wants to see it - the post was made on Feb. 13, 2012: (...)<br /><br />After running into the post, I confirmed via the Crystal Light official website and White Grape is no longer listed as an available flavor in any quantity. So it looks like this great flavor, possibly one of the best Crystal Light had, is no more - sacrificed to market all the new "specialty" flavors.

review/summary: This is the first decaf I've ever had where you could not tell it was decaf!
review/text: Whenever I try and cut the caffeine I have struggled--usually I would have to order a Cafe Americano type thing (watered down, decaffinated espresso--tastes just like a regular cup of coffee, but oi, the price!) because I could never find something drinkable I could brew myself.<br /><br />A friend bought me some Peet's for my birthday and when I shopped to buy more (it is ALL excellent coffee!) I decided to give the decaf a try.  It was amazing!  I really could not tell I was drinking something decaf--and it was just their regular coffee--not espresso or anything else.  I have tried most of the different flavors at Peet's and the coffee is consistently fabulous--including all the decafs (for some reason I don't care as much for their Sumatra but my husband assures me it's my imagination as he loves it).<br /><br />In any case I HIGHLY RECOMMEND any and all Peet's coffees but most particularly their decafs like the French roast.<br /><br />As I always caution buyers on Amazon, look to see who the vendor is if it's not Amazon directly.  The products stay the same but the vendors may vary.  This includes some that actually keep their stock on Amazon's shelves which is great for shipping but also examine the pricing structures carefully.  Do your due diligence regarding the specific vendor including ratings, prices and shipping policies.<br /><br />That said, the decaf Peet's coffee is amazing!<br /><br />JTG

review/text: I'd heard good things about Poop-Freeze from other pet owners, so I ordered a can.  Sadly, I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped to be. I followed the directions the first time, and instead of frozen poop, I just had cooler poop to pick up.  The second time, I sprayed for longer than recommended. This gave me cold, but still not frozen, poop. Granted, if you're picking it up with a plastic baggie, cold poop is slightly more pleasant that still-warm poop, but the product implies that the poop will be frozen nearly solid and that is not the case. (Incidentally, we're talking a pug here, not a really BIG dog).

review/text: The spray does at least partially freeze the poop all canine owners need to responsibly pickup, but it falls well short of the product claims. My family has used it under varying weather conditions and had uneven results, though we have precisely followed the directions. It is most effective (provided the directions are followed exactly) on very solid stool and least effective on soft/running stool. The obvious problem is the latter is exactly why one would purchase the product. We bought it to do a more thorough job picking up after our dogs on a multi-use trail. We bike with our dogs (using Walky Dog) and like to leave the trail as clean as possible for others and to ensure dogs continue to be permitted to use the trail. The product did not help as much as we had hoped. When our multi-can supply runs out, I don't think we will purchase more.

review/summary: Terrible product
review/text: So not only does this not work at all on any type of fecal matter that is not solidified (and randomly, at best, on already hardened stool - in which case, the product is really pointless anyway), but when I got the item in the mail, I was both amused & shocked at the directions. It indicates that you are supposed to spray the top of the poop, then there's a step where you must flip the poop over to spray the underside. Well, if I'm gonna flip the crap over, I may as well just pick the damn thing up. Pardon the pun, but this product is the biggest 'waste' of money ever.

review/summary: Freezer Works Better
review/text: This product is a waste of time. I have been getting far better results freezing my own poop using my ordinairy under counter freezer! Why would you wait for the dog to go?<br /><br />Pointless!

review/summary: Great on Loose Stool
review/text: I love this product.  My dog drops bombs in the house on a regular basis.  Perhaps he does it just to let me know that he needs more attention or maybe he does it to piss me off.  Poop Freeze has saved the day!  It makes picking up poop easy and fun.  Did I say fun - YUP.  My kids love picking up after the dog outside in the yard with Poop Freeze.

review/summary: Zap it before it hits the ground!
review/text: Here's the trick.  If you zap it on the ground,  it sticks to the grass. Not good,  especially the gummy stuff.<br /><br />What you need to do is position your can so that as "scruffy" is doin his deal you get it before it hits the grass! Don't shoot too early though...

review/summary: Not good on loose stools or chairs
review/text: When my dog usually lays a loaf, it's of the super soft squidgy kind.  Kinda like a Hostess Snowball.  After using this product, his doggy little debbies are a bit more solid, but still way too squishy for me to want to pick up with my bare hands!<br />So do what I do!  Sprinkle some cat litter on the poop and convince your dog that it's cat poop.  He'll scarf his own doggie tootsie rolls like they were leftovers from dinner.<br />How's that for recycling Mr Gore?!?  BOOYAH!!
