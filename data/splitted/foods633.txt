review/summary: A low calorie indulgence!
review/text: I don't think I'd be a girl if I didn't love chocolate.  I don't think anything could be better than matching raspberry with chocolate.  My sister-in-law buys these chocolate covered raspberries (in bulk!!!) and so I ordered this matcha hoping that it would satisfy me enough so I wouldn't steal her stash and become 400 pounds!  I opened this matcha and was pleasantly surprised to smell chocolate!  I couldn't seem to smell the raspberry in it.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh, if it'll make it very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I really wasn't sure how I wanted to prepare this matcha.  First I prepared it with just 1 tsp matcha and 16.9oz of water.  It was ok, but not really what I was looking for.  I seemed to get more chocolate from it this way and not enough raspberry flavor.  SO, next I heated up some milk, added a bit of sugar and frothed it up into a latte.  Now here is where I get more of the raspberry.  It's a nice creamy truffle.<br />On a side note, I'll be learning to make truffles from tea as a local tea shop this week so maybe I'll be able to use what I have left in making a tea truffle!  You can never go wrong with chocolate and raspberries that don't make you gain weight.<br />THANKS again Red Leaf for another wonderful matcha creation....keep'em comin'!<br />To get your own tasty Raspberry Truffle Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]

review/summary: Terrific Rasberry!
review/text: So I just have to say this matcha is delicious!  It tastes like a rasberry truffle and the lingering taste after you drink it is exactly like the lingering taste that is left when you eat an actual truffle.  Besides the great taste Red Leaf has terrific customer service!

review/summary: Wow how do they do this?
review/text: My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!

review/summary: Great, intense flavor!
review/text: As I was considering which flavored matcha I would try next from Red Leaf Tea, I was stumped. There are so many amazing flavors! However, this Raspberry Truffle matcha caught my eye fairly quickly and I knew that I had to give it a try. I am a sucker for all things chocolate, particularly super rich truffles of all flavors. I had very high expectations for this matcha and I have to say that it more than exceeded my expectations! You can find out more about this matcha here: [...]<br /><br />Once again, I was very pleased by the intense aroma as I opened the package. I could have sworn that somebody just opened a very expensive box of raspberry truffles somewhere in my kitchen. The matcha was a very bright green color despite being flavored. I first tried this traditionally as a hot bowl of matcha in my chawan. Initially, the slight bitterness of the matcha hits your palate, but it is followed by an intense and slightly sweet raspberry flavor with the chocolate aspect occurring more in the aftertaste. I love how the aftertaste lingers several minutes after your last sip and I also appreciate that the matcha was very easy to whisk with no noticeable clumps. While this is a super awesome way to drink this matcha, I just had to try it as a cold latte since it is so unbelievably hot here in Texas.<br /><br />For the cold latte I added a healthy scoop of this Raspberry Truffle matcha and milk into a blender bottle and shook it all up. Once again the matcha blended beautifully without any clump which is something I've noticed in other matchas when preparing them with a cold liquid. Although I didn't add any sweetener, the matcha seems a little sweeter now, but not by any means overly so. I also think that the flavor profile is a bit more balanced at this temperature. The bitter edge of the matcha is almost non-existent and the raspberry and chocolate flavors are more unified as a raspberry truffle would be. It is quite refreshing on this hot day and I was impressed that it didn't settle out even after being left on the counter for 10+ minutes.<br /><br />Overall, this is another big success from Red Leaf Tea! Not only is the tea quite tasty, their customer service is amazing. My order arrived within 2 business days! If you haven't tried anything from this company, you are missing out!

review/text: I picked this up at my local Rite Aid. It was only a dollar for an 8pk, so I decided to try them. The fact that I could not find an exp. date should have been a warning. These are horrible, hard and firm like jujube, and leaves a nasty too-sweet-almost-bitter aftertaste. Global Brands is batting 0 for 2 so far. Their Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate is also far off the mark.

review/summary: Have a Nigella
review/text: Nigella in Arabic are the Seed of Blessing.  The flavor is deep and savory, like a peppered oregano and something you just cannot put your finger on.  Musky and warm, it is pungent and cozy.  They are used from Spain to Pakistan.  If you have had them, it is most likely in string cheese, often from Armenia.  If you are from New York, they were frequently used in stead of caraway in rye bread.<br /><br />If you are a baker, try studding your crust with them, especially if you are using an egg wash.  Nigella love all starch, pasta, potato, rice and bread.  As before, they also fancy cheese.  If you cannot find Armenian string cheese, there are several domestic ones made without the seeds.  But they tend to be on the krafty side.  Trader Joe's may be the best of that lot.  Or go to your mexican market and get Oaxaca cheese, the kind you stuff chilies with, which is a good place to use them since they go with tomato sauce.  Middle Eastern halloumi or akawi work well.<br /><br />Or, go with farmers' type curded cheeses, whole milk cottage will do.  Just warm a spoon of seed in virgin olive oil until it hits your nose, but do not use high heat or you will burn the fat in the oil.  Cool and stir into the cheese.  Crumbled feta or blue are good.  Let it sit overnight or so if you want, just take it out of the refrigerator for an hour or so to bring it back to room temperature.<br /><br />Switch out the pepper for Nigella in your next ratatouille.  My favorite:  use a table spoon of seed in two of oil and two of butter, warm as before and fold in 200 grams or so of gorgonzola (dolce is decadent) and toss with a hot pot of your just drained fettuccine or pappardelle or even black squid ink pasta.  Just do not be too zealous in draining.  Some pasta water is nice.  Add a spoon or two if that is easier.  Garnish with fresh oregano, marjoram or basil.<br /><br />Prefer rice?  Use feta and kalamata olives or feta and small shrimp with blanched spinach.<br /><br />Get to know this seed.  You might see them labeled as charnushka.  Zamouri is a first rate source of highest quality and freshness.

review/summary: Full of orange flavor, sweet with no aftertaste
review/text: I recently switched from Splenda to Stevia.  I purchased Sweetleaf sugar packets with fiber, which are great, and now decided to try a flavored drop.  This one is very good!  Nice orange flavor, almost like a mandarin rather than an orange, and again, just like the packet, no aftertaste.  Very good, makes me want to try other flavors.  I only put 2-3 drops per 16oz, no more.  With Sweetleaf stevia, seems less is more, otherwise, you may get bitter taste.  Why did I switch from Splenda?  Turns out Splenda's glycemic index, a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels, is higher than sugar!

review/summary: My Favorite Way to Kill The Taste of Water!
review/text: I am not a fan of plain drinking water and this product is my saving grace.  Even fresh squeezed lemon doesn't do the trick for me!  A clear glass of water over ice with a few droppers of this makes you think you are drinking something sweet and exotic.  What a treat!  You have to be careful not to get it too strong, or it becomes almost "bitter".  I also always put a few drops of Valencia Orange in my water bottles to take with me before I leave the house!  This is a can't do without product for me.  I usually buy 2-3 of these a month and was absolutely THRILLED to find it on Amazon as a Subscribe and Save item.  I'm out in the country and always have to plan ahead to keep my supply going.  I have tried the Lemon Drop and Root Beer flavors, and while they are good, this is the one that I prefer!  You might even be able to break a child's juice or soda habit by using this or one of the other flavors!  This is much more economical and eco-wise than buying the fancy flavored bottled waters that abound in the market place.  I drink out of a quart Mason jar and recycle the empty bottle when I'm done!  It is also a good way to flavor and sweeten hot tea!

review/summary: OK for sweetener, but not much orange flavor
review/text: SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia Valencia Orange works fine as a sweetener.  In fact, it's very sweet, almost cloying.  But it doesn't do much to provide orange flavor.  I would put it in the category of a sweetener, not a flavor enhancer.  I thought I could add a few drops of this to a glass of water and have a refreshing orangey beverage, but what I get is a super-sweet glass of water with a barely detectable hint of orange.  I may use this in hot or iced tea on occasion but doubt I will use it as a stand-alone flavor enhancer.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweetener and are familiar with the super sweetness of Stevia, this is worth trying.  But if you're looking for something with a strong orange flavor, you won't find it here.

review/summary: This by far is the best tasting Stevia
review/text: This by far is the best tasting Stevia I have tried. I have tried different brands but they leave a bad taste in my mouth. Wisdom brand I have used for 6 years and have not been dissapointed. One thing to keep in mind is one tsp equils one cup of sugar approximately. I use a little less than a tsp of stevia to equal a cup of sugar. If you get a bitter taste you are using to much stevia. I use this primaryly to make Kool-Aid. Its cheaper than pop, all natural, zeor glycemic value, zero calories. I would recommend Wisdom brand stevia to anyone looking to cut processed, artifical sugar. Google Wisdom to find all products and recipe books.

The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating.  Best mustard to go with prime beef.  Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats, lettuce and fresh sprouts.  Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese (or, hey, just with crackers!).  A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.<br /><br />We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out.  We got spoiled, and now it's VERY hard to find.  So great to see it on Amazon -- wow!!!!

review/text: lapsang souchong tea is some of my favorite tea. it has a very distinct flavor, owing to it being smoked dried with pinewood.  the bags of tea say they make 20-25 cups of tea, but as this tea has a strong flavor to it, i used only a tiny bit of tea leaves per cup and managed to get ~35 cup with the one bag i've used so far.<br />overall im very satisfied with this purchase.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious tea!
review/text: I love this tea.  Ahmad tea is just a perfect cup of tea.  English Tea No. 1 is my tea of choice.  It's perfectly balanced and never bitter, no matter how long it's brewed.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you want to purchase English Tea No. 1 in it's loose form, you have to buy "English Afternoon Tea" loose.  Please note, however, that in teabag form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are two distinct blends.  But in loose form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are on in the same. I don't know why that's the case, but that's what a representative from Ahmad Tea told me when I emailed them to ask where I can buy English Tea No. 1 in loose form.<br /><br />I purchased loose English Afteroon Tea (aka Eng. Tea No. 1) from another online purveyor, and the loose version of the tea is just as delicious (maybe even more so) than the bagged version.  the loose tea is whole leaf tea, which is hard to find in a black tea.  usually, loose black tea is very finely shredded, not altogether different from its bagged form.  but the loose Ahmad black tea is whole leaf, which just goes to show how high the quality is at Ahmad tea.<br /><br />all in all, a terrific tea, and highly recommended.

review/text: We received a gift basket with this tea in it for Christmas. When my wife tried it she couldn't get over how great it tasted. Being a tea drinker all of her adult life and fancying herself as knowing a good tea from a bad she just had to have a supply of this tea. We couldn't find a local store that carried it so we went to Amazon to order some. The company that we ended up with wasted no time in getting the tea to us without difficulty. Of course once you add in the shipping the price of the tea goes up, but that's a small price to pay in order to make my wife a happy woman.

review/text: We love this tea. Being of English extraction, we are used to drinking a strong English "breakfast" type tea. This has a very nice flavor, not overly strong unless you steep it a long time, with just a hint of bergamot to liven up the strong tea taste (much less bergamot than in Earl Grey). After reading another review of this tea from someone who said that Ahmad's English Afternoon loose tea is actually the same as their English Tea No. 1 in teabags, we also bought this in 7 oz tins from another vendor, and it does taste pretty much the same. I use the loose tea in my teapot, and the bags when making a quick "cuppa".

review/summary: Good product, good price, always arrives in great condition
review/text: I don't personally eat this product so I can't vouch for the flavor and texture. I do, however, buy it here and buy it often as I donate it regularly to my church for their special dinners for the homeless, those in need, and fundraiser suppers.<br /><br />The pastor tells me that those who do the cooking for the church, as well as those being served enjoy it a lot and many ask for 'seconds'. The pastor advises me it makes a great side dish and helps to fill up hungry tummies  while being so easy to make. On occasion, the church cooks will add their own additional onions and celery, but it isn't necessary as this stuffing includes all that and more. And,because this is a 'herb' flavor, adding chicken stock or turkey stock vs. water makes it even more complimentary to a chicken/turkey meal.<br /><br />The price here at Amazon is better than that at the local grocery stores, esp. with my Prime for free shipping. I can also get it in 1-2 days if the church needs extra with short notice. Good deal, good product, prompt service.<br /><br />Edit: 2-25-10 (after-thought). All one needs to add to this product is butter and water. Depending on how moist/dry one prefers stuffing, simply add more/less water. Our church roasts turkeys and hen turkeys in large quantities very often and we strain and freeze the 'au jus' from them in 12 oz plastic containers. Occasionally, rather than using up our butter supply for stuffing, we substitute the defrosted au jus from the turkey. This seems to be the preferred 'flavor' by those enjoying the meals.

review/summary: Basic Boxed Food
review/text: This is boxed stuffing which -- as in all boxed foods -- in my mind is the equivalent of bland, bleh food. My husband, though, actually prefers this over my (sometimes) labor intensive homemade stuffing so I like to keep a quantity of it in the house for him. Making this according to the directions isn't something I've ever done so I can't really comment on that but I can say that with a quick few additions and substitutions, I can actually eat and enjoy this as well.<br /><br />First, I always use stock (usually chicken/duck -- whatever I have in my freezer) instead of water and add some sort of vegetable to it as well. Usually it's sauteed, grated carrots or zucchini but I've put everything in it at one point or another. I also add to the seasoning with whatever I think will taste good (sage is always great as well as any sort of chicken seasoning and I always add parsley if I have it fresh on hand).<br /><br />Here are some more suggestions to add to make your stuffing better that I've tried and liked:<br /><br />-- Cooked sausage -- breakfast sausage is always good but I've used brats and italian sausage as well and it's equally as good.<br />-- Bacon<br />-- Chicken livers (or turkey or duck or whatever you might be cooking)<br />-- Ground beef<br />-- Or you could go the fruit way and add apple, dried cranberries, raisins or even substitute some of the water for cider<br />-- Nuts (chestnuts and walnuts are what I've used)<br />-- Veggies -- Like I said above, grated carrots or zucchini is my standby but I always add onions, garlic, and sometimes celery or mushrooms as well.<br />-- Cheese -- parmesan in particular<br /><br />I also have a friend who swears by adding white rice to it as well but I haven't tried it (and personally think that that's an awful lot of carbs!)<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer has said, this is a fantastic donation item because it's easy to make as well as being very filling.<br /><br />Nutritional Information (1/6th of the box or 1/2 cup prepared stuffing):<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Calories from Fat: 50<br />Total Fat: 1g **<br />Saturated Fat: 0g **<br />Trans Fat: 0g **<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Total Carb: 21g<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Vitamin A: 8%<br />Vitamin C: 0%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 6%<br /><br />** (plus whatever butter you use)<br /><br />*** Contains both wheat and soy

My Mom loves this no mess way to make coffee and my Dad loves that there are in no grounds in his coffee, which is a problem with the small coffee makers. The best thing is that it is every bit as good if not better than the loose coffee.<br /><br />Our local supermarkets dropped the decaf version, so happy I found it here and love that it is shipped right to their door.

review/text: This works real well for since I am unable for find Maxwell decaffeinated coffee in the local stores in or around Plano, Texas. Also I am the only coffee drinker in our house so with the pack it makes just the right amount for me to have my two cups in the morning. The fact that I have it on automatic reorder helps also.

review/summary: Weak coffee if you brew one pouch and 24 oz. water (4 cups)
review/text: Coffee portions (cups) are 6 oz. If you like your coffee strong, you'll get one large 12-14 oz cup with one pouch. The flavor of this coffee is very good.  If you own a hotel type 4 cup coffee brewer like the Jerdon First Class, these work far better than trying to use #2 cone filters. Cone filters aren't meant to be used in hotel type round pouch brewing containers, the cone collapses and some grinds leak out. I gave up on square pouches with coffee, the square pouches let hot water drip by (in the round brew container) which dilutes the coffee. These are the best 4 cup round coffee pouches I've come across. These pouches are somewhat expensive per cup, but I only drink 2 cups a day.

review/summary: Saved my Diabetic Cat's Life
review/text: Short version: cat diagnosed with diabetes, insulin & Hill's prescription food not stabilizing glucose levels despite increasing insulin weekly over 4 weeks, switched food to Fancy Feast Classic Turkey and Giblets Feast, glucose levels normal after 1 week, decreased insulin dose dramatically, glucose still stable. May go off insulin completely soon. Thank you Fancy Feast. Please read full review below to learn why you should start feeding your cat (even if healthy) only Fancy Feast Classic Turkey, Chicken, Beef, or another WET food that has practically no plant based ingredients and has less than 10% of the calories from carbohydrates.<br /><br />Even if your cat isn't diabetic please read this review and the wealth of information by a vet at catinfo.org. My 12 year old cat was diagnosed with diabetes about 2 months ago. He is a big cat and about a year ago he weighed 22 pounds. Two months ago we noticed that he looked thin, so we took him to the vet. They discovered that he had lost 7 pounds (a third of his body weight in one year), was walking on his forepaws, and based on this checked his blood glucose. It was around 450, which is more than 400% higher than the normal level of less than 100.<br /><br />The vet followed the normal procedure for treating diabetic cats: insulin and "prescription" cat food (Hill's MD, dry). She did talk me into Lantus insulin, which is new (and more expensive), but has a chance of stimulating your cat's beta cells to start producing insulin again.<br /><br />We started my cat on 3 units of insulin, twice daily. I fed him the exact amount of Hill's I was supposed to. Came back for checkup a week later, glucose still off the charts. Up'd insulin to 4 units twice daily. Recheck: still through the roof. Up'd insulin to 5 units. At this point wife and I started reading online and found wealth of info at catinfo.org by a vet who specializes in treating diabetic cats. This vet is a crusader of sorts against the horrible diet we feed our cats. Cats are obligate (strict) carnivores. This means there diet should be almost 100% protein and fat, from animal ingredients. Your cat should have no more than 10% of there calories from carbohydrates. DRY FOOD, OF EVEN THE BEST QUALITY, CONTAINS MUCH MORE CARBS THAN YOUR CAT SHOULD HAVE. We discovered the Hill's food we were feeding had about 17% carbs (the canned version is about the same, so don't be fooled).<br /><br />After doing much comparison, we settled on Fancy Feast Classic Turkey & Giblets, because: (1) has only about 6% calories from carbs (2) first ingredient is turkey, other ingredients are liver,  by-products, that is, proteins & fat (3) it is sold everywhere, unlike high end canned foods (4) it is less expensive than high end canned foods (5) unlike the Fancy Feast Classic chicken or beef, it has no fish. Looking at (2) you may think "eww...by-products," but for a cat, animal by-products, which are protein and fat from an animal, are better than plant based proteins and much better than carbs. Looking at (5), cats should not be fed fish very often, because the trace amounts of mercury in fish will build up in your cats body over time. But if your cat won't eat the Turkey, the chicken or beef would be the next best options. Make sure it is the CLASSIC style, as the other Fancy Feast brands have too many carbs.<br /><br />Back to my cat. So now we were up to 5 units of insulin, twice a day. Recheck: glucose still above 400. I tell my vet that we are switching to Fancy Feast and she agrees to keep insulin at 5 units. Recheck a week later: GLUCOSE LEVELS COMPLETELY NORMAL! Go down to 4 units, twice daily. Recheck: still normal. Down to 3 units, twice daily. Still normal.<br /><br />We are now down to 3 units of insulin, once a day. There is a good chance he will be off the insulin completely in the next few weeks. My cat has gained 2 pounds, has stopped drinking water and urinating constantly, and acts four years younger. Another bonus, on the expensive dry food we used to feed him he would throw up almost every single day. Now he only throws up occasionally when he has a hair ball. We also now feed are 18 year old cat this food only. She seems much more spry and happy.<br /><br />I know this is just one anecdote (although there are more on the web) and that the Lantus insulin may be the real reason for this turn of events, but I do believe personally that it was Fancy Feast that saved my cat.

review/summary: My cat no longer needs insulin because of this food
review/text: I have diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture.

review/summary: The good, the bad and the ugly:?
review/text: I purchased this food because I am trying to feed my cats a near grain free diet and this is one of the few I could find.  That's the good part, well that and this is the only one of the purina fancy feast classics that didn't contain fish either!  Now, the bad part is that my cat would eat this about one can in twenty meaning there is a quality control issue.  After the some research on this matter, I came across the ugly....check out the reviews at consumeraffairs.com (just google consumeraffairs purina -- sorry but amazon site stripped the link when I inserted into the review).  So, be careful as Purina is the major supplier of most pet foods and after reading those HUNDREDS of complaints....they will never again get my business.

review/text: My cats enjoy the Turkey & Giblets Feast from Fancy Feast.  I treat them once in a while and it's affordable on Amazon through the subscribe and save, especially when you keep an eye on the price and it drops below $12/24 cans (subscribe and save).  I noticed that the cats do not care for the grilled or sliced types, but they never turn down this "pate" or original style and it just disappears.  For us, it's a treat that supplements their regular dry food diet.

review/summary: Not their best flavor...
review/text: This one was the reject surprise of the day.  Both cats wouldn't touch it at all - surprised me because one in particular is a turkey junky.  Can't figure this one out - it smells nice in the can, not strange odors that I can detect anyway.  It's pretty expensive to just toss but well, that's what I had to do.  It is healthy for your cat and it is a pate, not chunks.  However, that said, they don't care for the chunky Fancy Feast turkey variety either.  Not sure why - they gobble up the Friskies turkey and cheese like there's no tomorrow.  Not sure what to recommend here but to try it and see if your cat likes it.  Maybe it's just too boring! :)

review/summary: My three cats love it!
review/text: I have three cats all varying in age. My oldest cat 9 yrs old gets allergies due to weather and well just about everything, he will tear his fur out if I give him cat food with filler, leaving little bald spots all over him. With this food he has stopped pulling his fur out, You have no idea how happy I am with this. I used to just give him cortizone shots at the vet to help his allergies but not anymore. I've tried many cat foods and so far this is the best! My other cats love this food as well. I tried the light chicken flavor of this food, however it gave two of my cats the runs, though my older cat still wasn't pulling his fur out. This current food for senior cats makes two of my cats stool not runny but not super solid either, but I will accept this change if it stops my cat from ripping his fur out and being all twitchy. All of my cats seem more healthier with this food, I've been feeding them this for about 6 months now just forgot to write a review.

review/summary: The best food out there!
review/text: We have a 10 year old cat who will eat anything, people or dog food included, but then gets sick.  We have tried every kind of cat food on the market and this is the only one she can eat daily and not get sick off of.  It is also wonderful at preventing hairballs.  The only time we find her getting sick is if she has been out of dry food for a few hours and then pigs out when we refill it.  I think that is just her eatting to fast and trying to jam in to much food at once.  Otherwise, by far the best food.  We also use the wet food and give her a small tablespoon size serving as a "treat" when the dog get his breakfast and dinner.  She then has access to this dry food all day and night long.  Give it a try.  We couldn't believe it but are so glad we gave it a shot.

review/summary: Great Gum for Dental Care
review/text: I absolutely love this gum. The whole calcium from milk idea is perfect for gum that is meant to help take care of your teeth. This together with xylitol makes this, by far, my favorite gum to buy.<br /><br />The one reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is I REALLY wish Trident would get rid of the Aspertame. The gum would be sweet enough without it, especially with the flavorings and xylitol already in it. If Trident did that one thing, this would be the standard of all dental care gums.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />ALSO, what's the deal with the high price for this 12 pack on here? Someone else already pointed this out in the reviews, but it definitely needs to be mentioned: This is listed at about $1.74 per pack when buying in bulk, but my local grocery store sells the stuff individually for about $1.50, and I've even seen it on sale for $0.99. The price really needs to come down.<br /><br />=========

The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste.

review/text: I was somewhat dubious when I ordered these sour belts as a Christmas gift for my (candy-addicted) younger brother, as I have repeatedly had my heart broken in the past by sour belts that were decidedly... UN-sour.<br /><br />(Nothing is worse than craving the acidic, tangy *pop* of sour candy, only to have your taste buds duped by a too-sweet, sugary let-down of flavor.)<br /><br />Well imagine my delight when these sour belts slapped my tongue with tartness like a cranky old granny at a Church luncheon! Just as sour as the ones you find at the mall candy shops, and incredibly convenient, as they come in large tubs.<br /><br />Totally delicious and totally recommended.<br /><br />Beware, though: Since there are so many belts in a single tub, you may find yourself over-indulging and burning yourself from an excess of the citric acid on these babies... If this happens, you'll be left with a raw, stinging tongue that may take a couple of days to heal. Granted, this only happens if you eat like, thirty-five in a single sitting, but still... it's possible. I speak from (shameful and disgusting) experience.<br /><br />Still, when eaten in moderation, these are a great snack, a great replacement for love, a great way to gain weight, and a great way to spend your time!<br /><br />Grab them by the fistful and shove them in your face!!!

review/text: Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Sour Power fan...<br /><br />Peach, Strawberry, Strawberry Bananna, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, I love them all.<br /><br />But this is my first time trying the watermelon flavor...and it just has some major problems.<br /><br />Or really, just one big problem.<br /><br />The sour coating on the outside is classic Sour Power, which is great...but the belts themselves have a REALLY off putting plastic flavor that comes as a part of the watermelon flavoring. If you get it you'll know what I mean. None of the other Sour Power belts have this taste, it literally tastes like plastic and watermelon perfume compressed themselves into a belt and rolled in Sour Power powder.<br /><br />I love Sour Power as much as everyone, but next time I buy a HUGE tub (probably quite soon), it'll be of any other flavor.

review/summary: Not what I thought it was, but for my purposes it'll do.
review/text: Let me preface this by saying that this is NOT peppermint oil even though it comes up if you search on the phrase "peppermint oil".<br /><br />I make peppermint bark every year for Xmas and I usually get peppermint oil for it because some non-oil based extracts can cause the melted chocolate to seize up. However, I had decided to make peppermint bark fudge this year so the fact that it's not oil isn't a big factor.<br /><br />The flavour is quite strong and you won't have to use much to get a good peppermint flavour.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a flavouring, but if you're making chocolate candy and don't have much experience, I would suggest you find actual peppermint oil if you don't want to risk seizing.

review/summary: Love this Coffee!!
review/text: I have had a hard time finding really good decaf.  (Or good at all for that matter, especially flavored.) I stumbled across this company while searching and tried them out a while ago and fell in love.  I cannot say enough about this company and the coffee.  Excellent customer service and the coffee is great.  I just keep coming back.  I highly recommend this company and their coffee.  The maple coffee is great.  I would recommend trying many flavors as I have found them to be excellent!!

review/text: I first purchased these root beer drops from a local candy store.  It has since gone out of business.  I was pleased that there were available from Amazon.  They are simple a root beer drop, no additions, no wrappers just pure pleasure.  To be taken of course in moderation.<br /><br />John R. Simmons<br />Sebastopol, California

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These "small" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2...

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I thought it would taste similar to 7-UP, but it's really better or at least different enough so that it has its own flavor. I like the Key Lime  better then lime, or at least it's a new flavor to me in a soda.<br />All in all; a top of the line Key Lime soda.
