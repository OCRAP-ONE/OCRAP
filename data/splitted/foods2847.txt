review/summary: Good flavor but not all of the peppercorns fit in the grinder
review/text: We have a smaller pepper grinder, and we bought this to refill it.  What we've had of it so far is very tasty.  Not too spicy, but good pepper flavor.  The only problem is that not all of the corns fit in our grinding mechanism.  I assume that a larger grinder would have no trouble.

review/summary: Disappointed with mix of peppercorns
review/text: Product has probably 75% black peppercorns which are inexpensive to buy so I was disappointed that the mix did not have a greater percentage of the other peppercorn varieties, therefore in my opinion computing to an overpriced product. Otherwise we will use the product and if you like pepper, you will also like this pepper. Taste wise is good, just on the pricey side for the mix.

review/summary: Because They're Good For Ya!
review/text: I like peanuts.  And according to the medical folks, peanuts just might like me, too.  So everyday I'll have a couple of handfuls of PLANTERS DRY ROASTED, LIGHTLY SALTED PEANUTS.  And when you get the big 16-ounce jar that's a lot of handfuls.<br /><br />These goobers have 50% less sodium than the regular DRY ROASTED PEANUTS.  As I (and most everyone else) need to cut back on my sodium intake, that's a big plus.  Not only that, these oven-roasted nuts have zero cholesterol.  So no wonder the medical people tell us snacks such as peanuts can be heart healthy; just don't overdo the snacking, as there are plenty of fat grams in a single serving.  And the best thing about PLANTERS DRY ROASTED, LIGHTLY SALTED PEANUTS is the taste; they're a delcious snack (and your ticker will be thanking you).<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/text: There is a coffee shop I go to that serves the most delicious chai. I drink it with steamed soy milk. I asked what it was, and bought some on amazon. I got the variety pack to try four different flavors. They all kind of tasted the same... Really creamy and sweet. It doesn't come off as well at home... I need the frothing wand to steam it up like they do at the cafe. SO, for the price, it didn't quite meet my needs, although I do enjoy it at the cafe still.

review/summary: My New Cornstarch
review/text: Thanks to Jacques Pepin, I have become aware of the differences between starch thickeners in my cooking. Flour roux makes a very opaque sauce. Cornstarch makes a semi-opaque sauce that can easily get kinda gelatinous. But potato starch makes a delicate, transparent sauce that never gets as thick as Chinese sauces. It is a must for affordable gourmet home cooking! Bob's Red Mill products are always high quality and dependable, and this package size is perfect for the home cooking hobbyist - it will last a while but not forever.

In Cooking for Isaiah, by Silvana Nardone, (an excellent gluten/dairy free cookbook, by the way) brand names for cooking products are given.  That's where I found out that Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch contributes to a very good recipe for all purpose gluten free flour.<br /><br />So far, the pancakes, doughnut holes and waffles have surpassed anything we made with wheat flours.

With 10 different types of grains, it has more 'depth' than oatmeal, and doesn't get gummy if you cook it a little too long, as oatmeal can do (though you can make it to a porridge-like consistency). And, it goes well with fruit -- fresh, frozen, or dehydrated -- and benefits from adding the sweetener of choice (I like maple syrup, molasses, or honey).<br /><br />I haven't tried making bread with it, but it sounds awesome.

That's .36 cents a cup. The cost went up a few months ago to $23.59 for a box of 50. That's .47 cents a cup. The new Amazon price is what you would expect to pay in any retail store.

review/summary: Too strong even for me...
review/text: I ordered this because it sounded really strong, Jet Fuel.  And I like my coffee strong.  If you need the get up and go of a jet, then this is for you.  It's even too strong for me.  I can see people enjoying it though, because even with all it's potency, it isn't bitter.

review/summary: Perfect cup in the morning
review/text: I do not like most of the light or medium blends (I get a cup of coffee that is too week from my Keurig); and some of the darker roasts just give the same week cup of coffee with really bitter aftertaste.<br />The "Jet Fuel" is completely different type of coffee. It gives me exactly what I want in the morning. Since it is "Extra Bold", it has more body than just a darker roast (it is really strong, but does not have too much bitter or burned aftertaste). It is also available in large packages (24 and 50).

review/text: I'm not someone who needs incredibly strong coffee, but after we received a Keurig as a wedding gift, basically every pack of K-cups we bought seemed really weak.  After a bit of reading, this seems to be a somewhat common complaint.  The Jet Fuel packs are the first ones we actually think taste like coffee.  I'll definitely be buying more.

review/text: We have enjoyed Jet Fuel Dark Roast many times.  We love the full flavor and the aroma is very coffee like, kind of along the lines of a strong expresso.  The flavor is earthy, strong and has a full flavor like you would expect from a dark roast.  It is not overbearing as far as the flavor and I find it is good with many different creamers.  The smell is what you notice first but the taste is something you can't forget.  If you like strong coffee that is rich and aromatic then try Jet Fuel, you will not be disappointed.

review/text: I was looking for a suitable substitute for my favorite k-cup coffee which was no longer available (Green Mountain Organic Espresso).  Jet Fuel appeared by its description to be a possibility.  Delivery was prompt and the price for 60-cups was competitive (much less expensive than the Green Mountain Espresso).  It is indeed a robust smooth tasting coffee, although not a "suitable substitute" for the Green Mountain Espresso.  I am enjoying the Jet Fuel, but will continue to look for an Espresso k-cup.  I hope Coffee-People will do something about replacing the Green Mountain Espresso favorite with an Espresso of its own.

review/text: I drink a cup of Jet Fuel every morning. I have found that this has the perfect amount of caffeine. I drink a cup of this and a cup of standard coffee (Starbucks) every day. Jet fuel does a great job waking me up without giving me the shakes however, I have found that if I drink more than 1 cup, I do get a little jittery. I've been drinking this stuff since day one of my Keurig purchase and I will continue to order it. I love bold coffees and this fits right in there. I recommend this to anyone looking for a full roast bold tasting coffee.

review/summary: Good stuff - I'm having a cup now
review/text: I really enjoy this coffee.  I like a strong cup of coffee that has a clear roasted taste and this one is it.  Strong but not bitter and delivered in under a minute from the Keurig.  My only complaint would be that the k-cups come loose in a box and if you don't have a storage thingy it's a bit of a hassle to organize.  The coffee tastes awesome though.

review/text: We must have simply received a bad batch of Jet Fuel the first time.  I left a negative review and one star.  Luckily I have the opportunity to edit that review.  We have done a complete reversal and love this coffee now.  I makes a delicious and rich cup...even the 10 oz brew.  Glad I gave Jet Fuel a second chance!  Highly recommend  :-)

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: This coffee was purchased because of the fact I work third shift, and I was looking for something strong to keep me up during work. Not only does this coffee do that, it tastes great. It would remind me of a bold flavor that Starbucks would offer.<br /><br />I would recommend this coffee for someone who needs the caffeine.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I inherited my Keurig from my late mother. Store coffee pods seemed too weak. I read the reviews for "Jet Fuel" and decided to order 50 pod package. I like a bold coffee but this has a very bitter taste. I'm going to try again, after descaling the coffee maker. If flavor improves, I'll gladly retract my remarks. If not, I won't be buying THIS coffee again.<br />06/27/2012: Descaled Keurig coffee maker. Jet Fuel coffee was STILL too bitter for my taste. Perhaps my taste has changed. Whatever the reason, I WON'T be buying THIS coffee again.

review/summary: like espresso, black? try this one
review/text: I'm an espresso guy, but I just got tired of cleaning up the mess. So I've tried about 5 high-quality Keurig options by now, trying to find that dark taste without going into gross and overdone. I'd never have guessed it from the name, but this one does it.  Obviously, it helps to try them out yourself. But for what it's worth, I find a lot of the ones labelled French or Italian roast aren't dark, they are just overly strong...like dumping hot sauce on a dish, not getting the flavors right.<br /><br />The bonus of the K-cup system is, I can make myself a cup of coffee so fast I don't really lose the momentum of my work.  The downside is, I don't have that nice espresso-making ritual to give my eyes and brain a rest.  ALMOST enough to make me dig out the espresso maker.

review/summary: Burnt, Not Bold
review/text: We really enjoy Bold and Extra Bold Coffee so I bought a box of Crazy Cups Dark Roast Keurig Cups which has several different brands/kinds of dark roast coffee. Jet Fuel is by far the least tasty of the brews. The coffee was on the weak side for a Bold Blend, but had a burnt aftertaste. This coffee is not for those who enjoy a really rich, bold taste. So far, Dark Magic has been our favorite of the varieties in the box.
