review/summary: Better than canned, almost as good as fresh
review/text: I have tried several of the Harmony House dehydrated vegetables, and have to say this is one of my favorites.  I reach for them when I am out of fresh or frozen green beans and need a little more green in my meal.  Today I added them to a beef stew in the crockpot, and they turned out flavorful and tasty.  I also have used them in layered vegetable dishes and even tossed them into scalloped potatoes.

review/summary: A great sherry vinegar at a great price
review/text: My grocery store stopped stocking sherry vinegar, so I went on line to see what I could find.  For me, sherry vinegar is a necessity, as I use it in salad dressings, chicken saute, etc. and there really is no substitute for its special flavor.  On a hunch I bought a case of this product and I am very glad I did.  Very nice flavor and a super price--especially by the case---so I recommend this highly.

review/summary: Amazons price is cheaper than anywhere around here
review/text: I don't really need to review Cheez-its, do I?  We all know what they're like.  D-lish!  I did want to comment about buying CheezIts from Amazon.com.  The price here is far cheaper than what any of my grocery stores or discount department stores offer.  With a discount and a coupon, I can get about the same price as here on Amazon.  But I don't always have a coupon and they're not always discounted... I have a Prime membership so shipping isn't a concern.  I did worry a bit about having a box of cracker crumbs... and that wasn't the case at all.  They were as intact as if I'd purchased them from the grocery store shelf.  If you're a fan of Cheez-Its, this is a pretty good way to keep them in your cupboard.

review/text: Was doing the subscribe and save option when they still offered 4 boxes in each shipment for the same price they recently decided to start offering 3 boxes for. There were times when some boxes would taste different then in previous shipments and sometimes some boxes tasted burnt and others did not. It wasn't a bad deal previously, now that they've changed things though it would probably be cheaper for most to purchase them locally.

review/text: I don't mean that the product is bad, because it's not. Cheez-It's are always a good snack to munch on, and Amazon doesn't deliverer them old or anything. What I mean is the price, it varies from time to time. So it's hard to "Subscribe" to the item. One day it's $8 the other day is $12 the next day is $16. It never stays the same.<br /><br />Either way, I'm not giving the product a bad review, just letting you guys know that if the product is more than $8, then wait for it to get back to $8 before purchasing.

review/summary: More addictive than wood to a termite...
review/text: Once I start eating a few of these, I begin to pray that I don't eat the whole box. Delicious, tangy, and long-lasting flavor. I usually don't have my prayers answered, but I begin to pray that I don't eat the next box in one shot! Once in a rare while, you'll get a box delivered that has some crakers broken into smaller pieces. Don't blame Amazon. The people who deliver the product don't exactly treat it like the Hope Diamond when they handle it, and Amazon usually makes it up to you in a fair way. I'm sure the crybabies who will "never" buy it again were reimbursed! In any case, don't weigh yourself for a few days if you do what I do (or eat a few more salads...). Never get tired of the taste. If you're lactose intolerant, be ready to wear a nose clip after you finish! Bon apetite!<br /><br />P.S. It is cheaper on Amazon than any supermarket I go to. As others have noted, even when the supermarket has a sale, it barely matches it. No need for me to use public transportation, no lost time. No-brainer!

I don't know if my UPS guy was in a bad mood that day or what, but my Cheez-it's are 4 boxes of crumbs. I'm thinking of making crunchy,cheesy chicken fingers for the kids with them. They are too broken up to eat them otherwise.

I just got these today from amazon and they do not expire until Oct,2011 way more than enough time. Being that my family and I can down one of these boxes in a week. I got my 4 boxes for $10.05 the price shot up to $10.37 a few days after I already purchased mines. Still a good deal thought since when they are on sale at the store they are $2.50 a box. So you are only paying a few extra cents. WARNING!!! Very addictive and cheesy! :)

review/summary: The one time it's okay to be cheezy...
review/text: At the current price, these are a great deal (4 boxes for about 11 dollars), so hopefully that won't change. Cheeze-It crackers are one of those snacks that I think you can have at (almost) any age. They have a perfect amount of cheddar taste, not going overboard but still giving it a perfect amount of flavor. The bite-sized crackers are very easy to take with you and a perfect snack on the go or to curb hunger until the next meal. Have them with your lunch, watching the ball game, after dinner, before lunch, whenever. At many stores, CheezeIts have skyrocketed in price ($4 a box), so this is a great deal if you are a "Cheeze It" fan.<br /><br />Great buy!

review/text: So I was looking for more snacks and got the gummies. Was pleased to get this earlier than I imagined. I have been looking to lose weight and try and live healthier in general and know fruits are good to try and these low fat gummies can really help me lose weight. I am not at all diabetic and tried the fruit before too I think, along with the mandarins oranges (kind of like those). This is tasty and I want to try this flavor more often. I just have to start being responsible when it comes to my weight and my cholesterol. Not that I am an overeater just am happy to get something sweet that isn't as fattening but very good to have around when I get hungry. I get hungry and reach for more. Very flavorful. I couldn't be happier and I eat candy and sweet things whenever I want so I know what I'm talking about. Do try if you are searching for snacks or candy you want to make sure you have a bag. It's so unique of a flavor and in a good way not like anything you wouldn't really enjoy the flavor is amazingly good.

Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.<br />The lychee gummies are no exception. They have the aroma and pleasant aftertaste the fruit has with the hint of tanginess--they taste a hint more like the fresh kind than the canned, for those of you that have had both.

This is a nice gummy candy because it does not stick to teeth.  I really like Lychee fruit like the other person.  I have had them at restaurants.  Orange Flavor gummies are really better because they are more intense flavor and that is what I like in a gummy I have decided.

review/text: I don't really like this Lychee Gummy candy. I ate real Lychee last year in China. But this candy tasted weird. My kids and my husband didn't like the flavor either. My son said there were some white powers on the candy. Better be another one if you are looking for some Asian snacks.

review/summary: Seems to Work
review/text: The other two reviews for this product as of 3/11/12 are obviously fake, but I decided to buy the 3 pack of Party Armor anyway. Lately I've been getting much worse hangovers than usual, even after relatively mild nights of drinking, so I needed something to help. I don't know if it's the vitamins or the milk thistle, but taking a shot of one of these plus a glass or two of water before going to bed does seem to prevent a hangover so far. I drank beer last night and got very little sleep, but my only symptom today is a slightly queasy stomach (common for me after drinking, I don't attribute it to the Party Armor). My mind feels pretty sharp and clear and my energy level is alright. The only downside is the price in my opinion. Oh yeah and the taste is horrible but it doesn't matter much after a night of drinking.

review/text: Great customer service. Sent me a new bowl and lid when mine was faulty with no questions asked.<br /><br />I love the baby cook- I cook all my baby's food as well as most of the dinners for my husband and myself! It makes great creamed potatoes! I love that you don't loose any nutrients from the steam process- you just blend the food in it's own steam juices!<br /><br />I have used mine every day for well over two months- as i said, for both the baby and my own food, and we have not had any problems with limescale or build up.

review/text: I love the Baby Beaba!  Yes, you can save yourself $150 and do the same thing with your steamer & food processor, but there's something to be said for the convenience of this product.  Compact and steams/purees all in the same appliance.  In fact, it's small enought that I leave it sitting on my kitchen counter.  If it weren't for this product, I probably would resort to the premade, store bought baby food, because who really has time to lug out bulky pots & the food processor????  Worth spending the extra money!

review/text: We love this product. Granted, you can steam vegitables in a pot and puree them in a blender but the combined function in the maker along with the built in "no-guessing" measurment, makes it simple to use, convenient and easy clean up. We pour the puree into icecube trays and defrost two cubes per feeding, mixing flavors is so easy. We also prefer the cheaper individual storage containers with green lids vs. the beaba product. Bottom line, this product makes providing quality food easy.

review/summary: Poor Quality
review/text: I LOVED the Beaba the first two months I had it. I used it about twice a week for cooking food to store and twice daily for warming meals. After four months of use, the switch that engages at the top (safety feature) won't stay engaged, so I have to twist the top aggressively several times to get the machine to turn on - whether cooking or puree mode. So that's my first major disappointment.<br /><br />Second, the quality of the plastic doesn't seem to withstand the temperature of the steam, so the base of the main container has several cracks and leaks at the bottom. I am concerned about the plastic too - given how the steam is damaging it, I feel this may be one of those plastic that we are warned against heating foods in.<br /><br />For the price, I don't feel this product is worth it. Better to use a crock pot or food steamer and a Cuisinart.

review/text: Since I bought this product, my life has become so much easier. What is more important is my 9 month old girl loves food I make with it. Thanks to Beaba Babycook, my baby eats so well. I am so happy now that my baby girl looks and is healthier now, since I started using this product. The jar as well as blade are easy clean and durable.<br /><br />Pro: convenient and easy to make multiple meals (wash/peal, dump, steam, grind, and serve),<br />  easy to clean, dishwasher safe<br />  multi-functions<br />  lightweight<br /><br />Con: relatively small for making a bigger child's multiple meals in advance<br />  The water depository for steaming is small, which requires pouring water multiple times when making multiple meals at<br />  once<br /><br />It may seem expensive, however, it is worth every penny.<br /><br />*** I am a dad. If I can make baby food, anyone can as well.

review/summary: Worth it for me
review/text: I've had this for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  If you don't want to spend the $, there are certainly cheaper ways to get the same end result -- fresh, healthy baby food.  However, I'm a working mom of two who is willing to spend some extra $ for convenience and for the assurance that I am not going to forget that I'm steaming veggies on the stove and leave it on so long that it ruins the organic food I just spent a bunch of money on!  The ease of use, from prep to clean up, is a big plus for me.  Plus, I make small batches, with different combinations every time, so my daughter is getting a better variety of foods on a weekly basis than when I made food for my son (I made large batches of food with the pot/steamer/blender combo for efficiency, and there was only so much room to store it, and only so much time to steam all of the different types of food).  I'm also more likely to make my own food on a consistent basis because of the convenience; in the couple of weeks I've had the Beaba, I've only reached for a jar one time in a pinch.  It takes up very little space as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is willing to pay a bit more for some added convenience and ease of use.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price tag, but I believe it's been worth it overall.  It seems like a quality product and seems well made.  If the price makes you cringe, just don't get it; you'll get by without it, for sure.  If not, and convenience is important to you, then I would recommend giving it a try.

review/summary: Wonderful Babyfood Maker
review/text: This is a great product.  So far, since receiving it, I have used this babyfood maker to make my fresh daughter sweet potato, butternut squash, yellow squash, cauliflower, strawberrie/banana, & poi.  the basket holds a good amount of vegetables/fruit (more than enough for one feeding), the steaming & pureeing process is very simple:add the spedicifed amount of water (a booklet & recipe booklet is included), the blade is very sharp and creates beautiful pureed food.  My daughter has loved everything I have made using this thus far.  Clean up is easy, storage is easy.  My only complaint is that the cover seems kinda loose. There is a latch thing that slides and is supposed to ensure a close and tight fit, but there I find myself holding the cover down just to ensure that the food/water doesn't come out the top.  otherwise, very good product - I enjoy using it and feel it is worth the cost.

review/summary: Bottom of blending bowl cracked and leaked after 3 months
review/text: I loved this product. The idea is perfect...healthy food for baby, minimal clean up, compact design. 1-2 times a week, I would use both the steaming and blending function to make 2-3 purees for the week. I also used the steaming function at least 2 times a day to heat up the frozen food. Everything seemed great, but after 3 months, the blending bowl started leaking. I changed the rubber gasket, but it still leaked. It turns out the bottom of the blending bowl had multiple cracks through it. I ended up buying a replacement bowl for $22. Hopefully it lasts longer this time. I also had similar problems that other people had with the brown stuff in the steaming reservoir. Overall, I probably would not have made this purchase. There are less expensive options out there. But after spending $150 on the thing, I had to replace the bowl, even if it was $22.

review/summary: Initially Awesome, then quickly mediocre
review/text: We recieved a Babycook as a baby shower present and were very excited to start using it.  As our daughter started on solids, the babycook worked great.  It's very simple to steam, blend and cleanup.  About a month into the transition to solids, you'll realized that the babycook is just too small to handle all of the fruits and veggies you want to cram into the little basket and it take a few rounds of use just to create enough food for 1 week.  While it's a bit more to clean it's much more efficient to steam using the stove and then a traditional blender.<br /><br />Additionally, our motor burned out after just 1 month (this appears to be a problem according to numerous posts).  I can't report on the customer service from Beaba but will follow-up with a resolution.  So far, I'm not impressed as there is no clear 800 # and you can only submit a claim via email.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, I would not buy this again nor would I recommend it.  It does look cute on the countertop but just doesn't really replace the traditional tools to make baby food.

review/summary: Don't know how I could have lived without it before!
review/text: I have a 6 month old and 2 year old twins. I bought the baby food maker for the 6 month old and if I had known about it earlier, it would have saved me so much hassle, especially with making food for 2 babies! Before, I had to use lots of pots and pans and then I pureed using a hand held blender. This has made my life so much easier. It's so quick and easy and I hardly have any washing as I just give the parts a quick wash straight after use. I use it for making puree to add to plain yogurt for my 2 year olds who absolutely love it. I also use it for pureeing vegetables they usually take a dislike to but if I blend them into mash, I can sneakily make sure they are getting the veggies! I love that you get to use the water that the food has been steamed in so you are still able to keep those valuable vitamins that get lost in boiling. I think this machine is just fabulous and I would recommend it to every busy mom out there.

I spent $5 on vegetables and made food for 2 weeks!  I thought because I worked I would not have time, but I just make some on Sunday's.  Since I can make food for weeks, I don't do it that often.  I freeze in ice cube trays and once it is frozen, break it into ziploc bags and keep it in the freezer.  When I need food, I just thaw out a cube!

review/summary: Bought in 2008 and still going strong!
review/text: I bought the Beaba Babycook back in 2008 when it came to the US and was only available at Williams and Sonoma. We still use it practically every day for our little one and for us too. We started her out as a baby with steamed and pureed foods and now we just steam everything that can be steamed. I am happy to say that, perhaps thanks to the Beaba?, our toddler loves, loves, loves to eat steamed broccoli. She is the talk of the day care where she gobbles down her steamed broccoli like there is no tomorrow. I steam it and put it into an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PH5L4S">Aladdin 24-Ounce Micro Lunch Bowl, Grey</a>, a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSRDT0">Vivo Kids Bento Box, Orange and Pink</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O3GCFU">Foogo by Thermos Leak-Proof SS 10 oz Food Jar in Pink</a>. Just make sure that you use the liquid and pour it over the veggies. Otherwise they may dry out after a while. I also like to reuse the liquid in noodles or rice for our toddler's lunches at daycare.<br />I'm surpised though that the price hasn't come down since 2008. But I heard that Sam's Club offers the product a bit cheaper...<br /><br />Also, I mixed delicious ice coffee with vanilla icecream the other day - right there in the Beaba. Just had to make sure to clean it out properly later so as not to inadvertently mix caffeine with steamed broccoli...<br /><br />It's true that the basket becomes a bit discolored but it's not really a big deal.

review/text: I was given this as a gift, and I'll admit that I was skeptical about how much baby food I would actually make, and whether I would have time to make it while taking care of my little one.  Then in a VERY short amount of time today I made 4 whole ice cube trays of different purees.  I'm hooked - looking up recipes for different things I can make.<br /><br />My little one started solids very early (started rice cereal for reflux at 5 weeks and never looked back).  So I will use it a lot longer than those who start at 6 months.  I am going to enjoy taking my time introducing different foods one by one for the next months - and never having to buy a jar if I don't want to!<br /><br />Quick<br />Easy<br />Simple cleanup<br />Nutritious (all of you using the big steamer basket are losing tons of nutrients)<br /><br />Love it!

review/summary: Great customer service
review/text: I read many reviews on the beaba and other products similar to it, also spoke with my cousin who has used the beaba for two years on both her girls. She also writes for a baby site where she does extensive research on baby products. She told me she has never had any issues with mold or other problems that people report. I wanted to make sure I was buying something that was going to be worth it especially for how pricey it is.<br /><br />I'm sure you are worried about the mold problem and cleaning it out. This part is not as troublesome as I envisioned. After a couple of uses I cleaned it according to the directions which say to pour 100ml of water and 100ml of white distilled vinegar which can be measured using the blending bowl. After pouring the vinegar and water into the compartment it says to leave for the night and empty then you run it through a normal cycle w/water. I found that this did a great job. I also made sure that every time I was finished I would take the lid off the heating compartment so it can air out I don't really ever put it back on unless I'm steaming or it has been off for plenty of time to completely cool off.<br /><br />Another part of cleaning it that I learned is essential is taking the blade out and removing the gasket to clean. The gasket is a little sort of suction cup rubber thing that prevents everything from leaking out of the bottom of the bowl. The first couple times i didn't do this partly because I thought I could clean it good enough just left inside the bowl. I was wrong food gets stuck in ridges of the blade that are hard to clean unless you remove it. I had messed with the blade a couple times trying to figure out how to remove it. Later I found out in doing this I had left the blade a little lose. It started making unusual grinding noises and then at one point almost wouldn't work at all. Finally I took the blade off and found out the plastic part of the blade had melted due to it not being on tight. I called their customer service and left a message that evening. They called me back promptly the next morning and agreed with me on why this had happened. They are mailing me a new blade for free and i dont have to pay shipping even though my husband got it working smoothly with the blade I already have and are sending an extra gasket which I requested and am paying $2.00 for. The beaba comes with two gaskets anyway because it is made of rubber and is a material that can brake down easier than the rest of it (their words) they told me to throw away the other one because it was covering the part that melted and put on the extra one.<br /><br />I do love the beaba and think it is a great product. The cons: lots of parts to clean, I only use the beaba a couple times a week since I freeze the food so not a big deal to me ( i recommend the oxo freezer trays.) Pros: you can buy all of the spare parts online. con: shipping can be pricey about $5.00 for even a $2.00 item. The biggest pro for me is I get to feed my son healthy fresh food. I can tailor the food to his needs. Also I can control the texture by using the water the food was steamed with. Great product, great customer service.

review/summary: Returned - Chemicals in reservoir
review/text: I used my Beaba for the first time this week to make my 6 month old's food. There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).<br /><br />While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots. The liquid was some sort of chemical lubricant.<br /><br />If you wish to use this product, please make sure that you check the reservoir with a flashlight before and after each use. It seems pointless to go through the effort of making organic food for your child when the food ends up contaminated with mold or chemicals due to the Beaba's design.

review/text: Loved the product at first. It was so easy and convenient. However, I noticed that it took forever to grind up things that are little tougher or has a skin like green beans or peas compared to my food processor.<br /><br />Then I read some reviews regarding brown water coming out of the steaming unit. And when I checked my Baby Cook to my surprise found brown stuff on the bottom of the water heating unit. Was able to clean off a little bit but it is not designed to be cleaned easily. Thought the expense was for convenience but if the water reservoir can not be easily kept clean...I have no use for the it. Especially since it doesn't even grind as well as my food processor.<br /><br />Called the company to have it returned today. Hope it won't be a hassle.

The device, container and basket are BPA-free, as recently confirmed by independent testing by the Svan company who is taking over distribution of the Babycook in the USA.  The steamer basket holds about a 1/2 pound of peas at a time, which purees down to a full baby food freezer tray, with a couple of servings extra.  Just how much of one thing do you want to make at a time anyway?  I expect that the Babycook will pay for itself, given the high cost of those little jars of babyfood from the market  - over dollar ($1.29!!! in some stores) here, even more for the organic ones.  Although I don't have hard water I always use filtered water, so there has been no brown stuff anywhere, like another reviewer complained about.  Also, love the fact that I can use the Babycook to defrost and heat the frozen portions.  Microwaves slightly change the molecular structure of foods.  The best part?  My three year old loves to cook her own veggie combinations in it (with adult supervision, of course) and eat what she cooks.  Since she is a picky eater I am over-the-moon about this.  I am also excited to be able to prepare meat in it because my husband has religious dietary restrictions and you can't get suitable prepared baby food.  Again, love this product.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I love my Beaba Babycook. My daughter is a year old now, and I still use it to make applesauce, purees for casseroles, and soups. It's really easy to use, and I'm a single mother so I love anything that is quick, practical, and easy. As far as another review that said the Beaba is too small to make enough food, I stuff mine pretty full, that way I can make quite a bit of food at once. I don't like tons of leftovers and I don't freeze, so the amount it makes is perfect for my daughter and me. Definitely worth every penny!

review/summary: Spend $150 and you still have to pay $2 every month for a new gasket? Ridiculous
review/text: I've been using my new Beaba Babycook less than once a day for three months. It started leaking terribly whereby my entire unit would be sitting in a puddle of water after each cooking session -- VERY dangerous given this is an electrical appliance, so I contacted Customer Service. They very correctly told m that if the pitcher leaks, it is because the gasket needs to be replaced. I did exactly as told and it did fix the problem. However, I was concerned that I have used the Beaba less than once a day in the course of two months and the gasket already needed replacing. I was only pureeing poached pears and zucchini after all, nothing hard. Anyway, I raised this concern with Beaba and they basically expect you to buy a new gasket every month to replace the broken one. That's $2+shipping every month ON TOP OF $150 for the basic unit?!?!? That seems a bit ridiculous to me. Very disappointed in the overall design of the Babycook if this is what I am to expect.<br />Out shopping for a different baby food cooker and NOT recommending this one nor buying it for any expectant parents ever again!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have also had problems with the lid not matching up to the pitcher, and the food being pureed always shoots out the back and sides. This happens EVERY time I use it and sometimes, when using more water, it is very dangerous: Today, I scalded my entire forearm because the boiling hot water sprayed out when I was pureeing my steamed veggie. This is a very dangerous (and messy) design flaw and I don't see why for $150, Beaba can't make something where the lid actually covers the cooking unit.

review/summary: A food steamer is more useful
review/text: I did not use this item since it actually arrived damaged and so it was returned. Then, I chose to purchase a FOOD STEAMER (Nesco brand since it's the only one that is BPA free at this time) instead of getting a replacement Beaba. I am glad I did this!<br /><br />The Beaba is small and makes enough food for your baby... however I found that my baby who is now one years old eats ALOT of steamed foods (veggies, eggs, rice, etc.) about FOUR TIMES A DAY and that if I had gone with the Beaba I know I would have had to keep steaming and washing, steaming and washing the thing for each meal almost. With a food steamer I throw in all my food in the morning, turn it on and I have a whole day's worth of steamed foods for the baby, me and my preschooler! Less washing, less work, more happiness. :)

review/summary: concern about food safety
review/text: I agree with several of the reviews I read.  I have been using my Babycook for only 2 months and was really enjoying making my son's baby food, until I noticed that the water coming from the reservoir was discolored.  I looked inside the reservoir and noticed the black film that several other reviews mention.  Now I am very concerned about the food safety and will not be steaming my son's food with this machine.  I have even been diligent about cleaning it with white vinegar as mentioned in the instruction manual, which obviously did not prevent this probleme.  It also produces a small amount of food, so I am constantly having to make food for my son.  I have not tried to contact the company yet, but will be doing so this week.  I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: Not a real timesaver, and expensive
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be easier to have a two-in-one machine to make my baby's food.  The problem is that you can only make about four servings of food at a time.  I'm a working mom, so I need to make two weeks worth of food at a time and freeze it.  That means at least six batches in the Beaba, which would take hours.  In addition, the plastic is pretty thin, so I'm afraid to put the parts in the dishwasher.  This means HAND washing!  Add the descaling requirements, and this thing takes more time to clean than to cook with.<br /><br />The steamer also doesn't have any kind of 'off' signal, so if you have 'mommy brain' and walk away from it while it is steaming, it won't remind you when it is finished so you might come back long after the food has gone cold and then you have to throw it out.  The food processor blade is really inefficient so it takes a long time to get a consistent texture.  If you are processing anything starchy, that means it gets pretty glutinous by the time all the big chunks are out of the batch.<br /><br />For the price, you can get a full size steamer (that chimes when finished), and basic food processor or hand blender that will blend the food faster and more evenly.  And you can use those products for the whole family, not just the limited time the baby needs pureed food.  The Black & Decker steamer is very affordable and doesn't present the water scale problems that this machine has.

review/summary: not safe in my opinion
review/text: I wanted to like this machine but I changed my mind and I thought I would share.  First of all it is small and it is really baby food only machine. You have to cut up the food then turn on the steamer then take out the basket when its done and dump the food into the main container and blend.  You can accomplish the same exact thing in a regular stainless steamer on your stove in the same amount of time.  I tested it and I saved no time it was exactly the same!  The stainless steamer on your stove can also be used as a pot or to steam lager amounts and you will use it forever plus you can use the same steamer on the stove to defrost your baby food.  I freeze my baby food in tiny glass containers and I just stick them directly uncovered into my steamer on the stove.  If you use the silicone containers you just put your baby food in any glass bowl.  I do not use plastic for cooking.  I don't care it is BPA free there are other chemicals in plastic that can leach into the food therefore my stainless steel on the stove method is also safer than Beaba.  Also the Beaba water tank is coated with something.  It smells funny and makes the food smell and I don't trust that either.  It is not stainless.  Others have mentioned this as well so I do not feel safe about steaming in plastic and having the water come from some tank that smells funny.  For blending I just throw the food into a BPA free blender...yes that is plastic but you are not cooking in it and the exposure time is less.  You could use a glass bender or a stainless stick blender even better.  I actually do that as well its just that my BPA free plastic bender is tiny so its almost like the Beaba food maker.  So basically I came to the conclusion I can accomplish the same thing in the same amount of time with my standard kitchen cookware and appliances. I tested it and it took me the same exact time!  Plus my stainless steamer doubles and bottle sanitizer and bottle warmer.  I also have an asparagus cooker which is also great for warming up bottles and sterilizing but I use glass bottles so with plastic bottles you need to add more water so they do not melt sitting agains the metal...same goes for nipples I just boil them instead of cooking them in some plastic that is emitting chemicals into them like ALL THE STERILIZERS AND BOTTLE WARMERS DO!

I would highly recommend this product.<br />It took around 5-10 cycles of steaming water before I got rid of the chemcially odors from the steamer before feeling comfortable to start to use the product. You have to get creative and use your judgement in terms of how much water you'll need for different foods.<br />In all, a great purchase for anyone who wants to make their baby's first foods at home.

review/text: The Babycook works well as a steamer but the blender is basically useless. Unless your blending a full container the food gets stuck to the sides and your constantly stopping to scrape the food back to the blades. Very frustrating. Now, only after 1 month of use the blender actually quit working altogether.<br /><br />I am going to return it and buy the Baby Bullet. I have friends that own it and say it works great.

review/summary: Please, taste the water after it went through a  cooking cycle.
review/text: The idea of this product is great. It is well worth the price with all the time and money that it could save. After doing a lot of research, Babycook seems to be the best baby food making device on the market. However, when I checked the water after it went through the cooking cycle, I found that it had a strong mechanical smell and taste. After contacting the customer service, I followed their deep cleaning instructions. After leaving vinegar inside the water reservoir for a couple of days and running about a dozen cooking cycles, water seemed to come out cleaner. However, remembering how awful and strong it smelled and tasted at first, I am too skeptical to keep using this. All of us who make our own baby food do so to control what goes in our baby's tummy. I felt like I had no control of that while using Babycook. I actually bought the second Babycook hoping that it wouldn't be the same, but went through the same exact thing. Sadly, ended up returning them both. If Scandinavian Child looks into this issue and resolves it, I would definitely buy their product again as it is a breeze to use and is so space efficient.

review/text: We have a Beaba and I used it for all my 3 year old granddaughter's food when she was younger.  Now I am using the same one for my 5 month old grandson. I just noticed some complaints about the hollow handle getting caked with grime. I wash it immediately after use and run the faucet water through the handle. My handle is spotless inside. It has never had any grime in it. I love it and it has gotten a lot of use and still works wonderfully. I have used just about every fruit and vegetable in it without any problem. Both children have never had jarred baby-food and let's face it, there is no comparison between jarred food and home made, especially when it comes to taste.

review/summary: Design flaw in cleaning.
review/text: We used the babycook for preparing food for our son and the initial results were fine. However, after a few weeks of usage we noticed that there was a build-up of grime and dried food inside the handle. This occurs when the preparation bowl is very full during cooking and some of the steam and food enter the hollow handle. This is unavoidable and it is impossible to clean this out again. Why on earth they chose to place the opening of a hollow handle right next to the lip of the preparation bowl is beyond me. Who really wants to prepare baby food in a gadget containing old, dried and congealed food that cannot be cleaned? A design disaster that Beaba need to sort out.<br />All in all you are better off using a traditional steamer and a traditional blender.

review/summary: Great for busy moms!
review/text: I made my own baby food for my first child, I would spend a whole day every few weeks cooking and pureeing foods in large batches to freeze but with my second I just didn't have the time, so I decided to get a Beaba to make it easier, and boy did it do that! It does take a little prep work and I have to remember to do it before I start our dinner so it's cooled before we all sit down  but it is so much easier than when I did large batches, my blender never got it fine enough, it was kinda chunky and took a lot of work to use separate pots to boil and steam and then the blender, there were a lot more things to wash. The Beaba is so easy to use and clean, I highly recommend it for other busy mothers, I wish I had it for my first child! And I am finding ways to use it for my preschooler too, I add some of the pureed or steamed veggies to her food since it is hard to get vegetables in her, so I will be using this for a long time, well worth the money!

review/text: Like others have said, the reservoir is impossible to clean.  It has many crevices and is very dark with a small opening for a brush.  Mineral deposits even with a thorough vinegar wash/steam.  The metal inside also looks like it is coated in toxic chemicals like Teflon.  I didn't think about the plastic leaching until after I bought it, but of course plastic heated leaches.  It does not matter if it is bpa free, it's still plastic and it still has chemicals.  The cleaning required for this machine is exhaustive!  I wanted this cause a blog writer said how much it saved her time, but I can't see how that is true.  I am so regretful that I wasted my money on this.

I gave it 4 stars at this time because I found 2 things in the instructions that could have been a little bit clearer.<br /><br />1)  A little confusion in reference to the same part of the machine as a "steam heating compartment" as well as a "reservoir."<br />2)  Placing the gasket on the blender cutter as it's a little tricky pushing down the gasket where it needs to be, while being careful not to slip and cut yourself on the blades.

Study the machine and think how it is made and work, and you won't have a problem. I think the size is just right for making baby some foods.

Now it fits extremely loose and there's a gap between the bowl and lid so that when used, it sprays food everywhere.  I tried pressing the lid down, but that only partially stops it.  I've only hand-washed it, so not sure why it warped so quickly.  Seems like the plastic is really thin and cheap.  Overall, seemed like a great idea, but if I had it to do again, wouldn't spend more than $40 for the thing.

I even make homemade applesauce for my older kids (ages 4 and 5) all the time.  It's easy to use, easy to clean and works really well.  I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy the babycook simply because it was yet another gadget.  But it has been a lifesaver.  I have 9 month old twins and make their food.  The babycok is easy to use and does a great job even with carrots and other tougher foods.  I totally recommend it.  It is money well spent.

review/summary: Makes making baby food super easy!
review/text: I love this! I'm a kitchen gadget person and what better than a kitchen gadget for baby? On a serious note, I have been using this for about a month now. I love the all in one thing going on. It makes about 8-12oz with a full basket of fruits or veggies easy to make batches to freeze for later! I have not tried the pasta/rice cooker yet, but will soon. I love how easy it makes making babyfood and is easy to clean up.

review/summary: Pretty handy appliance
review/text: Okay so don't try to decode the instructions for the initial setup (three rounds of steaming) without the assistance of someone who is not sleep deprived.  Let's just say the water might end up in the wrong place and it might leak out of the bottom of the steamer bowl.<br /><br />Other than that, works like a charm.  I love that I can steam and puree using one appliance even if it is totally superfluous.  This was a gift and I do wish I could make bigger batches for freezing.  This only made, for example, five one-ounce servings of peas but the product doesn't claim otherwise.  If doing the purchasing myself I would have stuck with food processor.  Oh and I still had to run the peas through a mesh strainer so they would be smooth enough for my 6 month old.<br /><br />All in all, four stars for the intended purpose of this item.  I've only had the pleasure of using the babycook a few times now so no comment on the mold issue but I will be watching for it.

review/summary: Ideal addition to the kitchen for baby
review/text: I loved the idea of fresh baby food and feeding my little one gourmet purees made by mommy. Unfortunately, with children in the home, its not always realistic that we have time to create amazing fresh meals. Enter the Beaba Babycook! This little device is BRILLIANT. Simply wash food (produce, fish, meat, whatever your heart desires!), put into the Beaba, and turn the knob. A few minutes later, everything is cooked evenly and with steam, locking in nutrients. Then turn the knob again and the entire contents are pureed and ready for the youngest eater.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the price, but I found that I SAVED money using the BabyCook-- no more jars of babyfood, no more wasted half-eaten portions. I would whip up a BabyCook full of food, freeze in ice cubes, and have tons of homemade baby food ready to go for weeks at a time. I also used this for an extra veggies found in the fridge-- easy way to stock up on produce purees.<br /><br />Its true-- this device essentially serves the same function as pots, steamers, and food processors. But I found that having one little device to do all the work made clean up more simple and made cooking 100% of my baby's food more realistic.<br /><br />Best of all, the BabyCook is BPA free and safe for baby. You won't regret this purchase.

review/summary: Not great for a new eater
review/text: The steam/reheat/blend all in one is a great system. Unfortunately, the blades are not low enough to fully puree, so we were only using the steamer for the first 2 months. We returned it and bought the baby bullet.

review/summary: Not as great as it appears
review/text: I was very excited to get this, but it was very disappointing. It had a plasticky off-gassing smell, and I noticed its made in China not "french-made". I instead am using my Cuisinart food processor and one of those metal steamer inserts in a pot on the stove and saved the money and feel alot better about what I'm using.

review/summary: Works Great!
review/text: This works wonderfully!  Put food in basket, steam, dump food in blender, blend.  So simple.  So easy to clean up afterward.  I can make many foods in one morning, so my baby gets variety.  It makes about 6 or so ounces at a time, filling one freezer tray.  I think this is good so that I don't have mounds of one vegetable in the freezer.  It makes it easy to keep variety in Baby's diet.  I have had the gasket leak BUT that was because I had it on upside down!  Flipped it over, no problem anymore!  I definitely recommend this cooker!

review/summary: Great idea but flawed
review/text: I just read a post about one person noticing a bad smell after using the steam function for a while and had to post because the same thing happened to mine! I got the babycook as a gift and loved it at first but after using it a couple times and after it sat unused for a couple of weeks I brought it back out and immediately noticed a strange smell while the steamer was on...almost a metalic smell. I then noticed the water had slight brownish tinge after it had collected. I tasted the carrots and they even tasted strange!! The design is flawed because it's basically impossible to clean inside the steaming compartment. After sitting around any extra moisture WILL collect bacteria. I also tried running vinigar through but it didn't really help. I'm not sure if you have ever looked inside of a water distiller but this is the same thing that collects inside - a nasty brown film from the excess stuff in tap water. I would definitely recommend using the purest water possible with this machine! Also, after using it a while I realized my own kitchen items I already have are just as good as this thing, if not better because I can cook more at a time and cut down on my overall kitchen time. This contraption is not worth the wopping 100+ dollars it is going for in my opinion.

review/summary: Get an Immersion Blender instead
review/text: Totally not worth it!<br />Babies eat the really fine purees for such a small amount of time and it is important to continually increase the texture.  I found that a $5 steamer basket and $15 Immersion Blender did a much better job and allowed me to make larger quantities of food with better texture results.<br /><br />In addition the area where you add water started to rust so I really question the craftsmanship here.

review/summary: Terrible product!
review/text: I got this product as a baby gift and I had to return it because the steamer leaked when used.  Got a second one and it did the same thing.  When I used it I had to put a towel under it because it leaked so much water.  Now 2 months later it is steaming out black stuff into the food.  This product is not worth the money, it is way over priced and made very cheap.  Another problem is that it is just way too small, you can only make small servings.  I am very displeased with this product.  Don't waste your money!

review/summary: Best Baby Shower Gift ever!
review/text: I didn't purchase this off of Amazon, but I felt the need to review it.  I registered for this and recieved it for my Baby Shower.  It is one of the best gifts that I received.  It's quick and so easy to use.  I make my son's food every three days.  An example of how much can be made at one time is about 8 1/2 oz's of carrots at at time, I dice the carrots, not too small, and add the water, and wait about 15 minutes, and it's steamed!  Then I simply blend it in it's own juices.  Its so great.  I don't freeze his food, he has fresh food every day. Like I said, I make enough for 3 days, etc etc...<br />Trust me, you will not regret getting this product.

review/summary: So quick and easy
review/text: Love this product, so easy to use, my lil one has fresh healthy food in minutes. I like to cook a weeks supply of food, while I have one meal in the babycook I'm preparing the next. I freeze everything and defrost as I need it. I use Annabel Carmel's baby cookbook for recipe ideas and to help plan my baby's diet. Taking a star off because I would have liked it to have been a little bigger.

review/summary: works great for only a few months
review/text: The Babycook was instantly one of my new favorite kitchen items when I first began pureeing for my daughter.  It works like it's supposed to.  You can "fix it and forget it" until you have time to go back and puree.  I've been making basic vegatable and meat purees for about 4 months now, and here is where the problems begin.  The pitcher (the clear thing in which you steam and puree the vegetables, etc.) is made of plastic.<br />There is also this disc like lid that you place inside the pitcher when you are pureeing.  Since the pitcher is NOT made of glass, like I would think it should be since the cost is so high (you can get cheaper baby food makers, I believe from Safety First and the magic bullet), the plastic bows and bends, so you can't always get a clean fit of the disc, and about 80% of the time, I can not get the pitcher to go on the stand the right way so that the machine will allow me to puree.  It is so annoying.<br />Also, there is this gasket piece which has already fallen off.  It has a replacement piece, but it's difficult to get it back in correctly so that the water used to steam does not leak out from the bottom of the pitcher.<br />I'd never pay the money for this again... so glad it was a gift!
