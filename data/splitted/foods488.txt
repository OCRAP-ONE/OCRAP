review/summary: strong smooth tea with an aromatic bergamot scent and taste
review/text: I am totally addicted to this! i drink it every morning when i wake up and usually have one cup after dinner, . Bergamot is supposed to have properties that aid in digestion and calm your stomach, which i believe in. I have tried severl other brands but none even come close to the quality of stash.

review/summary: stash double bergamot tea
review/text: Bought this at a public store a few years ago but couldn't find it again.  Went to another brand from England and they stopped exporting it.  If you love bergamot then this is for you.  Full taste and bold.  Was thrilled when my daughter told me to look at Amazon.  And there it was.  So much better than any other earl greys.

review/summary: Strong, robust black tea flavor.
review/text: Stash has some of the best black teas on the market and their English Breakfast tea is one of them.  I nice hot cup of this tea first thing in the morning is a great way to start your day.  I really like the individual packaging of the tea bags and ofter tuck a couple of packages in my purse in case a restaurant does not have this tea.<br /><br />I have tried some other teas and have found that some leave a slight, bitter aftertaste and Stash's does not do this.  Very nice flavor and I leave the teabag in the cup the whole time I am drinking it.  Not too strong and not to light.

review/text: This is as close to Earl Grey perfection as one can hope from a tea bag, and at ~$.13/ea, an incredible value. For those who take no issue with tea in a bag, Stash's double-bergamot offering provides a balance of floral, citrus, and earthy notes without being overly tannic or bitter. If you're in the US and you've been looking for a substitute for Harrods, this is it.

review/text: I think it's like another reviewer said, it really lacks a good black tea body. I love the intense spiciness, but clove dominates. In fact, the clove is so intense, that it numbs my mouth half way through a cup. I don't mind because it reminds me of when I used to smoke kretek, but others might.

You take the teabag out of its pouch and it smells delicious, better than any tea I've ever smelled. Seriously, they could make potpourri out of this stuff! Compared to other chai's that I've tasted, this is my favorite. It comes in both decaf and caffeinated, so you can have it anytime... and just, yum. I highly recommend this tea!

review/text: Our family found Stash's Double Bergamot in a grocery store, tried it, loved it --and lost it.  Seems stores have limited shelf space and rarely carry "specialty" items like the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  If you like Earl Grey, you will adore the Earl with Double Bergamot.  Very distinctive flavor.  Unique!  Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out.  Priced better than the local stores.

review/text: I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.

review/summary: About the best Earl Grey Tea I've found
review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Great canned salmon!
review/text: We've been eating the Wild Planet tuna for a while (and it's also excellent), and decided to give this a try. It's more expensive, but very very good, with real salmon flavor and texture. It truly is skinless and boneless, and in nice big chunks (it's like a big piece of fish in the can, with maybe some smaller chunks to fill the space and weight needs). And being wild-caught, and in BPA-free cans, there's the added assurance that they're good for you!<br /><br />This would be excellent in a salmon salad, but what I do with it most often is a salmon hash, with sweet potatoes. It's also good mixed into mac & cheese! For those of us who don't have regular reliable sources of fresh wild sockeye this is really a great option.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: after the comment here I did further research, and the cans for the salmon are NOT, as of mid-2012, BPA-free (the tuna and sardines are). Sorry for the misinformation; I had seen reports that all of the Wild Planet seafood was BPA-free, but apparently (according to the company) there are no Alaska plants working with BPA-free cans and their other tests to date have not been satisfactory.<br /><br />Since it's an occasional rather than everyday for me, and the quality is otherwise so high, I'll keep using this. But others should make their own decisions.

review/summary: Tasty & Handy Way To Get Some of Your Omega 3 Oils
review/text: Some researchers say that Omega 3 is one of the most important nutritional deficiencies in the US.  Salmon is rich in Omega 3 oils, yet it is recommended to add Omega 3 fish oil supplements even if we eat salmon frequently-just to give one an idea of how much we need to add Omega 3 to our diets. Sockeye salmon is very sustainable and healthier to eat than other kinds of salmon.  It cannot be farmed because of its eating habits.  It eats algea and insects, leaving this kind of salmon to be the least carnivorous and lower on the food chain, thus, the lowest in environmental contaminants, such as mercury.<br /><br />With that said, this brand is canned in its own natural juices/oils. Skinless- very mild taste. Pull-tab lid. Can be eaten straight from the can. (I take this and some veggies to work for a quick, healthy lunch)<br /><br />If you like salmon, and/or you are trying to eat more of it, you've gotta try this one!

review/summary: Wild Planet Canned Salmon
review/text: The label on the can says... No liquid or oil added... That's just not true. I poured off 1 3/4 ounces of liquid from one can. That comes out to a price increase of over 40%  per can for the salmon you actually get. The salmon was good but if you are doing a price comparison per can based on the amount of salmon you get, the real price is approximately $6.46 per can or $25.84 per 4 pack. The other 3 cans sound like they are also full of water. If Wild Planet is not going to be truthful about the amount of liquid in the can, what else may be untrue? Is it really a product of the USA, or never previously frozen like the can says? The next can I have, I will weigh the salmon after pouring off the water.

review/text: My wife makes salmon patties for us and her dad. We have used several store brands at several different price points. This salmon is very distinctly more tasteful and the texture is chunkier than what we have seen. The price is higher than some brands, but the taste is worth it. We also like it that it is a sustainably managed product, as the salmon population is on the brink of extinction, something we all need to take seriously. In addition, this product does not need deskinning or deboning. We are buying this by the 12 can subscription amount and price, which helps considerably, and we will be buying this on a regular basis.

review/summary: Great canned Salmon..
review/text: I like to keep some fish in my diet but often find the choices at the grocery store to be disappointing. Although canned fish is certainly not as good as fresh I find this Salmon to be a great alternative to fresh fish. Sustainably caught, wild, and packed without any extra fillers makes this can a winner. Only complaints is that the cans I have received are not pop top as they are in the picture and I have received one order so far that had a dented can. If you do receive a dented can though be sure to contact Amazon as I quickly received a partial refund on this order when I spoke with customer service. In any case, highly recommended, as this Salmon not only tastes better but is also simply better for you. Definitely worth some extra money.

I would highly recommend it for those times when you want to serve the salmon straight from the can for a cold salad or, as I did, eating it greedily after the first sample taste! It is skinless and boneless which would make it attractive for those who can't face those items when opening a can of salmon. And the flavor is outstanding. I will continue to use the generic cans for my salmon patties and reserve these precious ones for when I want the salmon in its purer form!

I am very picky about my salmon, and right now, based on availability and choices of canned salmon in my area, this is my product of choice.<br />The only reason it got 4 stars out of 5, is because of price. When you eat salmon everyday, it kind of breaks your wallet a little. But I figure I can pay for my health now, with healthy food choices, or pay for it later with medical bills, so I guess I'm paying for it now.

review/summary: Amazing stuff!
review/text: This sauces are absolutely great! First of all, unlike many others, they are not just plain hot, they are actually really, really tasty.<br /><br />I'm an average heat lover. That means I don't count drops when adding Tabasco to my meal, but not eating whole habaneros instead of cucumbers either :)<br />So here's my humble opinion about this combo:<br /><br />1) Jalapeno Death. Jalapenos, tomatillos and tequila. Very mild, crispy and refreshing. Amazing on tamales. Expect to finish this bottle fast.<br /><br />2) Original Death - delicious, frutty and moderately spicy. If you felt like original Tabasco is not hot enough, this one will be just right. Good with pretty much everything. I did not try it on oysters yet, but expecting this to be superb combination.<br /><br />3) After Death. That's where the fun begins! Nice punch of habanero and long peppery aftertaste. Great on red meat, absolutely gorgeous on lamb and pork.  My favorite so far.<br /><br />4) Sudden Death. Did you read the recommendation on the bottle about using a micro-drop? Oh, you didn't... Well, you probably should. This thing is HOT. But it feels interesting: not an instant kick, but rather fast growing powerful avalanche of heat with long earthy aftertaste. It will put tears on your eyes and smile on your face - that's for sure. And because there's no instant kick, it is really easy to overdose, so be careful.<br />This sauce also has Siberian ginseng in it (not sure if it affects taste, but just having it in sauce is cool indeed)<br /><br />P.S. I'm looking forward to trying out Mega and Ultra Death<br /><br />P.P.S.  With this combo you also get two very nice and surprisingly well made skull keychains.

review/summary: Tastes Like a High Quality Cappuccino at an Economy Price
review/text: For the price of one cappuccino at your local coffee shop, instead consider making 43 cups of your own at home with this rich-flavored smooth tasting White Chocolate cappuccino from Victorian House.  Two teaspoons to a cup of hot water, and you have an enticing cappuccino that satisfies your taste buds, and you keep your hard-earned money in your wallet!<br /><br />Probably the most popular Victorian Inn flavor is French Vanilla <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5XPS">Victorian Inn Instant Cappuccino, French Vanilla, 32-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)</a>, but White Chocolate seems to be a second favorite based on my observations of what sells at our local distributor.<br /><br />This large canister will make 43 cups of cappucinno.  This is an excellent price (pack of 6) as this item is usually priced anywhere from %5.99 to $6.99 if bought individually.  Each serving has 90 calories, of which 25 are from fat.  It is mostly sugar, with very little coffee, so if you desire a caffeine jolt, add a teaspoon of your favorite instant coffee - I like Folgers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4F14">Folgers Classic Roast Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />konedog

review/text: Although, I understand that the Goreng part of the name means noodles without broth, I'll never stop calling this ramen (meaning noodles with broth). The Indomie products that I've tried (original, satay, and pedas) are all delicious. Make no mistake, not all oriental noodles do it for me. When our local Asian market ran out of Indomie, the owner told me to get a different brand that he promised I'd like better. I ended up throwing it out, because the taste was just awful. Indomie (original) however, has a mellow taste, with enough spice to keep you interested.<br /><br />This how noodles are done. Classic.

Now I can find it on Amazon, Halleluiah! The other reviewers are correct this is the best brand to be found. It can be drained as used as a lo mein or not drained and used as a soup. It is great with cabbage and onions added in.

review/summary: Nature's Miracle Oil
review/text: There is a quiet epidemic in America caused by excessive sugar in our diet and overuse of antibiotics.  The epidemic is Yeast (fungus) overgrowth, and it has been estimated that upwards of 85% of Americans suffer from it, many without even knowing.  Fungal overgrowth has been linked to cancer and other diseases.  There is a simple test called the "SPIT TEST".  Do a search on these subjects and take this test.  If you have the symptoms, purchase this product, Nature's Alchemy Essential Oil of Oregano.  Take as directed (usually 1 drop in water or juice 3 times daily).  Oregano is one of the most potent anti-fungal agents in existence, and it is completely natural with virtually no side effects.  Make sure it is wild oregano.  Don't take my word for it, do some research.  This product worked great for me, and cleared up a stubborn yeast overgrowth problem in just weeks.

review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!
