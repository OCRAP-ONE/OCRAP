review/summary: Starbucks green tea latte mix
review/text: I really love this green tea latte mix. It's really good. It's just as good as the Green Tea Latte from Starbucks. I just got it yesterday in the mail. I am enjoying myself since my job is not near a Starbucks I can just make this at home... Thank you! This is awesome!

review/summary: THIS IS THE BEST MATCHA GREEN TEA LATTE MIX!!!
review/text: This product tastes exactly like the Starbucks Iced Matcha Green Tea Latte (which I have with non-fat milk)!!! The powder dissolves quickly and easily, tastes great and all for a fraction of the Starbucks price!! I always receive the package in record time from the seller and it's always packaged well. As a repeat customer, I highly recommend this product and the seller to everyone!

review/summary: Bye bye Starbucks!  This stuff is better!
review/text: I am verrrry particular, and I can promise you this stuff tastes just like Starbucks' Green Tea Lattes!  I fell in love with this drink, but had a hard time accepting that I'd have to drop almost $5 every time.  I went on a mission to find an alternative, but didn't think I'd find one identical in taste.  I mixed 2 TBSP with 12 oz of soy milk and served it over ice.  The powder dissolved instantly, unlike the Starbucks stuff that just sits on the bottom and on the lid.  It's also sweetened, making it even more ridiculously easy to make.  This is probably going to be the least expensive Matcha mix you'll find, too, so look no further.  Try it!

review/summary: Great for baking with!
review/text: This stuff is delicious! I've made frappes and cookies with it so far, and the results are fantastic! The product arrives in an air-tight foil-type resealable bag.  I got his product for the taste, not necessarily for the health benefits.  But for those who want it for the nutritional benefits, I've been told that you need to find Matcha in an air-tight bag, and freeze it right after you open it.  It loses its nutritional value very rapidly! I looked at local stores, and the only matcha I could find was in a little 1 oz container (not air-tight whatsoever - you could shake it like a maraca) and they were charging $25 for the 1 oz! I got 16 oz for the same price, shipping included!<br />This is where I'll be buying Matcha from now on, for sure! There aren't many stores in Saskatchewan that have Matcha, and those that do are crazy over-priced!

review/summary: Best non-whey non-soy alternative
review/text: Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!

review/summary: Egg Protein Review
review/text: I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.

review/summary: Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
review/text: This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

review/summary: a tip for improving consistency
review/text: I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.

review/summary: This is a great alternative to whey
review/text: I've been a fan of HnF's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion (that being said, the ONLY whey I've found that doesn't bother my stomach at all is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BOTGTM">Optimum Nutrition 100% Platinum Hydro Whey Turbo Chocolate 1.75 Protein</a>).<br /><br />The chocolate tastes pretty good with water (although I don't really care about taste), and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk. It also tastes good in smoothies (I use frozen bananas and rice milk).<br /><br />Only downside is you may get gas initially and you're going to smell things that no human should smell. This passes pretty quickly (huhuh) though.<br /><br />Oh and don't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap. I use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it's still not very good.

review/summary: Low calorie, high protein, great taste
review/text: I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.

review/summary: The Best Protein Out There
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of "Metabolic" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.

review/summary: Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy
review/text: The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix

review/summary: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.
review/text: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Natural Protein
review/text: Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.

review/text: I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,

review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESN'T FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

review/text: So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.

review/summary: Not too sweet, not too salty
review/text: Amazon's vine program regularly offers me this type of vaguely healthy, vaguely sugary snacks.  Sometimes I accept.  Usually, I am disappointed.  These things, though, are actually pretty good.  They are described as dark chocolate, nuts, and sea salt.  That's pretty much what you taste.  The strongest flavor components are the nuts, which are very lightly salted with sea salt.  So, you taste the nuts, not the salt.  On top of that, they use dark chocolate, but in relatively small quantities so that the nuts remain the primary flavor component.  The fact that they use dark chocolate keeps the bars from being too sweet, and the light amount of sea salt is just enough for the nuts without overpowering anything.  I hate healthy snacks that try to mimic candy bars.  Such attempts generally use poor quality chocolate in large quantities, and usually wind up with about as many calories per gram as normal candy bars anyway.  These bars, though, just taste like what they are.  If you want a snickers bar with fewer calories, you are out of luck.  However, if you like nuts that are very lightly salted, dark chocolate, and don't want something as sweet as a candy bar, these are actually pretty good.

review/summary: Free Sample Was Delicious
review/text: Delicious free sample arrived with another order I placed on Amazon. I got the dark chocolate sea salt. At first I cringed at the idea of sea salt and chocolate...but it's wonderful and complimentary. I did not expect the pronouncement of the sea salt flavor to be as bold as it was, and to go so well with the dark semi-sweet goodness of the chocolate laced nut variety. I will be ordering these in bulk. Been on a gluten free kick lately after reading up on the horrors of gluten on blood sugar. You'll have to do your own research, but it's shocking, thinking you've been eating healthy wheat, only to realize that for some wheat can be the cause to many progressing health problems. Again, subjective information. Do your own reading. But these are not modified, are gluten free, and I can pronounce and understand everything on the label. Nothing hydrolized or masked.

I LOVE the simple ingredients and fresh taste of these bars! The sweet & salty combination is a winner for a healthy pick me up (usually at 3 in the afternoon!) - They do not "travel" well though, and I have been putting them in an old sunglasses case so they don't get smooshed.  I have a bowl of them on my desk at work for a no-brainer snack instead of a candy bar. Yum!

This is an elegant cinnamon nutty bar with indulgent dark chocolate. Also this bar has fiber 7g, protein 5gm and only 5gm of sugar. The fat content is a little high at 16gm. You will swear this is a sugary treat and not a healthy satisfying bar. Have them with a glass of no fat milk or chobani yogurt and you will feel full for hours. And they are only 5 points on the weight watcher point system.

review/summary: Review: KIND Nuts and Spices: Madagascar Vanilla no less!
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure...I'm not a huge nut fan.  Usually, I will skip brownies, cakes and other items that have nuts in them.  I'm willing to eat them by themselves but I find they kind of ruin other thing people stick them into.  Further, I'm trying to lose weight and usually nuts can be a good way to go.<br /><br />The KIND Nuts and Spices nut bars are part of the KIND Healthy Snacks line.  They are very upfront about pointing out the use of only 5 grams of sugar (or less) and nothing artificial.  further internet research shows that they keep the sugar levels low by using spices.  In this case, its Madagascar vanilla.<br /><br />The bars are very tasty, not too heavy and rather filling for what volume they take up.  They are a little sticky (the plastic wrap they come is is surprisingly strong) and the bars themselves really do taste well for the amount of sugar.<br /><br />I will point out that the bars I had boasted 16g of fat, 14 g of carbs, 5 g dietary fiber and 7 grams of protein.  From Weight Watchers standpoint, that's 6 points.  Having said that, I could see one of these bars being a decent substitute for a meal so from that standpoint, its cheap points wise.<br /><br />All in all, the bar is pretty good...I'm glad I got them and I will buy more!

review/summary: KIND Bars...delicious way to satisfy hunger
review/text: I am so happy that I got the chance to try KIND Nuts and Spices - Madagascar Vanilla Almond Bars.  I The bars are not only gluten free, they're low on the glycemic index (meaning they don't significantly impact blood sugar). They're sweetened with a mixture of honey and non-GMO glucose. And they have whole nuts -- almonds, peanuts, cashews and walnuts. It's a delicious way to curb hunger and not feel guilty after snacking.<br /><br />Although KIND is a great-tasting product, it has a few flaws. KIND contains a chicory root.  If you're not only gluten intolerant, but are also allergic to chicory root, then should consider whether or not you'd like to buy these. Additionally, for those on the SCD or GAPS diets, the bars also contain rice(a starch), glucose and soy lecithin -- which is considered "illegal".  It also contains peanuts.<br /><br />These bars taste wonderful and are an excellent, quick snack. I wish the manufacturers would create a line where the glucose, soy, rice and chicory root were eliminated. I know, however, that probably won't happen any time soon.<br />I still recommend these bars. I would actually purchase them in the future.

review/text: Kind bars are one of my favorite new snacks. They are healthy and give a nice little energy boost, but most of all, they taste great. I have had the fruit & nut, the peanut butter chocolate, and the dark chocolate, nuts, & sea salt; Kind bars. The dark chocolate, nuts, and sea salt flavor are my favorite.<br /><br />These are the perfect blend of roasted nuts and dark chocolate, along with cocoa powder, sugar, oil, crisp rice, and vanilla, all rolled up with a hint of sea salt. There is nothing that brings out the taste of the chocolate and the nuts like a hint of sea salt. This may not be a completely low calorie sugar free snack, but it is a delicious tasting snack that is still fairly healthy.<br /><br />Kind bars are becoming really popular and with flavors that taste like this one, I can see why. These make great snack bars and really hit the spot when you are looking for something to tide you over until meal time.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: When I first opened up the box, my heart leapt at the idea of nut bars that looked like my favorite Payday bars.  Could something healthy for you taste like something that is bad for you?<br /><br />OK, maybe my eyes jumped to an unrealistic conclusion, but come on now, there is always hope.<br /><br />Not to say that there is no sweetness, there is a little, just enough to feel that you are having a treat.  I really do not taste a specific type of vanilla so calling it Madagascar Vanilla is a bit of over marketing, but that is ok.  You do have to love nuts since there seems to be one of every type in it.  The syrupy stickiness that holds them together has a bit of a grainy taste, but it is not offensive and as for spices, nothing stands out as remarkable.<br /><br />Seven grams of protein is not enough for a meal replacement, but is perfect for an in between snack or a holdover if you will not be getting to lunch or dinner for a while.<br /><br />They are surprisingly good and I recommend that you keep a couple either in your purse or desk draw.

Our teenage boys eat them as a preferred snack, and get useful helpings of fruit, nuts and antioxidants in the process. While sweet and yummy, these bars are not extremely high in sugar like regular candy bars, and have more nutrition than many other purchased snacks. And the best part is, my husband and I like them, too.<br /><br />The dark chocolate nut and sea salt flavor has become my new personal favorite. I can get a chocolate fix without eating too much chocolate, a nice full feeling from the nuts, and a touch of salt taste to add a kick to it. If they could find a way for the chocolate and nuts to be low in calories, it would be the perfect snack.

review/summary: Taste fine, somewhat pricey
review/text: I like these bars. They contain some nuts, lightly coated in dark chocolate. They are a bit harder than many other bars to bite into because of the whole nuts used; this is not like a Quaker Chewy bar by any means. The ingredient list is relatively short, so it's easy to comprehend what's actually in these things, and the low sugar content makes them seem almost healthy.<br /><br />The one point I have against them is their price. $1.67 for a relatively small (40 gram) bar, purchased in bulk seems like a bit too much. That's a rate of nearIy $20/pound. I would probably not purchase them at that price. Bring it down to about $1.00 each and I might consider it.

review/summary: good. but not really 'dark' chocolate
review/text: Kind Nuts & Spices Dark Chocolatye Nuts & sea Salt bars are a tasty snack but labeling them "dark" chocolate is misleading<br /><br />They are basically a bar of Walnuts, almonds, peanuts, and rice krispies glued together with honey and chocolate<br /><br />While tasty, the main problem is the chocolate. I really wouldn't call it "dark". It certainly did not taste like dark chocolate<br /><br />Otherwise, it's pretty good. Low sodium, low sugar, no sugar alcohols or artifical sweeteners, gluten and transfat free.<br />I'd say other than the chocolate not being that dark, these bars are one tasty snack

review/summary: Better Than a Candy Bar
review/text: Although these are expensive, you will be able to tell immediately that it is a quality product. The nuts are plentiful and large, and the dark chocolate doesn't taste cheap. These bars are ideal for my mid-morning snack before I work out. They give me energy and only have 200 calories.<br /><br />It is not, however, the kind of bar I can carry with me, at least in the summer months. The bar melts easily, and I can see it turning into a real mess. Other than that, I can highly recommend this to people who want a tasty treat with not a lot of calories.

review/text: These are very nutty bars with a nice dose of chocolate as well.  Also, for being low in sodium, they have a salty kick to them as well from the sea salt.  It's nice that they're made of pretty healthy ingredients, though they're not big enough to be more than a snack or a nice treat if you're craving something sweet/salty.

review/text: The combination of dark chocolate, nuts, & sea salt make for an addicting combination. I've already made it through two bars since it arrived in the mail earlier today. I also love the fact that it is made with quality ingredients, so even though it approaches dessert like status, it is more healthily than a candy bar and tastes better than many granola bars, as much as I love granola bars. The salt, chocolate and texture reminds me of Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby minus the ice cream of course,

This Kind Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, the chocolate part is not too sweet.<br /><br />If I could increase one part of this bar it would be the dark chocolate, but really, this bar is just about perfect the way it is.<br /><br />It's also refreshing to know what you are eating, to see what you are eating, without having to read an ingredient list.<br /><br />I love that the nuts are left in whole pieces, not chopped up.<br /><br />This is a great satisfying snack!

review/summary: Good KIND of Nutbar
review/text: There are so many trail mix bars out in the market so how does KIND nuts & spices, Madagascar Vanilla Almond compete?  Well, while the taste is different, the main thing is the health factor.  Made from almonds, walnuts, crisp rice and held together with honey, this bar boasts only 4 grams of sugar.  But, the fact that it has 210 calories, 140 from fat is a bit alarming.  However, the fat is from the nuts.  Nuts are high in fat, but these are good fats.<br /><br />Overall, I would say these are good alternative to those nugget, chocolate, full of wasted calories and fat bars.  I recommend these as a quick snack for on the go.

review/summary: Very nutty
review/text: This bar is nothing but nuts held together with a really nice substance that is sticky enough to hold the nuts together, but is not hard to chew at all and does not get stuck in your teeth.  I honestly didn't taste much vanilla or much of any kind of spices, but it definitely has an all natural taste.  We're especially glad to find a bar with such a low level of sugar.  The calories are a little high for this small of a bar (approx 1 1/2" by 5" and they are 210 calories per bar) and I'm not someone who can just stop after eating one of something I like, so that could be a problem.  But, if you have enough self control to just eat one, this would be a really healthy and satisfying snack to have.

review/summary: Not too sweet, not too salty, plenty of nuts & a great crunch; very satisfying!
review/text: Over the last 10+ years I couldn't even begin to count the number of bars I have purchased and tried. Many have ended up in the trash without hesitation because of being too sugary sweet, packed with fillers, unappealing textures or flavors that taste off or artificial.  When I received the Kind bar (Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt) I immediately looked at the ingredients, saw only 12 and thankfully they were all ones I recognized and could pronounce. I also appreciated that they were low sodium, lower in sugar than most bars, plus they had a decent amount of fiber and protein. Of course the most important part was going to be taste and these didn't disappoint! I love anything that combines sweet and salty in the right amounts and this was perfect for my taste. The crunch and amount of the almonds was also really good at extending my chewing, which in turn helps me feel a bit more satisfied because I take longer in eating it instead of just scarfing it down.  Overall I have no complaints about the Kind bar and I look forward to trying out some of the other flavors, even if I think I've found perfection in this one.

review/summary: Nice combo of chocolate, nuts and sea salt
review/text: This KIND Nuts & Spices Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt bar manages to blend three favorite ingredients (chocolate, nuts, salt) into a rather healthy bar (compared to mass market candy bars and sugary energy/nutrition bars). The dark chocolate is distinct, taking over the bottom side of the bar. Thanks to the sea salt, despite having just 5% RDA sodium, you get a decided salty taste out of this. There are three kinds of nuts in this, almonds, peanuts, and walnuts.<br /><br />It has a mild crunch to it but I did not feel that my fillings were at risk of crumbling under pressure.<br /><br />Because of the chocolate and such, your hands will get a little sticky, so keep that in mind if you are planning to eat one of these before an interview or if you are going to be far away from a place to wash.<br /><br />One bar has 200 calories (140 from fat) and weighs 40 grams. It has 15g total fat (3.5g saturated, 0g trans fat), 0% cholesterol, 16g carbs (7g dietary fiber, 5g sugars), 6g protein, 125mg (5% RDA) sodium (thank you sea salt), 210mg potassium, and various other minerals and vitamins.

review/summary: These are fantastic!
review/text: Wow, I've gotta admit: I thought these KIND Madagascar Vanilla Almond bars were just gonna be some regular ol' bars when I ordered them from Vine. Boy, was I wrong. These aren't a bunch of ingredients blended together and they aren't held together by some outer opaque coating. Instead, the ingredients are all right there for you to see while you're eating each bar. There are only 10 ingredients in these things, including almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts, honey, non GMO glucose, chicory root fiber, crisp rice, Madagascar vanilla, and soy lecithin. Notice anything about those ingredients? That's right, they're all PRONOUNCEABLE and stuff you've actually heard of! That means you can feel good about what's in these because you aren't putting a bunch of chemicals or fillers in your body. And you know what else? The nutrition facts are pretty great as well! Only 210 Calories per bar (just slightly high), 16 grams fat (I'm assuming this is due to the nuts because there are only 2 grams of saturated fat), only 14 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and last but not at all least only 4 grams of sugar. Yeah, in a time when pretty much everything we eat is packed with sugar, each of these bars only has 4 grams of it! They've also got various percentages of a bunch of different vitamins and minerals. And on top of everything, these are really tasty. This is one of the few food items I've tried from Vine that I do plan to purchase more of when I run out.<br /><br />If you want a food bar that has decent protein and fiber and isn't loaded with sugar AND only has ingredients you've heard of, I wholeheartedly recommend the KIND Madagascar Vanilla Almond bars!

I was hoping for more of a contrast between the sweet chocolate and the salty nut taste, but I got more of a nutty and less chocolate taste.

review/text: I recieved a Kind choco sample with my Amazon order. I could tell it was "healthier" than normal, because it was not very sweet or chocolatey. However, after getting past the expectation of a rich chocolate experience, and accepting that it was more like a trail mix bar, it was better. By the end of the bar, I had enjoyed it. Just don't think you're going to have a chocolate experience with this bar, and it will be good.

review/summary: Long-lasting energy, real vanilla beans - yummm
review/text: Kind Bars are a wonderful snack for those who are interested in protein and longer-lasting energy.  I love Kind bars, because I don't get a carb energy drop after eating one, thanks to the low sugar & high protein/fiber content.  When I know it's going to be a long afternoon, I grab a Kind bar.<br /><br />The Madagascar Vanilla Almond has a very good vanilla flavor without being heavily sweet, thanks to having only 4 grams of sugar.  You can see all the little black vanilla beans in the bar!  This means they used real vanilla (as stated in the ingredients), and no artificial flavorings.<br /><br />Lots of satisfying crunching & chewing means I feel like I had a snack of substance.  Kind bars definitely fit this criteria.  There's also some crisp rice mixed in for extra texture.  There are a few too many peanuts and cashews in this variety for my tastes, would have preferred more almonds, but it's not a turn-off.<br /><br />The calorie count is a bit higher than I'd usually go for in a snack - 210 calories per bar - thanks to being mostly all nuts.  But it's still worth it to me, for the benefits of the protein.<br /><br />My favorite flavor is still the Kind Apple Cinnamon & Pecan variety, which I have on Subscribe & Save, but this Madagascar Vanilla Almond is a great runner up choice.<br /><br />Granola bars are overdone, mostly carbs, and just plain not so great for you (depending on the brand).  If you want a better snack, stock up on Kind Bars.

review/summary: Not the best when in hot environment but still tasty
review/text: I received the package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PE7ANY">KIND Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, 12-Count Bars</a> in the early evening, so it had been sitting in the shipper's truck all day in the heat.  Unfortunately, when I opened the package, each bar was soft because the chocolate was melted and sticking to the wrapper.  Regardless, when brought back to a temperature closer to the 80 degree range, I eagerly tore open a cellophane package and carefully peeled it back to try my first KIND bar.  With the first bite, I was impressed by the great flavor of fresh nuts and simple dark chocolate, even after exposed to the environmental heat.  On the second bite, I was hit with the sea salt, making me think about how smart it is to add sea salt instead of using salted nuts which I sometimes do when making chocolate covered nuts.  That creates an inconsistent salt burst which I find appealing.  At the small size of 1.4 ounces, it's loaded with fiber from the nuts and chicory root fiber, with relatively little sugars.  I personally would seldom consider eating one of these as a meal, but would have it as a filling food when needed in times where a meal could not be obtained.  I would supplement this and would not rely on this alone for nutrition!  Without further information on what else is included in the diet, I don't understand how the "Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center indicates that eating 2 KIND bars each day helps maintain your weight through low glycemic, deliciously satisfying, nutritionally rich ingredients that will keep you fuller longer."  I think that 400 calories of intake per day is too much for any snack item.  With that being said, I now carry one of these bars with me instead of another grain type bar for the times when I absolutely need something to eat or desire a chocolate fix.  When I have these, I no longer carry a little bag of nuts either.  Because I haven't yet purchased bars which haven't been heated, I can only say that those I've received are not visually appealing and require eating directly from the cellophane because the bits of chocolate fall away.  Despite that flaw, these are a great snack item that I will be purchasing and will try other varieties as well.  I would like to see these offered at a better value when purchased in a box rather than the current cost at about eighteen dollars for a pound box of twelve bars.

review/summary: I love Kind bars, but this flavor only ok
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that I love Kind bars.  I love their all-natural ingredients, use of non-GMO products, and marginal amount of sugar per bar.  This "Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt" flavor sounded intriguing, but I was ultimately disappointed by the subtle flavors.  The dark chocolate is a very light touch and I could barely taste the sea salt.  The nuts are plentiful on the other hand, but a little too hard and gummy and they usually got stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />They did make a tasty snack with Greek yogurt however, which helped to soften the nuts.

review/summary: Tasty but not our Favorite
review/text: My wife and I love KIND bars, particularly since she is pre-diabetic and loves snacking.<br /><br />These are perfect for anyone who is watching their blood sugar for spikes and wants a high protein snack.  The flavor choices of all of the bars kind of run together after a while.  They're basically variations of fruit, dark chocolate, coconut, and nuts.<br /><br />The Dark Chocolate/Nuts/Sea Salt combo is quite tasty, though I found that the salt didn't hit my tongue consistently.  Also, and this is my biggest complaint about this particular bar, is that it's MUCH harder to bite into.  It was like trying to bite off a rock!  Needless to say, make sure you have strong teeth and drink some milk for calcium to support your taste for these!<br /><br />I think we'll stick with our macadamia and fruit combo as our favorite...

And of course the easy to carry packaging makes it a good choice for travel (or taking to work).<br /><br />Good product, unremarkable flavor.<br /><br />Edit: I should point out that I'm reviewing the "Madagascar Vanilla Almond" product, the other flavors sound more interesting.

review/text: KIND has done everything right on these yummy little nut bars. What you've got here is a conglomeration of different nuts (seemingly glazed a bit) glued together with enough dark chocolate to be very tasty without overwhelming the surprisingly fresh taste of the nuts. The hint of sea salt is just right. As far as texture, it's chewy (but not TOO chewy) with hints of crisp along with the solid but gently yielding nut meats. What an indulgence!<br /><br />Note that these aren't a low calorie snack (more's the pity), but they do deliver a nice amount of protein. These would make a great meal replacement (or between meal pick-me-up) to store in a desk drawer and enjoy with a cup of coffee.

review/text: It's a good thing I am not allergic to nuts because this Vanilla Almond Bar is really loaded with them.  There is only 4 grams of sugar so the total taste is not very sweet but it is still quite delicious.  Each bar is 210 Calories but 140 of them are from fat.  This is not really a problem since the fat is from nuts which is the good kind of fat.  The bar is a bit dryer than most other ones I've tried so I like to have a drink on standby near me when I eat one.  This appears to be a really healthy snack and tasty without making my blood sugars hit the roof.  I will be buying these again and I highly recommend them.

This is decent in protein, low in sugar, all natural flavors...what else could you want? A lower price maybe? If you have young kids this would be a great after school snack but it could become a very pricy one for you to purchase on a regular basis. There are several flavors to choose from and enjoy.

review/summary: Kinda perfect
review/text: I'm not that much of a bar lover: a banana or fruit is my go to grab food.  But the KIND Nuts & Spices Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt bar is my new favorite "too crazy busy to eat a real meal right now" item.<br /><br />This bar does not taste like processed food. It has a simple set of ingredients - nuts, three kinds of  them, almonds, peanuts, and walnuts, chocolate and a touch of sea salt - and you can taste each one.  The sea salt and the hint of cinnamon elevates the taste, and the chocolate is sweet but not too sweet.  For some reason the chocolate is messy  and the only thing that seems to prevent it is keeping it super cold - not always easy for an item that lives in the bottom of my purse.<br /><br />These bars are filling, and at 200 calories, you need them to be. The calories do pack a nice nutritional punch though: 0% cholesterol, 7g dietary fiber, 5g sugars and 6g protein.

There are several different varieties as well, giving you your choice of chocolate, fruit and nut, or peanut butter preference (or combinations thereof).<br /><br />Excellent pick-me-up, and I will be getting more of these.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: This is a fabulous product. The dark chocolate gives it a little hint of sweetness, yet it's still a low-carb snack. The sea salt isn't overwhelmingly salty, but it adds a nice burst of flavor. These bars taste great, and they're also a decent protein, fiber and good fat boost.

review/summary: A delicious, all-natural snack bar, but it is definitely NOT a low-cal snack
review/text: These snack bars are part of KIND Healthy Snacks range of whole nut bars made with only 5 grams of sugar and no artificial ingredients. I tried the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I unwrapped my first bar was that it seemed to rain bits of dark chocolate. There was still plenty of chocolate left on the bar, but there were a lot of chocolate crumbs on the piece of paper in front of me. I am very glad that I was not sitting back when I opened this, as I would have had a lap full of chocolate!<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was the taste. The bar is quite, quite yummy - tasting of almond, peanuts and walnuts, with a nice shadow of cocoa, and periodic flashes of sea salt. In this respect the bar is a home run!<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was the calorie count. A Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar has 200 calories, with 140 calories coming from fat, and it has 16 grams of carbohydrates. As far as I am concerned, this does put the bar in the candy bar range, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />So, I would say that this is a delicious, all-natural snack bar, but it is definitely NOT a low-cal snack. Also, beware of opening one of these when wearing dress clothes!<br /><br />(Review of KIND Nuts and Spice Bars Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt)

review/summary: Kind of Delicious
review/text: The clear wrapper on these bars immediately reveals a product that is more like homemade bars than typical snack food, and the ingredients are simple and natural.  On taking a bite, I was impressed with the crunchy texture of the nuts, and it was not too sticky to hold.  The flavors that stood out the most were the almonds, sea salt, and dark chocolate.  I was particularly impressed with how well the salt flavor stood up, and the chocolate tastes like real chocolate that would be good alone.<br /><br />I have become more and more of a fan of these sort of "back to basics" products recently, and not just for health reasons.  While some brands do taste very bland or boring, as if being natural is enough, others take the taste and texture seriously, with no need to hide cheap ingredients behind a wall of chemicals.  This is one of those delightful products.

review/summary: I LOVE Kind bars
review/text: I've tried a number of different kinds of Kind bars and honestly I didn't think anything could make them better.  I was wrong.  Dark chocolate, which of course makes everything better, doesn't gild this particular lily, it makes it even more delicious.<br /><br />Kind bars are wonderful amalgams of dried fruits and nuts, and other good things.  They seem minimally processed; the nuts are cracked, not ground, and everything is held together with a bit of honey.  They're not too sweet, not too salty, not too dry... really they're just right.  Top this Just Right off with a thin layer of dark chocolate and you have a true winner.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't care if they're good for me.  They're simply one of the best snacks I've eaten in ages.

review/summary: Wow - Chewy, crunchy, delicious
review/text: These are among the best bars I've ever had. They are simply great.<br /><br />They are sweet, but not overly so.<br />Chewy, with a very good amount of crunchy nuts (almonds in particular) around them.<br />Natural sugars! (honey, non-gmo glucose), and the only relative<br /><br />Don't confuse them for health bars (these are better than most of them, 5g of fiber, no weird ingredients), or protein bars (though they do have 7g of protein), but obviously no comparison to sneakers or typical granola bars that have tons of sugar (these are just 4g per bar).<br /><br />All in, these are simply delicious, perfect blend of chewy and crunchy. And the ingredient list is something rare these days.<br />Oh they have a low glycemic index and are gluten free too. Did I mention they are delicious?<br /><br />The only down side is the price, of ~$1.50 per bar, even in a large pack.

review/summary: Great Product - Just Not As Great Shipped In The Summer
review/text: I have been buying bars from KIND for a few months, and I decided to see how they do shipped from Amazon rather than buying from the store.  I love the Dark Chocolate, Nuts, and Sea Salt variety as well as many of the others.  The bars buy themselves are worth 5 stars for taste and healthy diet considerations.  While they have a high ratio of fat, the fat from nuts is beneficial in reasonable amounts.<br /><br />So if everything is so great, you might be wondering why I only gave them 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the product is somewhat degraded in the delivery process.  I'm not sure what time the Post Office left them in my mailbox, but the Texas sun was not kind (no pun intended) to them while they waited for me to get home and retrieve them.  The dark chocolate wound up melting to an extent.  Even after waiting for it to solidify the next day, the melted chocolate that adhered to the wrapper went everywhere when I opened the bars.  It did not affect the taste any, but this is not a problem that I encounter when I buy them in the store and bring them straight home.  This is not an issue for the non-chocolate varieties, but I cannot recommend buying any of the bars from KIND in the summer.

review/text: These nut bars are a delicious treat.  They are more like a natural dessert/candy bar than a meal or protein bar though.  Imagine a pile/row of nuts held together by a sticky honey glaze and you can imagine these bars.  210 calories (140 from fat).  14 grams of carbs, 4 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein.

review/text: I've not much to add that hasn't already been said. These are the best tasting bars I've tried. They are, or taste like they are laced with Sugar. Perhaps because the nuts are held in place by tons of honey! Only 4g of sugar but with a 40g bar that's 10%. It's great to be able to see what you're eating too as nothing is smashed together or ground up. Visually appealing and very tasty.

review/text: Doc OZ has reccommended these bars but I say,"Doc OZ- You crazy!"<br /><br />They taste ok.  Standard, standard. They really taste like any other bar but at 180 Calories, I'd rather go with something else. I thought 100 calories was the caloric threshold for these power bars but I guess not.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick 180 calories, this is for you! If you are looking for a quick alternative to lunch- this is not a bad way to go. Looking for a low calorie snack, you can do much better than these.

review/summary: natural, delish and full of good for you monounsaturated fats but low in sugar
review/text: I'll admit I was not at all sure why, when I bought my contact lens solution, there was a special deal that I get this kind bar free. I knew there was hidden target marketing in their somewhere but I simply couldn't fathom what it was.<br /><br />Still, I was gonna buy the lens cleaner anyway so I may as well have a snack after a lens cleaning session, dontchaknow.<br /><br />I had unpacked my Amazon box and was headed to walk the dogs when I nabbed a taste...woa, unexpected.<br /><br />I am a KIND bar afficianado already. I even nabbled a KIND tote bag at a tasting event. I thought I'd pretty much sampled all of them and boubght many of them at Whole Foods in the years past. Either this one is new or I overlooked the best of the bunch along the way.<br /><br />I buy chocolate bars that have sea salt in them...it's a taste that sounds odd but the saltiness and sweetness combo is devine.<br /><br />They have taken it up a level. The crunch of the nuts with chocolate and seasalt and sweetness is truly superb.<br /><br />Now add in dark chocolate and nuts which are a monounsaturated fat and MUFAS have been shown in study after study to actually assist in weightloss (you still have to watch your caloric intake, mind you) and boost heart health and viola! A 200 calorie low glycemic snack...it's actually very low in sugar for a treat (12 grams)<br /><br />Packed with protein, this also will help satiety far better than a candy bar...and, in my opinion, the taste is simply superior.

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy, nutty flavor that is not too sweet, and (YAY!) no corn syrup that is often (over)used in other snack bars.
review/text: Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />***** Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!<br /><br />Nutritional Value: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br />Packaging, Appearance, Flavor: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br />Competitive Pricing & Value: *** Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Delicious nutty flavor with a very crunchy texture.<br />+ Only 4 grams of naturally-derived sugar (AND NO CORN SYRUP)!<br />+ All-natural minimalist set of ingredients.<br />+ Due to the all-natural nutritional content that is not artificially fortified with extra vitamins, these serve solely as snack bars and are not meant to be used as meal-bar diet aids.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- Slightly expensive considering the small 40-gram (1.4 ounce) size of each bar.<br /><br />Although these snack bars come in four different flavors, this review is specifically for the "Madagascar Vanilla Almond" flavor...<br /><br />The Amazon product listing for this snack bar currently does not list its nutritional information, so I included it below (copied from the kindsnacks Web site):<br /><br />Ingredients: Mixed nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts), honey, non GMO glucose, chicory root fiber, crisp rice, Madagascar vanilla, soy lecithin.<br /><br />Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamin A (0% DV), Vitamin C (0% DV), Calcium (6% DV), Iron (6% DV).Vitamin E (25% DV), Vitamin K (2% DV), Vitamin B1 (4% DV), Vitamin B2 (10% DV), Vitamin B3 (10% DV), Vitamin B6 (4% DV), Folate (6% DV), Phosphorus (15% DV), Magnesium (20% DV), Zinc (8% DV)<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Bar (40g)<br />Calories: 210<br />Fat Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 16g<br />Saturated Fat: 2<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 15mg<br />Potassium: 210mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 14g<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g<br />Sugars: 4g<br />Protein: 7g<br /><br />Nutritional Value: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br /><br />As befits the Kind company's slogan of "Ingredients you can see & pronounce", the ingredient listing for these snack bars includes just the necessities, without the various chemistry lab listing of corn syrup-derived sugar, vitamin additives, preservatives, and strange-sounding artificial compounds that some snack bars include.  The "non GMO glucose" means that the glucose is derived from non-genetically-modified sources.  Unlike the sucrose table sugar, glucose is a very simple sugar that is easily digested by the body.  "Madagascar vanilla" is sometimes promoted as being a premium vanilla that comes from Madagascar, even though most of us would not really notice any difference between vanilla sources and where the plants were grown.  But many so-called "vanilla-flavored" foods are artificially flavored with vanillin derived from lignin instead of vanilla fruits, so at least we get real vanilla here, instead of artificial vanilla flavoring.  The "soy lecithin" ingredient acts as an emulsifier to hold the ingredients together and keep them from separating.  Soy lecithin is a byproduct of soybean oil production.  So all ingredients used in these bars are vegan and natural in origin.  If you are allergic to either soy or nuts, you should not consume these bars.  But these bars are gluten-free for gluten-sensitive people, dairy-free, cholesterol-free, very low sodium, and have a low glycemic index with no trans fats.<br /><br />I am particularly happy with the fact that corn syrup, and all its variants, are not used in these snack bars, and that they are not all loaded up with sugar.  Too many snack bars list corn syrup as one of their primary ingredients!  These bars also have less sodium than most snack bars out there.<br /><br />Because these snack bars are not artificially fortified with additional vitamins, they do not serve as meal replacement bars, so they are not comparable to a meal-bar like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GU66BY">SlimFast 200 Calorie, Sweet & Salty Chocolate Almond, Meal Bar 5pk, 7.93-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> (which, like many meal bars and snack bars, is full of corn syrup).<br /><br />Packaging, Appearance, Flavor: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br /><br />These bars have a hard, very crunchy, whole-nut texture that I found totally enjoyable to eat as a snack in between meals and on hiking trails.  The texture is somewhat like crunching on peanut brittle, but certainly not as sweet as peanut brittle.  If you prefer your snack bars to be soft and chewy, this is not the right bar for you... but be aware that "soft and chewy" often translates to "loaded with sugar".  If you have sensitive teeth or gums, biting into this crunchy bar may cause some discomfort.

review/text: I love nuts and dark chocolate, so for me this was a no brainer. These aren't big enough for a meal replacement for me personally, but for some dieting or trying to do whats right and eat a breakfast in a hurry these are a great option. If you still eating those chewy granola bars, don't you think it time for an adult bar? The taste on this is great as you get the crunch from the nuts, the sweet and smooth from the chocolate, and sweets favorite companion salty. The only negative thing I could say is these do cost a good bit, but in my opinion it is worth it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Natural ingredients<br />-Minimal sugar<br />-Great taste<br />-Healthy fat, protein and fiber<br /><br />Con:<br />-Cost<br />-Not filling enough for a meal replacement.<br /><br />Overall five stars as it is a great product and I will continue to use it as a morning snack.

review/summary: Great tasty product, but a "free sample" as seen here? I think not.
review/text: The offer said, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AHWFFS">Free Sample of Kind Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar, 1.4 Ounce</a>, so I clicked on it, wondering if it was truly a freebie. It wasn't but I ordered a couple of them anyway. More on this "free sample" offer later, but how good are they?<br /><br />Subjective Taste Test:<br /><br />Perhaps this is a little unfair as I've tested the KIND Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar before. Bought a couple of them at a local store some time ago and found that they were a good snack alternative to my regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079N94TY">Clif Bar Energy Bars</a> when out cycling. And followers of his show will already know that Dr. Oz, recommended KIND and keeps some in his briefcase at all times. As far as taste goes, these are good, nice and chewy with a decent nut flavor, and the dark chocolate is not sickeningly sweet as one will find with some products. I have a thing for sea salt, and the combination of that with the nuts and dark chocolate works... and they don't leave a bad artificial aftertaste.<br /><br />Nutrition Stats:<br /><br />Checked the KIND site and found the following ingredients were listed for this product:<br /><br />Mixed nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts), chicory root fiber, honey, palm kernel oil, sugar, crisp rice, cocoa powder, non GMO glucose, sea salt, soy lecithin, milk powder, vanilla extract. Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamin A (0% DV), Vitamin C (0% DV), Calcium (6% DV), Iron (8% DV).Vitamin E (25% DV), Vitamin B1 (4% DV), Vitamin B2 (8% DV), Vitamin B3 (8% DV), Vitamin B6 (2% DV), Folate (4% DV), Phosphorus (10% DV), Magnesium (15% DV), Zinc (6%).<br /><br />> Serving Size: 1 Bar (40g)<br />> Calories: 200<br />> Fat Calories: 140<br />> Total Fat: 15g<br />> Saturated Fat: 3.5g<br />> Trans Fat: 0g<br />> Cholesterol: 0mg<br />> Sodium: 125mg<br />> Potassium: 210mg<br />> Total Carb: 16g<br />> Dietary Fiber: 7g<br />> Sugars: 5g<br />> Protein: 6g<br /><br />The Offer as Posted Here:<br /><br />At the time of this review, the title for this product is: "Free Sample of Kind Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar, 1.4 Ounce." It had shown up this way when I had done a quick search for sea salt, and it looked interesting with that title. But they weren't free, so I figured that I had just missed some special deal. They were being sold by Amazon LLC for $1.49 each at the time, with free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members, and since I've tried them before, picked up a couple of them.<br /><br />Now I see that the original Amazon deal is gone, and has been replaced by a third party offer. At the time of this review, they are being sold for "$1.59 + $5.95 Est. shipping" and available at an external website. That comes to $7.54 per bar. So much for the "free sample" being offered here.<br /><br />This deal reminded me of something else. Do you remember Vince Shlomi, also known as the "ShamWow Guy" and the one in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023SNDYC">Slap Chop</a> infomercials that we used to see? Television's fastest talker used his double entendre signature line "You're gonna love my nuts!" so often that people bought the product... often to their dismay. I like the KIND bars as noted above, but with the deal being currently offered here, it's reminiscent of that one from the "ShamWow Guy" a bit too much.<br /><br />There is another deal here on Amazon for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PE7ANY">KIND Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, 12-Count Bars</a> which is far better; just do the math, as it comes out quite reasonably if you want a dozen. They have been endorsed by Al Roker, Dr. Oz and other nutrition folks, but luckily we don't hear them saying "You're gonna love my nuts" on their television segments.<br /><br />9/23/2012

review/summary: Amazing Flavor!
review/text: I have already reviewed several of the flavors and gave them 5 stars.  My favorite has always been the Cranberry Almond but I think the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt is going to rapidly become my favorite.  I have an aversion to dark chocolate but liked the Dark Chocolate Peanut one pretty well so I went ahead and bought a box for those times I have a late afternoon sweet tooth at work.  I received the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt as a free sample with some Kashi oatmeal and again, didn't expect to like it because of the dark chocolate & the sea salt seemed odd to me. It is so incredibly delicious! The sea salt adds just the right contrast to the rest of the bar.  The only drawback - its hot outside and the chocolate became a serious melted mess in the wrapper by the time it ventured thru the heat to get to California.  Regardless, I got online and just ordered 2 boxes of the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt.  I highly recommend trying this one and I never would have without the free sample.
