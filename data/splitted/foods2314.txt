review/summary: mmmmmmfor chocolate lovers you gotta try this one
review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

review/text: Not only have i had just about everry brand of belgian chocolate this side of the atlantic, i have had this one several times.  But this seller sent bad chocolate. It has a powdery appearance and is very brittle to touch and taste.  Can't eat it at all.  And i guess i can't return it either.

review/summary: Gratification Times 10!
review/text: I treat myself to Chocolove at my local health food store once a month.  I am very conservative on how much sugar I have, so I make one bar last me a whole month.  Yes, it has real sugar, but it is so delightful for the amount of sugar that it has.  A taste of heaven.  I buy the 70% cacao and I am hooked! Seductive bliss!  One more thing, if you are in to dark chocolate, the taste is quite smooth, not bitter as some darks go.

review/text: This is the best chocolate bar I've ever tried.  The salty taste is in perfect balance with the chocolate.  I'm not the only one that thinks so, since our local grocery store sells out of this particular bar almost as soon as they arrive.  The other Chocolove bars are fine, but this one is tops.

review/summary: Excellent Dark Chocolate.
review/text: My husband and I occasionally enjoy a few pieces of dark chocolate in the evening and this chocolate is a real treat. It is hard to find such good chocolate at less than $3 per bar. We order a couple cases each fall and keep them in the freezer till we need a new bar. This is not bitter chocolate and just 1/6 (3 small squares) of a bar is only 80 calories and satisfies our desires for dark chocolate.

review/text: I first tried this at a small coffee shop and the memory of the taste haunted me until I found it on Amazon.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat in which to indulge, whether to forget your bad day or to reward yourself for a job well done. You can taste the real orange peel shavings in this chocolate and it is that perfect blend of dark chocolate and orange, which is the most divine combination.

You know, like buy bar A and then bar B and then eat 'em both.<br /><br />YEARS of doing this shamelessly has led me to become a regular purchaser of Chocolove's Pure Dark.  The 55% one.<br /><br />I don't care much for their other bars -- they're just so-so -- but DANG! the Pure Dark is crazy-good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Don't just buy this bar.  Buy this bar and then buy ten other chocolate bars.  It's in the name of science, it's okay.  Take all your bars, break them up, then try them all.<br /><br />Yeah, that chocolate that keeps evolving and coating your mouth with subtlety and wizardry?  That's this one.

review/summary: Temptation Natural
review/text: I was really reluctant to give these treats to my cat. It's really important to me that she eats a very healthy diet, and while I'm not doing the raw food diet, I do scrutinize labels for meat by-products, BHA, and useless fillers. With that said, my cat couldn't care less for those "healthy" treats that had passed my inspection. I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She's runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I'm about to give her one of her precious treats. I've also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand's regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients.

review/summary: It's a Miracle!!
review/text: I have 4 cats and finding a treat that all of them will eat has been impossible for years.  I decided to try these, and every cat, including the finickiest of the 4, LOVES these treats.  I give each cat 2 of the treats in the morning, and they gobble them up.<br /><br />I gave these 5 stars because they serve their purpose well, which is making my cats think they're getting something special every day.  Keep in mind, these are not as healthy as some of the high end treats that contain no meal or by-products, so I don't want to mislead anyone on the health value.  Moderation and coupled with a high quality food, these make a nice little treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I will try some of the other flavors in the All Natural line; however, the Free Range Chicken Flavor will always be in my cupboard.  If you try these, I hope your cat(s) enjoys them as much as mine do.

I can get him to do anything for a few of these!! He would probably even stand up and dance. He's crazy about them!!! It's not just a one time thing either, as I had to go back and buy a few more packages of them. He is so picky about everything else. They should advertise for Cats and Dogs also.

review/summary: My fat cat....
review/text: spoiled little sensitive stomach shelter kittie, begs for these when the bag is first opened because the outside IS crunchy and theinside is creamy. He carefully studies his little cache of 3 or 4 and nibbles each one slowly, savoring w his eyes closed. He dropped one and with a petulant mew jumped down from his chair and went searching for it. He 'talks' to himself all the time, mewing and grunting if things are out whack...he couldnt find his little nibble so I pointed to it and he snatched it up like a greedy little thing. These treats are so loved and comforting, given along with Pet-Ease Paw Gel which I use for anxiety. This little guy was a litter runt and caged alone when I was at the shelter. These huge blue eyes and the worst smelling coast-he was sick and it seemed the vets had given up. He's a roly poly muscle bound little smarty pants now at 6 yrs and these treats keep his coat shiny and the paw gel keep him calm...if frustrated or bored he will shred paper or find some clear manner to show his upset.

review/summary: Definitely gets the cat - and human - seal of approval
review/text: I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.

review/text: I have one cat who is addicted to these Temptation treats. Either the tuna of the salmon, I dont know what's in these little crunchy pillows, but he forsakes all food if he thinks there's any possibility I'll cave and slip him a few for being the cutest little meatball. His companion, a snooty long hair wont touch them and if he smells them on meatball's breath he gives him a swat for snacking between meals. So his coat seems very shiny, some months back he had flakiness which seemed to be dry skin, but the treats seem to have alleviated that. One thing I would caution is they're probably high in fat so offer them sparingly. (...right)

review/summary: It Really Works!!
review/text: I have osteoarthritis in one knee and it could use a  complete joint replacement. I take Glucosamine Chondrotin with Lubravite and MSN, Turmeric, Ginger, and Mobic (anti-inflammatory) for this but still had increasing pain in the joint for the last few months and was starting to get it in my other knee.<br /><br />I had used the Joint Comfort Tea for a few years and it worked well. I had no pain back then.But I used these other products also, so I wasn't sure which one helped the most.<br /><br /> Suddenly Whole Foods stopped carrying the tea. So I ordered it from Amazon for a three month supply. After that three month period, I was told Amazon was unable to obtain it!! I had a bad few months with increasing pain and discomfort, but didn't put two and two together about why!<br /><br />A few months later, they had it again and I got another three month supply. After 1 and 1/2 days of using this tea, my pain in both knees has just disappeared!! I have been pain free for a month now and am moving around much more.<br /><br /> I saw my orthopedic surgeon for the first time in 2 years last week. He said there is no reason to operate since my knee has not deteriorated at all in the 2 year span and especially, if I am not in pain now. He said when I am unable to straighten my knee completely and /or am in a lot of pain, then it's time to operate. So for now, I'm continuing my regimen and sipping that Joint Comfort Tea all day long!! Thanks Amazon for keeping me in supply - it means a lot to me!!

review/text: I bought this for my mom to help with her arthritis that she keeps complaining about and wouldn't you know that she did NOT want to take it.  (She likes pure chinese green tea better.)<br /><br />So I decided to take it myself since I had spent the money for it.  I HATE the spearmint & peppermint herbs (they remind me too much of the chewing gum and I wish yogi would take them out)-- Rooibos tea is my usual tea since it's sooo relaxing for my anxiety.  As far as taste, a lemon or orange flavored tea are more to my liking.  So I treated it like an iced tea and just got a large heat-proof container with a lid and into it using a large funnel, I combined:<br /><br />-1 bag of this tea with<br /><br />-1 bag of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATGHK">Davidson's Organic Tea South African Rooibos, 100-Count Tea Bags</a>  and<br /><br />-1 bag of a NON-HERBAL TEA (I love Tazo teas and tried them with this joint comfort tea, but there are too many yucky herbs like hibiscus and spearmint in Tazo teas which adds to the already bitter herbs in the joint comfort herbs, so something non-herbal is best like in Bigelow teas) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRJ4">Bigelow Lemon Lift Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(sometimes with a REAL lemon)<br /> (OR <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRHG">Bigelow Constant Comment Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O6W">Bigelow Raspberry Royale Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>)<br /><br />in boiling water and left them to steep and cool in the refrigerator in the morning and drank the cold tea in the afternoon/evenings and was able to tolerate it. (Sometimes I'll add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EKE68E">Heavenly Organics Organic Wild Forest Raw Honey Unheated -- 12 oz</a> to it when it has cooled down.)<br /><br />This tea CERTAINLY relieved MY joints.  I usually have a hard time stretching but after a week of drinking this tea, I felt almost like an athlete as far as my joints were concerned.  The yucca root extract, cat's claw bark extract (uncaria tomentosa alkaloids), and devil's claw root extract in it certainly help with relieving any joint pain.  Also, I notice that I have fewer allergy sneeze/running nose attacks that I usually have and fewer colds.<br /><br />It's an excellent tea if you want to relieve your joints and a great value for your money especially with Subscribe & Save.

review/text: I drink this tea on a daily basis.  I wouldn't say it's cured by joints by any means, but amazingly, it does take the edge off.  At first sip the taste didn't thrill me, but I've come to love the herbal blend in this tea.  Another bonus is that it is nice and soothing - helps with stress at work.  I order it in bulk from Amazon now because my health food store is always running out.

review/text: When my sister-in-law recommended this tea for my mom's arthritis I thought, "Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's going to help!"  Well, mom said it did help and so I decided to try it too.  I'm a skeptic but it DID work.  On those days when I almost can't stand up due to hip and back pain if I can make it to the kitchen to brew a cup of this tea I feel much better after drinking it.  It doesn't taste really great but I put some Splenda in it and it goes down easy.  It works well enough that I have started brewing about a quart at a time and holding it in the fridg 'till I need it.  Then all I have to do is heat it in the microwave.<br />Thank you Yogi for this helpful product.

review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

I will never ever buy this brand of food again. This formula is hard to find online right now - I'm not sure they are going to sell it again. Sorry my dogs were guinea pig test subjects yet again for the dog food industry.

review/summary: Yummm!  Great Sarsaparilla
review/text: Arrived in just a few days.  I have a Soda Stream and do not care the Soda-Stream Syrups.  I found this Sarsaparilla Syrup while looking for alternatives.<br />Recipe for Sarsaparilla in the Soda Stream: Fill water up to the fill line of the Soda Stream bottle and carbonate the water as you would for any soda.  Using a measuring cup, remove 4 ounces of the carbonated water and discard. Measure 5 ounces of the Fee Brothers Sarsaparilla syrup, and slowly pour into the Soda Stream bottle. I always tilt the bottle so the water does not fizz up when the syrup hits.  Screw on the Soda Stream bottle cap and gently mix up.  I think the Sarsaparilla tastes best when refrigerated and served over ice!

review/text: I enjoy pancakes, but when I began to adopt new ways of eating - I began to search for a "healthy" pancake mix. This pancake mix sealed the deal once I tried this product. In doing so, my daily intake of fiber begins bright and early in the morning. One thing I would recommend, or at least I like each morning when I cook fiber one pancakes, is that you put one pack of Truvia when you mix up the recommended 1/2 cup. If this is done, your pancakes will not only have the already great taste, but it makes that great taste delicious.

Shipping was very fast - got it in two days.  My local grocery store was stocked out of this for a while.<br /><br />The taste is kind of bland and the texture is not as fluffy as I hoped for, so I substituted the oil with eggs (1 egg for 2 tbsp oils) or egg whites (1:1 volume substitution) and added a pack of Truvia no calory sweetner (which you can buy off Amazon with great price).  It turns out much tastier and healthier.  Also, the milk and added fiber may cause a lot of gas, so if your body is sensitive to such ingredients, be cautious about it.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a good product and I would buy again.

review/text: We love pancakes but, let's face it, they're not the healthiest thing for you to eat.  These we can eat guilt-free!  They are very tender and, of course, extremely easy to prepare since you just add water.  For awhile I added blueberries to the batter and those were good, until one day I forgot to add them so I put the blueberries in a saucepan with a little bit of sugar substitute and water and simmered them till they burst.  This was much better since the pancakes cooked through with less time on the griddle and ended up much tenderer than when putting the fruit in the batter.<br /><br />It has become increasingly difficult for me to find this product on the grocery store shelves, so I was quite happy to find it available here on Amazon.  Amazing service!

review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

review/text: These crackers are a great way to get whole wheat into your diet & into children's.  They are low in fat & sugar, and they taste great.  I haven't met a child yet who doesn't like them.  The ingredients are good as well.

review/text: 1.  I love  Amazon's grocery/makeup/cleaning products subscription service.  It is only beta now, but I truly hope they will continue it.<br /><br />2.  This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/text: These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies.

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/summary: Bahlsen Dark Chocolate Cookies -  A Treat
review/text: I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin "chocolate vehicle"--i.e., cookie.
