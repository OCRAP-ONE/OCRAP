My spouse, who won't touch any other 'diet food', loves these!

review/text: I ordered these chips after buying a bag of lentil chips at a store and wanted more without going to the store all the time and found these on Amazon. I love the taste and crunchiness of it and its a healthy version of chips with protein which would leave you feeling satisfied instead of craving more. The cracked pepper has a slightly sweet hint which I find interesting and took a bit to get used to. I would buy again, its too bad you can't subscribe.

review/summary: Good alternative to higher caloric chips
review/text: Saw these chips on Dr. Oz as an alternative to potato chips.  These chips work for me, but not my husband.  The chips have a light flavor, are crunchy and have a puffed texture.  I have just ordered my 2nd box of the 1 oz size to control my portion size because  I don't trust myself to stop eating before the bag is empty.  I hope this becomes a regular Amazon item that I can subscribe to and get Super Saver Delivery.  Perhaps Dr. Oz  should get a percentage for all the items and books that he introduces on his show that I end up buying on Amazon!

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: We discovered these as one of the snacks sent by a diet my husband was on.  They're good enough we then looked them up ourselves.  They're cheaper per ounce in the larger bags, but the 1oz bags are great for potion control.  All three flavors available on Amazon are delicious; my husband's favorite is the cracked pepper.  The rosemary is a reasonably strong taste, so I would recommend liking rosemary if you order it.<br /><br />I make fat free 'hummus' to serve with them (no sesame/tahini or olive oil, so it's not quite traditional, but that's necessary to cut the fat).  I just throw a can of chickpeas, juice from a lemon, salt, a handful of fresh cilantro, and varied roasted peppers & garlic in to the blender, until it's all mashed up good.  Delicious combination.<br /><br />I wish these were available on subscribe and save, since we would, in a heartbeat.

review/text: I tried this brand after having a successful experience with the 'Simple 7' brand and they didn't measure up. The baked chips are bland and they are coated in a film that changes their texture. They are to thick and just do not satisfy chip-craving. As the calorie in take is identical to that of the 'Simple 7' brand I'll stick with the latter, which is amazing.

And not only do these fit the bill, they are delicious!  Are light, low calorie, and absolutely yummy!  Great, great chips!<br />And an entire bag is only something like 100 calories!  Wonderful.  I think these may actually be the "perfect chip!".  Have salt, but just the right amount.  Whoever dreamed these up, did a great job and I am grateful, and grateful to Amazon for carrying them.

review/summary: I've been getting these for years...
review/text: My vet recommended these treats several years ago as a healthier alternative to the treats sold in supermarkets (like the treats shaped like fake bacon, sausages, steaks, etc). My dog LOVES these treats, probably more than she ever like the fake bacon variety of treat. She's not usually bribable, but these seem to do the trick. The only drawback to these treats from my point of view is that they're only available at the vet's office, so I'm thrilled to find them here online.<br /><br />Just a note about one of the other reviews I read: I purchased 4 packages of these at a time at roughly $1.30 per package, and the shipping was still only $5 for all 4 packs. So, even with shipping, the per-unit cost is around $2.50 (which is better than the $5 I was paying at the vet). And I don't think the package is misleading- I've only found these treats in 1 size, and they all have the same picture of a dalmation on the front.<br /><br />Finally, people have mentioned that these could be used to give pills. I think they're probably a little small for hiding pills (unless you're trying to give a 1/2 or 1/4 tab of a VERY small pill). If hiding pills is what you're going for, you'd be better off getting pill pockets (small, cup-shaped treats that you can mold around a pill or capsule).

review/summary: Be aware of treat size and excessive shipping costs
review/text: These Lean Treats were initially recommended by my vet. I have a large dog, and the larger-sized treats, which I purchased for $6 (12 oz)  from my vet, are large enough to hide pills in, and also to tear into smaller pieces for training. I ordered these treats as replacements, thinking I was getting a bargain. HOWEVER the shipping cost was over $6 for a 4 oz pkg!!!! The pkg contents were not accurately described, as the size of the treats were appropriate for tiny dogs like chihuahuas. The pkg image is blurred, it shows a large dog, a dalmatian, and so further misleads the consumer. So, while the treats are great, the images and the descriptions need to be clarified. I won't order online again until this is cleared up. Perhaps if there were actual size pictures of the treats, that might help.

review/summary: Very pleased!
review/text: I purchased these little gems last week on a whim, after researching the history of the Abbaye de Flavigny. They have been making these candies since the year 1591! Anise is an acquired taste, I think, akin to a delicate licorice, and those who enjoy it will absolutely love these anise drops. A fact I found quite interesting is that it takes fifteen days to make just one of these candies!<br /><br />Each candy is roughly the size of a medium pearl, with a pleasantly smooth texture. They are not meant to be chewed, (the word "jaw-breaker" comes to mind!) but savored. The taste is exquisite: strong but not overpowering, herbal and sweet. At the heart of each drop is an anise seed, the texture of which contrasts beautifully with the hardness of the candy surrounding it. Very refreshing.<br /><br />I am so glad that I stumbled upon these! They are a real treasure in a world where artificial flavorings and chemical-based sweeteners are the norm. There is something quite special about these Anise Drops from Abbaye de Flavigny.<br /><br />As for the seller, Touch of Europe, I couldn't be happier with their service. My package arrived quickly, (two days before the estimated arrival time!) wrapped safely, and included a hand-signed letter thanking me for my business, which I thought was a nice touch.

review/text: My first thought when opening a pack of these...was wow! They have MUCH more filled then the classic ones do, and even more than like "Double Stuff" oreos do.<br /><br />The cookie its self has a unique flavor that I can best describe as a sweet buttery shortbread type flavor. It's definitely not one of those cookies where you take them apart to get to the filling, and forget about the cookies lol. They are fantastic, and CERTAINLY worth a try if you have never had them. I am a huge chocolate fan, but not usually too big on sweets. But these have and always will be a classic and my favorite.<br /><br />Pros: Everything.<br />Cons: I can eat a whole pack by myself. I blame Keebler fully for this.

review/text: There ain't really a whole lot to say about these things but I still wrote a review that I hope others may find helpful just in case they have a need for these things. I bought these ingredients because I always cook Tom Yum Soup specifically the tom yum seafood. I am from Asia and I love to cook and I would rather use the organic ingredients rather than the ready mix flavor. My husband is American and he loves Tom Yum. I brought some of these when I went back to Asia last December but I already ran out so I had to buy some.<br /><br />  When I received these product, they were in an excellent condition. Considering that these are perishables, I got them still fresh and got them the way the seller had described/advertised them. The packaging was neat and was absolutely done carefully. The price for me is reasonable because you just cannot find these stuff in some groceries at least here in Texas. Nice doing business with the seller. So over all rating, I give both the seller and the product a 5-star rating.

I was skeptical about ordering produce in this fashion, but the other positive reviews and my desire for the ingredients won out. I'm so glad I took the chance! :)<br /><br />My order arrived two days before the earliest delivery estimate. In the high-90s heat we've been having right now, that makes a big difference, as did the fact that it was very well packed and obviously very fresh produce to begin with. The items were of excellent quality and generous portions. I can make an insane amount of Tom Yum soup now and have enough left over to throw together some other delicious dishes.<br /><br />Give it a try. I think you too will be very pleased! :)

They contain a variety of fillings, probably not everything Koppers makes, but a nice sampling (dried fruit, cordials, nuts, hard candy). Also be aware, they do not all have chocolate inside; some are candy coating all the way down to the filling. Better be VERY confident in your dental work before you bite! This is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Actually kind of fun...not knowing what's inside. A nice introduction to Koppers products.

review/text: I have not truly sampled all the different types of chocolate in this five pound bag, but most of them are very good.  My favorites are the malted milk and the coffee flavors.  Some of the fruit flavors are nice as well, but the mint chocolate is awful, and hard to get the taste out of you mouth.  The dried fruit is good, but some were a bit sour for my taste, but my mom loves dried fruit and she really enjoyed the chocolate covered fruits the most.  The nuts I don't like at all, I have been eating the chocolate around the nut and throwing the nuts away.  If you like nuts there is a good variety, from small pearl size to giant almonds.  The chocolate itself is smooth and delicious, very well made.  I don't really like playing guess the candy, I wish there was a way to identify the candy before taking a bite.  If love all types of candy you will enjoy this mix, if you are picky stay away.

I was aware that it was manufactured in a facility that has nuts, but the description does it clearly state that these candies have various centers such as nuts, fruits and other things.  I used these for a children's gingerbread house decorating party, and there were kids that had nut allergies in attendance!  Thankfully, all went well, but it is outrageous that Koppers does not clearly describe this product. Although not the tastiest candy, the overall quality was good, not great.

Great on fish, twice baked ravioli and chicken to name a few. I have also used the crumbs in yogurt and on salads for a little extra crunch. Highly recommended!

review/text: The only mint I taste is natural flavor, that's not mint. What's up with sugar and honey in it too. This make it too sweet. If I want sweet, I'll get the Southern style tea. Try some organic mint for a change and see the different.

review/summary: Not your children's grape drink
review/text: This is not an over-the-top sugary drink mix like Kool-Aid, as others pointed out it is on the sour side.  While not what I was expecting at first I still find it to be a refreshing mix.  I have just received my second "Subscribe and Save" shipment of this the other week shortly before Amazon removed it from that service.  In the first shipment I had received there were a number of packets where the powder had solidified a bit as another reviewer reported.  I think I calculated about 18-20% of the packets in that shipment had that problem.  The only issue this gave me was getting the mix out of the packet; some alternate squeezing of the packet would break up the chunk enough to drop out into my water bottle.  It took a little longer to dissolve but then was fine.  In the most recent shipment all packets felt and sounded to be in loose powder form.  The only other complaint I have is that the packets never seemed to tear open well.  As a result I find it easier to cut them open with scissors, not a problem for me as I drink these in my office cubicle.  When this shipment runs out I intend to order a restock, hopefully it is available again at the SnS discount.

review/text: The shipping from Amazon was great as usual.  However the product I received was not.  These truffles were almost past the expiration date and obviously had be stored in a non-climate controlled place.  The chocolate had been melted and the peanut butter nugat inside had melted down to blob in the bottom of the sphere.  These truffles were not a bargin at the price I paid for them. I will buy my next ones locally where I can be assured they will be what I am paying for and not something somebody is trying to get rid of.

review/summary: Melted chocolate
review/text: I received my first box and when I opened it the chocolate had been melted. It was no longer smooth and creamy as Lindt truffles usually are. The weather had been cold and I accepted the package directly from the post women so I assumed it had arrived that way. I called Amazon and they gave me a replacement box which arrived in 2 days. Unfortunately it had also been melted and at that point I just gave up. I have two boxes of yucky chocolate.  I'm assuming that they melted while they sat around at amazon or Lindt provided a sub par product.  Do not order these. Buy them somewhere where you can inspect them first.

review/text: This is my third order of this pickled ginger.  After trying another brand sold here, I almost passed on this ginger.<br /><br />The pros:<br />+  This ginger is sliced thinly & there are no large pieces that need to cut before you can eat it.  I use my ginger on my tossed salad to add a bit of kick & sweetness to the dressing.<br />+  The flavor is smooth, sweet, slightly hot, but not overwhelming & there's no unpleasant aftertaste.<br />+  The shipment arrives very quickly & is very well packed. :)<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  This ginger is a bit on the expensive side, but in my opinion, well worth the extra cost.

review/summary: Comparing Velveeta pasta and cheese mixes
review/text: There are two Velveeta pasta and cheese dinners. This one, and Kraft Velveeta Original Shells & Cheese, 12 oz. They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.<br /><br />But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.<br /><br />Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides. It's much better than the broccoli version... and way more yummy (if more expensive) than the regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HUI0">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>.

review/text: I came across this product in the store in the form of those little 2oz cups that Easy mac comes in (I don't know if it's 2 oz exactly but it's the small single serving cups that you can put in the microwave). I liked it so much I came to my best friend Amazon to see if I could buy more and was pleasantly surprised when I found that you could buy it in the larger size. Obviously there are no health benefits and the broccoli comes dried in a little packet so there's not much to be expected, but if you like Velveeta and broccoli give this a try! I love it. It's quick and easy and difficult to find in a store so this is the place to get it. It's everything you love about traditional Velveeta with the fun twisty rotini pasta and broccoli parts. Very happy.

I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!

review/text: The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not "loose" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.

review/text: I love Jack Links Beef Steaks. These have a wonderful flavor with just the right blend of spices and hickory flavoring. I have trouble eating just one. It makes a great snack anytime. Before letting my grandkids know I have some, I make sure I hide a few first. Kids love them too.

review/text: When I bought this item the first time, I was happy then I "subscribed and saved". What a waste! Once they have their hooks in you, they give you the bottom of the barrel. I even gave them a second try the next month and they were all moldy AGAIN. Terrible company. "Subscribe and save" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers. Shame on Jack Links. Pathetic.

Since then, they either have mold or have been so hard that I cannot take a first bite through it (sidenote: I am an avid carnivore). They need to step up their quality control before selling this.

review/text: After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day.

review/summary: Good snack!
review/text: Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the "chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)

It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it.

Sometimes they are a little tougher than others, but it's not so bad you'll rip your teeth out eating them.

review/summary: Best Jerky / Beef Steak! Best to buy it from Amazon!!
review/text: I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!

review/summary: Less Additives than other Packaged Jerky
review/text: It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store.

They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a "Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box.

review/summary: Thick and chewy, not traditional jerky but delicious nonetheless
review/text: I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label "Beef Steak" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these "beef steaks" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless.

It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!
