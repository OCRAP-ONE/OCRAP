review/summary: Simple. Tasteful, Great for Outings, Baby and Toddler Approved, Yum!
review/text: These pouches are very handy and a delicious item for baby. My toddler is 22 months and still loves these. We have tried in other brands and flavors, but after having received a box of these to try  out she has found her new favorite. She seeks theses out, knows where we hide them and definitely loves them. Best of all, mommy loves them too. They are very handy with traveling, just toss a pouch in your diaper bag and go. You don't need a spoon for these either, very easy opening, that babies and toddlers seem to enjoy eating out of. We had our neighbors try them, ages 3 and 11 months and the kids wanted more. 3 for 3, we definitely recommend them.<br /><br />Ingredients are simple - Organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid, organic lemon juice concentrate

review/summary: Baby loves it, simple to use, lasts 24 hours after opening
review/text: Not sure if it was the baby's mood, but whenever we feed her this food, she eats every last drop - loves it.  The food combinations chosen for baby foods boggle me.  Juicy Pear and Garden Greens just don't seem like a palatable combination, but it's a winner.  As with other pouch foods, this lasts 24 hours after opening when refrigerated.<br /><br />My only complaint - the pouches are just placed in a box - no padding, etc. Of the two boxes, one pouch had opened up and partially drained into the box. It had the inevitable rotten vegetable smell when opening.  Tossed out the open pack, checked the rest. Washed them all of the sticky, greenish mess.<br /><br />So if you order a couple of boxes, open then up and inspect for leaks!

review/summary: Sneaky mom used this to add nutrition into the diet of a picky eater.
review/text: I chose to try this product not because I have an infant, but because my pediatrician recommended it to help my picky 7-year-old get a more balanced diet.  The puree is supposed to be added to things such as spaghetti sauce and smoothies.<br /><br />The first pouch I actually tried myself-just to see what I was up against.  I thought it tasted pretty good. The first taste was a bit "green" but then I could taste the pears.  So, since they come in a cute pouch (and my son LOVES yougurt and applesauce that come in pouches), I thought I'd give it shot.  Open, taste, spit. No-go straight out of the pouch.<br /><br />I've since added it to smoothies, pancake mix, and oatmeal.  He was unable to detect it in any of those. Tonight, I'm trying it in the spaghetti sauce.  If it works, I will try some of the other flavor combinations in recipies.<br /><br />For the purpose that I used this for, I give it 4-stars. It would have gained a 5th if my son would have liked the taste straight out of the pouch.

review/summary: Finally, an impressive organic baby food product
review/text: This product is one of those products that just cause you to say Wow and finally.  We have tried very hard to feed our children organic products after a major medical scare doctors traced to hormones found in non-organic milk. Anyone who has ever gone down this route will testify to 1) how difficult it can be and 2) how expensive it can be. This product makes it a little easier.  You also need to be concerned with truth in advertising as the organic market is still self-regulated (an analogy would be the real -estate industry and the classic Realtor symbol, which is largely self-regulated).  Look up Organic Consumer's Association for more information.<br /><br />Before I continue my review, many people will complain about the natural sugar contained in the pear or banana. That is true.  However,as I said before, it is a difficult road to go down and you have to be practical.  It is completely unrealistic to expect to find the perfect organic baby food your child will eat- even if you created it yourself. You have to find the balance you are comfortable with, so don't sweat it as you go down the this road.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1(6 Months+) Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> is a product that is easily handled and dispensed- thus making it invaluable for traveling.  WARNING-  Keep the cap away from children however.  It could be a choking hazard. If you are on the raod, the contents dispense in a less messy manner than similar products.  Must have something to do with the thickness of the non-recyclable BPA FREE container.  It works out well however, because it produces less mess yet allows a child to still self-dispense the contents.  Each package provides 2 servings so be sure to double the nutritional information if your child eats the entire package.  The product does not require refrigeration, dispenses easily, seals easily, and fits nearly anywhere. The ingredients in this product are all based on real food products and does not "source" other products that are based on soy (such as DHA sometimes added to baby food on the pretense that it enhances brain development).  Many will complain about the high carbs and low protein count.  However, the only proven perfect food for babies up to 18 months is human mothers milk with an increasing need for protein as the child develops (my wife elected to breast feed our children for 2 years).  Clearly carbs are a major societal issue but I am out of my realm to realistically suggest a solution. I am just trying to strike a solid balance for my children.  In that regard, and comparatively, this product provides an ample solution when balanced with organic protein sources.<br /><br />Our children both loved the taste of the product as did we.

review/summary: great for eating on the go...
review/text: I prefer glass jars for my kids because I'm not a huge fans of them eating from plastic so much. But I understand that there are times that you need a meal on the go with minimal mess. This seems perfect for that situation. And I feel that the company is doing as much as they can to make it a safe product with these pouch things being bpa free and all.<br /><br />My only complaint is that one pouch leaked in shipping. It didn't leak too much, but that makes me hesitent to order more off amazon. I know that amazon would replace any that leak, but I don't like hassel in ordering online.<br /><br />I feel the review is for the product, and this stuff is great! I tasted it and it tastes very close to applesause but not as sweet. I do like the container design and my youngun is able to eat it by herself with just a bit of me helping to squeeze.<br /><br />It may sound probably dumb to give a great review with all the qualifiers (bad plastic, leaking product), but we really do like them. I would definately suggest them.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: I originally got these for my 11-month-old, but my 2.5 year old begged to try one and so I gave in. They were a hit with both of my kiddos. I like that they are made of organic ingredients and seem to be a decent size pouch (bigger than some other ones that I've found at the grocery store). I tasted it myself and it tasted a bit like a green smoothie, you could taste the veggies, but it was definitely sweet and tasty. It got five stars from this family. :-)

review/summary: Good alternative to the homeade stuff
review/text: The ingredients are: pear, broccolli, spinache, lemon juice, and Vitamin C (absorbic acid).<br /><br />That's pretty much what I put in his homeade purees, except the absorbic acid, which is a perfectly safe ingredient.  My 8 month old loves this stuff.  And it's green, which is awesome.<br /><br />And I love the pouch.  It makes it really easy to have on the go -- you can squeeze out just enough to put on a spoon (or my finger when I'm in a pinch), and the spout is safer than a jar because there's less room for contaminants to get in.<br /><br />And I've tasted it myself -- it tastes good!  I mean, I'm not personally going to snack on it, but it tastes like what it is -- broccolli, spinach, and pear, and all those are pretty good-tasting foods.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Tasty, convenient, and not too messy
review/text: I tasted these before I handed them over to the littles.  The pear really does "overpower" the brocolli, but the veggie taste is just underneath.<br /><br />What I Like:<br />Easy to take along<br />Requires no refrigeration<br />Texture just like applesauce, so it's not "weird"<br />The "spout" is the only hard part, so it's not terrifying if your kid walks around with this thing hangin' out of his/her mouth<br /><br />What I Don't Like:<br />Baby / Toddler can get overzealous and SQUEEZE a mess rather quickly<br /><br />Mess factor isn't a deal breaker for me - it's baby food, after all!  I think these are pretty cool for picnics, beach days, and whatever else you might need a cooler or picnic basket for!  They're also probably a great pick-me-up for low blood sugar if you don't have anything handy but the diaper bag!

review/summary: Veggies for dessert
review/text: I am impressed that the flavor of spinach & broccoli is as mild as it is considering pears are the only fruit added (though pears are listed first in the ingredients).  This is a much more pleasant way to sneak in some greens!  I did notice that some pkgs. seem to have a stronger spinach flavor & taste less sweet than other pkgs. of the same case.<br /><br />Green veggies are never a big hit so it was nice to find something that is well tolerated!  Some brands are down right awful, as I'm sure you know.<br /><br />I really prefer glass but the portability of the pouches can't be beat!  I love how convenient they are & the variety keeps expanding.  So perfect when I need to grab & go.  Jars for home.  Pouches for travel.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more Baby Gourmet flavors.

review/summary: Yummy Goodness For Precious Consumers
review/text: My darling little daughter just turned six months and received the okay from the pediatrician to start eating solid foods.  Baby Gourmet's Juicy Pear & Garden Greens puree was her first taste at something other than breast milk and rice cereal, and did she ever love it!<br /><br />These purees are great first foods for babies.  They are easy to swallow and easy on the digestive system.  My daughter absolutely loved the taste and was constantly reaching out for the spoon between bites!<br /><br />I, too, tried the Baby Gourmet food, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste.  It had the perfect amount of pear to sweeten the vegetable taste without making a child too accustomed to a sugary taste.  In addition to its yumminess, I had peace of mind giving my daughter a product free of chemical additives, pesticides, and fertilizers.  Being that she is my first child, I only want the best for her, and I believe Baby Gourmet is amongst the best in baby foods.

review/text: Our granddaughter is 10 months old and so I got these for her as her parents are really into organic foods.  Our daughter has been feeding her these now for a couple of weeks and they are just about gone!  It turns out that not only does she like the taste of them but also the pouch has an opening that makes it easy if they are on the road or at someone else's house without a baby spoon to feed her by squeezing the package and the puree comes out easily through the opening.  A great buy and a terrific product.  Our daughter plans to buy more herself!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great for On-the-Go
review/text: Judging from how my grandson didn't take his eyes off the spoon (since we served this sample at home using a small dish) from the minute he tasted this combination, he obviously would rank it as five stars for taste.  There is no doubt that it is made of first quality ingredients, so five stars for that, as well.<br /><br />So why four stars?  Just judging from the competition, it is seriously over-priced.  This is not the only brand of organic baby food on the market.  While I can't compare its taste to the other equally high quality brands since my daughter-in-law makes the majority of his food from scratch, this seems to rank as the costliest.  On the other hand, the convenience of its packaging makes it ideal for long trips or outings.<br /><br />So, five stars for quality, taste and packaging, minus one for price.

review/summary: My baby loves these!
review/text: Obviously most parents know the advantage of having vegetables mixed in with fruits for babies that tend to be a bit picky.  My daughter hasn't responded any differently to this mixed into her morning cereal than she did with fruit alone, so that tells me that the flavor must be appealing.  I appreciate the fact that you can see the flecks of greens in the product as well, it comes much closer to the homemade purees my wife has made.  The price of these is a bit higher per ounce than some of the other pouches, like Plum Organics, but it's still not bad considering how much food you get in the Amazon package.  This has been a hit in our home and I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors!

review/text: I know this was intended for babies/toddlers but it's good for preschoolers too! I wanted to see if my 3 year old son would enjoy it and he does! I pack in his lunchbox with his favorite organic Peanut Butter Sandwhich and a fruit or baby carrots. We pack it along as we go to long hikes, outings or preschool and he gulps it up! I sampled a bit and it's not overly sweet but just the right amount of flavor and full of nutrition for growing minds. Much better than a juice box! But just in-case they get extra thirsty it's always a good idea to have purified water nearby =)

review/summary: Siberia and Small-Town Hoosier votes 2 thumbs up
review/text: Organic is huge if baby's health is key. Ixnay on chemicals. Natural foods for the best of growing starts. Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear & Garden Greens has a mix of 2 fruits and 2 veggies: Organic Pear, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate, Organic Broccoli, & Organic Spinach. A wellness start in baby food.<br />BUT WILL BABY EAT IT?<br /><br />Grandson Frank gave it the test with consent and assistance from his mom. Frank is half Russian, half American. A cold war free opinion from a 7-month-old objective tester. He has his way of expressing his likes/dislikes, piercingly. Nyet, robustly.<br /><br />Frank tried juicy pear with greens and ate it with a "Mmmmmmmmmm" and no mess, then after having finished it he said: "ammm...ooo...uh..." I guess it was his opinion of it, so you can interpret it as you wish. To me it seemed he was saying something like "Taste's like chicken" or "Mmmore mmamma mmore gooood fruit and veggies." That's when Frank got a little possessive and demanded the other eleven easy-open recap-able pouches be saved for his grandparent visits. Being a pushover grandparent, I agreed, me being a pineapple-green beans fan anyway.<br /><br />I did notice the nutrition facts. Due to health I personally must watch things like fats, trans fats, & sodium. ZEROg for each of these. To heart-healthy watchers that means perfect. Plus 70% Daily requirements of vit.C, 2g fiber and 25% of vit.A in just a half pouch. Frank's a big eater, like his PaPa, and ate the whole pouch, not a drop missed, spit, or blown.<br />HE LIKES IT, FRANKIE LIKES IT!<br /><br />Like milk, the cost is a bit higher compared to non-organic foods on the shelf, so since the taste and nutrition value is confirmed, it boils down to what the budget allows and "is your child worth the extra?"

review/summary: My toddler loves these pouches....
review/text: My 22 month old toddler absolutely loves the pouches of baby/toddler food.  I have bought her the fruit flavors of several different brands in the past.  When I read the ingredient list on these (organic pears, broccoli, and spinach), I was rather doubtful that she would like the taste.  To my surprise, she seems to prefer these over the sweeter berry flavored pouches that we also have right now.<br /><br />The pouches are very convenient to keep in the diaper bag, and are a good snack for when we are out of the house.  My daughter prefers them cold from the refrigerator, but will also eat them at room temperature.  They only require refrigeration if they have already been opened.  For a younger baby, you can squeeze the food directly onto a spoon.  My toddler likes to suck the food out of the pouch.<br /><br />My only complaint about the pouches is the high price.  In all fairness though, the competing brands are about the same cost.

review/summary: Organically Pleasing
review/text: This uniquely packaged baby food has a lot going for it, not the least of which is its organic cachet. With no sweeteners, fillers or salt added , a parent can be assured of pure and wholesome ingredients. The pliable, metallic container is quite unique with its plastic spout and lid. No need to worry about breakage when dropping the baby food, though bursting can occur to an errantly stepped on package.<br /><br />We like that the Baby Gourmet food is easily transporable and that any left over food may be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Other foods have a longer after opening lives and longer shelf lives also. Our shipment of Baby Gourmet reaches its expiration date five months after we received it. That should be no problem because it'll easily all be gone within a month.<br /><br />But what about taste and satisfaction? Our grandson loved this food from the first spoonful and ate it eagerly. Subsequent feedings have produced the same positive response. Our daughter let Gabe chew on the spout for a minute while she held the food "bag"; this was great fun for Gabe but not a practice I'd recommend. To feed Gabe the Baby Gourmet food, we screw off the plastic lid and squeeze the food into a bowl or empty baby food jar. Our 8-month-old charmer readily finishes off the entire containerful in one setting.<br /><br />There are only a couple negatives for me with this product. One is the cost which may fall in time. The other is the packaging itself which as others have mentioned doesn't appear to be recyclable. When our grandson visits, Mrs. Spudman and I like to stock up on the recyclable glass baby jars that come in handy for all sorts of projects and storage of tiny objects.<br /><br />The Baby Gourmet foods are a product of Canada.

review/summary: My daughters absolutely love these!
review/text: I have two daughters, one is 2.5 years old and the other is 13 months old and they have absolutely loved the Baby Gourmet Organic Juicy Pear and Garden Greens flavor.  Both of my daughters tend to be picky eaters in that they won't eat the same thing at back to back meals, but they constantly demanded these for breakfast, dinner, and lunch.  The squeeze pack was suitably sized for a meal, and the offset valve (rather than being directly in the center) allowed both of my daughters to feed themselves.  I've tried a number of similar products on the market, but have yet to find one that my daughters enjoyed as much as this particular flavor.<br /><br />I will admit that the price seems high, but compared to other offerings and in looking at the weight to price value, I find these to be comparable to other brands on the market.<br /><br />Also we had less incidents of messes with the Baby Gourmet Organic packaging because my daughters couldn't open it on their own and because the product didn't squeeze out as easily when they grasped the package (which has been my experience with other brands).

review/summary: Gourmet "organic" baby food at a premium price.
review/text: The current catch phrase among baby foods is "organic".  Unless one actually harvests and purees organically grown fruits and vegetables directly from a garden, all manufactured, processed, and packaged baby foods can't be considered truly organic.  Baby Gourmet has provided consumers with a good selection of "organic" baby foods that's worth a try.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Easy to use pouches; just remove cap then squeeze and feed.<br />>Package claims no artificial ingredients, unsalted, and unsweetened.<br />>Gluten and nut free (for babies that are allergic).<br />>BPA Free packaging (safer for babies).<br />>Our 13 months old baby really liked the "Juicy Pear and Garden Greens" puree and gulped it down unassisted.<br />>Provides good source of Vitamin C (140% DV).<br />>Good selection of different fruits and vegetables packs made for babies from 6 months+ to 8 months+.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Parent supervision always necessary or the baby may make a mess and squeeze the puree out everywhere.<br />>Don't leave the cap around the baby; potential choking hazard!<br />>Premium price at $0.51 per ounce.compared to what we've also tried: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SIAR08">Organic Baby Organic Summer vegetable ( 24x4 OZ)</a> at 0.18 per ounce.  However, Amazon does offer a great subscription service that lowers the Baby Gourmet price to 0.43 per ounce.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Premium organic baby food comes at a premium price.  Well worth it if one's baby likes eating it.

review/summary: Convenient, Healthy, Delicious!
review/text: I was really excited to get these because I've seen babies sucking on these pouches around town.  Now that my baby's eating solids, I wanted to see what all the rage is.  I love them for many reasons!<br /><br />-First, they're ORGANIC,  no fillers added.<br /><br />-Second, they TASTE GOOD (of course I tasted!). What's more is my baby loves it more than any food he's tried so far.  He couldn't get enough.<br /><br />-NUTRITIOUS:  Baby gets his greens--broccoli and spinach--mixed with sweet pears.  You can actually see the green flecks of goodness.<br /><br />-TEXTURE:  Fruits and veggies are well-pureed, perfect for stage 1.<br /><br />-3 WAYS TO FEED: 1-Squeeze into bowl and spoon feed, 2-Squeeze directly onto spoon, 3-Squeeze into baby's mouth or let baby suck it out through plastic tube.<br />For the first serving, I mostly spoon fed my baby, but once I let him suck on it, he wanted to keep sucking it down.<br /><br />-QUANTITY: There's a lot of food in there!  2 servings per pouch, 4.5 oz pouches<br /><br />-CONVENIENT:  Of course it's convenient because you can feed your baby nutritious, organic food without dirtying even one dish or utensil.  Convenient because you can feed on the go.  Convenient because the cap twists back on so you can save the rest for later...<br /><br />-The one DRAWBACK would have to be the PRICE.  These are pretty expensive for a pouch of food.  But it is organic, and for now, I expect to pay more for that.<br /><br />I'm sold on these, but because of the price, for me, these will be a "sometimes" food bought for convenience and travel.  In fact I plan on taking these on vacation with me so I can feed my baby in his stroller, on the run. I'm actually excited to give it a try!<br /><br />And by the way, after I'm done here, I'll be searching to see what other varieties Baby Gourmet offers...<br /><br />Happy feeding!

review/summary: So delicious that even my 1 year old enjoys it!
review/text: I don't have an infant right now, but I still decided to give these Baby Gourmet Purees a try.  I did literally eat a couple bites myself.  The pear flavor was definitely stronger than the flavor of the greens, but I could tell there were greens in there.  I wasn't sure if my 1 year old daughter would like it or not, but I gave her a bite anyway.  She wanted another bite, and another, and another.  Then she grabbed the pouch and sucked the puree right out of the straw itself.  I guess that means she liked it!  And if a one year old whose been eating flavorful table foods for months will eat it, then a 6 month old will definitely enjoy it.<br /><br />Even though this baby food is pureed, thin enough for a baby just beginning to eat, I like that I could actually SEE flecks of green in it.  I could see that it had garden greens in it, which definitely made me feel like it was a healthier and more natural baby food choice.  As your baby grows, you can stir in a baby cereal to thicken the puree.<br /><br />I'm not sure why it's in a pouch rather than a jar or a plastic container, but I like it.  The twist-on cap can re-seal the pouch after you pour out exactly as much as you need.  Then it can be stored in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve more to your baby.  I'm sure they don't want you to allow your toddler to suck on the straw-like spout, and I'm sure it introduces germs into the rest of the food if you do that.  So, just because I let my toddler do that, doesn't mean it's the smartest way to handle this baby food.  The pouch should be easier to transport in a diaper bag than a glass jar and should seal better than the flimsy plastic containers with click-on lids.<br /><br />So from myself, my one year, and my friend's 9 month old ... we definitely recommend the Baby Gourmet Stage 1 baby foods.

All in all a great  making it easy to get greens in your family. My 11 year old son suggested to  Organic Gormet try making it iwht apple. Apple goes better with spinach.

review/summary: Great toddler snack
review/text: I think this is a great product for the picky 2-year old eater (obviously younger children who are not ready for solid foods would also really benefit from this product.  It can be sucked directly from the pouch or squeezed onto a spoon for feeding).  My son (the aforementioned picky eater) eats fruits but no veggies, so I thought these pouches would be a good alternative to supplement his diet.  He considers them a "treat" and gobbles them up.  They are also a great traveling food-- perfect to pop in my purse when we are heading out.  I love that they are organic, convenient and don't need to be refrigerated (unless you open it).

review/summary: My baby says "OMG!"
review/text: My 8 month old baby went bat guano over this puree!  She was a crazy person, and gulped one down in about 45 seconds, no exaggeration.  She then wailed until I opened another one and she sucked that one down just as quickly, too.  I just opened it and let her suck it right out of the pouch, kind of like a Capri Sun for babies, although you could put it in a bowl, which probably would have slowed down her eating.  9 ounces of food in 3 minutes, that is a lot.  Which is partly why I didn't give this product 5 stars, because this stuff is expensive!  No way could I afford to give these to her often, especially not 2 at a time, even with subscribe and save they are almost two dollars a pouch.  Yikes!  But the other reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because with all the good stuff these have, ORGANIC veggies, gluten free, no sugar, no additives, BPA free packaging, the packaging is a real environmental waste.  It would be a 5 star product if the packaging was recyclable.  They could at least use less plastic on the cap (the cap does make the package resealable, though, which is nice if you have a baby that actually doesn't eat the entire container, can't say I know what that is like!)  But for taste, 5 stars all the way!  And they are great for travel, no chance of broken glass containers of food.

review/summary: Gourmet Baby Food, for sure!
review/text: I'm not looking a Gift Horse in the Mouth but it would have been nice to try the other flavours on my grand-daughter. However, the 2 boxes we received were both Juicy Pear and Garden Greens so I thank my blessings (and amazon Vine) and am reviewing that flavour.<br /><br />I made 100% of my daughter's and son's baby food and know how long that took. In today's much busier world with two working parents, providing very healthy food for babies is tough. I also never gave my children anything that I wouldn't find tasty, so I knew that I needed to try this product before I experimented on my grand-daughter.<br /><br />I squeezed the contents from the intriguing packaging into a small bowl. First I tried it at room temperature and then heated it as recommended (bowl set into warm water, NOT microwave!) and tried the remainder of it that way. BOTH versions were good but I enjoyed it cool, much moreso. When cool, the pears dominated; when warm, the greens dominated. I was amused that the flavour was very similar to a gourmet chilled soup that I make in the summertime. :)<br /><br />My grand-daughter just finished an entire package of this in a wee bowl (with my help) and she LOVED it! I like the fact that it's not just fruit or just vegetables but BOTH. As it stands, we'll power through what we received and then go on the lookout for the other flavours available.<br /><br />Both my daughter and I really appreciated the convenient pouch, which makes feeding the baby very simple when you are out and about. No glass to break and you can squeeze the puree onto a baby spoon, making feeding a snap. Baby, mom and me all heartedly recommend both the product and packaging.

review/summary: Two year old is the test dummy. Sorry :>)
review/text: When Amazon offered this baby food I thought "Wow! just the thing for the little guy when he starts on solid food!" Unfortunately I didn't consider the expiration date.  Don't get me wrong! I wouldn't expect ,or WANT ,a baby food with no preservatives to last indefinitely.  It's just something to consider if you plan to stockpile or you're giving it as a gift for a baby who won't be on solid food for a while.<br /><br />I think the food is most commendable for what it DOESN'T have. No fillers, preservatives, added salt, sugar,gluten, BPA . This is especially important if you have an allergy-prone baby. If you go on the baby gourmet  web-site and click on their blog they have a great recipe for brownie-like cookies using the pear/garden greens food (2 pouches). Of course you add the sugar and flour but you're also adding fruit and veggies. How sneaky is that?<br /><br />If cost is a consideration (isn't it always?) you can save a little with automatic delivery. Free shipping over $25.  Also at the present time (Feb 23, 2012) there is a 35% discount coupon on the product page if you order from Amazon.<br /><br />As for the taste? Great! ( you'd expect me to try this on a baby test dummy without tasting it?) If your two year old asks for a "juice box" throw her one of these. Although you might have to hide them once she gets a taste. Freeze one just to the stage of mushy and throw it in the diaper bag. A very nice and healthy treat.<br /><br />For the time being the two year old will have to be the test dummy, since if will be a couple of months before the main target  gets a little age on him but bottom line I think the food is a winner.

review/summary: Baby Gourment compared to Happy Baby
review/text: After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470425245">Feeding Baby Green: The Earth Friendly Program for Healthy, Safe Nutrition During Pregnancy, Childhood, and Beyond</a> I make most of my babies food because it is exceedingly difficult to find nutritionally balanced ready-made baby food. However, I do keep a few ready made pouches on hand as back up.<br /><br />I have some gripes about modern baby food in general.<br /><br />1)Most of them are loaded with sweet carbs and are not nutritionally balanced for babies needs, but they do not reveal this easily.<br />2)They are formulated according to what babies will eat happily and costs little to produce, versus what is actually good for babies.<br />3)For babies up to one year old, the perfect food is human milk which is 50% fats, 37% carbs and the rest is protein and vitamins/ minerals. After 6 months babies need increasing amounts of protein. None of the organic "baby food" on the market even attempts to provide this proper balance of nutrition in their foods.<br />4)The predominance of the carb dense baby foods are directly contributing to the obesity epidemic in America. These foods are getting babies hooked into an addictive and damaging insulin cycle that gives the USA the highest rate of childhood diabetes in the world. People think that "organic" equals "healthy" and that is what the marketing from the baby food companies wants you to think. There is organic junk food too and the VAST majority of organic baby food on the market is dessert, not nutritious food.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet and Happy Baby are no exceptions to this so they both lose 2 stars right off the bat.<br /><br />Of the two brands, Baby Gourmet is my favorite and here is why.<br /><br />Truth in advertising!<br />Baby Gourmet has named this puree "Juicy Pear and Garden Greens" which accurately reflects the ingredient list. Organic Pear,<br />Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate. This food is 9 grams of carbs, no fat and no protein. Spinach actually has a decent amount of protein in it, but there is so little spinach in this food that the protein content of the spinach is too small to count. Still, Baby Gourmet calls it like it is. There is no deception on the label.<br /><br />Compare this to Happy Baby's "Broccoli, Peas and Pear" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VBRCG">HAPPYBABY Organic Baby Food, Stage 2, Broccoli, Peas & Pear, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 16)</a> which is a complete reversal of the ingredient list (which is also not listed accurately on Amazon at the time of this review). Here is the ingredient list in the proper order; organic pear, organic peas, organic broccoli,organic lemon juice concentrate, ascorbic acid (vitamin c), but the name of the food would lead you to believe that the first ingredient is broccoli! This slick marketing is misleading about the contents of the baby food. This puree is a light translucent yellow. It looks like pureed pear, tastes like pear and according to the label, it has 15 grams of carbs, no fat and less than 1 gram of protein.<br /><br />Of course, babies love these sweet tasting pear based purees, but keep in mind that you are giving your baby a very sugary fruit, pear.<br /><br />Here is another reason I like Baby Gourmet. All of their ingredients are real food. No Fillers and no strange additives!<br /><br />Happy Baby adds DHA to some of their baby foods. This DHA is sourced from GMO algae that is fed GMO soy (check with the Organic Consumer's Association if you want to learn more about this). They have managed to get this GMO DHA into the "organic" label by using a loophole in the organic standards. In addition, there is no/zero/zip/nada evidence that this GMO DHA actually improves "Brain and eye developement" as they claim on the label. Because of their deceptive marketing practices and abuse of the organic label, I no longer purchase Happy Baby products.<br /><br />Was this review helpful?

review/summary: Great Taste and Portability, but Costly
review/text: My granddaughter Sophie - 8 months old - LOVED this food. It is easy to open, very convenient to carry or recap and perfect for a diaper bag. You have to remember that babies may need to be introduced to a food a number of times before they may decide that they like it. So if your child turns it down the first time, try it again at the next meal. The fact that it's a little tart is not a bad thing. Children have a greater tolerance for tartness than adults. I know my kids love to suck on lemon or lime wedges where I would be puckering up big time.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the product is that in comparison to other baby food, it is very expensive. Gerber single 2.5 ounce tubs run about 50 cents a serving from our local grocery store. These are over $1 a serving (not per package, since there are 'two servings' per package.<br /><br />I like that it is organic but many baby foods are organic these days.<br /><br />Lots of positives: great taste, baby loves it, convenient, resealable, easily portable. Negative: cost.

review/summary: The girls think these are a great treat!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:07 Mins<br /><br /></span>Here are my two girls -- Big Sister E on the right, 33 months, and Little Sister e on the left, 14 months -- devouring some Baby Gourmet (the pear/spinach/broccoli flavor).<br /><br />Personally, I've found other baby food packs of this style more tasty, but the girls LOVE them.  When the box arrived, it wasn't long before they spread them all over the house -- Little Sister likes to carry them around and mouth the top, since she can't twist them open.  Big Sister is a little too old for the target demographic, but she's hooked.  She said (before this video) that it tastes like apple sauce.<br /><br />They're VERY convenient for travel -- they kept the girls occupied during a meeting with our financial adviser, because even after the food is gone, they like to play with the bag and cap.<br /><br />I like that the packaging is BPA free and the food itself is simple and Organic (no sweeteners, no preservatives besides the pretty innocuous ascorbic acid -- aka vitamin C), but I do wish the package was recyclable.  It feels like a lot of trash to produce... Maybe they're recyclable in some areas, but not mine.<br /><br />I'm going to try and make these last until our big cross-country trip this summer -- but, short of hiding them, I'm not sure that they'll last that long!

review/summary: Product expiration & bulk ordering
review/text: The product itself is pretty straight forward.  It's got pureed organic baby food in a little pouch.  Easier to transport than the little glass jars.  If your baby eats a lot, there's a lot more food per pouch.  The nozzle and cap makes it easy to squeeze straight onto a spoon and feed baby with no mess (at least on this end).  Also, since the food theoretically is being transferred from the pouch to the spoon, you don't have cross-contamination of the baby's mouth germs being reintroduced back into the jar of baby food.<br />The color of this particular product leaves a bit to be desired.  But the flavor was fine (to me) and the pear and garden greens combo is pretty nice and healthy.<br /><br />I echo the same concerns that another reviewer posted.  I actually got this product a little earlier since I knew my baby would be eating in a month or so.  Lo and behold, once I opened it when he was ready for solids, the expiration had already passed.  Perhaps this is only an issue for the free stuff we're getting through Vine reviews; I sure hope so.  But somebody ought to think twice about giving out stuff on the cusp of expiration that is meant for babies and their uniquely sensitive systems.  This is also relevant given that the baby food comes packaged as a pack of 12.  Now, I don't know who would buy a package of 12 food pouches of the *exact* same flavor.  Your baby must really love pear and greens.  Moreover, I mentioned that each pouch is 4.5 ounces.  That's more than 2 glass jars' worth.  My personal thought is that unless your child has texture issues or low oral muscle tone, the baby is probably going to move through the pureed food stage a lot faster than you could possibly go through 12 pouches of this baby food (I'm assuming that you're also providing him/her with other flavors, though).<br /><br />I also recommend looking into the Happy Baby brand of baby food.  It also comes in neat little pouches and has organic pureed fruits and veggie combos; but it adds additional Salba grains that are naturally rich in Omega-3s.

review/summary: Our Little guy loves `em - easy to hold too.
review/text: So, we've tried many, many different types and brands of these baby mush packs.  One thing in particular about these which we like - and apparently our little one does too - is that the spout is at an angle on the corner of the pouch, rather than sticking out of the top.  For some reason, it seems our little one has an easier time holding it and sucking on it that way.  Plus, as a result, he drinks it all down to the bottom, instead of us having to squeeze up the dregs at the bottom of the container, like with do with other pouches.<br /><br />As for the flavor of these ones, can't say I've tried it - but our little one didn't seem to have nay problem sucking each packet dry - sometimes within seconds of receiving it.<br /><br />5 star product in my opinion.

review/text: Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Juicy Pear and Garden Greens didn't sound that great at first. I mean, pears and greens? I tasted some before we gave it to the baby, though, and it was really quite tasty; I need to toss some pears into my next batch of greens or even try a pear-spinach smoothie sometime. Meanwhile, the baby sucks it up like it's ambrosia; half the time, he slurps it right out of the package without using any utensils, though we obviously don't want to do that if he's not eating the whole thing at one sitting. One nice thing about the packaging for these baby foods is that you can re-close the small opening without exposing the uneaten food to a lot of air. This is a really good concept!

The pouch style makes these easy to take on the go, because you don't need a spoon, and don't end up with anything messy to bring home when you're done.

I would think your baby can hold this and slurp it out, of course I think they'll have to be old enough.  I'm sure newborns can't.  That said, it will be an adventure if I'm so totally wrong and the food gets squirted out all over the place right?  ;)<br /><br />Taste great and is organic for those of us on the lookout for it, but of course, organic can sometimes mean pricey and it is somewhat here, but well worth it in the end.

review/text: We gave this to our 8 month old and she gobbled right down.<br />I ate a pouch too. It really does taste like what they say the ingredients are - pear and spinach.  I suppose if you are a baby and don't know that socially those two don't compliment each other very well - it works.  It just tasted weird to me, but then again, Im not the target audience. We try to avoid giving our kids fruit very early. Seems if you just start them off on veggies only you can convince them that greens and oranges are good.  Add fruit to entice - that is in line with this product.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the ingredients and the lack thereof. Simple is good.  This is as simple as you get.<br /><br />The packages work really well.  You can throw these in a diaper bag and you're good to go.  Need a meal on the go - no worries its there fore you.<br /><br />I really recommend this and would look forward to other flavors.

review/summary: strange taste for babies!
review/text: This is a healthy addition to a child's diet. The problem is not with it's nutritional value, but with the taste. Normally most baby foods has a nice sweet taste, that will be appealing even to adults. But this tastes so much like an organic health food. It is assumed that the baby would already be used to better tasting food (at least milk) and introducing this becomes a challenge. Our baby was willing to experiment with this new stuff, but after swallowing a spoonful, he firmly refused to take another. When i tasted it, i could understand his reason. Even the older children, who normally would not have minded pouncing on the baby food, stayed clear of this one.<br /><br />An appealing taste is definitely a factor in any baby food and not just nutritional value, and this lacks a nice taste. I still give it 3 stars because it is organic and if you start your baby early with this, the child may grow used to it.

review/summary: Baby loves it. Mom loves that it is organic.
review/text: My baby girl just started eating solid foods in the last week at just under 6 months old. She has been eyeing our food and watching us intensely when we are eating. When she started trying to grab food off our plates, we knew she was ready to start eating.<br /><br />We skipped cereal all together and this was the second food that she tried after squash. I tasted a bit before giving it to her because I was curious about how strongly she would be able to taste the broccoli and spinach through the pear. While you can taste the greens, the pear mellows the flavor just enough. It isn't so sweet from the pear that baby will get used to sweet flavors though.<br /><br />The texture is perfect for her at this stage too. It isn't so thick that she has trouble with it but gives her more texture than something thinned out a lot with formula.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not crazy about the pouches. They don't stand up easily on my pantry shelves and I worry that they could be damaged or leak if I were carrying them around in a diaper bag. I do like that the cap goes back on since one pouch says it is two servings. Unfortunately, the packaging also makes it difficult to know when you have squeezed half of the food into the bowl.<br /><br />I think this is also pretty expensive. We purchased another organic baby food product in a similar pouch today that was less expensive, even before the coupon, and offered similar flavor choices.<br /><br />So my overall rating would be 5 stars for the taste and that it is made with organic ingredients but 3 stars for packaging and price.

review/summary: Good ingredients, but always waste a little food
review/text: In terms of convenience and taste, these are great. Overall, I have only one complaint. Given the design of the pouch it's pretty much impossible to get all the food out, which seems like a waste every time. It's not much, but more so than a regular glass container of baby food.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Baby loves it, and savors it.<br />2. Organic ingredients<br />3. Super easy to open (simple twist)<br />4. Tastes great (yeah, I try her food to make sure we're giving her food that has some flavor to it)<br />5. 4.5 ounces of food (larger than the normal/standard of 4 ounces.<br /><br />Neutral<br />1. In general I wish that baby food emphasized more the vegetables than the fruit. (these are plenty sweet, they could have easily used half as much pear and the rest could've been some healthy greens.<br />2. Feel very liquid, more so than most baby food that I've bought.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Due to puch design, baby food is wasted.

review/summary: portable, liked by a kid who doesn't like green things
review/text: My daughter is 7 months old, and we started baby food right before 6 months. She has never been a fan of most green things (spring veggie mixes, green beans, etc) even though we keep trying them. But she likes this! It tastes more like pear sauce than anything (I tried it).<br /><br />It's also nicely portable. My little one is too young to squeeze it right into her mouth, but I can carefully squeeze some onto a spoon if we're out (if I'm home, I usually just squeeze it into a bowl). I also reseals well (the cap screws back on) and is easily tossed back into the diaper back if it's not finished. I would definitely buy this again and in other flavors.

review/text: I like it is organic, you can really taste the pear which is good but the green bean tastes is pretty powerful too but the pear is the strongest taste. It would have been nice to be able to sample the different flavors but the pear and greens is the only one I was sent. It is pretty healthy with 40 calories, no fats, less than 1 gm of sugar so it is something that I would feel good about.

review/summary: Great organic baby food-on-the-go!!
review/text: The Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 (6 months plus) - Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food - these pear and spinach fruit/veggie pouches were great for an 11 month old boy (my newphew), for on the go!  He can just take the pouch and feed himself by sipping through the top - which frees up mommy's hands for doing other things!  The nutrients are great as well, and he liked it!  Plus the fact that it is healthy organic makes me happy: it's super convenient to have these sort of things around to grab and take in the car: great value, would definitely recommend!

review/text: I love the taste of this product.  Reminds me of Nestle's Quik when I was growing up...<br /><br />After the third day, I had a whole day of explosive foul-smelling rotten-egg flatulence that could only be attributed to the drink I had. However, I wonder if this happened because I had added 8 oz of skim milk to the drink... usually I do not have a problem with skim milk as I have it in coffee and with cereal during the day.<br /><br />The rotten-egg smell, per my research, comes from sulfur-containing foods... perhaps the combination of hemp and milk creates a nondigestible mix?<br /><br />Please, if anyone has ideas feel free to comment.

review/text: Boiling coffee, super-fine, with a bit of sugar added before boiling, is a delicious change from brewed coffee.  We tried Aladin 7oz bag when it appeared on local supermarket shelf during Passover.  We'd had boiling coffee in Sweden -- this is just as good.  In fact we went out and bought a thermal glass boiling pitcher designed to let the grounds settle.  Pour gently into a small espresso or demitasse.  Expect some 'mud' at the bottom of your cup, so drink in sips.  Slow enjoyment!  (4 stars because maybe not everyone will like this as we do.)

review/summary: Bold,Rich, Aromatic - Shade Grown and Organic - Packaging Needs Improvement
review/text: Camano Island Shade grown and organic coffee not only produces a wonderful and flavorful cup of java but saves trees from being chopped down as well. The Sumatra coffee is a real eye-opener, a coffee lovers coffee with a very bold rich taste(dark roast). The aroma alone will get you going in the morning and will be a great afternoon pick-me-up as well. It's as good if not better the the more expensive designer labels, and this 5lb bag is a truly good buy. Shade Grown/Organic is pretty expensive at my local market.<br /><br />But what's up with the packaging. It arrived in a heavy-weight clear plastic bag. Not very environmentally friendly. Also, it is very hard to keep sealed. It has one of those cheap sticky tabs you pull over to reseal and at that it is not very sticky.By the second use it wasn't working. I transferred my coffee into the largest Tupperware bowl I could find(5 lbs. is a lot of coffee) to keep it fresh.<br /><br />5 stars for the coffee. I love it and would buy it again, but Camano Islands - if you are listening- please improve the packaging.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy....Laurie<br /><br />also available in a medium roast - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9SN4A">Camano Island Coffee Roasters Sumatra, Medium Roast, Ground, 80-Ounce Bag</a>

review/summary: Bold, rich, chocolaty and organic
review/text: Sumatra roasts have typically been some of my favorite coffees. This Camano Island Sumatra is among the best. It's got exactly what I'm looking for: a nice, bold flavor without too much acidity. There are some hints of chocolate in there that made me compare it to Trader Joe's MochaJava. It's a great afternoon or evening coffee, especially with a rich desert since it has the character to contend with the sweetness of a rich cake.<br /><br />The price is remarkable for the quality of the coffee. You could pay $15 a pound for some 'premier' coffee from the likes of Intelligentsia, but I don't feel the price difference is at all warranted when you can get a coffee this good for half as much. Are there better coffees out there? Sure, but they're not that much better at 2-3x the price.<br /><br />This is well worth getting if you like Sumatra style roasts.<br /><br />Very tasty.

review/summary: Expensive But So Worth It
review/text: My husband and I are now eating more organic foods as part of an increasingly healthy lifestyle. I am responsible for our grocery shopping and, as a very thrifty shopper, I searched extensively for an organic coffee that gave me good value, great price, excellent flavor, and a reasonable quantity. This coffee definitely fits the bill. It is bold, rich, and silky even without creamer or sweeteners. Moreover, scoop for scoop, it packs the biggest flavor and aromatic punch when compared to just about any other coffee I've tasted.<br /><br />I was skeptical to spend sixty dollars on coffee but picked this one based on the many positive reviews. Now, my husband and I are both so pleased with this purchase. I will certainly keep this coffee is regular stock.

review/summary: What happened to the Price???!!!
review/text: I've enjoyed this coffee very much over the last year, and am disappointed that the price has jumped $24 per bag (that's a 66% increase!).  I'm canceling my subscription and looking for another brand.  It's very good, but not good enough to justify the price difference.<br /><br />Edit:  Since posting this review I discovered that the price of coffee beans has doubled due to weather and bad crops.  How bad is it?  Apparently opium farmers are tearing out their crops and planting coffee beans.  So, Camano Island jacking up the price is understandable and should be expected (although some notice to subscribers would be nice).  Unfortunately, this news doesn't put any more money in my pocket.

review/text: I didn't throw in the "social responsibility" factor to make up for some shortcoming in quality here.  So let's get it out of the way and get to the coffee itself.  Camano Island Roasters are committed to fair dealing with their growers, the community, and the environment.  That should matter to us all, but even if it doesn't matter to you, they still make the best coffee you can buy at any price.<br /><br />This coffee will hit your door a day after it is roasted.  It is that fresh.  And they roast it perfectly.  The Dark Sumatra is earthy, a bit smoky, and finishes incredibly smoothly.  It is a world-class cup of coffee.<br /><br />And this is a luxury you may be able to justify for every day.<br /><br />Even if you don't want to rely on mail order for all your coffee, this also makes a gift that is guaranteed to impress even the fussiest coffee drinker (and they will be especially impressed by the good the good folks at Camano intend to do).<br /><br />I love this coffee and the people who make it.  I think you will, too.

review/summary: A solid go to. Will buy many times if price stays low.
review/text: I ordered this five pound bag to drink while I'm over here in Iraq. We of course get coffee provided in our dining facilities, but it is Maxwell House's dish water blend. I brewed this in a french press. It worked well with the grind except for the shake at the bottom of the bag. This is to be expected with five pounds of ground even with a quality burr grinder.<br /><br />Has a nice flavor. I drink coffee black and with milk. This roast is dark which helps cut through milk drinks. Being from New Orleans, and knowing pre-ground coffee is less than ideal for flavor, I chose the dark roast(french roast). If you were going to drink it without milk, they offer this Sumatra in a medium roast that will emphasize the bean better than the roast. Since my purchase the dark roast has increased in price. Medium is still at the cheaper price.  I didn't have the luxury of a grinder. Make this your first purchase before you buy this coffee. Even cheap whole bean will beat this coffee after it hits the air for a couple weeks.

review/text: I was buying this coffee for my husband, who goes through about 1 1/2 lbs. per week. Since he goes through it so quickly, he likes coffee to be already ground (I like whole bean).  Even though it's already ground, though, it's good tasting coffee. It's dark, but not bitter.<br /><br />I had been using Amazon's Subscribe & Save for this, but I had to cancel because the coffee went up a whopping $15 per bag in one month.  It was a bargain prior to that cost increase, but for its current price, I could buy almost any other coffee, so I stopped ordering it.

review/summary: Buy for the content, not the container
review/text: After going through several iterations of trying and ending subscriptions to different Amazon coffees, I've finally arrived at home on Camano Island.<br /><br />The taste of their Organic Sumatra Dark Roast is deep and balanced.  It is faintly sweet-nutty, like cashews.  The product is also consistent bag after bag, suggesting that the roasters and buyers are attentive to quality control.<br /><br />On the negative side, the price has risen sharply recently, but we are in the middle of a global spike in energy and agriculture costs and must expect that coffee from the other side of the planet is going to reflect that price change.  I love this coffee too much to do other than hope that some of the price hike is going to the original farmers.<br /><br />The plastic bag makes sense for packaging in that it's light and tough and needs no wasteful paperboard support.  There is still some room for improvement: 1) the bag should have a zip-lock strip on the outer side of the thermal seal to permit re-closing and 2) the bag or label should be marked with the appropriate SPI resin identification code for sorting plastic recycling.

review/summary: Very good for wheat-free
review/text: When I was diagnosed with gluten sensitivity, I thought foods such as this would be off-limits.  What a pleasant surprise to find Orgran making mixes like this.  The falafel patties hold up well to cooking, and my daughter and I honestly could not taste much difference between this falafel and previous wheat falafels we used to have.

review/summary: Delicious falafel mix!
review/text: We love the OrGran products. They are good quality. The problem with most boxed mixes is the sodium content. This brand is less salty tasting than the Fantastic Foods brand. OrGran makes these with yellow peas so they taste a little different from what we expected. There aren't any other beans in them which other falafel mixes usually include in the mix. These are a good gluten-free food choice for my son who is on a gfcf diet. Overall these are good and the kids enjoy them!

I highly highly recommend them!<br /><br />ORGRAN products are new staples in my pantry for the health of my family!

Easy to use and very good tasting.  I have been corresponding with their web site in Australia for several months now and love the great receipes they have.  Anyone on a gluten-free diet needs these products in their pantry!

I fry up two boxes at a time and freeze the leftovers.  Whenever I want some I grab three and warm them up in the microwave for 45 seconds.  Yummmm!

review/summary: Good Sauce
review/text: This is a good all purpose sauce.  Has good flavor that the heat doesn't overpower.  Not really that spicy unless you use a whole bunch.  10 good drops is about enough to add a little heat to a pot of soup, but a lot more is needed if you want a lingering burn.  Heat isn't quite up to par with other products out there, (such as Spontaneous Combustion) but this has the true aged cayenne hot sauce flavor.

However, I was walking out of the drugstore, close to Valentine's Day and spotted Cherry M&M'S....well, I grabbed them and thought, I'll give them a try.  Nobody told me they were a "Limited Edition" of M&M'S.  So, when I went back to the store they were gone.  Sooooo, I found them on Amazon!!!!  Ordered 2 bags, one for me and one for my granddaughter. Received them before expected date and have almost eaten entire bag.  Can't wait till Christmas when they will be out again.  Thank you Amazon.....for your prompt service...I will reorder from Amazon they are great!!!!

review/text: I received this as a gift.  The added infusion of the Kalamata Olives gives this oil a very rich flavoring.  I sauted vegetables in it.... WOW.  Great drizzled over cold tomatoes and mozzarella.  I also served it at a dinner as a dipping oil with mixed herbs and it blended nicely with the flavors.  This oil is slightly thicker than some of your cheaper oils, so it clings to the herbs and the bread very well.

review/summary: Best Sugar-free Syrup!
review/text: I first tried this syrup at a local restaurant and loved it!  Since then, I have found that another local restaurant also serves it.  I have looked in almost every store I can think of for it, but can not find it anywhere.  I went so far as to ask one restaurant owner if I could buy one from her, but was denied :-(  So, I turned to the internet.<br /><br />I found this syrup cheaper on other websites, but the shipping costs made it equivalent to what I paid here at Amazon.  The price is expensive for breakfast syrup, but I have not found any other sugar-free as good.  (I have been a diabetic for over 30 years and have tried MANY!)  I would (and probably will) buy this again in a second!

And the "spicy onion" - it is not spicy hot nor do you taste a lot of onion.  It just gives the tuna a new and different flavor from regular tuna and it is VERY GOOD.  I buy it every couple months.  It comes in a pack of 12.  That is the other nice thing - it is in a pack instead of a can.  And I've actually eaten it without mayo and it's still VERY GOOD.

review/text: Great price on this tasty tuna. The onion flavor is not strong, it just gives it a slightly tangy, spicy character like a good marinade. I used half my normal mayo and it was awesome as tuna salad, but also not too bad on it's own. SALCOL only sells line-caught Skipjack tuna, so there is no risk of bycatch waste so common in the tuna industry or use of more endangered species of tuna. That's enough reason for me to switch.

review/text: This is really good tuna. As others have mentioned, its not particularly spicy or oniony, it just tastes like it was in a good marinade. I honestly wouldn't mind a really spicy and oniony flavor, but these are great nonetheless. These 3.5oz pouches are a good size for use as a snack or quick meal. They are even better when you heat them up a little, I place mine over the toaster while the toaster is on for a minute or two. I will continue to purchase these and am going to try other products from SAFCOL.
