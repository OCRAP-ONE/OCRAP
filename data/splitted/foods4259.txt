review/summary: Big tripe for big dogs
review/text: Although this product states trip treats for dogs and cats both my animals are smaller cat and dog, so I would say this product is for big dogs and very very big cats. My animals are both about 10 pounds each and find it difficult to eat this delicious tripe treats.

review/summary: Doesn't smell bad, and my dog likes it
review/text: This tripe doesn't smell like barnyard at all (it barely smells of anything). It's quite hard, and some of the pieces are fairly big (2" long) so it can't be cut up into smaller pieces, but there are a lot of smaller pieces in the bag as well. I give my dog (a 13 pound corgi mix) a bigger piece or two when she goes into her crate at night and use small pieces as high-value treats now and then. My cats will occasionally eat one of the littler pieces but the big pieces are definitely too much for them.

review/text: This stuff is great!  I run it through my coffee grinder to powder-ize it, then its easy to munch down with soy milk and maybe a thin cookie.  Not bad in coffee or hot coco either.<br /><br />Excellent pick-me-up, and according to all my googling, a great source of hard-to-get nutrients and minerals.<br /><br />Incredibly, the Serving Size is listed on the bag as one full oz.  That is insane.  I find a max serving is maybe two full tablespoons.<br /><br />Raw organic cacao nibs are part of my normal routine now, which is painless at this price.<br /><br />I love it!

I had to break the cookies in half for the younger child, as he likes to shove everything whole in his mouth.  My 2 year old loved them, so they must taste pretty good since she is the pickier of the two. Thanks Amazon!

review/text: These Gerber Graduates snacks are good because they are high in iron. My picky eater went for his 12 months check up and the doctor said his iron level is exceptionally high for a picky eater.  I told the doctor that my baby eats a lot of Gerber snacks, but not baby meal/food. I orderd them in bulk because of subscribe and save. It was a pretty good deal and I didn't have to cut coupon.  Sometimes when we are on the go and I am hungry, I also snack on these.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Oats for someone who really likes oats!
review/text: Bob's R M Oats "Rolled Thick" are the BEST! These are two pound bags, so each bag makes 18 (yes eighteen) servings and each serving has all the "whole grain" (28 grams) you need for the day! But the cooking directions on the bag turn these fine oats into globs of sticky goo that are hardly look like they should. You can get the picture if I tell you they look like a bowl of gummy instant oats! Yucky! So I used HALF the amount of water, dash of salt (optional) and bringing the water to boiling, added the oats, bringing it back to boil, stirred, then covered and cooked TWO minutes, Turn off heat, keep pot covered, and let sit til you serve. This method produces thoroughly cooked oats that retain their natural texture and chew. DELICIOUS! See if you like!

review/summary: Wake Up and Smell The Shade Grown Sumatra - Save a Tree
review/text: Camano Island Shade grown and organic coffee not only produces a wonderful and flavorful cup of java but saves trees from being chopped down as well. The Sumatra coffee is a real eye-opener, a coffee lovers coffee with a bold rich taste. The aroma alone will get you going in the morning and will be a great afternoon pick-me-up as well. It's as good if not better the the more expensive designer labels, and this 80oz bag is a truly good buy.<br /><br />But what's up with the packaging. It arrived in a heavy-weight clear plastic bag. Not very environmentally friendly. Also, it is very hard to keep sealed. It has one of those cheap sticky tabs you pull over to reseal and at that it is not very sticky.By the second use it wasn't working. I transferred my coffee into the largest Tupperware bowl I could find(80 oz is a lot of coffee) to keep it fresh.<br /><br />5 stars for the coffee. I love it and would buy it again, but Camano Islands - if you are listening- please improve the packaging. I did see this also available in smaller whole bean packages.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy....Laurie<br /><br />also available in dark roast(slightly bolder and richer)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9SN5E">Camano Island Coffee Roasters Sumatra, Dark Roast, Ground, 5 Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Real organic cinnamon sticks
review/text: After lots of research, for Ceylon cinnamon sticks, Indus organics was the supplier I was looking for.<br />I had discovered previously, that real cinnamon was from Ceylon, the true and healthy quality is from India, but I was unable to find it anywhere else on the market. Wholefoods and many other health food stores did not even know the difference between CASSIA and CINNAMON from CEYLON.<br />Cassia is the cinnamon from China, it is harder & darker brown color,(.5% of coumarin),when real cinnamon is more brittle and lighter brown, and from India(.004% of coumarin) beside is healthier.<br />Cassia is mostly what is sold in the States, still called "cinnamon".<br />Indus organics knew exactly what I was looking for, not only they sale quality products but they know what they are selling.<br />I highly recommend this company.<br />Catherine Salacuse

review/summary: really disappointed
review/text: To be honest, I have never knowingly tried Ceylon cinnamon before, I'm just a regular user of cassia, so by reading about it, I was already expecting a  milder, less aromatic, but less bitter, sweeter, and more healthful version of cinnamonum. Mostly, I was concerned about too much coumarin as I am a regular drinker of homemade chai. Also, I didn't like to have to use too much sweetener to counter the bitterness of the cinnamon and other spices I use. At about 3 times the cost of cassia sticks (about $42 for 1 lb, including shipping), I was hoping the tradeoff was not going to be too much of a sacrifice.<br /><br />Received the package 3 days after ordering. Came O.K. packed in the box of two plastic jars. Upon opening a jar, i noticed that it was not sealed. It had the typical paper type of seal with pull tabs under the lid, but it was not sealed to the jar  -a bit concerning. So next I tried to smell. When I stuck my nose right into the jar, I could detect a mild aroma,  much less than i was expecting for a large new jar. I figured the one jar had broken seal and maybe the cinnamon wasn't as fresh as it should have been otherwise. Jar was well labeled, but no production date or best used by date either. I then opened the other jar, the very same thing. My next thoughts were that these probably came out of an open bulk bin and were packaged by the vendor, maybe with old, stale contents. My suspicians were at least partly confirmed when I read the packing slip with a handwritten note:<br /><br />Dear -----<br /><br /> Complimentary jar packing for you!<br />  Enjoy real Ceylon cinnamon<br />  Indus Sales<br /><br />My thoughts were, Gee isn't that generous of you. For the pittance of only $42 I paid, I was not expecting much and I only thought you should just throw the sticks loose into the packing box, haha.<br /><br />Anyway, next I decided to taste. I simmered one half of a stick ( more than I would have used of Cassia in a cup of my chai) broken up coarsely in 6 ounces of water for about ten minutes, it seemed to have just O.K. aroma, but the water was barely colored at all, and there was very little taste to my senses. Then i ground some up finely, about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon, toasted a piece of bread, spread with butter and honey, and sprinkled the CC on. I honestly wasn't sure whether I could even taste anything except the butter and honey. My spouse thought the same way. Maybe baking with it will do better? If nothing else, i guess it could always be rendered to the compost pile. On second thought, the antimicrobial properties of the various cinnamomum species would probably mess up the composting process.<br /><br />If my sampling is a good example of what the touted Ceylon cinnamon is all about, then I will probably go back to my cassia, but at a reduced level. After all, isn't coumarin compounds ability to prevent clots, reduce blood pressure, reduce cholesterol, and the antimicrobial qualities, a big part of the health benefits of cinnamon (cassia or not) anyway, as long as not done in excess? I mean taking excessive, or the improper dosages of prescription Coumadin, (tradename for a related presription compound, I believe) could be VERY VERY dangerous to one's health also and probably even very much more so, that's why patients are so closely monitored. If Ceylon has only ten percent of the coumarin that cassia has, but if i am using 3 times as much, and making it 9X the cost of cassia, that may be too much af a sacrifice for me. I think maybe better to just restrict my intake to 1/4 teaspoon cassia/day on average, enjoy the taste, and enjoy other things with the money saved. Unless I just got an old, or poor quality batch. At any rate, i don't like what i got, so 2 stars.<br /><br />  Update March 4, 2012:<br /><br />I think by now I have given this tasteless garbage that is hyped as "true" cinnamon, a fair shake, about 2 1/2 months. I gradually reduced the amount of so called "bad" and "fake" cinnamon I was using, while upping the ceylon until I ran out, about 2 months ago, and only used the Ceylon crap since. A recent visit to my doctor revealed that my blood pressure had gone higher, lab test results later showed my cholesterol and triglcerides had also gone up noticeably. Also I hadn't been feeling so well. Doc wanted to know if I was doing anything differently. I told him about the cinnamon change. He advised I go back to doing whatever I had been doing before.<br /><br />The peddlers/hypers of this Ceylon type of cinnamon tell you about the very low amount of coumarin versus other species of cinnamon. What they don't tell, is that it also has less of the beneficial essential oils and cinnamaldehyde.<br /><br />As far as the coumarin, many plants naturally contain coumarins, including chamomile, sweet clover, cherries, strawberries, celery, apricots, vanilla grass, sweet woodruff, and many more. And coumarins are natural appetite suppressants, have been used in treatment of asthma and lymphedema, and reportedly are actively anti-HIV, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, anti-coagulant,anti-hypertension, anti-arrhythmia, anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoporosis, anti-septic, and analgesic.<br /><br />Almost anything used in extremes can be harmful or dangerous.<br /><br />So I just got a new supply of what I call "real" cinnamon, and it's not the Ceylon variety. Oh boy, it tastes soooo goooood, and i'm very much enjoying cinnamon again for the first time in months.<br /><br />Update March 11 2010;<br /><br />O.K. so maybe I was to harsh in my first review and last update, so just to be fair, there were a couple of uses for the Ceylon C that we liked O.K. Ground and mixed with whipped cream and used for topping, especially as topping on hot chocolate. Ground and used for ice cream was also pretty good. The wife liked in some pastries, but was not a good substitute at all for cinnamon bread, rolls, or on toast, IMO. And if you're trying to use in Chai, or anything else with other dominant spice(s), the very subtle taste of the Ceylon cinnamon is completely lost. Works O.K.  as a single subtle flavoring/aroma in a light tea, such as darjeeling, though.<br /><br />I have done more research and share what I have learned below;<br /><br />There are 4 main species of cinnamomum sold as cinnamon. All are related, same genus and family, although burmannii and loureiroi are more closely related to aromaticum (Chinese Cassia), than to the Ceylon cinnamon.<br /><br />1) Cinnamomum burmannii. Also known as Indonesian or Korintje cassia/cinnamon. This is  the variety you see sold as those  neat, dark, thick, and hard quills, curled from each side. It also is probably the most likely variety to be sold as ground cinnamon, and probably what most people in the U.S. are used to consuming. Generally the cheapest of all, it also has the lowest (of the 3 so-called cassia varieties), in volatile/essential oils. Also has lower coumarin content than the other cassia varieties. Has a harsh, somewhat acrid taste that usually takes alot of sugar to counter.<br /><br />2) Cinnamomum aromaticum. Also known as Chinese cassia. Fairly common tree in China/Southeast Asia. Whole form is not commonly sold to U.S consumers, and does not come in neat "quills". Could be used in some ground cinnamon products commercially or to the consumer?<br /><br />3) Cinnamomum loureiroi. Also known as Saigon or Vietnamese cinnamon/cassia. Trees take a long time to grow, usually about 20 years before production. It is the highest priced of the "cassia" varieties. Saigon cinnamon has again become more available, after so many trees were destroyed in the war. Whole loureiroi comes not in rolled quills, but in slightly curved, pieces of irregular shaped/sized bark, with a beautiful color. Has a potent, very sweet, and somewhat fiery taste. It's 6 to 7% volatile oil content is the highest of all varieties, and contributes to it's intense flavor, the form most similar in taste to cinnamon candy. Combines well with ginger, cardamom, and other dominant spices. This is now most definitely my preferred variety for most uses, and I have just happily obtained a quality supply of it, whole pieces, (not from Amazon) at only slightly more than 1/2 the price of this "Ceylon" cinnamon. Excessive and everday use of loureiroi variety could certainly cause some concern about coumarin though, especially if a person has some sort of liver or kidney disease.<br /><br />4) Cinnamomum verum. Also known as Ceylon, Sri Lankan, or true cinnamon. The main difference here is that the outer bark easily separates from the inner bark and only the inner bark is used. The inner bark is almost parchment thin and rolls up in many thin layers to make a "quill". Has the lowest volatile oil content (usually less than 1%) of all the species, giving it the weakest, most subtle taste/flavor, but also has the lowest coumarin content of any variety, if that is a concern to you. Some say it is more aromatic, than most other varieties, which may usually be true, but not necessarily so, in my particular experience.<br />-----------------<br /><br />The bottom line for me, is that the Ceylon Cinnamon probably has some limited use in my household, at least until it's used up,  but the Vietnamese will be my staple.

review/summary: The real thing - know the difference before you buy
review/text: I was pleased to find real organic cinnamon on Amazon. This shop delivered beautiful, well-packaged rolls of Ceylon. They sell what they say they sell.<br /><br />Why is this noteworthy? Because most of the stuff labeled "cinnamon" isn't. The stuff in the grocery store - even Whole Foods - is Cassia, which is botanically related to cinnamon, but simply isn't actually cinnamon. Why did it become OK for this imposter to be sold as cinnamon? I don't know, but it is just another case of the consumer being lied to in order to promote sales.  It is worth noting that most Cassia comes from China, and has very different properties than cinnamon. Cassia has a flat, harsh, blunt flavor. Cinnamon is a delicate, complex, subtly sweet spice.  Cassia contains hundreds of times more coumarin than cinnamon - which makes Cassia toxic in large does, and I believe harmful if eaten regularly. Cinnamon has extraordinary health benefits (documented in controlled studies).<br /><br />If you want real cinnamon, this is it: Ceylon cinnamon grown in Sri Lanka. You can do the research yourself, or save the time and try this cinnamon.<br /><br />Be warned that if you are used to the hard, hollow, harsh stuff sold in stores (at least in the US), that is Cassia, and, you will find cinnamon is different in every way: it looks, feels, tastes, smells, favors as cinnamon has for thousands of years before corporate food came along.<br /><br />I don't mean to lecture, but itt is worth relearning about this amazing spice.

review/summary: I Wasted Money on "Real Ceylon" Cinnamon Sticks
review/text: During the cool winter evenings I've always used cinnamon sticks as stirrers for hot teas and ciders.  When I ordered the real Ceylon cinnamon sticks (at a higher price than ordinary cinnamon sticks) I was expecting a "Wow" taste.  Instead, the sticks added zero to my hot drinks.  Also, they have no cinnamon aroma.  I called the vendor and was told that if I actually chewed on the stick I would get that deep cinnamon flavor.  It was true.  I could taste the cinnamon when I chewed on the stick, but who wants to chew cinammon sticks and get a mouth full of splinters?  Not a good buy.

review/text: These are excellent cinnamon sticks.  I had been used to the extra firm version from areas in China or Vietnam (though some are softer than others within these region) but these are much softer.  They are excellent for crumbling, and I've used them for both cooking and tea blends.  I typically use the whole sticks in my green teas, as they add a delightful flavor, especially with some citrus, like tangerine.<br /><br />I will certainly be reordering when I finish consuming my 1 pound bag, which is already about half depleted.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: GREAT VALUE!!!!
review/text: Not much to add to the other 5 star reviews, had to provide my 5 star rating, this product deserves the highest rating possible.  I only buy Ceylon Cinnamon, it is  healthier than Cassia, and it actually tastes better.  Mine arrived in the two 8 oz.  containers as pictured with a quantity of about 40 sticks per container, each 4" long and approximately a half inch diameter width.  So you get about 80 sticks all together, not 85-90 as the description states....still a great value for what you get.  I also appreciate the fact that it is organic and is free of pesticides.

review/summary: Delicious addition to my spice cabinet
review/text: This is my first time trying Ceylon Cinnamon, and I was very happy with what I got. The taste has less of a bite than cassia, but more aromatic. I was able to crumble it with my hands without the need of any special tools. The sticks were all in a plain clear plastic bag, so I quickly transferred them to an airtight container and put them away in my cupboard. I would definitely buy these again.

review/text: I'm very surprised no one has written about these, yet.  I never really thought much of dry roast almonds; they're either over-roasted, or they're correctly roasted, but Maisie Jane's almonds are the smoothest I've ever had.  I'm a typical buyer of Trader Joe's brand almonds, but three pounds of TJ's costs around 21 bucks, so this is a better deal.  However, the difference in taste and crunch makes Maisie Jane's a far better value.  This is my brand, now.  Hands down.

review/summary: Good but not great quality
review/text: After visiting a local chocolate factory, I was interested in incorporating cacao into my diet for health benefits.  I like to put a tablespoon into my morning cereal.  This is my second time purchasing cacao nibs through Amazon, and although the price was right, the quality of nibs was not as good as the first, which cost almost twice as much.  The nibs taste and smell the same, but there is a bloom (white film) on them.  As I understand it, this is caused by not storing them under ideal conditions. You can kind of see it in the picture for this product.  The other brand was a richer brown color.  The bloom does not affect the taste but makes them look less appealing and leaves a film (cocoa butter, I think) on the glass jar in which I store these nibs.  There are also some shell fragments to watch out for.  All in all I'm reasonably satisfied with this purchase, but you get what you pay for, and I'm not sure if I will purchase this brand again.

review/summary: TERRIBLE compared to others, many shells
review/text: I LOVE cacao nibs and I so much wanted to love these, as they are a small organic company from Ecuador. I bought these, Navitas and a generic brand, from Peru at my local food store to compare. Compared to the other 2 these were of terrible quality, both in appearance and taste. They look washed out, and don't have the fresh, sort of oily look that the other raw organic cacao nibs I bought had and are much smaller pieces. They are about half the six of others on average and the bag included much of what I would call cacao nib powder. Their taste is less pungent and their texture a bit dry, less cool and crispy than others. The biggest problem with them is that the bag is FULL of shells, which are not chewable, and must be picked out. You cannot eat them in crunchy delicious handfuls at your desk.... or even pour them into a recipe. Actually, you have to meticulously inspect each small group of them for shells, which are hard to tell from these super small nibs. Anyway, for the best quality I would go with Navitas or another brand that you can see in person before you buy. From my experience if they look good they are good! I hope this helps.

review/text: I am no cacao expert but these seem like very good quality. At first I thought it was too bitter, but then I got addicted to them. Now I am munching on these throughout the day. I also found a good education article about organic raw cacao here that has encouraged me to eat more: [...]<br /><br />Just a caution to new consumers out there - these are strong and potent. If you eat too many, the effect is somewhat similar to coffee - your heart begins to race and your mind gets overactive with difficulty to focus.

review/summary: yummy, fresh and exactly what ordered
review/text: Due to some of the reviews, I decided to get 3 different brands. I am no connoisseur, but you know what tastes good. I compared the 3 and to me, there was little difference in the crunchiness, taste and coloring. (all were organic and raw) These were very fresh, crunchy, tasty, not too bitter or chalky and I found no shells or cocoa powder (on the bottom of the bag) as some others have noted. These are a great price, they shipped the next day and they are just plain yummy if you like the flavor and texture of nibs.  I use them in yogurt, smoothies, salads even will grind sometimes with my coffee. I was very pleased with the quality of these nibs. Will buy again.

This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.

The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps.

Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!

review/text: When you have a family that loves fig newtons as much as mine, it is best to buy them by the case than depend<br />on grocery store sales which don't happen often on these cookies.  They are still the best quality with the most<br />filling and crunch of any fig cookies on the market so they are worth the extra expense over cheap no-name<br />brands.

review/text: If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a "Newton" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the "best by" date.

review/summary: Deliciously better than honey or sugar!
review/text: I adore this light version of the Madhava agave because it is so versatile.  I use it in hot and cold drinks to sweeten without any sort of aftertaste.  It mixes easily into both.  It is the perfect compliment to tea or coffee, especially yummy in a vanilla rooibos!  I also use it in place of sugar in various recipes, especially any dressings.  I prefer it to honey because it does not crystallize and it has a very low gycemic index.  When you eat honey it is like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream but agave, while high in fructose, is slowly released into the bloodstream so you don't have that after sugar crash.  Use the amber variety in place of maple syrup but use this light version for any other type of sweetening!  From one sweet tooth to another, agave will satisfy! I'm off to make some tea...

review/text: Some other reviewer wrote that the agave nectar is 60 calories per teaspoon and that is an error. The bottle actually says 60 calories per tablespoon and since there are 3 teaspoons in a 1 tablespoon, agave nectar actually has 20 CALORIES PER TEASPOON. I only wanted to point this out because it would be a shame if that previous misinformation stopped someone who would otherwise try this wonderful product. Another reviewer thought the light agave nectar tasted like butterscotch...I don't agree; I think it just has a pleasant sugar-like sweetness with no after taste.

review/text: Never heard of it. Did some research and decided to try it. Extremely satisfied with my choice! I went for the "Light" version since my research mentioned that it was the one with no strong after-taste. Much better, natural choice than artificial sweeteners. Does have calories, but the glycemic index response is very good; translation: it doesn't give you that "sugar rush". I like things fairly sweet, so I use 2-3 teaspoons per cup of coffee. You may need less. DEFINITELY get the 12 pack!!! Best value and you'll be amazed at how much you start using it!

review/summary: This can make you sick.
review/text: About 30-40% of the population of Central Europe has trouble digesting fructose.  If you have trouble digesting fructose, it can cause a lot of unexplained abdominal pain.<br /><br />This is almost 100% fructose.<br /><br />Personally, I spent about two months with very bad, mysterious abdominal pain that seemed to be everywhere. After several weeks of doctor visits, discussions about IBS, and an abdominal ultrasound that came up normal, I started thinking about what was different in my diet:  I had been using agave nectar in my tea several times a day.  After throwing out the agave nectar and looking online for a list of lower fructose food, I changed my diet, a little.<br /><br />The pain went away in a matter of days, and hasn't returned.<br /><br />If you're using agave nectar and you have suddenly started having digestive issues, try getting rid of the agave nectar.  For some people, this is really bad stuff.<br /><br />Note:  There is some indication that IBS is actually fructose intolerance.  If this makes you sick, it might just be the fructose.

review/summary: Not tonight, honey.
review/text: When you want a syrupy sweetener that's delightfully neutral in flavor and doesn't threaten to put you in sugar shock, agave nectar is a good choice. Other syrups like honey and maple contribute a strong taste component to the foods they sweeten. Agave nectar seems to fade into the background providing only a mild enhancement for your foods and beverages. If you want more personality, by all means add a spice or extract.

Boy, am I glad I did buy the whole box!  We use this in everything, including baking, and find that it has a really good taste.  Most sweetners ruin the taste of our fine coffees, but the agave simply supplies sweetness.  We'll be trying the amber agave next in hopes of a heartier sweetness for winter baked goods.

review/summary: Great sweetener.
review/text: Agave is a healthy alternative to corn syrup and regular sugar.  Madhava provides a brilliantly packaged product at an affordable price.  Honey has that annoying tendency to spill over the sides and crystallize.  This product has a great pointed spout which stays clean without any effort.<br /><br />Use this product in an amount slightly less than regular honey, as it is a little sweeter.  Can be used in baking, or just right on top of oatmeal or pancakes.  Nutritionally superior to traditionally processed sugar and cultivated without disturbing any honey bees, agave is the ecologically sound way to sweeten your foods.<br /><br />Madhava delivers all of this to you in a conveniently sized bottle.

I then had my husband taste it because he doesn't like artificial sweeteners, and he loved it, too!  It will come in handy on the Perricone Weight Loss diet, because of it's low glycemic index.

review/text: Updated Nov. 2008 -- believe it or not, the last two shipments I received do NOT have the impossible-to-open seal!  So the company DOES listen to their customer's comments!  I wish I could change my rating to 5 stars....<br /><br />Original review: The only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that they've changed the seal and it is now almost impossible to get the new seal off!  I've contacted them but I doubt they'll listen.<br /><br />That said, I've just started a subscription for this because, inspite of the seal, it has replaced sugar in our house.  It has virtually no taste (we use it in everything -- coffee, mixed drinks, dessert sauces, etc...), it dissolves instantly, and has a low glycemic index which means fewer hot flashes.  We (family of 2) go through about one bottle a week.<br /><br />The Amazon price, especially if you subscribe or have prime shipping, is the lowest I've found.

review/summary: Not what I expected , but ok
review/text: I didn't see that ths agave was a light color. I had bought the dark one (same company, same ounces ) at my  local health food store for over $4 a bottle. The light one is not as sweet and is a little thiner, so you use twice as much!

review/summary: Not RAW Misleading Title
review/text: They have this listed as RAW. It is not raw and should not be listed as such. There is nothing wrong with it. To be considered raw it should not be heated above about 115 degrees, I believe that is the correct number. Amazon should change the label on this. They used to sell the RAW kind and for some reason, it is not available. The title is therefore misleading.

review/summary: Great Sugar Substitute
review/text: Unless further research reveals that agave syrup has a higher glycemic index rating that previously thought, this sweetener can be used as a substitute for other sugary items.  It works well for sweetening tea and coffee and is thick enough to be used on pancakes.  The light syrup doesn't have an odd taste or aftertaste - the taste is very similar to a simple syrup made from sugar and water.
