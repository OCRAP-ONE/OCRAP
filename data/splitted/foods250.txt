review/summary: great product
review/text: I'd like to first make a note, after reading other reviews, I hesitated to buy this pumpkin because of issues with dented cans. When I received my order, every can was in perfect condition, and well packaged.<br />As far as the product goes, I love this pumpkin for baking purposes. I make excellent pumpkin muffins with this and when I ran out and used conventional pumpkin, I was disappointed. So, we are hooked on this pumpkin, it's a must have for my muffins.<br />I did read in other reviews that some folks that feed pumpkin to their dogs didn't like this product, and I will say that my dog who has digestive issues does better on the conventional pumpkin (I believe it has more fiber than the organic), and she doesn't like this kind much. But I'm not basing my 5 star review on my dog. She can eat conventional and we will eat the organic.

review/summary: Better taste, organic, and not a dent in the box
review/text: I was so happy to see all twelve cans in pristine condition and with "use by" dates two years off stamped on the tops.  Another highly pleasant surprise came when I had my first taste.  This pumpkin is without a doubt better tasting than Libby's.  With the Subscribe and Save discount, this superior product actually costs a tad less than what I pay for Libby's at my local store.  And with the added convenience of home delivery!  I use a couple cans each week because it is loaded with nutrients and fiber and being a thick puree it is very useful in creating good things to eat.  I have put about a tablespoon on a dish for my cat twice and she ate it up both times which rather amazed me.

review/summary: Dented cans
review/text: The pumpkin is good, but 7 out of the 12 cans arrived dented (and not just little dents).  I read that dents aren't a big deal unless they are at the seams of the cans (which most of these are at the top or the bottom). Would have been a good deal, but I'm definitely disappointed.  Like other reviews said, these dents don't appear to be from them being shipped as cans that were even packaged in the middle were dented, makes you think they are selling the companies "seconds" or something.

review/summary: great pumpkin
review/text: We love pumpkin soup and eat it year round, not just during "pumpkin season".  And I make a pumpkin macaroni and cheese that even company raves about.  Normally I wouldn't serve mac and cheese to company, but this particular recipe is definitely 5 star quality. (I do not make pumpkin pie - don't like it.)<br /><br />I was really happy to find this brand on Amazon in 2011 for half of the price I pay through my food club when the product is on special sale.....and about 1/3 of the price that is charged when it's not on sale.<br /><br />It's really good pumpkin.  My original review gave this pumpkin only 4 stars because at that time it didn't come in a BPA free can.  It is now October, 2012 and I recently received a second case from Amazon and was delighted to read "BPA FREE" on the label.<br /><br />Thanks, Farmers Market, for caring about our health!  You earned your 5th star.<br /><br />The pumpkin is still a very good price now in 2012 IF you order it in the "frustration free packaging" from Amazon, but only slightly less than my food club.  But, hey, pennies count!

review/summary: GREAT Organic Pumpkin delivered with NO damaged cans!
review/text: I ordered this pumpkin because my cat needs it in his diet. The first time I ordered many months ago, half the case was damaged, the company was having "packaging issues". But they assured me (their customer support was fantastic! Extremely nice, helpful, and friendly, and they made it right just as promised!) that they would take care of everything and they did, fast too! I originally ordered because it was "organic", which is very hard to find in the stores! I reordered when I was getting low. I received the case, the cans were perfect, and because of this product, my cat is alive and well! It was VERY important that my cat have this, so yes, I am VERY thankful they are still selling this product! I will continue to order it as long as I need it! THANK YOU VERY MUCH FARMERS MARKET FOODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Chris

review/summary: Is this manufacturer using Amazon to close out damaged cans?
review/text: Our dog gets pumpkin in every meal -- if yours does too, you know why.  You also know that one can only stash so many cans of pumpkin, and that somewhere in the spring most supermarkets start running out of canned pumpkin and can't get more or stop ordering it (understandably).  So, I was happy to see this product on Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers experienced, many of the cans arrived dented. In fact ALL 12 CANS were dented, most severely so.  Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink-wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.<br /><br />This clearly indicates that the manufacturer -- or whomever wrapped the cases -- shipped already and obviously damaged cans.  I checked the product listing and there is no mention of these being seconds.  My message to manufacturer, distributor and/or Amazon: check the product or change the description so people know they are taking their chances.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon customer service came through with an offer to replace or refund.  I'm giving this one more shot for my dog's sake, and will hope for the best.

review/summary: 8 of 12 Cans Very Badly Damaged (Dents)
review/text: Being unable to find canned pumpkin in any of my local stores, I held my breath (after reading the mixed reviews and mentions of damaged cans), took a chance and ordered a 12 pack.  Of the 12 cans, only 2 arrived undamaged.  Another 2 had small dents, which shouldn't affect the product or make opening the cans a problem.  Unfortunately, the 8 remaining cans are too badly dented to use.  Dents deep enough to have bent the cans sideways, and in the case of top dents, probably make it difficult/impossible to fully open with can opener. These will be discarded. Since some of the cans are dented on the top while others on the bottom, and the two undented cans were on an OUTSIDE row and the most severely dented on the INSIDE row, it appears that the cans were dented prior to packaging and not damaged in shipping.<br /><br />It is disappointing to see that damaged product is still a problem so many months after the first reviews called attention to the issue but an Amazon customer service rep. promised that someone would look into the issue to try to ascertain just where the damage is happening.  I haven't actually tried the pumpkin in the any of the 4 'safe' cans yet, so my review isn't based on the actual quality of the pumpkin but given the outrageously bad condition of the packaging there's no way I could rate this higher.

review/text: I received Farmers Market Organic Pumpkin 12 pack yesterday. 5 out of 12 cans were pretty badly dented, another 2 not quite so bad. Packaging was not damaged and cans were bubble wrapped inside the box so it wasnt packaging or delivery. These cans were sold and shipped already dented. Don't blame UPS. I will keep and use them they are dated 2013,however this is hardly what I paid for ???? . Someone is obviously taking full advantage of the pumpkin shortage to unload their dented can inventory.

review/summary: Ridiculously Dented and Damanged Cans
review/text: We eat pumpkin on a regular basis and it gets hard this time of year when all of the stores are sold out.<br /><br />I saw reviews here on Amazon saying the cans were dented, but saw that someone from the manufacturer had responded so I figured the problem had been addressed.<br /><br />NOT SO.  I received a case of these cans and it was wrapped extremely well - bubble wrap all over the place.  However, the cans INSIDE the case were dented and damaged - I don't mean a little dented, I mean several of the cans had their entire sides caved in in such a way that I could not open one can and on another can I couldn't remove all the pumpkin because the can was smashed so badly.<br /><br />Those most damaged cans were packaged in the middle of the case - seemingly intentionally disguising how badly damaged they were.  The cans on the outside were relatively OK, ALL of them were dented a little - every single can - but the ones on the outside were MUCH less damaged than the ones on the inside.<br /><br />I don't see how this could have been accidental, although anything is possible.<br /><br />The quality of the pumpkin itself was good, but I don't like using damaged cans in case the food inside has been compromised.

review/summary: A good price for a good product.
review/text: First, I want to review the product itself. I've used this brand of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market brands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the "ready to ship" flat of cans that were pre-packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way. I wouldn't have hesitated to purchase the cans off of a store shelf in this condition since the product is in very short supply, so it isn't a problem for me.

We use pumpkin daily, as an addition to our dogs' diets, in order to keep their digestive systems in peak condition.  And Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin is exceptional.

review/text: I HAD to have pumpkin for my dogs so I rolled the dice after reading the mixed, but mostly dissatisfied reviews. One third of the cans were very dented. However, none were bulging which is the sign of spoiled food. We are using the dented ones first without issue - on the third of four right now.<br />I must agree that it looks like a manufacturers "error". The dented cans were hidden in the middle of the case, surrounded by good cans. I would bet my last dollar that Farmers Market Foods is using Amazon to dump what they knew wouldn't sell on the supermarket shelves!<br />Lastly, I will purchase this item again, dents or no dents and use it unless it's bulging. But it's unnerving knowing that something sneaky is going on at an organic food manufacturer.

review/summary: All Cans Dented.
review/text: All of my cans were dented.  Some cans had multiple dents.<br />If we were told that and / or if they were discounted, I could<br />make the choice; however, this was just a case of a manufacturer<br />making extra money on dented cans and taking advantage of the customers.<br /><br />GDn

review/text: I'm one of the lucky ones who did not receive any damaged or crushed cans, though, I would not have cared at this point since I was desperate for pumpkin.  I needed the pumpkin for my dogs.  I do, however, notice that it does not work as well for them (their anal glands) the way the regular pumpkin does (Libby's) but I like the fact that they are getting organic.

review/summary: Finally, I have pumpkin!
review/text: Like some of the other reviews, my cans were a bit dented in spite of the excellent packaging.  But just a tad, not enough to be concerned about the contents inside.  I've purchased organic pumpkin before from local stores, and it was a little watery, so that's probably one of the differences in regular pumpkin and organic.<br /><br />My dog and cat both need pumpkin to help express their anal glands, and the pumpkin is much cheaper and easier (especially on the cat) then taking them to the vet every few weeks.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon!

In the past 6 months it has been very hard to find 100% pumpkin in the stores so I started ordering it.<br /><br />It's also good for humans -- pumpkin pie is very healthy and low fat, if made in that fashion.

review/summary: Damaged/Bent cans
review/text: Ordered a 12 pack of 15 ounce cans of pumpkin.  Received the order and about 10 of the cans were dented or bent (some severely).  The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping.  The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box.  It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans.  I considered returning the order but needed it right away.  I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies.  The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable.  I do not intend to order from this vendor again.

Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans, not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family, but we really do not eat pumpkin!  An added plus was free shipping.  I would buy this again.

Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat!

review/text: My cats are canned pumpkin connoisseurs, though I do wonder about their street cred because they like the awful crud in Libby and other generic store brands.  That said, this brand got a paws up from all of them.  The crazy critters will lick it off a spoon when I open a can.  Once opened though, the magic is gone.  It returns once mixed with their raw meat. :)<br /><br />I use this brand for my pumpkin recipes because it tastes fresh and is not watery.  I'm fortunate to have received intact cans, so I'm sorry to read of others' experiences.  The product though is excellent quality.

review/summary: great quality at a good price -- and so happy that I found this!
review/text: I had been searching far and wide for canned pumpkin, but to no avail until I came across this product.  Until finding it on Amazon, I had never heard of this brand before.  After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but I love pumpkin, so I placed my order.<br /><br />The items came in less than a week (I ordered right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend).  Every can but one (which had the slightest dent) was in excellent condition.  The cans were packed in a cardboard tray, shrink wrapped and then bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.<br /><br />The taste is just right to me -- pumpkin, not too light or too strong.  The consistency is not too thin or too thick, but again, just right. The quality is comparable to (if not better than) its brand name competitor.  The product is organic pumpkin, period.<br /><br />My compliments and gratitude to Farmer's Market Foods. This was my first experience with this product, but I assure you, it will not be my last!

review/text: There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online.  Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.  Yes, I was desperate for pumpkin.  It's watery.  It's not solid packed.  And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par.  I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation - otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something - they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so!  Amazon took it back and I'm sure will be crediting my money.  I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER COMMENTS before I purchased this.  Beware of dented cans.

review/summary: Love this but one teeny complaint....
review/text: ....and it is not related to the product, so the product itself gets 5 stars. I ordered this because the price was comparable to non-organic brands in my local supermarket. Thrilled, I did 'Subscribe and Save'. I fully expected the expiry to be soon, as is often the case with Amazon, but the stamped date was a flmost 3 years from now, yaayyyyy! It is wonderful pumpkin, and a safer can than most brands, double yaayyyy! Not one dented can, another surprise. However, now that I set up auto-ship, the price zoomed up. That seems to happen a lot. I'll probably cancel if it doesn't go back down a bit when I need more.

review/summary: a cure for the dog from Amazon
review/text: My dog sometimes gets an upset stomach. The vet recommended that I feed Buddy rice and pumpkin to get him regulated again. Buddy is a large 100+ Golden Retriever. I didn't want to give him just any kind of pumpkin so looked for an organic one. He loves it - and it makes me feel good about giving it to him.

review/text: Considering the shortage that we have had on pumpkin this last year, it was a blessing to see it available and at a good price. Yes some of the cans were dented, but big deal. My dog and I were able to enjoy. I hope it comes back out for purchase soon. I don't care about dented cans.

review/summary: Good for babies
review/text: I bought this for my 10-month old son.  He loves pumpkin and I ran out of the fresh pumpkin I pureed and froze.  He didn't like another brand so I thought I'd try this one.  He likes it a lot and it serves its purpose.  My only complaint is that it has chunks of pumpkin skin in it.  Some of the pieces are large enough that I have to fish them out so my son doesn't choke on it.  Other than that, it's exactly as advertised and when we run out of the first order, I will buy more.

review/summary: Terrible for Pie!
review/text: The first time I used this pumpkin, my pie was TERRIBLE (goupy, flavorless), and I figured I must have done something wrong. I made my next pie with Libby's, and it was perfect. So I decided to try the EXACT SAME RECIPE with the Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin again tonight. AWFUL!! Watery, miserable. I let the pie bake longer, in the hopes that it might thicken up, but it's still goupy and doesn't taste pumpkin-y at all.<br /><br />The pumpkin itself was thin and lumpy as I mixed the ingredients, and while I think I managed to work out the lumps, it just wasn't very "pumpkin-y" smelling or tasting.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy this product again. I prefer "natural" and organic alternatives, and I know that they can sometimes require recipe adjustments, but this is just unacceptable.<br /><br />"Certified Organic" apparently doesn't always mean a better product!

If you just put about 25% of the sugar usually in a pumpkin pie and a graham cracker crust you have an extremely healthy and tasty dinner dish.<br /><br />Can't say much other than it is what I expected. I love pumpkin.<br /><br />As far as the reviews complaining about dented cans go... none of mine were dented, but who really cares anyway? As long as an opener will still open it, it really makes no difference.

review/text: Initially, this product was priced fairly ($15.51 for 12 cans) and a quality product.  No dented cans noted.  However, it should be noted that the price hiked 150% in 1 month.  Regardless of the current economy, what was a fair price, quickly became ridiculous. I will not purchase this product again.

review/text: True, the cans often have very minor dents (why they're at Amazon), but at least with the ones I bought the top rims were fine, so you can certainly still open them with a can opener.  Given that we need this for our dog who requires in his diet and there is no longer any available locally, this is wonderful to get delivered for what it cost in the stores.  Pretty tasty and good for people too!

Taylor's Market belongs to Amazon's Marketplace sellers group. Amazon is not responsible for dented cans not shipped out by them. I would not accept severely dented cans. If the seal breaks and air gets in the can & sits in a hot UPS truck, voila, you have ptomaine poison in your can. It happened to me when I was a kid and it's not fun (severe stomach pain & everything else you can imagine). You can even croak from it. Amazon does a terrific job. I buy all my groceries from them, so please, blame the seller, don't blame a good company that always attempts to do their best.  I'm giving this product five stars because the pumpkin is excellent; have been buying it for years at a local gourmet & organic store.  Now I'm buying it from Amazon.

review/summary: 3 Cases Arrived Safely, 1 Did Not
review/text: After reading all the reviews and comments on the dented cans, I wasn't sure I should order the pumpkin on Amazon. However I took the chance. Amazon is my favorite place to shop.  This is the  pumpkin that I buy at our grocery store.  It is for my 18 yr old cat and it keeps her regular. This is her favorite brand. Also I'm hearing that there is a possibility that canned pumpkin might be hard to find on the shelves after Thanksgiving because of the rains. So I wanted to stock up. I remember a couple of months ago  it was hard to find in some areas.<br /><br />I received the order yesterday and was a little scared to open it up.  But it was fine!! The cans arrived in great condition.  There was a tiny dent on maybe 2 or 3 cans (just like I might find on the grocery shelf). I was very happy with my order.  Maybe it has something to do with the warehouse it is shipping from.  I live in CA and Ontrac delivered it. I've been so impressed with Ontrac. Amazon has been using them alot lately.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered 2 more cases and hope they arrive in the same condition.  The date on the cans is 6/2012. The price per can on Amazon is $2.36. In our store it is $2.99 and when on sale, maybe $2.50.<br /><br />I received 2 more cases that I ordered and they were in perfect condition.  Now I'm all stocked up in case it is hard to find pumpkin on the shelf next year.<br /><br />12/08/09 UPDATE:  I believe it matters on who is delivering the order.  I ordered one more case. For some reason this case was delivered by UPS (the others were all delivered by Ontrac) and some of the cans were VERY  badly dented and cannot be used. I asked for a refund.  No matter who is delivering these cans, Amazon needs  to put some protective packing around the cans so they don't get dented. I will no longer take a chance and order similar products on Amazon.

review/summary: Great product no dents was a great purchase and value!!!
review/text: Strong positives:<br /><br />Here is my assessment on buying 3 cases of this product as a cook:<br />1. This is a very strong value on an organic product<br />- Nearly 60% to my local Whole Foods<br /><br />2. Organic products don't act or cook like the mass produced brand but the difference is in the organic nature of these items.<br />- Our experience cooking for over 50 people and over 12 pies so far is they all tasted fine and didn't see any issues in consistency.<br /><br />3. Dented cans, 36 cans purchased and no dents.<br /><br />4. Lastly, beyond the value it was organic with a shelf life on our cans into late 2013.  So while I'm sure the cans we have left will be gone by then the reality was this was a great deal at better than 60% off to my local organic store.<br /><br />Great product and value, glad it was an offered program wish there were more organic items on amazon.com.

review/summary: Farmer's Market is clearly packing dented cans and marketing them through Amazon.com
review/text: Like most of the US, our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So, I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake, I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product, knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase.

review/summary: So disappointed in canned pumpkin
review/text: I read the last few reviews indicating no dented cans and hoped for the best.  My box arrived today and I too received badly damaged, dented and unusable cans.  I'm not terribly picky but most cans are dented at the rims/seams and all are badly smashed all over.  This was my last hope for canned pumpkin for my dog.  I do not believe the Amazon packaging is the problem. The cans were already dented prior to being shrink-wrapped.  I do not believe stores would put these cans on their shelves and I would never buys cans with this much damage. I have never been unhappy with an Amazon purchase, but this product was a waste of my time.

review/summary: Good pumpkin, BUT too many heavily dented cans!
review/text: I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  "caveat emptor."

review/summary: every can was dented
review/text: I am SO disappointed.  Even though I read many reviews complaining of dented cans, I took a chance because of the pumpkin shortage & my family's regular use of pumpkin (a "superfood"!)  But I just received the package, which seemed to be packed sufficiently, yet once I opened it up fully, every single can was dented.  Some severely.  Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.  The only thing I can figure is that the manufacturer is using this a way to get rid of damaged cans, because nobody would pick a can up in the store that looked like the cans I received.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon customer service and I'm sure they will come through for me - I have never had a problem dealing with them.  But beware if you are buying this product.  Maybe the dented cans were just a fluke but all 12...???<br /><br />**update: Amazon customer service was a breeze to deal with and sent me a new case and again, EVERY can was dented.  Some severely.  I won't try again.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Not as good as Libby's; cans in bad condition
review/text: There have been ongoing problems with dented and leaking cans with this product.  But my dogs HAVE to have it for their digestion, so I ordered a case somewhat reluctantly.<br /><br />In the first shipment I received, the cans were so badly dented that they looked like they had either been dropped from a considerable height or beaten with machetes.  One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE - and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage -- otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.<br /><br />Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.<br /><br />That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.  It's very watery, and there are black flecks throughout.  I wouldn't use it for pies, but the dogs don't seem to care and it does them no harm.

review/text: My son loves pumpkin muffins.  Can't find any Libby pumpkin in Cincinnati, OH.  Tried this hoping it would be the same and it wasn't.  Too much water in can maybe.  Didn't taste the same and wouldn't even feed the rest to my dog.  Do not waste money.

review/summary: Delicious Pumpkin--and NO Dented Cans!
review/text: After reading all the dented-can reviews, I was a little hesitant to order. But the price was much less than locally available canned pumpkin...so decided to give it a try. The cans arrived boxed tightly within a much larger box...packing care was evident and not a single can was dented. Have used this pumpkin to make the most awesome pumpkin pancakes. Just stir it into pancake mix and add a little water/milk and microwave for a vitamin-packed indulgent treat. After reading articles on the benefits of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, this makes organic pumpkin a no-brainer...and totally delicious, too!! WINNER WINNER!!

review/summary: Compared to another brand
review/text: I use a lot of pumpkin.  I especially enjoy it mixed in my morning oatmeal and my little dog considers it a real treat.<br /><br />I was leery of purchasing this product because of the some of the negative reviews so after opening my first can of Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin, I felt obliged to do a review.<br /><br />I am so glad that I ignored the negative reviews.  I happened to have a can of Libby's pumpkin puree (my usual brand) already open so it was easy to do a comparison.  The Farmer's Market pumpkin seemed a little creamier and the color was very similar but perhaps just a shade less bright.  To my palate, it seemed to have a slightly earthier taste, more like sweet potato but when I added cinnamon and sweetener, it was impossible to detect a difference.<br /><br />None of the cans were dented and the expiration date of October 2013 is almost three years in the future.  I am very happy with this purchase and delighted that it is offered on subscribe and save since pumpkin puree is not something all grocery stores routinely stock in the off season.

review/summary: Damaged cans??
review/text: I just received a shipment of Farmer's Market Pumpkin (12/15oz cans) and was very pleased with the condition of the cans.  Outside and inside cardboard cases were in excellent condition.  Of the 12 cans, 2 were slightly damaged (no worse than some found in my local grocery stores!) and the other 10 were unscathed.  I was worried after reading all the horror stories [above] and so I am very happy with my own experience.  Would not hesitate to order again.

review/summary: YUP, most of cans are dented.
review/text: yes, most of the cans arrive dented, so if you are fearful of that, don't get it.  But pumpkin is hard to find in the stores other than in fall, so if you like to extend your pumpkin usage to other seasons, this is a good buy.  Definitely good quality for feeding dogs or making bread or ....pumpkin fudge!  Yum!

review/summary: Good quality, but you're paying for it.
review/text: This was the only pumpkin I found at a time when I needed it.  It's a good quality prouduct, maybe a bit lighter in color and texture than popular brands.  It worked wonderfully in my pumpkin rolls.  I usually spend alot less on canned pumpkin, but it was delivered very quiclky, no dents or dings in the cans or packaging.  Overall I'm satisfied.

review/summary: All of the cans were badly dented
review/text: The quality of the pumpkin itself is quite good.  However, it was just shipped out in the warehouse carton and all of the cans were badly dented.  I won't order this item again.

review/summary: Excellent value
review/text: I buy Farmer's Market organic pumpkin to mix in with my dog's meals.  I've seen the comments about dented cans and have to say that I think it's the manufacturer.  When I buy in the store I always have to sift through the cans to find the least damaged.  The metal seems to be pretty thin.  My Amazon order was in much better shape than the cans I've seen in the stores.  Price is good too.  Locally, I've seen this product priced between $2.39 and $3.69 a can.  And even though the Amazon price is only pennies less a can than my lowest local price, it's incredibly convenient; especially with the free shipping.
