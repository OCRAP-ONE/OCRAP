review/summary: Consistent quality, our "main squeeze" brew
review/text: We've tried so many K cups, and we keep coming back to Tully's French Roast. It is great both black and with cream, and the flavor is always strong but never bitter. Sometimes I want even more of a bite than this offers, so then I'll reach for Timothy's Magic Mountain. But on the whole, if we could only buy one type of K cup for our Keurig, it would be this one.

review/summary: My Favorite Coffee - Strong, Bold, and Delicious!
review/text: I tried just about every kind of K-cup, looking for my perfect coffee. After trying, Tullys French Roast, I just started enjoying it and stopped looking. I wanted coffee that was dark, rich, bold, and enjoyable. This did it for me. I recommend it.<br /><br />EDITED to say that Tully's Kona coffee is great as well. Which is my favorite now? I'm not sure. Both are delicious!<br /><br />EDITED once more months later to say that my favorites are now:<br /><br />1) Italian<br />2) French<br />3) House<br />4) Kona if I want something with a very strong taste.

review/summary: Strong taste
review/text: This is, as advertised, extra bold in taste. Maybe a bit too bold in fact.<br /><br />I don't really like bland coffee. I prefer a bolder taste, and this product delivers. In fact, as the French version has it, it may be a bit too "tres intense." There is some harshness to the taste, as my palate experiences this.<br /><br />Still, I'd rather too bold rather than too bland. . . .

review/text: This is my all time favorite.  As other reviews have said, good strong flavor, but not bitter.  No cream necessary!  My only complaint is the price.  I first started ordering this about three years ago.  The price then was about $22.  It then jumped to $29, then back down to $26.  Now, six months later it's $31.  Thanks to the other reviews, I ordered from Costco for about 10 cents per cup cheaper.

It tastes old, like it's been sitting for hours after brewing.  Not sure what Tully's did differently but now I'm stuck with 6 boxes of undrinkable k-cups because Amazon doesn't take returns on food.  Ugh!!  The "sell by" date on my boxes is March 2012.

review/summary: The Best Keurig K-Cup Coffee I've Found So Far
review/text: Tully's French Roast K-Cups make the best coffee I've so far tasted from a Keurig Coffee Maker.  There are many good coffees out there, but to my taste the French Roast has the kick I need.  Because of an attenuated sense of taste (autoimmune problems) I need coffee that has more than the average kick so that I can actually taste the coffee, and Tully's does the job.  My wife, who possesses normal, or beyond a normal sense of taste, agrees with me that this is excellent coffee.  No, it's not for those who like a mild tasting coffee, but unlike a comment I read in another review, it doesn't taste at all like an ashtray smells....not at all!  This is seriously good coffee, and if you like strong tasting coffee, give this a try.  I doubt that you'll be disappointed.*****UPDATE***** It's been about 2 years since I started using Tully"s French Roast K-Cups, and I thought I might add to my original comments.  Having tried at least 3 other brands of French Roast coffee, from San Francisco Bay, to Starbucks, and one other brand, the name of which escapes me at the moment, and I can say that Tully's makes the best of the four.  San Francisco Bay is a close number 2, but Tully's beats it out.  It is hard for me to believe that Starbucks would come in number 3 in a taste test, but it did.  If you like French Roast, by all means try the others if you like to experiment, but if not, take my recommendation and go with Tully's French Roast.  You won't go wrong.  It is a perfect cup of coffee every time!

review/summary: Strong and Bold, But Still Certainly Bitter
review/text: While the French Roast tastes nice with cream and sugar (as does almost any coffee,) the Tully's brand of French Roast served black is almost flavorless aside from its bitter aftertaste. Nearly every K-Cup tastes good served with cream and sugar; French Roast tastes poor when served black. I suggest another flavor.

review/text: I prefer strong coffee with a smooth taste.  Tully's French Roast is strong but has a bitter aftertaste that only goes away if you use half-and-half (the bad coffee transformer).  It's just bad for your cholesterol and waistline if you use it every day, just to finish the batch of coffee I bought.<br /><br />My favorite was Coffee People Organic K-Cups but it's no longer available.  The second best is Coffee People Donut Shop K-Cups, but they're more expensive then Tully's French Roast (at Costco).

review/text: I had almost given up on my Keurig when I stumbled upon this one in the variety pack that came with the machine. Finally, something that tasted like REAL coffee! Bold, rich, balanced, delicious. If you like bold coffee this is a must try. I was pretty disappointed in the other K-cups I sampled. They all seemed somewhat watery and lacking in any texture or body. Tully's French Roast is the first I've tried that approximates a freshly ground cup of strong coffee. It's smoky and intense and overall very satisfying. Love it!

review/summary: Tully's French Roast K cups
review/text: I have had my Keurig coffee maker for over 2 years, in fact I replaced my original on its two year anniversary due to our water's mineral content but that is another story.  Over the past two years I have tried many of the different coffees.  My initial favorite was Donut Shop which tasted very much like Dunkin Donuts coffee.  I was diagnosed with high cholesterol in early 2011 so I started drinking my coffee black and I found the Donut shop K cups to be very bland.  I started trying a number of different K Cups and found Tully's French Roast.  This is now my favorite coffee, it is very dark and has an intense rich set of flavors.  I am not a professional taster so I won't try and describe the different flavors but suffice it to say it has a rich depth of flavors that I look forward to each morning.  It reminds me of a good red wine like a Cabernet, where there are a number of different subtle flavors that linger in your mouth long after you swallow.  I enjoy it, I hope you do as well.<br />Paul Speese<br />Regular Coffee Drinker

review/text: I only drink strong, bold coffee and this was strong but there was something slightly off about it.  Another reviewer said it had an almost bitter, fishy taste to it and that's the best description I could come up with also.  I expect some bitterness because of the type of coffee I like but the fishy, past it's prime taste was unexpected.  It wasn't the coffee maker because my daughter chose another flavor and it was spot on.  As I said in another review for this coffee...the sell by date was 15 more days out so maybe it was past its prime.

review/summary: Great Brew, just what a French Roast Should be.
review/text: Tully's French Roast is described by the maker as being intense and powerful with a bitter end. Traditionally a French Roast should be light smokey-burnt and maybe a little sweet with light to medium body with intense flavor. Tully's French Roast fulfills the above description very well. It's surprisingly smooth and balanced with no harsh or unexpected bitterness. Th Aroma wasn't as strong as I would expect, but did have burnt undertones which is a hallmark of a French Roast. However, the aroma isn't one that will catch your attention the way others will.<br /><br />Aroma: 3<br /><br />Sweetness: 3<br /><br />Acidity: 5<br /><br />Body: 4<br /><br />Bitterness: 5<br /><br />Aftertaste: 4<br /><br />Total: 90<br /><br />Scoring Summary:<br />(90-99) Very Awesome Coffee<br />(85-89) Very Good Coffee<br />(78-84) Just Average Coffee<br />(50-77) Just Poor Coffee

review/summary: Comparing Tully's and Green Mountain French Roast
review/text: In order to figure out which brand I should buy in the future I compared Tully's French Roast and Green Mountain French Roast k-cups side-by-side.  Results: Tully's has a more full bodied flavor, whereas Green Mountain has a thinner flavor (I can almost describe it as "more watery" but that wouldn't be the right word, but it is missing something).  I'm going to get Tully's from now on.  This k-cup tastes like a finely brewed French Roast with the full thickness and spectrum of texture and flavor.

review/summary: Better than Starbuck's French Roast
review/text: For the last few years, I've ground my own Starbucks French Roast in my coffee maker.  When the coffee maker broke, I ordered the Breville K-Cup coffee maker (a great productBreville BKC700XL Gourmet K-Cup Single-Serve Coffeemaker With Coffee Cups And Perfect Pod Holster).  To my dismay, Starbucks doesn't offer k-cups.  I order the filter baskets, and attempted the make your own cups.  Just didn't taste up to par.<br /><br />Online, I noticed folks were comparing Tully's with Starbucks, so I ordered them.  Wow, am I sold.  Tully's is fabulous.  Starbucks lost a customer and Tully's gained one.  The taste of this coffee is superb.  Bold, strong and flavorful.  I am so glad I ordered the 2-pack.  I'll be back for more!

review/summary: Burnt Offerings
review/text: I have a Keurig B60 and have used it with a variety of coffee 'k cups' for several months now.  I was a little disappointed in the Tully French Roast.<br /><br />Now let me quantify that I  I tend to like my coffee "light and sweet".  I also find French Roasts to typically be among my least favorite types of coffee.<br /><br />I do sometimes opt for a bold cup of java.  However, I find the Tully French Roast to be more bitter than bold.  I've tired different cup size setting on the Keurig, but the Tully French Roast keeps resulting in a bitter cup of coffee.  It really had a burnt taste to it.<br /><br />I went so far as to run the same k cup through the Keurig twice to see if the Tully coffee was simply too bold for my taste.  I realize k cups are not intended for re-use but I was trying to figure out if the coffee was just too bold for my taste or really just bitter.<br /><br />SEE TIP AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW.<br /><br />While the second cup of coffee was on the weak side, it was still drinkable....however, just like the first, it was bitter.<br /><br />Where the Keurig is concerned I have found the best bold cups to be the Newman's Own Organic "Extra Bold" and the Emeril's "Big Easy Bold".<br /><br />Again, while not a huge fan of French Roast, I liked the Timothy's World "French Roast"; that brand is what you would expect, a nice cup of bold coffee.  The Tully's - just bitter.<br /><br />TIP:  While you probably don't want to reuse k cups as a regular practice, it does not hurt the machine, so if you like your coffee mild or want to cut down on costs, here is what you do.  Brew a cup of coffee using the k cup of your choice.  Then, go through the brewing process again: simply leave the used k cup in and lift and reclose the handle when the unit displayed 'Ready To Brew'.  This is best done with the small cup setting, otherwise your coffee will not be mild, but just plain weak.

review/summary: Better than adagio's other teas
review/text: There used to be a small tea store near my house which was absolutely amazing. After they went out of business, I tried to find similar teas online. I tried Adagio's dewey cherry, mango melange, hazelnut rooibos, apricot rooibos, and chocolate chai.<br /><br />The dewey cherry is pretty good.  It has a nice blend of sweet and tangy flavors.  This one is worth your while.  The others were disappointments.<br /><br />When I opened the mango melange, I felt like I'd been hit in the face by someone spraying perfume samples at a department store.  The effect was a little better once the tea was brewed. I plan to drink it all before I go looking for my next tea, but the next one won't be from adagio.<br /><br />Their flavored rooibos teas had the same problem -- the hazelnut and apricot extracts were so overpowering and cloying I couldn't taste the rooibus. In their chocolate chai, you can't taste the chocolate, the ginger, or the tea; it's just a wall of cinnamon extract. I may actually throw out the chai without finishing it.<br /><br />So the dewey cherry is pretty good, and the other herbals are drinkable, but stay away from adagio if you care at all about the complexity of flavor in your tea.

review/summary: #2 favorite flavor pop-tart
review/text: I'm not a fan of pop-tarts in general, but they're an awesome energy packed snack. It's 400 easily digested calories in a convenient foil pack (if you eat both). I take a pack with me on mountain bike outings and I ride 1-2 hours on average and typically eat one once I get close to 1 hour in, to ensure I have some energy, and another at 1:45 or 2 hours to maybe allow a 3rd hour (which my ass typically gets too sore to continue beyond).<br /><br />This flavor is awesome and the does a good job surviving inside my pack. It really does kind of taste like a big Oreo. This is one of the 3 flavors I can stand, the others being frosted brown sugar and cinnamon and Smores. I like my pop tarts cold or at room temp, but not hot from the toaster and these are no exception. This flavor is definitely the more edible kind of pop tar and a shame to be considered used for tiling your roof with.<br /><br />Recommended! I'm going to try dunking it into cold milk next time.

review/summary: Fresh, fast & a good value, but....
review/text: This is the second coffee I have tried from Coffee Bean direct, and my experience has been similar with the 2.  It is fresh and aromatic, arrived quickly and is a good value, but not as good as coffee I have gotten from other roasters.<br />Celebes kalossi is one of my favorites beans; generally a bright full bodied cofee which is not acidic.  The beans I got from coffee bean direct were fresh & oily, but roasted a little too dark, a bit bitter and not as bright as the other Celebes I have had.  Given that I can not get it locally at all, and stopped ordering from another online coffee shop when they raised their shipping rates (effectively doubling the cost of the coffee) it leaves me in a quandry.  I was going to order some4 Tanzanian Peaberry, my other favorite, but having been a little disappointed with the yergecheffe, I am up in the air on that one.  I see they carry Kenya AB, which I have never seen before (only Kenya AA) and have to wonder if they are buying lower quality beans? (certainly that is what would be indicated by the lower quality Kenya coffee).  Before I saw that I thought perhaps the roast was just off.  I guess I will have to think about it while i finish the 10 lbs of coffee in the freezer.  If I could get Aftrican coffee and Celebes locally, I probably wouldn't think about it.  It is not bad, and is nice for a change.  If it was as good as what I had been getting before I would keep both on subscription.  So nice to get coffee delivered this way, and Amazon has been really excellent service all around in this area.  i only wish the coffee was better.

review/summary: Good stuff and easily accessible
review/text: If you can find this in a grocery store near you, it's definitely worth buying.  I paid $2 less for this at a small Thai grocery store, which also stocked two cheaper brands that are made with black tea (instead of the green tea this Pantai brand is made with).  While I think the black tea brands have more depth of flavor and are stronger, this Pantai brand with its green tea isn't too shabby either.  You  might just want to brew it a bit stronger than I did the first time (I have used 1/3 cup tea in 4 cups of water).  The bag is 1 lb, so it'll last you through many glasses and pitchers of Thai tea!<br /><br />You can't use regular milk to get the creamy taste, though.  You need to use either sweetened condensed milk or (even better) regular sugar and evaporated milk.  I haven't tried cream or half and half, but you can also used those if you have that on hand, I suppose.  It's just that the evaporated milk is cheaper and probably somewhat better for you with all the sugar in this drink, and lasts longer in the fridge (after opening).  Whatever floats your boat...<br /><br />I haven't tried the other Por Kwan brand that's also available on Amazon, but the other Thai tea blends that I've tried that are made with black tea just have a deeper, almost coffee-like flavor to them.  If you don't want that intensity, then this Pantai brand is a good option.  Tastes just like what can be found in any Thai restaurant, basically.  And definitely better than any instant Thai tea mix.

review/summary: Warning - contains an artificial food coloring with potential side effects!
review/text: I haven't had Thai tea in several years because the restaurants make it too sweet.  I purchased this one and a black tea version.  It tasted great, but I developed a migraine that I had to get medical treatment for.  I totally missed that it contained FD&C Yellow 6 food coloring, also known as Sunset Yellow.  The package I received had another label placed over the ingredients, so the presence of the food coloring wasn't noticeable on the package.  It is listed on Amazon's description, so it is my fault for having bought this.  I later learned that it can have several potential health issues.  There have been calls for the withdrawal of Sunset Yellow from food use from the British Food Standards Agency.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest has requested the FDA ban it in the USA.  Sunset Yellow is banned in Norway and Finland.  It is also in the black Thai tea mixture I bought.  I have gotten migraines from other artificial food additives, mostly artificial sweeteners and food preservatives.  I try to be careful, so I only blame myself.  I read every review, but didn't read the description that closely.  If you are looking for a healthy drink, this isn't it.

review/summary: Excellent, Tasty, Authentic
review/text: It's delicious and very tasty just like the ones I've had at Thai restaurants. It does say in the pkg that its green tea but hey GREEN is better and healthier than black tea and I'm happy about that because I never knew what it was made of, I just knew I loved it and ordered it all the time from Thai restaurants. I add white table sugar, half & half and ice and it is Ahh-MAZING. I brew 1 cup in 2 liters of water, at the end the leaves are pitch black like coffee but the tea is that beautiful burnt-orange color. I tried to go healthy and used agave once, honey once, and skimmed milk. It was gross that way and I had to throw it out.

review/text: I couldn't figure out how to make authentic tasting Thai iced tea and figured it couldn't be THAT hard.  I was right.  You just need the right tea.  This is it folks.  It's even got that hint of reddish coloring that is served in Thai restaurants.  Add milk and some condensed milk and you're there!

review/summary: Exactly What You're Looking For!
review/text: Every time I go to a Thai restaurant I get a Thai iced tea and swear "Some day I'll make it myself". I've read about many types you can buy to substitute but to buy "Thai tea" to get the real flavor. I actually found this exact bag at a local market today called Central Market which is like a Whole Foods for about half the price but I would certainly pay this price easily because it's a pound of loose tea! Loose tea is extremely light so you'll have plenty to last you a long time & costs less than buying 2 teas at a restaurant. I don't care for condensed milk so I used half and half and raw sugar. (My local Thai place uses half and half) It was the exact flavor of what Thai iced tea should be! Even as it was steeping my mouth was watering. The tea is really good quality too. Definitely don't pass this one up!

review/summary: It's a good quality loose Thai tea.
review/text: The packaging it comes in won't last you unless you put it all in a zip-lock freezer bag. I personally put it into plastic sandwich bags (times two). The brewed result is deeply orange and the flavor is somewhat weak. That's my usual tea to water ratio so perhaps I need to try again with a stronger mixture. I have had better loose tea from the Chinese market but this is admittedly much easier to procure. So it's good quality, not terrible but not excellent.

review/summary: Easy Thai Tea at Home!
review/text: Guys, this is it! I have been searching endlessly for a way to make delicious thai tea at home after I first tried it at a restaurant. I scoop 4 teaspoons into a tea filter bag like these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KDW9MO">Finum 100 Tea Filters, Large, Brown</a> and let it steep in a mug of hot water for longer than usual (maybe 10 minutes). I like to wait until I get a strong and dark reddish color. Then I add a little bit of sugar to taste and a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk. The end result is an orange-color and creamy drink. I think it's really delicious and tastes just like what they serve in restaurants. It's great both hot and cold. Add some bubbles for bubble tea!

review/text: It tastes infinity times better with CONDENSED MILK. I used regular milk 2% and it felt like something was missing. If you don't have CONDENSED MILK. Whole Milk would taste better than 2% Milk.<br />Originally...<br />Brew the tea and sugar and water together and strain for best taste. Add ice, then chill. Then add the desired amount of CONDENSED MILK depending how milky you want the tea or how strong you want the tea to be. Viola! It should be a medium orange in color not blood orange and not creamy orange either.<br /><br />There are other brands I will definitely compare! It tastes similar to the restaurant style. Gorgeous orange color. Even the ground smells aromatic like the restaurant brewed tea. Once brewed it has a slightly different aroma. For those with a sensitive nose can certainly make that distinction. Otherwise you'd say it smells the same. I am eager to get the CONDENSED MILK to get that restaurant taste down pat!

review/text: Just received my tea in the mail. Along with the tea, I also purchased a mesh strainer. Make sure you have something to strain the leaves with when you are done boiling because you will have a mess if you don't. I have been craving thai tea several times a week and spending 3.75 a glass at my local Vietnamese restaurant was getting absorbent. This tea is very very similar to the tea I get at the restaurant. I am very impressed. Made exactly as the package said. Will be ordering more when this is all gone.

review/text: I, like many others, bought this to try my hand at making Thai iced tea at home.  It is made from green tea though, and traditional Thai tea is made from black tea.  It does alter the flavor slightly.<br /><br />The leaves should be brewed floating in the water then strained through a tea sock.  I use a little more tea than the package suggests (5-6 tablespoons per cup of water) and brew it a little longer.  With 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 3 of evaporated milk...This drink comes out almost as good as the Thai restaurants make it.  The price is good and I get my Thai tea at home for much less than $3.15 a glass!

After seeping and straining like the instructions state, I sweetened and added milk...the tea took on a funky and artifical orange color and tasted gritty and artificial.<br /><br />There was no depth of flavor that the restaurants have. I also really disliked the artificial food coloring they added to the mix.  It turned the tea into such an unappetizing color. I am very disappointed.

review/summary: You Want to Know How Tough a ZZ Plant Is?
review/text: You want to know how tough a ZZ plant is?  I moved in late September and all my house plants were supposed to come directly to my house.  Other items went to storage until we finished the remodel.  You guessed it!  Movers packed my ZZ plant in a box, in a storage pod, outdoors in Arizona.  Our Fall was relatively hot this year--hit 100 degrees several times in late September and early October.  Just unpacked one of the last boxes today that were delivered from the storage pod about 3 weeks ago.  There she was--poor little thing. She was about the size of the picture in the upper right had corner of this page.  Four branches--three of which died.  The other is still green and there are 3 new shoots coming up out of the pot.  Gave her a drink and put her in filtered light.  We'll see how she does but I'm very hopeful!

review/summary: Horrible Quality - 2 of 3 stems died within 2 weeks
review/text: I was so excited to have this plant.  It arrived very poorly packaged and the dirt had gone everywhere.  I repotted and watered according to recommendations.  Two of three sprouts died within 2-4 weeks after I owned it.  One hadn't fully bloomed yet and it just died.  The other just got all brown and died.  I think they were poor when they arrived and just didn't survive after repotting as a result.  Sad. They were all really thin and wobbly, nothing like the picture - where they have thick stalks and look big.  Just scrawny. I saw some at Ikea and plan to get some there if they are still there.

I picked up seven plants in all for a grand total of $30.00! I will not need to buy any house plants for a while as I am very satisfied with the plants that I have.<br /><br />As far as the Z plant, which has several different names, I am so happy that I came across this plant, I saw this plant in someones office and knew I had to have my own. In my research, I found out that you can even grow other Z plants from this one plant. I plan to do further research before I start to grow more Z plants so that they will be a success.<br /><br />Well I would not wait to find one of these plants as they bring joy to the owner and home!

review/text: I can't vouch for the taste personally but my dog seems to love them!  I have substituted these treats for her bed time treat to replace the much more expensive and fatty pigs ears.
