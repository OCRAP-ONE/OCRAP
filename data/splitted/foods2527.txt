review/summary: Great on popcorn
review/text: Years ago, there used to be bacon and cheddar popcorn topping--well that disappeared, and for awhile I would just make my own with cheddar topping and bacon bits. Then I found this little miracle, and it is awesome. I'm sure you could use it for something else, but there is nothing better than dousing popcorn in butter, pouring this on, microwaving it for 30 seconds, and then enjoying a good old mystery movie.

review/summary: Popcorn flavoring
review/text: I bought this to flavor my popcorn a couple months ago.  The flavor is very nice, not salty but very flavorful.  I actually use it on other things besides popcorn.  However, I will note that it tends to harden up while sitting in the cupboard.  I have to use my "magic bullet" to re-grind the seasoning.  It lasts for a while like that but not too long.  Maybe its just the humidity during the summer that caused it, but it was upsetting that I had to break it all apart when I wanted to use it.<br />Flavor - five stars<br />convenience - 1 star

review/summary: Not what it used to be!
review/text: Fry it like bacon for BLTs or breakfast side. Crisp flavor burst with a great aftertaste. I love to cook this at a very low simmer in a covered fry pan for a couple of hours. The texture is very soft, translucent and just melts in your mouth. I'll add it to soups (split Pea, Navy Bean. Very delicious and versatile product. Burgers Smokehouse products are phenomenal! THREE YEARS LATER: OCTOBER 19,2011. Use to love this stuff but after several reorders found the size of the slices, texture no matter how carefully prepared, and in general the product itself not the original I was buying in 2008. The pieces in most or the orders have been too small to fry like a bacon strip. The product turns out tough, sinewy, and rather like something to paste on the bottom of ones shoe rather then put on the breakfast plate. I am a fairly decent cook and knowledgeable and other then boiling the tar out of it, utilizing a pressure cooker, sticking it in a blender, or cremating it and grinding up into ashes you are going to get tough pieces. I don't know what they did to it, perhaps new processing, changed the recipe, new smoke-master, where they are raising or buying the pork cheeks before smoking, shaving the cut on the Jowl, but it is not the same item in size, texture, nor quality I use to so enjoy. The customer service is still wonderful and has credited, sent free packages,and apologized. But now after so many attempts of reordering, retrying, and disappointments I have given up on Burgers Jowl!

review/summary: Very Fine Quality
review/text: I have tried lots of different coffee brands this year, and this one, by far, is the best. Although I usually prefer a light roast, this medium roast is fantastic. I thought that Gevalia's blends were very good, but compared to this, there's nothing like Hawaiian Kona. The price is reasonable for Kona beans, and this brand really is exceptional.<br /><br />I drink it black, so it has to be good. There's no attempt to hide the flavor of crappy beans by over-roasting. Or, even worse, adding "flavorings" to mask an inferior product. If you have already tried this product and you know that you enjoy it, try searching for the "5 Pack" on Amazon. It's a good cost savings to purchase in bulk, the discount for buying 5 packages is equivalent to getting 2 packages for free.<br /><br />This coffee is very fine quality. Recommended.

review/summary: Rich taste
review/text: We tried this coffee after having brought home some 100% Kona coffee from Hawaii several years back.  We ordered this along with some Jamaican Blue Mountain and a few other types of higher-end coffees.<br /><br />This is by far the best of the lot.  It has a rich and complex taste with an almost nutty or fruity background character.  Growing as it does on the lava slopes of the hawaiian islands, the beans pick up a significant amount of flavor from the rich soil.  Although we are not frequent coffee drinkers or 'coffee-snobs', when we do drink coffee, this is what we drink.  It's good enough that we went to the trouble of buying a good grinder and moving from ground to whole-bean just to get the added flavor.

review/text: In my opinion this is the best dog food on the market for all breeds. Our 7 year old miniature poodle "mix" had problems with seizures. The vet recommended "medication" to control the seizures which was expensive.<br />A friend recommended trying Natural Balance dog food. I am happy to report that our "Scooter" has been seizure free now for over three years.<br />We now have both of our dogs dining on this mix and they are both very healthy. Our other pooch is a 13 year old Bi-shon, we wouldn't feed them anything else.<br />Thanks to my purchases of this product on Amazon.com, I save the fuel I would normally use going to several pet stores to find this product, also Amazon delivers it right to my door for the same price I would pay for it in the local store.<br />I wouldn't buy it from any other source.<br />You should consider buying this product and I would highly recommend this particular blend.<br />Mike Crabbs<br />BelAir, Maryland

review/summary: Great dog food...organic is where it's at!
review/text: Good nutrition is very important to me, so feeding our 3 dogs a quality diet is a must. I've tried several different kinds of food, all supposedly high quality. None of them were organic, and it always bothered me. I eat an organic, raw food diet and am well aware of the important role good nutrition plays in one's health. I had looked at organic foods before and they were all too expensive. I came across Natural Balance one day when I was searching for an affordable organic food for my dogs. I researched it and decided to give it a try. My dogs loved it!! Within the first couple of weeks, I noticed their coats started to glisten and they seemed to be more energetic. Our lab mix has always had a sensitive digestive system...anytime I ever changed her food I had to very slowly mix in the new food to keep her from getting diarrhea and digestive upset. I am happy to say that with this food, she did not have any issues during the transition...I was able to get her switched over in record time. Now I realize it was never her digestive system that was causing the problem--it was the sub-par food we were buying for her :( We are now on our third bag of Natural Balance and have never been happier with a food choice. Their coats are shinier than ever! And...it's $10 cheaper than the "quality" food that came from the vet.

But here's the skinny: sure, it works as a cereal (or a garnish for a flake-based cereal) and all those other things, but this stuff was put on Earth for the sole purpose of being a yogurt mix-in. I don't know what sort of magic happens when you drop a scoopful of this stuff in a bowl of vanilla yogurt (mango was another great choice), but some sort of magic does happen. Once I'd tried it that way, there was no looking back. It's now a staple in the kitchen. I don't think I've eaten yogurt without it in the last month.

This is a great midday snack to give you the complex carbs that you need (without a large blood sugar spike) to get you to the next meal.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these in the future and would throw them in my luggage as a snack on a plane, or a treat to munch on when hiking.<br /><br />No chocolate chips needed in this granola snack!

Normally I need granola to be with something: Milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that. This stuff I was eating out of the bag like snack chips.  It has just the right cinnamon taste, and the oats taste fresh. You know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless? This does not. The clusters are crisp and flavorful--not just cinammon and sweet, but hearty and oaty.  It's like the best part of a healthy cereal...minus the milk and the not so tasty part.<br /><br />If this came in snackpacks I'd buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches.  Heck that's what I did with half this bag!

review/text: While this product didn't feature a lot of big clusters, I found it quite tasty and loaded with healthy ingredients.  It had enough cinnamon to complement the taste, but not too sweet.  With nearly as much fiber (15g) as sugar (18g) per cup, and 9g of protein, one could definitely do worse.<br /><br />Apparently one of the issues that comes with relatively low sugar granola is that the clusters don't stick together so well.  However, this is not much of an issue if you're eating this with yogurt or milk.<br /><br />Overall, a great product worth recommending if you like granola.

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy and healthy
review/text: This product has a wonderful mix of flavors and textures in every bite.  It is a mix of whole grains, blueberries, and flax seeds that are then lightly flavored with vanilla.  The different ingredients all have different tastes and consistencies that make this mix feel good in your mouth.  It has a very lightly sweetened taste that makes it delicious as a "munchy".  It's also wonderful on top of yogurt or eaten like a cereal.  It's very healthy and keeps well over a period of time.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.

review/summary: Delicious, but not really THAT healthy
review/text: Granola is awesome, KIND is a great company and this was delicious, but this is perhaps not the healthiest choice. There's a surprising amount of sugar in here, and not to be super-picky, but the flax seeds pretty much just get stuck in your teeth, where they have minimal health benefits. This was also rather on the tough side as far as chewing, which can be a concern for some.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: The Oat and Honey clusters reminds me of the granola cereal that I used to love as a kid, but this has much less fat and still tastes great.  It's gluten free on top of it!  Since I am Celiac, my breakfast cereal choice is somewhat limited.  I was looking for something different to break up the monotony and decided to give this a try.  I am glad I did.  The only downside to this is that it is a bit expensive.  I think it is worth it though.  I just ordered the Maple Walnut clusters and looking forward to trying them.

review/summary: Granola with a bad flavor
review/text: Maybe I got a bad bag but... the flavor of the vanilla blueberry was unpalatable. I love granola and was looking forward to trying this healthy version but it tasted old, almost as if it had "turned." If it weren't so expensive, I would try it again. I love the idea of including flax seeds in the granola.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Granola
review/text: Best granola on the market! Would never guess it's gluten free. I order six bags at a time to make sure I never run out. I eat it straight from the bag as a snack, put it on top of yogurt, and eat it as cereal with milk. Tried many other brands I could find locally but none even come close, so I will continue to order Kind.

review/summary: love Kind products
review/text: As a lover of Kind bars, I was excited to see this granola. I'm generally not a fan of grains unless they're sprouted grains, but this was great. Low glycemic and tasted SO good. It's full of amaranth, quinoa and millet as well as flax which provides the Omega 3. I love how the blueberries add a nice sweet/tart taste but was disappointed to learn that they're blueberry puree as well as apple and plum puree. I wish they were just dried blueberries.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great granola and has a nice depth / complexity of taste.

review/summary: Vanilla covering mars the texture and taste of the snack
review/text: I wanted to like this healthy snack, and perhaps I chose the wrong flavor.  The blueberries were nice -- tangy and flavorful.  The grain is crunchy.  But the vanilla covering (or glue or whatever it is that is sticking the grains together) has an unpleasant rough, starch-like texture and a bland aftertaste, kind of like that chalky aftertaste you get from Pepto-Bismol (although NOT that flavor.)<br /><br />I think I will give this brand another try in another flavor.

review/summary: Healthy but still tastes good.
review/text: I'm not a health nut. In fact I'm a foodie who wouldn't give up anything in the name of health. I do tend to think that stuff like this sacrifice taste and don't buy them. So why did I get this? the description had said they could be sprinkled on yogurt and I do eat lots of yogurt.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however, these taste good. I like them. For the most part, I ate these with milk as morning cereal or I snacked on them. I never got to put them on yogurt (which was my original intention). If these come with the subscribe and save plan, i'll order it just to have them over. Otherwise, they'll be an as needed buy.<br />A little goes a long way with these. The didn't taste like raw bran or some "healthy" cereal completely robbed of taste. Instead, even a sweet tooth like me liked it. Just a reference, I don't drink skim milk because i think it taste like water so that should give a little idea of where i'm coming from.<br /><br />My only con with these: they packages aren't big. Not like regular cereal bags. They're much smaller.  I wish they came a little bigger which is why i took of a star. But then you don't need to eat much to feel full so i guess....<br /><br />Anyway, If you're the kind of person who avoids stuff like these because you think they taste bad, try this and be amazed. If you're a health food junkie, well, now you don't have to sacrifice taste.<br />Cheers!

review/summary: This is an HONEST, kind, product!
review/text: I find myself searching grocery store shelves. I read the labels, scour the freezers and even the so-called healthy products-aren't. This wonderful granola type snack is different. It contains healthy grains but is minus the un-healthy sugars, syrups and fats. I found that it tasted great. In fact I prefer it over the sickening sweet alternatives marketed by the food packing giants. With flax seeds it is uber healthy with so many essentials. The cinnamon taste is pleasant and if I am not mistaken, cinnamon is thought to be a "fate burner"!<br /><br />Be kind to yourself and give Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters a chance!

review/summary: hmmm.....Tasty!
review/text: This is a lovely little granola. Just enough sweet, but not TOO much. The vanilla/blueberry clusters add taste interest without being overpowering. I can take or leave the flax seeds since they aren't well digested in whole form for most folks. Ground whole flaxseed sprinkled on your food, or flax seed oil are both more beneficial since they are more easily digested and utilized by the body. The whole flax seeds do give some good textural interest along with the grains. Very nice with Greek yogurt and fruit and NOT "cardboard-y" at all. Definitely a two thumbs up rating from me.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I'm not a granola expert of fanatic, but I thought I might enjoy this product more because I like blueberry and vanilla.<br /><br />When I opened it, it smelled musty, like a year-old box of cereal.  I found that very odd, but plunged ahead anyway.  It was disappointing, because I picked up on pretty much no blueberry flavor (or blueberries, for that matter).  It tasted like really dense granola.  From a pure flavor and eating enjoyment aspect, I did not really care for it.<br /><br />From a health standpoint, this product is free of everything "bad" and full of "good stuff"...heavy on flax.  I'm not a health food fanatic, so again, this was lost on me.  But my son, age 24, really seemed to enjoy it.  He's much more attentive to what he consumes, and I think he liked the taste as well.  He ended up being the only consumer of this product.  (My wife liked it less than me.)<br /><br />I have to conclude, based on the non-scientific study of my family, that this product appeals to folks accustomed to more "healthy" snack foods...and not folks like me who have no problem with more "commercial, processed" snacks.  I had hoped that KIND would be both tasty and healthy...but it fell short.  I'd be a two-star reviewer...my son would be 4...so I'm splitting the difference.

review/text: My son and I both enjoyed this granola as cereal in the morning. The clusters stayed crunchy in milk and it was quite flavorful. We could see bits of blueberries and their flavor was noticeable while not too overpowering. The flax seeds did sometimes stay in the milk afterwards but as long as you drink the milk you get their full benefit. We both enjoyed the taste and the variety of grains included. It is relatively healthy and we've always been satisfied with KIND products. This is a tasty granola option.

review/summary: My kind of snack!
review/text: I love having something in my pantry I can take out and munch on without guilt--this is exactly my kind of snack.<br /><br />The best thing about Healthy Grains Clusters is how healthy they are. They're made with whole grains, including quinoa, one of the healthiest grains out there. The flax seeds are an excellent way to get important omega-3 fatty acids into your system.They're also a very good source of fiber. Best of all, they're made with all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />Besides being good for your diet, these crunchy clusters are addictively good--both by themselves and as a yogurt topping. I wasn't sure how'd they would actually taste, as I've had plenty of bland health foods. They turned out to be one of my new favorite snacks!<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent granola that satisfies your sweet tooth.

review/summary: Nice crunch and better than Bear Naked Granola
review/text: For years I have been eating Bear Naked Granola (Fruit and Nut, in the orange bag) with vanilla yogurt and berries as one of my favorite breakfasts.  When I was offered an opportunity to review this similar product, I was skeptical that anything could top my favorite granola.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters granola.  It actually tasted fresher than Bear Naked and I can eat 1/3 of a cup for roughly the same calories as 1/4 cup of Bear Naked.  (The rest of the nutritional info is roughly the same between the two brands.)  The Kind granola has a nice crunch and didn't get soggy when mixed with yogurt.  The cinnamon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  It's packed with whole grains, Omega 3 and other healthy ingredients.  It would also be good served as a cereal with milk.  It's a bit more expensive than Bear Naked, but if both were on the same shelf, I would definitely reach for the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters.  I would also be interested in trying other versions/flavors of this product.

review/summary: Nongluten granola
review/text: I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see "without gluten" on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say "gluten free oats" but still I wondered about the other grains.  Another ingredient was amaranth, which has no gluten (neither do oats, but they easily become contaminated by gluten in processing) so I checked this site and lo and behold, it says that it is non gluten!  So, not on the package (unless I am missing it?) but yes, on this site.<br /><br />I took this bag of granola with me to my daughter/husband's house and they tried it too.  It was a very nice tasting cereal, loaded with whole grains.  I did not experience what some other reviewers said, with having no clusters in their bag (in other words, some got kind of a granola dust, but mine were big chunks, just like they are supposed to be).  Mine was packed in a box with some of those air pocket things, so it came through just fine.  I also didn't notice any funny aftertaste.  The cost is $16.56 for 3, 11 oz bags, or $14.08 through "subscribe and save" ($4.69 per bag).  I think this is a little higher than our local Walmart Bear Naked granola, but not that much higher.  Also, Bear Naked granola isn't gluten free (the oats are not gluten free, to my knowledge), whereas the Kind variety is.<br /><br />Although the variety of this cereal that I had (Cinnamon and Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds) did not have glycerin as an ingredient, I noticed that my bag of Bear Naked fruit and nut granola did have glycerin, apparently with the raisins and cranberries that were in it.  I have to admit, I had always associated glycerin with soap (like Neutrogena) but note too that nitroglycerin (an explosive) has glycerin.  Glycerin is also, apparently, a sweetener (probably why they use it with raisins and cranberries).<br /><br />In the end, I would say that if you like the taste of this granola, the price on this one isn't bad.  And taste is a matter of, um, taste.  Because it is non-gluten, I may just buy this instead of the Bear Naked granola that I usually buy (yes, I know that Walmart's Bear Naked granola isn't non-gluten, but I like it and it is cheap and for reasons that I do not understand, I do not have to absolutely abstain from gluten, although I usually do).  I would definitely give this granola a chance and if you like the flavor, go for it!

review/summary: A bit too sweet and pricey, but it's a delicious all-natural product
review/text: PROS:<br /><br />- It's a very natural product. Just look at the ingredients: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />- It tastes delicious. The cinnamon comes through nicely.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- I felt it was slightly too sweet. Obviously, that's subjective, so look at the sugar content: 5g of sugar in a 29g serving. The good news is that "sugar" isn't in the list of ingredients. The product gets its sweetness from the juices in the ingredients. It claims it's "low glycemic," but you might want to be skeptical about that.<br /><br />- Only 2-4 realistic servings per package. Most cereals have a serving size of 3/4 cup. Here's it's just 1/3 cup. On the other hand, the serving size is 29 grams, which is comparable to the average serving size weight for other cereals. The package claims 11 servings. Sure, if you're just nibbling. But if you have a standard bowl of cereal, you'll find that it only has 2-4 realistic servings (depending on your bowl size). So it goes quick! This makes it somewhat pricey and lowers the overall value.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you're not concerned about the relatively high price and you like a sweet cereal, then this is a perfect product!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy product with multiple uses
review/text: Though I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating and can now be a little more relaxed about my carbohydrate intake (people slam the Atkins plan for being unrealistic, but it's only the initial phases that are truly restrictive), I still keep an eye out for needlessly excessive carb counts.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds are therefore right up my alley.  They're tasty and crunchy, perfect for stirring into my plain yogurt, sprinkled over hot cereal, or just enjoying in a flavorful small handful every now and then. A third of a cup serving- more than enough for the uses I mentioned- contains only 17 grams of net carbs (22 grams of total carbs minus the 5 grams of fiber).  For calorie watchers (like my wife), total calories for that amount aren't bad, either (about 130).<br /><br />As I've said in the past when I was pleased with a free sample of a product from the Amazon Vine program, I'm definitely open to picking up a fresh supply of these healthy, good-tasting clusters at my own expense once my free supply runs out.

review/text: I am not a health food fanatic. In fact like many Americans I am overweight. Deciding to make my forties a healthier decade means making some changes. So I am exploring healthy food options.<br /><br />Kind vanilla blueberry clusters is healthy but is it tasty?<br /><br />The first morning I had it with milk. Crunchy, tasty but a waste of time. Even though it was soaked in milk it wasn't really a cereal and it was still dry. How? I wound up drinking the milk from the bowl at the end. - fail.<br /><br />I bagged some and took it as a snack. Better. Great and crunchy. Tasty but have a drink handy - Good.<br /><br />The next morning I had Greek fat free yogurt and sprinkled some on top. It required some hands crumbling clusters but not really that much work. It added a bit of flavor to the creamy goodness that is Greek yogurt (not the other kind of tangy yogurt) and it gave it some crunch. Not thirsty after words ) the best way to have it.<br /><br />Over all if you like crunch and want to add some healthy omegas to your diet this is a good way to do it. Especially if you eat yogurt or like snacking. If you are looking for an alternative to sugary cereal or hate dry food look elsewhere this just won't cut it.<br /><br />Personally I would keep it but not as a breakfast food.

review/summary: a tasty breakfast or snack
review/text: I've been eating KIND bars for a couple of years.  They are a truly healthy alternative to the many so-called health & energy bars that have flooded the market in the last decade.  KIND is also a socially conscious company which donates portions of its proceeds to worthy causes.  They've now added cereals to their line of bars.  I tried the Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  It was tasty & satisfying.  It was tasty with milk, or on yogurt (Greek in my case), or as a stand alone snack.  However, the portion sizes listed on all food products are ridiculous & don't reflect real life.  At least not the life I know.  However, even doubling the portion size the result will still be a filling meal which is low in calories, high in protein, low in sodium, low in sugar, with 0 sat. fat & 0 trans fat.  That the package is just 11 oz. in size is one of my major complaints.  This is a healthy alternative to many of the granolas which are on the market.

The amazing variety of grains used in this is a selling point to me, I like the variety and it's not over-sweet. I do like granola that's not all broken up into tiny little pieces, but has some chunks in it, which this does have.<br /><br />Kind granola is also gluten free and vegan friendly. If you are on a restricted diet this is perfect. I thought the cinnamon was just the right amount, not overpowering. To me, things that are 'healthy' for you aren't very useful unless they taste good too, this tastes good. Enjoy it on yogurt, or out of the bag, or with milk. I put it in little baggies and throw it in my backpack for a snack at school.

review/summary: Great For you and Great Tasting!
review/text: My family loves the entire line of Kind Healthy Grains products! These natural ingredients products are great tasting and great for you, especially if you are on the look out for gluten free food. I found the Cinnamon Oat Clusters delicious coming in close as a first compared to the Maple Walnut Clusters which currently lines my cupboards.<br /><br />I feel this product is a great addition to add to my yogurt, to eat with milk as a breakfast cereal, and it's also a good stand along snack. It's got a great crunch, the texture is desirable, and the flavor is pretty tasty. My 3 year old which a picky eater loves this stuff so you can be sure that I'll probably be taking advantage of the awesome subscribe and save deal that Amazon.com offers!<br /><br />If you are wanting to try it before subscribing, you can find this product in most stores. I was thrilled to find at my local Market of Choice grocery store and am so glad to see it here on Amazon.

review/summary: Nice crunch, slightly bland taste
review/text: Unlike some of the other reviewers' experience, the product I received had nice big clusters and a good crunch to it.  It seemed slightly bland to me, though, so I added an extra dash of cinnamon and a little nutmeg, which made it taste much better in my plain Greek yogurt.<br /><br />Overall, I like the oat clusters and I like the extras that are in it, such as the flaxseed and Omega-3,  which make the calories worthwhile.

review/text: I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well.

review/summary: not a granola fan, but I liked this one
review/text: I've always thought I should like granola, but I had never found a packaged one that really did it for me. I'm a big fan of KIND bars, so I was excited to hear that KIND had a new granola product line. Finally, I've found it, a package granola product worth eating.<br /><br />As with other KIND products, I like that their granola is made of natural ingredients. As their slogan says "ingredients you can see and pronounce." But, of course, that only gets you so far if the taste isn't there. KIND granola comes through on the taste to though. It's sweet but not too sweat, and I liked (unlike some other reviewers) that the blueberry flavor wasn't too strong. The texture, which is always tricky with granola, was also just right - the perfect combo of crunchy and chewy.<br /><br />I enjoyed mine both on its own and with milk. However, I do agree with the other reviewers who said that larger clusters would be nice when you're eating it on its own.<br /><br />Oddly, my 15-month old daughter also loved this granola. She would actually shake with excitement when she saw the bag come out of the pantry.

It is very similar in taste to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7TH24">Heartland Granola Cereal, Original, 16-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a> but of course with flax and a very light blueberry taste.<br /><br />It is easy to eat as a snack because most of the granola clusters are pretty large. Four kids and I wiped it out in just a few minutes. Highly recommended. Excellent taste and healthy ingredients.

review/summary: Great snacks for in the car or at home
review/text: My wife and I had to run out the door for a class and didn't have time to really get any food in advance.  Luckily I had this and took it in the car with us.  It was a great snack to have on hand and I like the fact that it's not overly sugary as these granola products can be.  Flax is an added bonus as it is one supplement that I always want to take but never seem to get around to do doing so.  The reclosable bag worked very well for us.  The last serving I put over milk to see how it would work as a breakfast cereal and that was fine as well.  My only complaint is that it wasn't very clustery, it tended to break down into smaller grains of stuff, but who really cares about that most of the time?  The taste was awesome.

review/text: Kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh, bright flavors. These clusters are nice and crunchy, and great for any granola-type use. The clusters are not very big, so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking. The blueberry-vanilla flavor was a bit muted but I'm happy to compromise on that for such a hearty, healthy product.

review/summary: Tasty and Satisfying
review/text: I received my pack of Kind Healthy Grains Clusters in a firm, cardboard "envelope" that protected it enough that it was not pulverized as some reviewers had experienced.  The cereal had varying sized clusters of fruit and grains as well as some loose, individual ones, similar to other granolas.  I tried it as a snack one evening when I had the munchies and found it tasty and satisfying.  It was crunchy and not too sweet and I enjoyed the wholesome taste.  I didn't notice a lot of vanilla flavor and the blueberries were not as flavorful or large as the ones in "Blueberry Morning" cereal, but they were identifiable as blueberries.  I have not tried it with milk or in yogurt yet but feel that it would be very good if eaten that way.  I would purchase it again.

review/summary: VANILLA blueberry FLAVOR ... great in YOGURT or alone!
review/text: In my quest to eat healthier, I'm been trying to eat more Greek Yogurt and healthy grains.  I'm not a huge fan of plain yogurt, but with these grains added, it makes a delicious, filling snack/mini-meal.  I got the VANILLA BLUEBERRY flavor and I thought the KIND brand was very comparable to BEAR NAKED.  This particular variety (VANILLA BLUEBERRY) was slightly moisturer (less dry) than its Bear Naked equivalent.  I don't really like blueberries that well, but the blueberries were not that overwhelming in this mix (as far as taste).  In fact, the chewy texture was about the extent that I even noticed that blueberries were in the mix.  My VERY picky-eater son really liked this mix also.  He doesn't like much, so that says a lot.  He ate it both plain and in milk (as cereal) and said that it tasted good.  In fact, he has taken it to school as his snack a couple of times.  I would/will definitely be eating more of this.

review/summary: Great With Anything But Itself
review/text: At the office I work at I gotta have a fulfilling snack that won't make me put on any more pounds and these Kind Healthy clusters get me most of the way there.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients and nutritional information the clusters certainly have the healthy stuff down with no real adverse ingredients (IE: gluten) that seem to plague just about anything in the grocery store.  It was nice to have a healthier alternative compared to the usual peanuts that I have.<br /><br />The clusters were great with yogurt and milk and that was mostly how I had it.  However, the one time I had the clusters by themselves I wasn't all that impressed as they left a lingering aftertaste and not the good kind either.  Perhaps it was the vanilla but I had to drink some juice to get the annoying taste out of my mouth and they get stuck easily in your teeth.  In short, these clusters are next to no good on their own but are ideal with anything else.<br /><br />A great alternative to munch food but you'll wanna have them in conjunction with something else less you get a weird aftertaste.

review/summary: Is It Stale?
review/text: Like a few other reviewer here, I noticed right away after opening the bag (Cinnamon Oat Clusters) that it smelled like stale grains or stale peanuts. It's a pretty strong odor but it wasn't overpowering.<br /><br />Since I am not familiar with some of the grains in the bag, I thought maybe they have some distinct odors that are similar to what I assume is a stale smell. For reference, I know the smell of flax seed, oats, and rice, and they smell nothing like what I was smelling from this bag.  Despite the strange smell, I still tried a few bites, and the taste wasn't too bad but I KNOW it would have been better without that lingering smell.<br /><br />Just like the others who have complained, the expiration date on my bag is August 29, 2012, so the product should have still been good.<br /><br />Also, like others, I felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows. The lack of larger clusters makes it harder to be a hand snack but you can still pour it in a cereal bowl and add milk.<br /><br />Previously I have enjoyed Kind products, so this experience won't prevent me from trying other Kind products. However, I may be hesitant to try this particular product again. I'll be glad to change my review though if Kind sends me another bag -- and it doesn't have that peculiar smell.

review/text: This is a great tasting granola that can be easily enjoyed by itself or as a great yogurt mixer which is how I always enjoy it.  It is lightly sweet with a great crunch.  On its own, I personally don't taste much of a blueberry flavor short of a very slight fruit tanginess.  Mixed in yogurt it is great because.  It gives a great granola flavor and crunch without adding an excessive amount of sweetness.

review/summary: Good for a snack or a cereal
review/text: This is a great product that can be eaten either as a snack or as a cereal. My husband and I tried it both ways. He is a bike rider and took some along with him for a snack on the trail and really like it. This particular package had the vanilla/blueberry clusters, and the taste was great.<br /><br />We also tried it as a cereal with almond milk and once with apple juice. It was great. I seemed to like it more than my husband. He said it wasn't sweet enough for a snack, but was great as a cereal. I liked it just fine either way and also ate it mixed with yogurt, which was great.<br /><br />The one drawback is that only 1/3 of a cup - a small serving - is 120 calories. This mostly comes from the high carbs of the many mixed grains like gluten free oats, brown rice, oat flour, buckwheat, and more. So it has a very high fiber content, which makes it a great healthy carb for active people. I like that it uses molasses as a sweetner, and has sea salt as well.<br /><br />This is a really healthy, nutritious, whole food kind of product, and we really enjoy it.

review/text: I'm an enthusiatic cinnamon lover and granola eater, and I really wanted to like these more. There is a distinct cinnamon taste, but this product is too dry to be eaten alone for my taste. I decided to try them in some vanilla yogurt, and liked them much better. The hard dryness allows them to no become overly soggy too quickly. There are some "clusters" but the contents of the package reminded more of loose grain given to horses. So, they just get an "OK" from me.

review/summary: Pleasant and lightly sweet flavor. Makes a nice snack.
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains is a cluster cereal made with whole grains like gluten-free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, and quinoa. Other ingredients include gluten-free oat flour, flax seeds, evaporated cane juice, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E, citrus fiber and citrus pectin. It boasts to be all natural, low glycemic, no refined sugars, non gmo, no saturated fats, and low sodium.(According to the package, it contains soy and made in a facility that uses peanuts, thee nuts, and sesame seeds.) A serving size is 1/3 cup (29g). It contains 120 calories, 3g fat, 0 cholesterol, 20mg sodium, 22 g carbs (5 fiber, 5 sugar), and 3g of protein.<br /><br />The flavor for Kind Healthy Grains is pleasant and lightly sweet. It can be enjoyed in several ways: as a snack right out of the bag, as a topping, or as a cereal. For out-of-the-bag dry snacking, it's quite good. It's a moderate crunchy with a little bit of chewy. I tried Kind Healthy Grains with milk as a cereal. I didn't enjoy it as much that way. While it did taste good, the softening of the grains in the milk made it chewier and chewier taking longer and longer to finish it off. Eventually I gave up before the cereal was finished.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains come in a handy resealable bag that is not difficult to seal or open. Handy for on the go snacking or keeping in your gym bag.<br /><br />It's also made in the USA. Nice.

review/summary: Hearty but rancid?
review/text: I was excited to try this cereal, and when I eat granola, I like putting them on top of plain (perhaps just slightly sugared) oatmeal cereals. Hot.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I was surprised that it smelled a bit rancid... I wasn't sure whether or not that is how it's supposed to smell. However, the taste is great. It is very nutty, and very chewy/crunchy. It also doesn't become soggy quickly, even though I put it into hot oatmeal.<br /><br />My one slight complain would be that the bag does not seem to seal very well. It has the built-in seal, but it doesn't seal tightly - some light movements would open it. It also doesn't stand on its bottom, but that's probably not a huge deal.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this granola. It's very tasty.

review/text: OK, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to granola type products because a local bakery makes a great blend and my wife makes cookie sheet after cookie sheet of the best granola ever.  This Kind Healthy Grains, though, is no slouch.  The ingredients are high quality, generally whole, and vegan.  It's a nice snack, in small amounts.  Still, I was a bit disappointed in the taste and texture.  The blueberry flavor was too muted.  The added sweeteners overwhelmed the natural flavor of the grains and berries.  Vanilla was in there somewhere but its flavor, along with the flavors of all the other ingredients, lost their individual taste profiles.  The resulting melange is tasty but does not have that crunchy, whole grain flavor I was expecting.

I am not super into organic food (in large part because of my budget), but I do often eat "organic" granola that I purchase at my local grocery store.<br /><br />My usual granola is more processed and contains more sugar than the KIND brand, so I was a little skeptical that the cinnamon oat clusters wouldn't taste very good. I was pleasantly surprised! They are delicious - plenty of flavor and plenty sweet, these do have more texture and fiber to them and are overall more hearty and filling than my grocery store brand. I really enjoyed them! They are yummy with milk or even just plain.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I couldn't just dip into the bag and neatly grab a handful.<br /><br />However, on the whole, I really liked this product, either standing alone or in some cottage cheese with fresh fruit.

review/summary: Great gluten free crunch granola
review/text: We've been gluten free for several years now, and one of the things that has been missing is a good, crunchy, gluten-free granola.<br /><br />The Vanilla Blueberry granola boasts a punch of delicious vanilla flavor and crunchy oat clusters. It's packed with a variety of healthy grains in addition to the gluten free oats.  It's a healthier granola.  The only downfall is the lack of blueberries in the granola. When a granola is labeled vanilla blueberry clusters, I tend to look for blueberries or at least a noticeable blueberry flavor. (The lack of blueberry is the reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star review.)<br /><br />The Cinnamon granola had a very nice cinnamon flavor. The granola tasted great with milk as well as eating plain as a snack.<br /><br />It would be nice if the granola came in larger packages as we went through the granola very quickly. If you use it on top of yogurt or ice cream, it will last much longer.

review/summary: Delicious whole grain goodness
review/text: Healthy grains seem to be in the news recently and cereal bars, granola and other whole grain foods claim to be tasty and good for you.  The people at Kind have mastered both taste and health in their healthy grains product.  I sampled vanilla blueberry Clusters with Flax seeds and found it to be the best "granola" I've ever tasted, except perhaps for the granola I have made myself.  It's delicious, low fat, and has an ingredient list that is easy to understand.  It can be enjoyed many ways, but just eating it out of the bag is great.<br /><br />Containing 5 g of fiber, 750 mg  of Omega 3 with 100 percent whole grains, its list of benefits also includes cholesterol free, low glycemic and low sodium, non GMO and finally, it has no trans or saturated fats.  Those claims are amazing since it actually tastes very good and is a good addition to your diet of grains.  It is indeed a "Kind" grain food.<br /><br />Other grains tend to be too sweet, or have had seeds or nuts that can crack teeth or get caught easily.  This granola is easy to munch, just eating it  out of the bag,  or using it for a topping,  or combining it  with milk almost like a cereal.  Since it's more expensive than cereal, I like to savor small batches of it when I'm hungry or use it as a yogurt topping.  I recommend trying it.  It's wholesome and quite a treat, a type of healthy "candy" for the conscientious eater.

review/summary: Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters
review/text: I tried these both as a snack and as a cereal.  As a snack, they tasted bland.  I was expecting more of the blueberry but I didn't get it.  Then I thought, maybe the milk would bring out the flavor, but it didn't.  Although a healthy snack, it didn't have the taste I was looking for and can always get a granola, flaxseed blend anywhere, if that's what I want.  Just average.

review/summary: LOVE this!
review/text: This is probably the best granola I have ever had. It only has 6 grams of sugar, where most granola cereals have 15 grams or more. The taste is incredible; a well rounded cinnamon flavor and the granola itself is pretty uniform in texture which I like. No huge clumps. The flax seeds are also a nice touch and lend good flavor to the mix. I also like the packaging. Its compact and easy to both open and seal back up. I was about to give up on store bought granola but this changed my mind. Love it.

review/summary: Tasted good.
review/text: I mixed this bag in with my Kashi cereal and am enjoying the combination.  The clusters aren't too large, the cinnamon isn't overpowering, and it gives a nice flavor to the Kashi.  I would readily use this to make Granola Bread, except I dumped the whole bag into the cereal, so I can't.  I think it would work quite well.  I also think it would be very good as part of home-made trail mix, with raisins and M&Ms and the like.  Depending on price at my local grocery store, I'd buy this.

review/summary: Love the crunch & taste but I have some issues with it.
review/text: Let's get the unpleasant stuff out of the way first:<br /><br />1. Calling this product "clusters" falls somewhere between false advertising and a grand exaggeration. Sure, there may be clusters in there (though I had to go spelunking to find them), but by no means are clusters a primary element of this snack.  That vast majority of the bag I received was loose bits.<br /><br />2. I opened the bag on the day I received it from Amazon and the first smell that hit me was rancid grain or oil--you know, when a box of cereal or crackers (or even a jar of peanut butter) go bad, they have that nasty stale smell?  Well that is what this smells like (at least the bag I got).  The "best by" date on the bag is August 29, 2012, so clearly the product is not outdated.  I HATE the rancid smell and will throw away snacks, cereals, crackers, etc., as soon as they start smelling that way, so it was tough to push past it to even try the granola.<br /><br />Now for the better news:<br /><br />1. While the product's strong rancid smell is off-putting, the taste is relatively pleasant (as long as I hold my breath or hold the bag away from my face when I'm pouring it out of or grabbing it from the bag to avoid the smell). There is SOME rancid taste, but I've been able to continue eating the granola on yogurt, ice cream or oatmeal--just not by itself.<br /><br />2. The package makes the following claims about this product: 5g fiber (per 1/3 cup serving), 720 mg Omega-3, gluten free, 100% whole grains, all natural, low glycemic, no refined sugars, NON GMO (whatever that means), no saturated fat or trans fats, cholesterol free and very low in sodium.  That's all pretty good news if you're looking for a healthier granola.  Total fat is 3.5mg per serving, sodium 20 mg, total carbs 22g, protein 3g and sugars 6g.  Also, as noted in the product title, the granola contains flax seeds.<br /><br />3. The crispy crunch on this stuff is awesome. I'm not sure what causes it, but it has a much lighter crispy type of crunch than most granola I've had (though admittedly I am not a big consumer of granola). I love it sprinkled on my ice cream and yogurt and even started putting it on my oatmeal.<br /><br />4. At 6g sugar, it is not super sweet, which is great.  It has a nice cinnamon taste and enough sweet for me but not too sweet.  They use evaporated cane juice and molasses for sweeteners.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Would I buy it again?  *IF* I could be assured that I would never get another bag that smells rancid, yes I would.  Otherwise, probably not.

review/text: These clusters are fresh, crunchy, with just enough sweetness to enjoy eating by the handful. It doesn't have that typical oily taste that you get from other granola makers. Instead you get a clean tasting and healthy treat. Low in sodium and sugar, and best of all no saturated or trans fat! Highly recommend!

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years (including the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds ), and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste. I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids. Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.<br /><br />As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option. There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3.5g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol. There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g/20% are from sugar. There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 130 calories.

review/summary: Healthy and tastes great, but the clusters were crushed
review/text: I received my bag of Kind Healthy Grains clusters free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />We eat cereal for breakfast a couple of times per week, and I'm always looking for one the kids like that isn't half sugar and artificial colors. I was really impressed with the ingredients in this product -  Non-GMO flax seeds, amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  No artificial ingredients, preservatives or coloring, and it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice and molasses, and not the dreaded HFCS.  It's high in anti-oxidants, Omega-3s, and fiber, and is low in salt and fat. It has a very nice cinnamon flavor, too!<br /><br />Overall it's a very good choice for snacking or as cereal.  They need to put it in a box or some other container because my bag arrived with all the clusters broken into small pieces.  There was no way to eat this except as cereal with milk, or sprinkled on food (we had some on yogurt).  It tastes really good, with complex flavors from the various grains.  The kids like it, too.

review/summary: Absolutely Addictive
review/text: Oh my God is this stuff addictive. I really just ordered it because it was food and it was coming from the Vine program, so no risk. I opened it a few hours ago and the bag is like 1/3 gone. I'm a writer and one of the toughest parts of sitting at a computer all day is that if you have no self discipline (I have none) you snack all day. It's tough. You try to eat healthy things, but let's face it, you put a banana and a bag of M&Ms next to you on the desk and that banana is going to get eaten last. But this stuff is, if you can believe the label (and why wouldn't I?) very good for you--lots of grains, low carbs, low sodium, etc. So maybe (if I can afford it) I can sit here and munch and not feel half so guilty.<br /><br />I would imagine that this stuff will be very popular in airports where it's very hard to find anything healthy to bring on the plane with you. Fortunately, I rarely see bananas on sale in airports, so I eat the M&Ms guilt free :)<br /><br />But seriously, this stuff is great. And not too difficult to crunch either, which I sometimes worry about with granola, trail mix, etc. Of course, now I have to try the other flavors and I'm very intrigued by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IW4WFY">Kind Healthy Grains Dark Chocolate and Cranberry Clusters, 11-Ounces Bags (Pack of 3)</a>. Seriously? Chocolate hidden in a healthy snack? Man, that banana on the desk is going to get very old.

review/summary: Delicious and filling (just bring a toothbrush)
review/text: I'm big on granola in the fall and winter; for me, it's more satisfying, more filling, and it wards off the hunger pangs longer than cereal once the temperature starts to drop. (And before I start reaching for the oatmeal every day.) Because my personal "granola season" is fairly limited, I tend to be pretty selective, and in fact most years I make my own. This granola (or "Oat Clusters") isn't quite as good as homemade, but it is delicious; it fills you up; and it tides me over until lunch.<br /><br />I like the slight sweetness, that doesn't go overboard; I also like the mix of more solid "chunks" with smaller bits and grains. The cinnamon flavor is nice - definitely there - but not overpowering or cloying. In fact, the only thing I didn't like was what seemed - to me - to be a lot of sesame seeds (or seeds that looked like sesame), which got stuck in my teeth and gums no matter how much water I drank- even after two rounds of (sugar free) gum. It's not the end of the world of course, but it was a bit annoying; the next day I ate it I made sure to leave time to brush my teeth shortly afterwards, and all was well in the world.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Great Snack
review/text: This is a health food that reminds me a bit of cereal in a bag. It has vanilla flavoring with blueberries, flax seeds and grain clusters that are kind of like granola. It's high in fiber, has some protein, and is actually quite good. I've been eating it just as a snack but it also tastes good in yogurt. If you have a high powered food processor, it's good ground up as an addition to a smoothie. The package also suggests putting it in a bowl with milk like cereal, but I haven't done that.<br /><br />This is a gluten-free snack so that might be helpful. No artificial colors or flavors that I saw. Interestingly on the ingredients it indicates vitamin E was added but on the nutrition facts there is nothing about it. Strange I thought. Other than that, it's good, go for it!

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I usually don't eat a lot of granola. I find that it's either too sweet or too bland and anything even remotely "healthy" doesn't taste very good just eaten by itself.<br /><br />That's not a problem here. I ate this just by itself and found that it has a nice light flavor - not too sweet and there isn't an overwhelming flavor of blueberries or vanilla - just a nice blend of the two. The flax seeds give it a slightly nutty flavor that blends well. It was crunchy, but not overly so. While it is a bit high in calories (120 calories for a serving (1/3 of a cup)), I like that I get 5 g of fiber (20% of my daily requirement) in a serving.<br /><br />I did find that in my package, there were few "clusters" and at over $5 for an 11 oz package, it seems a tad expensive (especially if you only buy this product and don't get the free shipping from Amazon). But I do like it and plan on trying their other flavors.

review/summary: Super healthy & guilt-free snacking
review/text: I've seen the KIND brand bars in stores but never had the chance to try their granola.  As you can see in the description, there's a plethora of "good for you" grains, such as amaranth, quinoa (grain of the Incas that is loaded with amino acids and fiber), oats, millet and buckwheat.  Plus it also has flax which we know is beneficial for its omega-3 fatty acids plus adds more fiber to the mix.  As for the taste, this is not your typical sweet granola with a lot of added sugar -- instead KIND granola contains evaporated cane juice & molasses as sweeteners.  I recommend adding it to yogurt with fruit if you are used to a sweeter tasting granola.  It's not bad on its own but may be lacking in the typical granola flavor for some.

review/summary: tasty granola
review/text: I wasn't very certain what to expect when they kept pushing 'healthy' and 'fiber' and the such in the description.  I figured it was good for me, but might have to choke down a handful to get the benefits.  Glad to say that Kind came out with a rather tasty granola without much in the way of fillers.<br /><br />The flavor is cinnamon, but it doesn't overwhelm the granola/grains. If anything, it's mild and more of an 'aftertaste' (if that can be a positive review).  It hits your tongue more after you're chewing than before and it's definitely not artificial.  The granola is more of a 'softer' kind than I've come across (probably because of the brown rice) so it's not as if you're chewing on rocks and a welcome change.  It goes very well with yogurt since it's not too strong of a flavor and it does make a good cereal.  Since there are less sweetners (molasses and cinnamon seem to be it), you get more granola per serving than others I've noticed (1/3 a cup compared to 1/4) but it still has a great taste (i.e. not cardboard).<br /><br />Definitely will keep a bag on hand for punching up yogurt or for a healthy snack.  Also, it claims to be gluten-free (I'm not an expert on this), which is a nice option to have on hand for anyone who has gluten allergies.

It's not the cheapest cereal but you get what you pay for in the quality of the ingredients. I would recommend it; it's healthy and tastes good.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Kind bars when I need a healthy snack or light meal replacement, so I was excited to try their new granola.  Like the bars, this loose granola isn't too sweet and has a nice balance of protein and carbs.  The cinnamon flavor is noticeable but not overwhelming, and the texture is crunchy without cutting up the roof of my mouth.  And unlike other granola I've had, this stuff is actually good enough to eat "on-the-go," rather than only combined with yogurt or milk.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Awesome breakfast cereal or treat!!
review/text: My first thought was that this tastes like Cinammon Toast Crunch cereal... without the three layers of sugar to get to flake.  The level of cinammon was perfect - not overpowering.  The firmness and crispness were dead on too... held up well with both yogurt and milk as well as solo (fist snacking).<br /><br />The fiber is high which is great.  The sugar level makes this more of a snack than a staple for me and I would caution anyone with blood sugar issues to look carefully at the nutrition labels.  That said, I think it is a wonderful treat and change of pace from my current paleo diet - I will make it a regular part of my once a week "cheater" days.  For those without diet issues, I would highly recommend as a daily breakfast or snack option.  It reallly tastes good!!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

It was great  both ways.<br /><br />To me the real test for any food is: will my kids eat it? In this case the answer is a resounding yes. Additionally, I brought this along to munch on at a swim meet, and the kids on the team wanted a taste. They all liked it, too.
