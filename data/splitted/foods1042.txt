review/summary: pretty good value
review/text: Shopping and Delivery experience was very good. We bought this for the kids to take to school with their lunches and/or camping and other trips we may go on. Working out pretty well so far.<br /><br />Some other reviewers had indicated that the expiration period was too near. Our package's expiration is May of next year; which aligns well with the school year! Now, we'll wait to see if, by then, we finish all/most of what we bought :)

review/summary: Date stamped on product is mfg date, not expiration
review/text: I ordered this product on May 2, 2012. It arrived as promised and the box had a date stamped on it of Feb 14, 2012. It did not clarify whether this was the manufacture date or the expiration date. I called Amazon and they found a note related to this product indicating that this is the manufacture date and that the product expires 9 months from manufacture. I suggested they update their product description with this information because it can be confusing otherwise.<br /><br />So, it basically leaves me with 6 months to use this product. I doubt I will through 200 packets by then, but it is still much more convenient than finding another container to put a small amount of ketchup for single serving use.

review/text: This is exactly what you expect: 200 small Heinz ketchup packages like you find in a fast food restaurant. Mine came packaged in a grey cardboard box that looks like what you'd expect to see in the stock room of a restaurant, so don't expect a pretty product package like you'd see on the grocery store shelf. If you're buying small ketchup packets though, you probably don't care about that.

review/summary: HFCS  = Wont be feeding this to my family
review/text: Go with Simply Heinz Ketchup not these packs its the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS.<br /><br />HFCS.. Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?

The product I received is 6 months old.  I will have to donate it to a food bank. This is a good product, but not fresh enough for extended use. I will purchase at GFS after this.

review/summary: This is SALTY licorice
review/text: This type of candy is very popular in parts of Europe, like Scandinavia and Germany. To give salty licorice a one star rating because it tastes like salty licorice is supposed to, is like complaining about sugar tasting too sweet.<br /><br />These candies look very similar to Malaco's Salty fish, but tastes different to my big disappointment. Not the greatest salty licorice I've had, but works fine when there's none other around to buy.

review/summary: Startlingly Good!
review/text: I've always liked licorice and I've tried quite a variety of types. Well, here's a new one. It's salty licorice and I found it at our nearby IKEA store. It has a real fine, rich licorice taste plus it's quite salty. It's tough and chewy, perhaps somewhat like a fairly hard gummy bear in the shape of a fish. Nice mix. My wife (Russian) says it's more characteristic of northern European candies which tend to be less sweet. This licorice is imported from Sweden.<br /><br />You may find this a delicious candy and have trouble putting it down. That's my problem. On the other hand, you may not like it at all. Licorice sold in the U.S. tends to be much sweeter and less flavorful. If you're used to this type and then try these salty licorice fish, you may find it quite startling. My take is that it's startlingly good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Almost gagged--dont like salt like he does, so I figured it was just too salty for me...he hated it! the salt is too too salty for us.  Took to work--same reaction with everyone who tried it....we are definitely americanized I guess! But for someone who is interested in testing their tastebuds-this is the stuff!!!! And that is the reason for the 5 stars!

review/summary: Love the flavors
review/text: I am in love with the Rise Bar brand. My favorites are their breakfast bars, which have a chunkier and crispier consistency. The energy bars have more of a "Powerbar" like texture, everything is ground, with some shredded coconut added to some flavors for interest. Little bits of amaranth add some texture too, but they are still more soft and chewy than crunchy. That said, the energy bars taste pretty amazing too, and are a better alternative for strict vegans (sweetened with brown rice syrup and tapioca syrup instead of honey).<br /><br />To note, the Rise Energy Bars are very sweet, and almost dessert-like in my opinion. I enjoyed them most as a mid-day treat, particularly when I hit an afternoon lull before a workout. Plus, they are the perfect size for a sustainable energy snack.<br /><br />I love all of the "superfruit" inspired flavors, which are a fun change from the ordinary. That said, I think the blueberry and coconut is still my favorite - the flavors really stand out and are great together!

review/summary: My favorite energy bar
review/text: I've tried a bunch of different energy bars and this is my favorite. It's not as heavy as some, is quite satisfying, and is not too sweet. It is also organic, mostly raw (which I think is healthier), and doesn't have a ton of weird non-food ingredients. It's also fairly tidy to eat - I like the kind bars also, but they are very sweet and very messy. Generally I cut it in 1/2 - as I don't think I need all the calories at once, and use it as an in-between meal snack, or to help fill me up if I've only had a smoothie or salad for a meal. I used to be a big fan of the lara bars, but I prefer these. I've bought this flavor and the coconut flavor - and buy both in bulk on on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Delicious Treat
review/text: I discovered Stretch Island Fruit Leather in the grocery store while looking for an alternative to artificially flavored fruit rolls and was pleasantly surprised. They were sold individually, so I purchased one of each flavor available (strawberry, cherry, and raspberry) to sample. Raspberry and cherry turned out to be my two favorites.<br /><br />The strips are thick (think a thin strip of beef jerky) and if they've been sitting out in high temps, a thin sticky film will develop on them--I learned that the hard way--but if kept in the fridge or cool location, this can be avoided. There is some texture to the strips; I like to suck on them rather than bite and chew because it feels like a little tongue massage, but they are chewy. As for the flavor, it's tangy with a hint of sweetness.<br /><br />It reminds me of the fruit strips I used to make in my dehydrator, except with a bit more thickness and moisture. Basically, if you're searching for something ultra sweet or don't have a fondness for tangy/sour flavors, then this fruit leather may not be for you.

review/text: My family loves fruit leather, and I like the way that Stretch Island does business, but the Orchard Cherry has a cherry flavor that is just okay, more like dark cherry pie on its way out and I think it has to do with the other fruit flavors that they use to boost or support the cherry flavor. Even with the slightly different tone to the cherry flavor, it was a hit with my family and my husband ate just as many of them as the kids did! My only wish is that they offered even larger packages (like bulk for fruit leather fiends), so that it lasted longer in our house.

review/text: I ordered these through Subscribe & Save so I get them every month.  The price for them in brick-and-mortar stores has gone up, but I'm now getting them from Amazon.com at the same price per candy that I used to pay in a local store.  My kids absolutely LOVE them; they usually polish them off early so I have to order another shipment before the next one is due.  I've tried them myself and they taste wonderful; if you love cherry flavor you won't be disappointed. It's great to have natural "candies" for my kids.

review/summary: A great healthy snack!
review/text: I bought a big bag of this stuff at my local Costco after doing research on dried fruits with oils....not so good for you after all.  This is great because there are no preservatives at all; just dried apples, cherries and grapes.  Plus it's all organic so how could you go wrong?  A funny statement on the back says may contain pits, core fragments and stems - Hey it's real food!  Haha that gave me a good laugh.  This is how dried fruit is supposed to be!  A note with the apples - at first they seem to have a rubbery texture, but the more you keep chewing them, the sweeter and tastier they get.

review/summary: Weak flavor profile, but at least it is decaf
review/text: I find the flavor of this chai, when made as directed, to be flat and weak.  When made stronger (using nearly twice as much as the directions call for), the taste does greatly improve.  The flavor also has a bit too much star anise for my personal tastes.  I prefer to have anise take a backseat role in my chai, with more cardamom, cinnamon and clove tastes up front.  Either way it is a very creamy and smooth drink with the bonus of being decaffinated.  I am still searching for a really good decaf chai, unfortunately this one just didn't quite work for me.

review/summary: Best Decaffeinated Chai
review/text: I have always drank chai. All kinds, decaffinated or not. I bought a pack of 6 Pacific Chai Decaffeinated Vanilla Chai just before the holidays and ended up giving them away as little "try this" gifts. Everyone I gave them to asked where I had bought it - BIG success. My Mom is 82 and cannot drink ANY caffine. She (as well as me) loved this creamy light flavored vanilla chai. When I came back to stock up for the winter for both my Mom and myself, I noted that Train "decaffeinated" vanilla chai contained black tea and hense was NOT decaffinated. Pacific Chai Decaffeinated Vanilla Chai does NOT contain caffineated black tea. My Mom ad I are set for the winter. And by the way, it is a REAL treat with a dollop of very vanilla Silk (soy milk).

review/text: The Decaf Pacific Vanilla Chai is a soothing, mostly nondairy, milk-like drink that you can make hot or iced just by adding water.  I only drink it hot and like it very much though I wouldn't call it real chai... more like warm milk with sugar and spices in it - lol.  The black tea is pretty far down on the list of ingredients so authentic it ain't!  Still, I enjoy the warmth of the drink and find it comforting to sip for some reason so I'll continue purchasing.  It's especially nice to drink in the evenings on a cold day.

I have also introduced this to other people and am so glad it does come in the six pack because they always want a can after tasting it! I almost forgot to add the BEST thing about it is it is decaffinated so you can drink it any time of the day or night! In my humble opinion the decaffinated tastes MUCH better than the caffinated!

review/text: These folks really know how to make great food. My older dog, who is a picky eater, was skin and bones before we switched food. Now she is again healthy and happy.<br /><br />Amazingly,changing to K9 Natural cured dry, itchy skin and lackluster fur. Her coat shines and she no longer scratches and chews at herself.<br /><br />She does eat more than the recommended portions, so it is a bit more expensive than expected, but soooo worth the price.<br /><br />As an aside, the amount of waste that comes out in the end is about 1/4 of what it used to be. It also isn't smelly or gross. It makes clean-up way faster and easier. This may not seem like a big deal to some, but keeping the yard clean and odor free is pretty great, and having very little to pick up on walks is really nice!

review/summary: Healthy treats that help to naturally calm excited dogs
review/text: We originally bought this brand due to the claim that it uses "All Natural Cage Free Chickens" as well as the "No Hormones" and "No Antibiotics," etc.  But the items were surprisingly better in quality than the package claimed.  These strips are real strips of dried chicken, not just processed "meats" as some companies may use.  This particular flavor became our household favorite due to the effect it has on our easliy excited black lab, Hayden.<br /><br />At first I thought the ingredients were just light flavoring, since all of the packages seem to contain the exact same looking treats.  But, the smell is very strong.  This flavor contains chamomile and lavender - which claims to calm your dog.  This claim is very true for our dog.  Only after a couple of nights, we noticed a considerable difference in behavior for Hayden.  Our dog usually gets wound up in the evening time and continually wants to play even right before we go to bed.  After giving Hayden six strips, which is the suggested amount for his body size, he became docile and even sleepy before our bed time.<br /><br />I usually don't believe the statements that most products like this claim, but I can say we have noticed a big difference.  Granted the effect is short term and can't be predicted for really young dogs or "unfixed" dogs (for comparison our dog Hayden weighs 85 lbs, is 6 years old, and has been fixed).<br /><br />These are the draw backs though.  1) This is an expensive way to treat large dogs EVERY DAY, so maybe not realistic for everyone.  2) The effects may only last a few hours, so overly exciteable dogs may be able to "battle through" the effects.  3) Flavor is very strong and very odd (lavender?) some pickier dogs could turn their noses up to the smell and flavor of these treats.<br /><br />Just a note - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IUZZ2">Dogswell Happy Heart Chicken Breast, Flax Seed & Taurine, 3-Count 16-Ounce Bags</a> seems to have the opposite effect on our dog.  This product contains taurine - like Redbull - so maybe that's the reason.  I'd recommend that Happy Heart flavored treats should be avoided late in the evening.

review/summary: Change in product....
review/text: I have used these products for several years for my Cairn Terrier. Have always purchased them in health food stores and felt it was a safe product. Never had a problem. However, I recently(June) purchased this item from Amazon and recieved the 6 bags. It took a couple of severe illnesses in my dog for me to connect the mellow mut strips. He initially started vomiting yellow bile and it proceeded to a vomiting/diarrhea progression that lasted for two weeks with much abdominal pain. The first time, I thought he had just injested something outside that had caused inflammation in his abdominal tract. My dog eats an excellent, mostly organic diet...is seven years old and in great health and vitality. After the first bout of this "mystery illness" I didnt give him any treats for a while(because of the dehydrated form) just a very bland diet of rice and chicken/beef working back in to adding veggies etc that would be in his normal diet...he was fine. A few days ago, with the presence of wonderful health in my dog, I opened a bag of the mellow mut strips and gave him one per day for three days. Here we are again, same illness...same symptoms. This time, I made the connection...did some internet research and found numerous pet owners who have experienced the same "toxic" problems with these Dogswell products. I am writing this review to alert other pet owners to a likely contamination problem in these products.

review/summary: Made my dogs calm and they loved these!
review/text: I was surprised that these treats actually calmed my dogs down, especially the four month old puppy, who is hyper. All three dogs loved these treats. For the puppy, I broke the strip into smaller pieces for him, and it worked out well. None of the dogs got sick from the treats. I will buy these again for sure. The ingredients are all natural.

review/text: Dry, clean, easy to pack up for a stroll.  I have a very small dog so I break these into little pieces for treats (and bribes). We have tried all kinds of other treats but these are his favorite and mine and seem to be a healthier and more natural addition to his diet than biscuits or other snacks.

We use it prior to thunderstorms or fireworks to keep everyone relaxed and at ease. The chicken is cage-free and the ingredients are all-natural. Dogswell products are consistantly high-quality and well priced.

review/text: We have been buying this product from Amazon.com for some time now. We save money and their delivery service is great. I have noticed with the last 3 orders that we received, the strips are not as soft as they used to be. I mainly purchase them for our 13 year old dog who has trouble chewing due to missing teeth. I hope the soft strips come back soon as I will have to search for something else for her. Our other 3 dogs will continue to eat them!

review/summary: My dog's favorite treat
review/text: These are, by far, our 5 month old beagle's favorite treat.  We like that they are all natural and they are much cheaper to buy online than in the pet stores.  However, she gets so excited about them that they really don't mellow her out at all - they actually seem to have the opposite effect!  Still, a great product, and they smell good, unlike a lot of other dog treats.  Try putting them into Kong toys for a fun challenge for your dog (and good way to make them last longer!)

review/summary: Causes intestinal issues
review/text: Our dogs love these chicken strips, unfortunately I cannot recommend them nor purchase them again. When given in the recommended amount (4 strips for our over 75lbs. dogs) all three dogs developed loose stool. I eliminated other treats in order to isolate the cause and unfortunately it is the mellow mut.  Too bad, because they actually seem to work in calming the dogs on rainy days when they don't get a lot of activity and as a bonus them calmed our 88lb. GSD/mix who is afraid of thunderstorms. I will continue the search for the perfect  calming treat...

review/text: These are wonderful packaged jerky treats, with nothing questionable in them as far as I can tell.  I would rather be making my own jerky, but since I don't have the time, tools and space to do so, these are great.  I get them delivered every 3 months, and end up paying only $0.67 an ounce, compared to the $1.59 an ounce I would be paying if I bought individual packages from Petco. My doggy LOVES these jerky treats too!

review/summary: Great product - my dog is addicted!
review/text: The "mellow mut" chicken breast strips are great for my dog - he loves them and they aren't full of artificial junk. They make a good snack mid-morning for him when starts bugging me for food. Only one drawback: some of the strips are not consistent in size and this creates a problem for a little chihuahua mouth with few teeth; some of the strips are so thick he can't bite through them. I give them to the neighbor's big dog, which makes the cost of the ones we keep very expensive!

review/summary: Made my dog VERY ill
review/text: I gave my 1 year old healthy dog one of these strips.  Within 12 hours, he began a bout of diarrhea that has now lasted 4 days; vomiting began last night.  We are on our way to the vet this morning -- I hope something can be done.  That chicken strip was the ONLY change in his regular diet, so I am certain that his illness is a result of this product.  I strongly suggest that you do not purchase this item.  It looks like some sort of high-quality, natural product, but I believe that's just marketing.  I have contacted the store at which I purchased the treats as well as the company.  I hope that the product is taken off the market and that no other dogs and owners have to go through the experience we've had with Mellow Mut chicken strips.

What I got was a single unit, NOT the 6.<br /><br />When I called about this, the mistake was corrected immediately, so that was good. And I got to keep the single unit I received FREE. That was nice.<br /><br />Still, you may have a picking-and-packing problem in the dog-treat division. Any ideas on how to avoid this? The order form doesn't supply any alert mechanism. SO I GUESS THE PICKER JUST HAS TO READ THE ORDER MORE CAREFULLY?

Now, I'm almost sad I tried it because it makes my old standby pale in comparison.  The supermarket no longer sells the french roast, so I'm looking forward to the day when amazon carries it.  If you want a reliably delicious whole bean coffee, look no further, it's the closest thing to perfection out there for a pretty good price.<br /><br />Great job on your coffee, San Francisco Bay!

review/summary: Can't beat the taste for the price!
review/text: Half the price of starbucks/peets coffee and tastes just as good!<br /><br />I drink a ton of coffee,  use a french press and always fresh grind.  I'm always on the lookout for a good coffee that is not expensive (starbucks, etc. are way too high priced). I ran across this coffee at costco one day, and have been buying it ever since (about 2 years).<br /><br />There is some variability month to month (I go through a bag a month) and one month the coffee was not as oily,  and one month it was so oily it cloged my grinder.  The taste has not varied too much, and I have never been dissapointed with the taste for the price.  If I had the money to waste,  Peets Major Dickasons is a bit better than this coffee.<br /><br />This coffee is cheaper at costco, but if you add local sales tax, it's roughly the same as amazon's price.  I have not tried ordering this product from amazon as I buy it from costco near my house.<br /><br />The bag this coffee comes in is very heavy clear plastic and OK for reseal, however I prefer to store it in an air tight plastic container to keep the aroma fresher longer.<br /><br />Aroma on the coffee is very good.
