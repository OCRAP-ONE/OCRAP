review/text: This Jerk seasoning is awesome.  So much more flavor that any other product I've ever tried.  It comes in a thick paste which packs a heck of a spicy punch.  My guests and I were VERY happy.

review/summary: Great Product - Bad Vendor
review/text: I really like the product and it does make a great margarita but buyer beware. The web site for ordering is not very clear and you may end up getting only one jar and paying $30 for shipping when you can get three jars for the same $30 shipping cost (does not include the product cost). I complained to the vendor but they didn't seem to care. I ended up paying $52.50 for one jar (including shipping) when I could have paid $97.50 for three jars which would be an average of $32.50 per jar (including shipping).

review/summary: For Cheese Lovers!
review/text: My 6lb puppy goes crazy for cheese, any cheese any time.  These treats are a total blessing as they do not require refrigeration and they do not contain anything aside from cheese!  They are little disks about 3/4" diameter, and have a consistency akin to a thin rice cake.  I use these for training sessions as my pup can eat them super fast, they do not seem to fill her up, and she always wants more.  They also do not have a nasty smell nor do they leave my fingers stinky or sticky.  A great treat that I will always keep on hand.

review/summary: Great products; not as big as it seems in photo
review/text: I give this a 3 because it has great products in it and was the perfect "thank you" gift for my son's teachers.  I was just a little shocked to see it was not as "big" as it appeared in the photo once delivered. Without any other items around it in the photo, you can't tell it's about 6-8" wide by about 12" tall.  It was compact, and shrink wrapped, so all the items fit in the box base.  This is great to ship it, but it doesn't look like a $25 gift without opening it, "fluffing" it up, and putting my own ribbon on it so it would look like the image shown.

review/summary: "Substituted with high quality candy" my PO'd butt!
review/text: We ordered 20 of these as gifts for our clients. We were excited when they arrived, but were quite upset when we opened the box to inspect our goodies. It was definitely not what we had expected, and certainly not something the reflects the level of appreciation we have for our customers. Besides the packaging's being cheap-looking.<br /><br />Upon closer reading of the product description, we found: Do we ship chocolates in warm weather? Delicate chocolates will be substituted with high quality candy in transit to preserve the quality of your gift while in transit.<br /><br />Well, our delicate chocolates were substituted with OTHER chocolates (Almond Roca), and the unmentioned and hardy coffee was also switched out with a cheap, hotel-caddy brand.<br /><br />All together, we could have put together this $25 gift basket for less than $10.00 - packaging included. I completely understand that they need to make a profit, but I would have loved for them to make a profit off the products that they advertised, rather than cheap substitutions that I'll have to return.<br /><br />The biscotti would have been $1.38<br />[...]<br />The coffee was 2/$1.31<br />The Almond Roca was 2/$1.19<br />[...]<br />The Butter Toffee Corn was $0.75<br />[...]<br />The English Tea cookies 6/$23.08<br />[...]<br />The mixed fruit Candy was $2.00 (and I didn't hunt for a deal)<br />[...]<br /><br />Overall...I would have much rather taken the time to put something together myself. Needless to say, we will be returning these and seeking a quality gift that matches our expectations and level of appreciation for our clients.

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/summary: AESTHETICALLY PLEASING~~~~SPRINKLES!
review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/text: These Twizzlers are amazingly addictive and delicious.  I love fruity & chewy candy and this is my all-time favorite.<br /><br />They're also incredibly unhealthy.  Each bag contains 2,080 calories (16 Twizzlers) and weighs over half a pound.  It's easy to eat half in one sitting. Once I ate a whole bag. Be forewarned.  It's a bag full of sweet sweet wonderful starchy corn syrup poison.  I would rate it one star for your health, five stars for the best candy you'll ever taste.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: This is one of the worst-tasting candies I've tried in a while. I thought I would like them because I like regular Twizzlers and I also like sour gummy candy, but these have none of the good qualities of either.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the package I smelled a weird, Play-Doh like smell. The twizzlers were extremely soft, rubbery and plastic-like, and they tasted terrible. They weren't really sweet or sour. One was supposed to be lemon and the other cherry, but the closest to either flavor that I tasted was a vague cough-syrup type flavor from the red vine. The gooey stuff in the middle wasn't really gooey, either, it was just softer than the outside. I'm really surprised that this product was released because Twizzlers are so great, how could they mess it up in such a big way?<br /><br />It comes in a huge bag and I threw the rest of it out after one taste. I'll never eat these again.

review/text: These remind me of Now & Laters in that they've got an interesting tangy-sweet taste with a subtle petrochemical flavor. Like Now & Laters they taste nothing like fruit, but that's not what they're going for. I'm not a big fan of regular Twizzlers but I like these a lot - too bad they're not low calorie. They're a bit dangerous because they seem like they should be filling, but they really aren't so you can eat a lot of them without thinking about it. Best to portion out a few ahead of time & put the bag well out of reach.

review/text: I'm a big fan of regular Twizzlers. If you think that these Sweet & Sour Filled Twists are anything like regular Twizzlers then you will be sorely disappointed. These taste absolutely horrible. They taste like sucking on a bottle of cleaning supplies, or maybe like cheap side-of-the-road reststop hand soap. Further, the texture is like soft plastic filled with elmer's glue. Nevermind the bad taste, the texture is so gross you won't want to eat these. These are also very, very unhealthy with a whopping 70 calories PER TWIST. Avoid this candy at all cost--it is repulsive.

review/text: These taste better if you eat them in the dark.  They just look like something you would clean out of your drain. That being said, they taste okay but there is a distinct 'powdery' spice taste.  Of course, when you are dealing with a bagged snack, I guess that is to be expected.  I did find them surprisingly filling but that comes with the price of being high in calories.  However, compared to the same amount of something like potato chips, these will be healthier and your better bet. Plus, as I mentioned, these will be filling.

The price is outrageous due to shipping from Finland even if you buy mulitple boxes.  Its not worth the money unless its a wedding or formal event to buy these milk chocolate 4% alcoholic candies.  They are delicious but even Godiva brand looks like a bargain compared to this chocolate's overall price tag. These are semi-soft candies with a gel shell of liquid vodka centers the size of a Jelly Belly...milk chocolate soft coating and liquid center.  They are a product of Finland and are superior but too pricey  ( I bought them at a wholesaler in the past & also on ebay as a lot for a special occasion & will wait until the price drops before I get them here on Amazon )  Elegant gormet candy. 5 stars on product 1 star on price.

review/summary: It must be the box?
review/text: This is a nice idea and a swell looking box. For the money spent though,  (not including shipping), this is a LOT of cash for a few items of candy.  I guess what you are actually buying is the gift IDEA, not necessarily a nice amount of treat items.<br /><br />Just thought I would let you know ahead of time.

review/text: 1950's Retro Candy Gift Box<br />I ordered this for my husband for Christmas 2008.  The box was torn and banged up.  There may have been $5.00 worth of candy in it and most of it was stuff I could have bought in any novelty shop-even cracker barrel. As a matter of fact, Cracker Barrel did have similar items in a basket for half the price.  I wish I had saved my money.  Then add on the shipping- it was VERY expensive!

review/text: I bought the 1950's candy crate for my daughter for her birthday. I paid $38.00 with shipping and handling. I don't know what I expected but I was stunned at how little we got. It was about $5.00 worth of candy (probably worth no more than $.50 total in the 1950's), .50 for all the waste of paper to stuff the box, and the rest of the cost was probably for nostalgia. I would never buy one again.

review/summary: Nice assortment, but quality was poor.
review/text: The Retro Candy Gift Box was a nostalgic assortment of nostalgic candies. I bought it for a family member who enjoyed several of these candies during their childhood years. Unfortunately the candy freshness was poor. Most of the confections were shelf-stale. Old. Gums were rock-hard, such as the Bazooka individuals. Suckers had a soft outer layer. Too many items were obviously past their sell-by dates. The joke went around the table that "maybe these candies *are* actually left over from the 50's!". It was a trip down memory lane for the gift receiver, but a disappointing one at that. I would not buy this again.

Perhaps I was expecting to be wow-ed and was disappointed instead.  The candy was damaged.  I am hoping no one else played around with this candy before I received it.  The box it came in was cute with its little bow.  I'm afraid to eat the candy because it looks like its been handled.  It's not worth the money.

They loved watching him dig through the packing to see what candy he'd pull out next!  There were quite a few candies that he hadn't seen in years-and he loved all the different kinds-from the candy cigarettes to the mustache!  What a cute idea!  The only complaint (if you could call it that) is we would have loved seeing doubles of some of the smaller candies in the box to fill it up a bit more.  I would purchase again!

review/summary: Lots of Laughs and Good Memories
review/text: We have had so much fun with this product. I actually bought the Candy Crate 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s retro candy boxes for a dinner party in September where we were celebrating 4 birthdays. Between dinner and dessert, I put the boxes on the dinner table and let everyone participate in opening the candies. Everyone laughed and talked for an hour or more about the candy and memories of growing up. Since that time, I have done the same thing with school friends on a recent vacation, my brother's birthday and will be using once again at an upcoming dinner party. The Candy Crate candies are well packaged and you get plenty of product. Be prepared however; the shipping cost is as much as the candy. I have to say that it is worth the cost to see friends and family have such a good time!

Sooo, my sister did not know who sent the candy until I asked.  She said the packaging was nice and the candy brought back many pleasant memories, except that most of the candy was stale & hard.  She said she liked the "crispy" jelly beans, but had a hard time chewing the "leather like" bazooka bubble gum.  Although definitely stale, she said she enjoyed the present and ate the candy anyway...

I didn't & the item arrived late August, about 20 days before my mom's birthday in September.  I stored it in the fridge til her birthday because I knew some of the candy would be melted or close to it.  Thank goodness I did too.  There was more chocolate candy inside than I expected.

review/summary: A Yummy Adventure!
review/text: Don't be afraid to try something new!<br /><br />So this matcha is very earthy smelling in the dry form. When I opened the bag there was really nothing remarkable about the smell other than sort of an earthy aroma mixed in with the matcha aroma. I shrugged and was like "okay" lol I just didn't know what to think. I have never heard of Lucuma let alone had Lucuma before so what do I know!?!<br /><br />I did however want to expand my horizons and the health benefits of Lucuma really interested me as well. Especially helping with skin inflammations and as an immune system booster!<br /><br />So I prepared the matcha of course and took a sip. It just tasted like matcha but of course a Red Leaf Tea quality matcha which equals GOOD STUFF!<br /><br />I added my ice and milk - as in my typical latte preparation of course, but this time did not yet add the splash of vanilla creamer. Took a sip - still the same - wonderful matcha flavor, but nothing else.<br /><br />So then I added my splash of vanilla low fat creamer, hummm now this is an interesting turn of events. I taste a light fruitiness here! Is it my imagination perhaps? Is it wishful thinking? Is it that somehow magically the creamer brought out the fruity flavor? Maybe it is a mental thing since this is now the way I usually enjoy my matcha - I have myself fooled into thinking things always taste better this way? I don't know. I am willing to admit if that is the case but maybe had I just added some sugar (there is sugar in the creamer I am sure - its not sugar free and even if it were it would have some kind of sweetener in it in the place of sugar right?). So I am thinking ... this must be a fruit that is complimented and made more predominant with the addition of some kind of sugar, not the creamer at all!<br />&#8232;So next time I have this I will leave the creamer out and add some sugar which ironically I had considered doing before adding my creamer but I just didn't want THAT much sugar in my matcha. Still for the sake of science next time I will!<br /><br />So then, how does this matcha TASTE? Well, its matcha tasting, with this light juicy like flavor similar to a melon. The fruit looks like an avocado to me. I looked up the Lucuma Fruit and found that it is supposed to have a flavor similar to a sweet potato and maple and you know what I do get that! Its light mind you the matcha flavor itself is the predominant flavor here. It is richer as a matcha though and I think that is due to the Lucuma! Still I get this melon flavor too. It truly is interesting and nothing about it tastes bad at all. I just don't really have my mind wrapped around it yet HOWEVER if you are adventurous and want to try something out of the box this is a good one to select for sure!

review/text: This was truly a wonderful surprise! A great strong decaf tea that I could use for iced tea mixes. I've tried several brands of decaf black tea and found them either lacking richness or generally serviceable but nothing special. But this tea is the best I've found at a great price. The tea brews wonderfully dark, which is just what I was looking for. And it has a good rich black tea flavor without being bitter. I'm really enjoying this tea, especially since finding good decaf teas can be difficult. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Harris Decaf Black Tea !!!!
review/text: The greatest thing about Harris Decaf Black Tea is that it NEVER gets bitter like most orange peoke teas.  The longer you let it steep the better the flavor gets.  Be patient with it.  It makes great ice tea - I put two tea bags in a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup filled with cold water, put it in the microwave for 5 minutes and then let it steep till it is cold.  Refrigerate it after it is cooled down.  I usually drink it without sugar or lemon it is that good.  I've been adding mint/spearment leaves to the brew this summer and it makes a very refreshing drink.<br /><br />You might not realize it but Harris Decaf Black Tea was the first decaf tea to make it to the grocery store shelves under the name of Milford-Harris Decaf Tea.  When the major brands came out with their own versions the grocery stores stopped selling this tea.  I went on a search and got a company address - since then I mail ordered a case or two at a time directly from the company.  Now it is available from Amazon - great move.

review/summary: Not a good product
review/text: I have been drinking decaf tea for years, and thought I would save a few dollars by buying the Harris tea bags.<br />The tea itself is fine.  Weaker than Lipton or Tetley, but still ok.<br />However, about every 3rd bag has broken after I poured the water.<br /><br />So in the long run, it is much costlier than the other brands due to waste.<br /><br />Would not buy again.

review/summary: Very healthy!
review/text: I had been drinking green tea because I'd read it was very good for you. It took me a while to acquire a taste for it but eventually I came to really like it & drink it throughout the day at work. But recently I had some surgery & was told by my doctor to stop drinking green tea for a few weeks prior to my procedure. I'd also read where black tea has the same healthful properties as green tea. My doctor said black tea would not interfere with my surgery so I bought some. It's a similar taste to green tea but stronger. It gets strong very quickly when steeping so if you prefer a lighter taste I would recommend pulling the teabag out pretty quickly. But I like it. I'll probably alternate now between green & black tea for variety-sake.

review/summary: The Greatest tea
review/text: We first tried Harris Decaf tea bags when we found it at our Local store but they were discontuning<br />it. We were were really wanting to find it in other stores but they did not have it. So I called the<br />Harris Co. and they let me order a case of it. We have been using it for years and would not<br />be without it. We only use one tea bag for both of us. We put one tea bag in our tea pot and it<br />is strong enough for both of us. It has no bitter taste like other tea brands. I carry some<br />bags in my purse so we can have it when we go out to dinner.

review/summary: Taste good whatever they are
review/text: This product tastes good and seems fresh (no crunchy ones) however the packaging is small town.  This product came double bagged in a clear bag with no label whatsoever.  The gumballs are not labeled either (some pics of this brand show printing on each individual gumball) and since I lack the lab and knowledge necessary I cannot do a molecular analysis on the composition of these gumballs.  I guess I can only trust that they are the Double Bubble brand that I ordered.

review/text: I was happy that I got these on Amazon for a much better deal then I could anywhere else. They came in pretty colors and were in good shape when they arrived (not cracked or chipped). They're your typical gumballs - tasty for a short while, then they lose their flavor. They served their purpose though - they were a party favor. I passed them out to birthday party guests in little bags as they left the party. Overall they were what I expected and a good price to boot!

review/text: This is your no-frills classic powdered green tea.  This green tea is like a pearl necklace on Audrey Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe.  It's both classy and sexy and icons of a more romantic era.  While it's not the most superb matcha or the most interesting, you simply can't go wrong with Royal Matcha.  It's a comforting and energizing drink for the morning, and if you're immune to caffeine, this makes a great latte for dessert after dinner.  Like I said, you can't go wrong with this.

review/text: I'm allergic to walnuts and almonds and I LOVE granola. Unfortunately for me, this means I can't really eat granola, because almonds are usually the second ingredients in granola. But then I found THIS granola! It's sweet, delicious, full of raisins and nary an almond to be found!<br /><br />It is, as the other reviewer pointed out, a little dry, but I always eat mine with yogurt or milk so until she pointed out the fact that it's dry, it didn't really occur to me.<br /><br />Bottom line?<br /><br />This stuff is AMAZING. and DELICIOUS.<br /><br />&lt;3

review/text: I first tried this granola in Alaska about 15 years ago and fell in love with it. We drove all over the state eating the granola right out of the carton.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered a case.  Either it's not the same product, or they've changed the recipe.  It seems much drier, no clusters to speak of, and just isn't as flavorful as I remember.  I'll just stick to the easily obtainable Quaker Low Fat Granola in the future.

My dog LOVES this food, he's always very excited for meal time and gobbles it up very fast.<br />The 74% meat and 26% veggies is the balance that dogs would be getting in the wild, and the added organ meats are great for them.<br />The minimal ingredients is also a very good thing, healthier dog foods lately add in all kinds of fruits and such, and that's actually<br />not a diet that would be best for dogs and not close to the ancestral diet.<br />It's a GREAT food for dogs with allergies like mine because it doesn't have tons of things to bother them.

review/text: I have used this food for over 10 years.  They continue to work to make it better and better.  This seems to be the best formula to date.  My dogs have beautiful coats and their stools are firm.  It's true that the cost of the food can be a bit hard on the wallet but I found the food worth the price. I think the shipping costs are what tend to drive up the price of the food for those of us who do not have a store nearby who stock it. It can be nice; however, to have your dog food directly delived to your door.  I am currently using the turkey.  I have not tried the pork or the duck.

review/summary: Love the food, hate the price.
review/text: We rescued our first dog October 30th and because I was stupid and had never had a dog, we bought back to basics turkey and started him on it right away. No transition. Obviously, this upset his digestion and whatnot and he had loose stools for almost a month. He has been on it, and since mid-December, the Pork and I just recently saw the duck line. He is doing great. His coat is gorgeous, shiny and soft, his teeth are white and shiny and his bowels are normal. I love this food, I just HATE the price. I understand quality costs though. I had a friend recommend Kirkland's and we may switch to that since it is cheaper. It's a 4/5 stars, but it'd be a little bit better on my pocketbook.

Also whether the PGPR ingredient (look it up) is the cause or not, I'm not sure either but I certainly will be watching Hershey's and Nestle's products and not buying which is known to have PGPR. Perhaps it is the Castor Oil this PGPR is partially composed of since in my childhood and I stated I was to sick to go to school my mom offered Castor Oil as a remedy for my sickness -- off to school I would go.

review/text: Cardia Salt is the best thing I've done for myself in years!  And it's delicious!!  Over the last 3 months I've lost weight, am not bloated and feel great - and the only dietary change I've made is switching to Cardia Salt.  I use it for everything.  It's delicious - and I'm a salt freak - salting cream cheese and toast and cheesecake for example.  My friends would give me flavored and exotic salts for Christmas.  Now cardia salt is all I use.  I filled my salt dish with it and use it for cooking and all salt uses.<br /><br />I discovered Cardia Salt in a New York Times article that stated that it's not the sodium that's bad for you, it's when the sodium/potassium ratio gets out of whack, and that in the US we use way too much salt and get far too little potassium, which is in all whole foods, but not in processed foods we eat too much of.  In Finland they call it Pan Salt, and I read in the Times article that they put the whole country of Finland on Pan Salt and reduced their cardiac disease by 60%!!!<br /><br />  Try Cardia Salt, you will love it.  Be sure to take a kelp pill to get your iodine.<br /><br />A note to the manufacturers - please package it in bulk like sugar or salt instead of the individual little shakers that are hard to break into.  You'd save a bundle on packaging and customers would be less frustrated trying to open the shakers.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1QCUG">Cardia Salt (3-Pack)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JV0SPU">Cardia Salt (6-Pack)</a>

review/text: Although there is a big convenience factor of shopping online and then putting dinners right in the freezer for latter so I gave a two but quality is not great. The burgers are very fatty and the steaks (filets) taste aged due to sitting around too long not part of the aging process for taste and quality. The fish comes out of the bag smelling fishy not fresh. Again all my opinions are based on that I'm used to top shelf very fresh or properly aged meats and fishes. I thought I'd try them and it wasn't horrible just not great. Everything was edible I just felt the need to cook well done.

review/text: The first time I purchased these poppers, my scotties must have figured I won the lottery.  They love the taste, they love the crunch and it's the only ball I can get them to chase (and return everytime! The only thing that would make it a better product for me is a more detailed nutritional breakdown. One of my scotties was recently diagnosed with Cushing's disease and along with this disease it is typical that high blood pressure is a concurrent issue. Not knowing how much salt is in the product is making me question future purchases. I realize that this is an industry-wide problem and no way lessens the absolute joy of watching "my girls" chasing their poppers!  An absolutely great treat!!!

review/text: I have two Chihuahuas who are housebound.  They are trained to peepads/newspaper.  They are rewarded for using those facilities since Chihuahuas have been known to lift elsewhere and everywhere.  This is perhaps the favorite reward which delights me.  I had been using dog jerky type treats but didn't think it was as healthy and it certainly was gummy.  If these crunchy items are meeting the challenge of treating the dogs and perhaps helping keep down dental plaque I am very happy.
