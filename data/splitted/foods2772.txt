review/text: I originally purchased two containers (6 pounds total) to try this honey for making mead.  Of course I had to taste a little bit before pouring all six pounds into my fermenting tank, and it's delicious. I ended up keeping that bottle open and ordering a third so I had an untainted bottle for my mead, haha. Both orders arrived undamaged and well packaged. The product itself is fantastic, you can really taste the slight citrus notes in the honey, it is darker in color than your run of the mill grocery store bought, nice and thick and gives my mead a very rich, amber color.

review/summary: Packing Issue
review/text: Considering the price of honey these days, this would be a pretty decent buy if the product were shipped and received fully intact. I received this bottle, which is supposed to have a flip-top lid, with only the lower part of the lid on it. The top, flip part had not only been raggedly broken off it, the missing part was not even in the box! Obviously, the person who packed it could see that the top was broken off, but decided to send it to me that way, regardless. The inner seal was intact, so I decided to keep it, as it would not be worth the cost to send it back. It is delicious honey, with excellent citrus notes. However, noting that another customer also had a packing problem, this seems to be habitual. I would have rated it 5 stars if not for this problem.

review/text: I haven't had Orange Blossom Honey this good since we moved from Florida to Texas many years ago.  It brought back amazing memories and a very happy mouth.  If you are a honey lover and want the best tasting honey ever, you have to order a couple of bottles.  They were shipped timely, packaged very well (in a plastic bag besides the packing material) reasonably priced, and worth ordering.  This was my first order of Tropic Bee and it definitely won't be my last.

review/summary: Best Honey Ever!!!!!
review/text: I ordered this honey for my 93 year old Father.  He uses honey in his tea and to sweeten other items in his home.  He has been doing this for as long as I can remember and he knows when he has obtained a product that is outstanding and he absolutely loves this Tropic Bee Orange Blossom Honey.  He said that this is the ONLY honey that he will ever use and I plan to keep purchasing it for him.  He said a lot of the honey being sold on the shelves do not taste right and I must have purchased over ten varieties for him until I found this product on Amazon.  It is not available in any of the stores or speciality shops so I will continue to log on and purchase it from Amazon. I have started using this product myself and IF you love honey, ORDER this brand.  You will find it to be outstanding.

review/summary: BEST honey I've ever gotten mail order!
review/text: I'm picky about my honey, and most is too bland (blended) to impress me.  I don't require a honey to be a specific variety, but it should represent some good variety well. This is the best citrus variety I've ever gotten mail order.  I was raised in the Rio Grande Valley in the fifties, and, sure, I've tasted even better fresh from the hive during the citrus bloom, but that's not a fair comparison. I've got this on subscribe and save, which is my endorsement!

review/text: I needed some breath mints, and when I saw the "3 Hour Mint" words on the box I picked it up. The "Clinically proven to reduce intrinsic bad breath for up to three hours" sold me. I gave them a try, and must say that I was sold! The mints have a nice taste - strong spearmint that was not overpowering. Plus, it has a nice minty aftertaste that lingered in my mouth, and (I am reliably informed) kept my breath sweet.<br /><br />Now, just because these mints are "sugar free" that doesn't mean that they are zero calories. In fact, each one has five calories (carbs 2g.), which is not bad for a large mint (the size of a Life Savers candy, as apposed to these tiny, tiny mints).<br /><br />I really like these mints, and will definitely be buying more!

review/summary: Not for coffee lovers.
review/text: The product description states: "A delightful blend of chocolate, hazelnut, and cinnamon flavors bring to life one of our most popular flavored coffees ever. Cookiedoodle will remind your taste buds of warm holiday cookies all year long."<br /><br />In the three lb. order that I received there was barely a hint of coffee flavor, but not even a hint of either a chocolate nor a hazelnut flavor. The coffee beans do have a chemical type hint of cinnamon flavor, but are so lacking in coffee taste that I can only guess that they are very old and dried out coffee beans, with all of the coffee oils completely gone.<br /><br />The aroma and roast of the type of coffee in the "coffee" beans is almost completely missing. It reminds me more of a very weak flavored tea instead of a medium or even very lightly roasted coffee.<br /><br />It is impossible to guess what type of coffee bean were used because of the complete lack of body or flavor in the brewed coffee.<br /><br />I didn't get the taste of "old" dried out coffee, but then again, I didn't quite get a coffee flavor taste either.

But when a person has a bag this size (20oz) staring at her with 4 different flavors and life is short as it is, the imperative to eat more than one is overwhelming...if these are still on sale, buy it with thethought you will share them with loved ones even if you stash them away for lil ol you, you deserve it.

Does not really hurt anything, but clearly these cans were "salvaged" and repackaged for sale here to people who could not see their condition.  That's fine, but I'd expect some disclosure and a better price for dented goods.  Current price is about the same as local prices.

I tried to improve the flavor by adding cilantro....still the "rasam" still did not taste good. Next I added a packet of MTR ready to eat sambar and a small eggplant, some minced carrot, a diced potato, a few string beans and okra... And more cilantro. Now the rasam/sambar was passable but would have been a lot better if I had made it from scratch. All this took a lot of time which defeated the point of using a ready to eat packet!  I like the MTR spice mixtures but NOT the ready to eat!

review/summary: delicious for krispie treats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I'm always on the look out for flavored marshmallows to use in krispie treats, which is hubby's favorite sweet snack.  When I saw these I thought they'd be worth a try.  Aside from just sampling them from the bag I've only used them for the treats.  They are a pineapple flavored marshmallow rolled in toasted coconut.  The only thing that I could say was a drawback is that my recipe calls for 10 oz. so I usually use a package of these then 16 regular size marshmallows to come to the 10 oz.  I also increased the butter from my usual 3 T. to 4 T. which gave them the usual consistency, otherwise the coconut will really make your mixture thick.  I've bought a lot of flavored marshmallows in the past but these seem to be the big favorite.  They make a pleasantly sweet coconut'y' treat that is out of the ordinary.  Keep them on hand because as we go into winter I'm guessing these will be sailing off into the sunset, just when you need them most.

review/summary: False Advertising - FROM CONCENTRATE
review/text: I buy this juice at the local grocery store, and on the label it states NOT FROM CONCENTRATE as well as on the ingredient list. I just received these from amazon and they say FROM CONCENTRATE, but amazon advertises it as PURE NOT FROM CONCENTRATE. Just a heads up for anyone like myself looking for the real stuff, as from concentrate juice can be had for a fraction of the cost of the real stuff. Very disappointed.

review/summary: Not a concentrate- it has water added
review/text: It is good juice, but it is not concentrate like it says. It does have water added. I have seen a bottle of this brand that is a concentrate and does not have water added, but cannot find it anywhere. I thought this was it, but it's not. I can get this locally with the water added. I want the concentrate, just cranberry (with the c). If I wanted the juice with the water, I would have given it five stars. I give it one because the ingredient list is different, and that is what I expect, the ingredients to be right.

review/summary: False Advertising & Retail Fraud
review/text: Sounds pretty harsh but, if a local store did what Amazon is doing here, the authorities would be on them in a heartbeat.  Amazon describes this juice as "not from concentrate."  Previously, I was getting Mountain Sun cranberry juice from a local grocery store which was "not from concentrate."  It was expensive, over [..] a bottle but, cheaper than the health food stores.  Then, they changed to the cheaper version from Mountain Sun, made from concentrate, at around [...] a bottle.  I was delighted to see Amazon had the "not from concentrate" and at a good price.  My wife and I have bought from Amazon for years but, not food items.  We have always been very satisfied with Amazon until now.  When we received our first shipment of juice, I was shocked to see that the juice was made from concentrate.  Amazon was passing off the cheaper juice for the "not from concentrate" version and at a higher price than I can buy locally.  What a fraud and retail scam!  Amazon, I no longer respect you as a trusted vendor and will be much more cautious in buying from Amazon in the future.  I will also tell all my friends and family to be cautious when buying from Amazon as well.

review/text: This is full strength cranberry juice, so it's really really tart! But oh so good when diluted or mixed in other beverages or used for cooking. And because you dilute it, the three bottles go a long way.<br /><br />I make my own cranberry juice drink by diluting this pure cranberry juice with four parts water, then sweetening with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FL08AG">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Turbinado Raw Cane Sugar</a>.<br /><br />It's a great, flavorful substitute for lemon in tea. My personal favorite is two or three teaspoons stirred into a cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1QO">Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea</a>. I have a cup sitting beside me as I'm writing this.<br /><br />For cooking, a couple of tablespoons are a tasty substitute for wine when roasting chicken or beef.<br /><br />Yum!<br /><br />And I haven't even mentioned the health benefits this stuff is supposed to have!

I don't know when the change happened as I'd buy bulk when it was on sale.  In the past 2 months, I've realized it no longer needs to be diluted. What a waste of money! Instead of one bottle lasting 2 weeks or more when I'd dilute it with Seltzer water, now I'm drinking it "full strength"  and a bottle only lasts a few days. I wonder if this is why my local store stopped carrying it.  I'll be looking for another brand now and cancelling my "Subscribe and Save" with Amazon.

review/text: This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

My entire family is addicted to this peppermint iced tea and THAT is a good thing since the only thing in this product is peppermint leaves. TRY IT, it is totally amazing as hot tea and iced tea!

review/summary: Great for Stomach Aches
review/text: After having a few adominal surgeries I get stomach aches quite often, especially at night.  If I'm awaken with a stomach ache I will brew some peppermint tea which always helps.  Unfortunately, it's not great for my bladder so a couple of hours later I'm back up but I can then usually get back to sleep again.

review/summary: Wonderful tea!
review/text: This tea is one of my all time favorites. It has such a clean, refreshing taste and intoxicating scent. From the moment I open the waxed paper liner, and all throughout it's brewing cycle (I make mine in a coffee maker) it just smells so delicious.<br /><br />I like to put this peppermint tea over ice and add a touch of Stevia Spoonable Powder NO Calories NO Carbohydrates Extracted from the leaves of the Stevia plant with high concentrations of Steviosides and Rebaudiosides - 16 Oz #ST52 for sweetness.<br /><br />My husband prefers this tea served hot in the winter, I love it year round.

review/summary: A Classic
review/text: this is a classic...who wouldn't love this tea?  the peppermint taste is intense and sharp without being overwhelming.  i enjoy bigalow's 'mint medly' flavor, but find this to taste so much more...authentic and closer to nature.  and i love that they do not individually package each tea bag--always seems like a waste of the earth's resources--but the tea always stays fresh.

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Watch the Packaging - 4 to an envelope
review/text: What I was expecting were individually wrapped tea bags.  They come 4 to an envelope, so once you open it the others are exposed to the air.  They definitely can not be used in a public setting where no one knows who originally opened it or how long it has been open.  I suppose they would be good for batch brewing at home.

review/summary: The Best Tape (Fermented rice)
review/text: If you like tape, fermented rice,  then this is the yeast you want to use. This delicate treat is hard to make -and not all yeasts are alike. Other things you have to know is that the rice must be clean - and completely cooled before you sprinkle the yeast (crushed into a fine powder) on it. Sprinkle on thin layers, building up the layers in a bowl. Small batches are best. The bowl must be covered so that no light comes in. Put on top of the fridge, or other place that emanates some wamth. It should be fermented in about 3-4 days. Remember, all utensils must be clean also. Good luck. I like it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The flavor is though! just buy a normal sized package instead.

review/text: I like the flavor of coffee, but Emeril's doesn't have that traditional coffee flavor. It's pretty bitter--so much so, that 2 Splenda packets in a 16 oz cup don't mask the bitterness. Three stars because it's tolerable, but I'm holding out for tastier coffee.
