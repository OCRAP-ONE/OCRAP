review/summary: No hulls, but really small
review/text: We recently got this, which seemed great because prior to this we purchased what we had thought to be "paragon popcorn" sold by amazon and we got this popcorn called "snappy" which really sucked because there were so many hulls, that we decided to buy this after reading the reviews.<br />upside: hardly any hulls<br />downside: the popcorn is very small, and not as tender as I would have thought it to be since the kernels are so small.<br />Overall, this popcorn is better than the one purchased before but I would probably look for something else.

review/summary: Mmmmm . . . . tiny pops, big flavor
review/text: At first I was a little disappointed in the overall size of the popped corn--small compared to the typical yellow variety I'm used to--but the flavor was excellent.  Almost every kernel popped(save for one or two per 1 qt. (popped) serving)!  I love this variety of popcorn and am SO glad to find it at a good price and availability.

review/summary: We hate to leave this kind of review......
review/text: We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past.  Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival.  Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn.  Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it.  Moths came flying out of the bag.  Yes, moths!!  Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag.  Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.  We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund.  We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility.  It's just not good business.  They have our money after all.

review/text: The popcorn arrived ahead of schedule and the packaging was meticulous.  I have never seen better packaging for a bulk item.<br /><br />The popcorn is good, but not great.  I use a hot air popper and have tried Crimson Jewel and other non-Amazon brands of red popcorn previously.  There were very few un-popped kernels, but the popcorn was not as tender as Crimson Jewel.<br /><br />I would buy this product again, but prefer Crimson Jewel.

review/text: Ok- I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should buy 12 lbs of popcorn. We just like to eat it a few times a week. I have to say, I'm usually a butter lover when it comes to popcorn. But, not with this. No butter is needed with these tasty kernels! The kernels are very white when they pop and small so they have a great mouth feel. All of them popped and the crunch was tender, yet crisp. All I did was toss on a little popcorn salt and I'm not sure it even needed that. I've never had popcorn so good! This is worth a try!

review/summary: Delicious gourmet popcorn!
review/text: This is by far my favorite popcorn of all time. Petite, fluffy kernels are delicious and light as air. I pop this several times a week in my Back to Basics popper. One thing to keep in mind: the kernels pop up quite a bit smaller than ordinary corn, so you should measure out more, to fill up the popper. For instance, normally I measure out nearly a half-cup of ordinary corn, but for the Vintage Red I usually use almost 3/4 cup. Happy popping!

review/summary: Vintage Red a Hit with our family
review/text: I appreciated that this popcorn wasn't full of big hulls like regular popcorn is, and that it is more dense and crunchy than "movie style" popcorn. After eating the Vintage Red, regular popcorn seems kind of like styrofoam. The only thing I noticed that you need to watch for is that with some of the gourmet popcorns, shipping is more expensive than the popcorn itself.

review/summary: Ok, but will look for something better
review/text: This popping corn is a mix of pros and cons for us.  It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.  We'll be trying something else next time.

review/summary: Seems average in taste, possibly not compatible with all hot air poppers
review/text: I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper. I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter, if your hot air popper has a lot of power, be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop. The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly, I  do not find the popcorn fluffier or less "husky". In fact, I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper. It is nice to know the corn is organic, but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply! ;)

review/text: I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning "butter."  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush.

review/text: I started ordering popcorn from Amazon because out local grocery stores only sell one brand of regular popcorn. Most of the popcorn they sell is microwave. Since there is only one to buy, there is no comparison price shopping and the stores seem to be taking advantage of this. This was very tasty popcorn. I tried many of the different Amish Country Brand popcorns. This was by far the best. The price is very reasonable even taking shipping into consideration.

review/text: Starbucks use to have an Ethiopian blend of coffee I liked, but recently they haven't carried it any more. So I found this brand and thought I'd give it a try. I like drinking coffee I know came from Ethiopia, because I've heard that's  where the coffee bean originally came from. So I bought a bag and loved it. I since have subscribed for a five pound bag every three months. It saves me money and "bottom line", great coffee at an affordable price!

review/summary: SOUR PUNCH ROPE-CHERRY
review/text: Good product with a decent amount of sour crystals on the ropes, but 1 star away because it could've tasted much cherrier like Twizzlers� do! Still wasn't a bad purchase at $7.50 for a carton of 30 Sour Ropes(approx. $0.30 per rope) through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com with free shipping overall. I'm still enjoying my carton, but now the overall decision on purchase is up to you?! I do someday would like to try the other 3 variety of Sour Ropes at the right price in; Strawberry, Apple, and Blue Raspberry!

review/text: This product is great to keep on hand for a light lunch that's quick and easy.  My husband and I both enjoy a mug of hot soup a couple of times a week, and this serves us nicely (we both tend to have lighter appetites).  It has a good consistency, is packed with tasty ingredients, and there is plenty of chicken.  One selling point is the terapack.  After learning about BHPA-containing can liners used by many soup manufacturers I decided we needed to avoid the ubiquitous stuff whenever possible.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

When I found out I could buy these in bulk from Amazon and SAVE money - I was happy. I will be sure to try the other varieties as well!

review/text: We enjoy this cookie at our house.  I love that they have this wheat free alternative to animal crackers.  I buy this big bag instead of the little bags and place the appropriate amount into baggies as a snack for my little one.

My husband loves them so much that he doesn't even mind taking a "kid snack" to work.:-)<br />I've also found that if we get a box that's been damaged and broken up - the crumbs make an awesome pie crust!

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: I purchased these because of the outstanding reviews. I needed some cute, yummy animal cookies for my nieces baby shower. I was making a banana pudding in my trifle dish and wanted little animal cookies to march around the edge and show through the bowl. Well, I am happy to say it worked and these were yummy! I had quite a few bags left and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them! He is now asking for more. LOL So I am going to try some of the other flavors.

review/text: I just bought these for my daughter today at our local health food store and I was very skeptical, but now I'm addicted to these. I hate to say that I ate my daughter's cookies but I did and will "sadly" have to go buy her some more tomorrow. I LOVE sweets but these are perfect, not too sweet but just perfect and you don't have to feel horrible about eating them all! LOVE THEM!

review/summary: Glorious
review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

review/text: We've tried the vanilla and now regularly order the oatmeal version for our kids' snack. Both are very good.  The oatmeal variety has more "texture" but our 5 year old still loves them. I also eat them occasionally and also prefer oatmeal; they are sweet but not too sweet and make a great snack!

review/text: My kids really enjoyed these animal crackers. I purchased them as an easy snack, to throw in the zoo bag or park backpack for busy summer days. I appreciate that they don't use refined sugar and they have whole wheat. My kids love the shapes and the taste. They taste quite good and held up well. This is my first time to try the Barbara's Bakery brand. Can't wait to try other varieties.

review/text: My 3 year-old daughter and I need to avoid wheat-- but are not strictly gluten-free.  We also avoid all artificial sweeteners, corn syrup, etc.  These animal cookies are great.  She is able to bring them to school and eat them when the other kids have "regular" animal crackers and she is excited to be eating the same thing.

review/summary: More chocolate than you expect
review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.
