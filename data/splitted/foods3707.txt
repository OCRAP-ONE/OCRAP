review/summary: Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!
review/text: This is the best waffle mix that I have ever tried.  I usually mix in sliced almonds and a few drops of real vanilla extract.  Once ready and cool top with sliced strawberries or Chiquita bananas and smother with real maple syrup --not the cheap imitation syrup--and I could eat waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. By the way, these waffles go great with a side of Cuban toast (french bread butterfly cut covered in butter then pressed down flat in a hot sandwich press.  So yummy your tummy will smile :)

review/text: I first tasted this Waffle mix about 15 years ago.  It was a Christmas present, and came from Williams-Sonoma.  It was amazing, but at $13 a can, I never bought it again.<br /><br />I then googled the WS product, and found out that I could get 3 cans for the same price from Amazon.  Wow!!  What a deal for the best waffle mix on the planet.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: My friend gave me a Belgian Waffle maker for Christmas. He also included a 3 pack of this Carbon's Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour. On Christmas morning we immediately started using this. I also did change the 5 oz. water for 5 oz. milk. It is much richer with milk. I was going a bit nuts looking for this in stores. Finally I had to ask my friend where he got this. He said he got it off of Amazon. We ran out of the 3 cans in a little over a month. The original recipe amount made too few waffle, but it was my first time that I had used this mix. It was amazing. After that initial time, I've had to double the recipe to accomodate our family of 5. Everyone really likes it.

review/text: I love this waffle mix.  It is easy and fast to make my son a quick waffle before school.  I use the kitchen aid double sided waffler.  The recipe on the container using 1 cup of mix only makes 1 and 3/4 waffles with my maker.  If I am making waffles for all of us (3 people), I have to double the recipe.<br /><br />I have found no difference in substituting oil for the butter in the waffle recipe.  2TBS butter=1 ounce oil.  Easier!  Enjoy.  This mix is also sold at World Market for $7.99 per container.

review/summary: Great Product for Fluffy Waffles
review/text: I have been trying to duplicate the light and airy belgium waffles I have had on occasion in restaurants. It was difficult. I found several recipes on-line that looked like they would be very tasty but not only were they tasteless but they took more than an hour of prep time! Being pretty frustrated, I decided to look for some product that would be easy to make and hopefully taste great. I found it with this product. Very simple to use - just add eggs (and you don't have to separate the yoke from the whites!), butter, water and of course the flour mix. The result - very light and airy waffles with a great taste. Now I would be remiss to say, that it is also likely that the waffle maker will also make a big difference. I purchased several and returned several until I found the right one. Although a little pricey I would highly recommend the KitchenAid Pro Line Series Waffle Baker. When paired with this waffle flour mix, the results are unbeatable!

review/text: There really is a difference and this stuff is awesome.  A couple tips...follow directions for mixing exactly as they instruct.  What I found out works best is to take the egg out of the fridge an hour or so ahead of time to come up to room temperature before mixing with water.  Also if possible, let mixture stand about 30 minutes or so before using for waffles.  Extremely light crisp and delightful waffles.

review/summary: Fabulous (when using right waffle maker and consistency of batter)
review/text: I love the waffles from this mix; they have an absolute wonderful flavor and texture in my opinion.<br /><br />However, the results are VERY different depending on which waffle maker I use.  I have made these with an old, traditional square grid waffle iron, a light-weight circular "Belgium" waffle maker, and a light-weight flip "Belgium" waffle maker, and the results were completely ordinary.  It's only after I purchased a heavier-duty flip Belgium style maker did the waffles come out gloriously light, fluffy, with a slight crispy outside:  just perfect for me.<br /><br />The results are also dependent on exactly how thick the batter comes out which depends on the size of the eggs used and on how precisely the water is measured out.  I prefer the waffles when the batter is on the "runny" side.  When you fill the waffle maker, a runny batter spreads quite quickly and you actually don't use as much batter per waffle.  You can still see the black parts of the "insides" of the grids of the waffle maker poking through the batter when you go to close the maker.  The waffles then really expand as they cook and you get a very light, fluffy waffle with a crispy outside.  Yum!

review/summary: Good, but better with buttermilk
review/text: Similar to some other reviews, we found this mix to be very good, but not "5 star" outstanding.  But for the convenience of a mix, I do think it's one of the better mixes.  We've tried regular, blueberry and chocolate.  The chocolate waffle mix does a very nice job of keeping the chocolate in the middle, and their is definitely enough chocolate.  This morning we tried the regular again, and instead of water, used Butter Milk.  I had intended to add a little vanilla and cinnamon as well, but forget.  We all agreed that today's waffles were the best yet with this mix, so I think we'll keep on with the butter milk.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: Carbon's Golden Malted has become a fixture in our house to the extent that we placed an Amazon subscription order just to knock down the order price by a few bucks. The three (3) containers seem to last us a total of about four months, making waffles for two-to-three people once or twice a week.<br /><br />The smell, taste and texture of these waffles will remind you of your favorite restaurant waffles because many waffle and pancake houses actually use this product.  The malt smell as you're cooking these waffles is a dead giveaway that these are the real deal. You add a fresh egg, five ounces of water and two tablespoons of melted butter to one cup of Carbon's mix to yield between three or four waffles depending on the capacity of your waffle iron.

review/summary: I don't see what the big deal is...
review/text: I purchased this pancake mix a about 6 months ago or so and for some reason got yet another shipment of it 2 months after that although I was pretty SURE that I cancelled my subscription. Anyway I thought that this mix would be sooo amazing like so many reviewers led me to believe. That the product would be worth the price that I was paying. Boy was I wrong. To anyone who is on the edge of buying this recipe, my opinion is that you should NOT. It is a total waste of money. Not only do you have to add the milk (or water), BUT you have to add the eggs, AND the melted butter as well to this mix. So pretty much the only difference between this mix and regular all-purpose flour is your leveler(baking soda or powder) and a tiny bit of sugar, (maybe about a TB per 2 servings. How cheap are those ingredients to buy? All you have to do is measure them out into some AP flour and you have the same thing as this "mix" except with a better more home-made taste Takes about 20 seconds more people. They say that it has 'malt" in it, whatever that is, but I don't taste it. The worst part is that this stuff expires REAL QUICK for the quantity. Really In 6 months My 3 person family was only able to use 2 of 33oz cans (making waffles or pancakes about once per week) and I just tried using it again yesterday and it turned out all crumbly/inedible. I look under the box and it's EXPIRED ALREADY. So unless you have a large family, you might as well throw your money in the trash because now we have 4 unopened cans of the stuff now in the trash outside. My advice, just find a good pancake recipe online and buy yourself a 10 pound bag of flour for about 5 bucks at the store instead of  wasting your money on this highly over-rated stuff. I gave it 3 stars ONLY because my expectations may have been a bit too high due to reviews on here and because MORE OR LESS I got what was promised by the company. But this product merits AT LEAST a deduction of 2 stars (I was on the verge if deducting 3) for the value for what you're getting, ease of use (which is none compared to way cheaper regular plain flour), and amount of time until parish/expiration.

review/summary: Tastes great, but short of outstanding
review/text: I got this as a gold box deal for a great price. The product tastes great and we've been enjoying it for breakfast. However, it is still comparable to many other competitive products. In other words, nothing to really write home about. I personally do not give 5 stars unless something is absolutely outstanding and beats all my expectations (isn't that what maxing out the star rating should be?). So this gets my 4-star vote, 4.25 if that was available :)<br /><br />BTW, one thing that was surprising was that the cans I received (order Mar 2011) Expire Jan 2012. So either that's a testament of its lack of preservatives and quality or Amazon was getting rid of its expiring products as a gold box deal.

review/summary: very good sweetener
review/text: Equal is a very good sweetener for beverages like coffee or iced tea. It has no fat, no calories, less than 1 gram of sugar (which is, of course, next to nothing), and it has almost no carbohydrates, either.<br /><br />I usually prefer Sweet And Low for my sweetener; but when I can't get my hands on that Equal is a fairly good substitute. Equal is my second choice because it's not quite as sweet as Sweet And Low. On the other hand, if you prefer a non-sugar sweetener that's not too sweet or potent, then Equal would be a good choice for you.<br /><br />Equal is a powdery white substance. Just open the individual packet or packets and pour it in to your beverage. It is probably quite good for certain recipes as well. Keep the individual packets in the box they come in or you can put them into any container you wish.<br /><br />Just one warning: This product contains phenylalanine. If you are allergic to that or if phenylalanine makes you ill in any way I would definitely avoid this product.<br /><br />Overall, Equal is a good choice for a sweetener substitute for sugar. It isn't quite as potent as Sweet And Low; that can be a good or bad thing depending on how sweet you like your beverages or recipes. I myself prefer the taste of Sweet And Low. Of course, you can always add a little more Equal to make the drink a bit sweeter.<br /><br />Four stars.

review/summary: Great steaks -- Horrible delivery
review/text: I ordered 12 steaks but only six arrived.  I contacted Omaha and they said they would send six more.  When the six more arrived they were completely thawed and now I am afraid to eat them  -- maybe I will fry them up and give them to my dog -- he has a strong stomach.  The six that arrived on time and still frozen were delicious. If this were baseball I would be thrilled, but I am not happy batting .500 in the steak department.<br /><br />Update:  Omaha sent me 12 more steaks.  They arrived still frozen and the two I have eaten were delicious.<br /><br />So all told, I originally ordered 12 -- only six arrived -- six more were sent but were thawed -- but then they sent 12 and they were great.  So in the end I ordered 12, but got 18 great steaks.  Omaha made it more than right.  Omaha may not be good at counting but they get an A for effort.

They salt the result, and you have "movie theater" popcorn. Kernel Season's Popping & Topping Oil is supposed to be that pre-mixed oil-butter concoction, but it's not.  I don't know what this is.  Vegetable oil with urine in it?  Who's to say.  But whatever it is, it tastes terrible.

review/summary: This is the best
review/text: I've been weight training for about 6 years and in that time have used just about every major brand of protein supplement and meal supplement - EAS (Myoplex, Whey), NitroTech, Optimum Whey, MET-Rx, Designer, GNC, etc. Labrada's V60 continues to be my favorite.<br /><br />As far as flavor, the vanilla tastes as good or better than the other protein powders I've had. The chocolate is mediocre, not quite as good as Myoplex. The banana flavor...well, you might want to pass on that one. My personal recommendation would be to get the vanilla and add a small amount of chocolate or strawberry syrup, bananas or peanut butter if the flavor becomes boring.<br /><br />It mixes easily so it can be put in a shaker cup or tossed on a bowl of cereal for breakfast.<br /><br />It's not a meal replacement, and doesn't contain additional vitamins and minerals like Myoplex or ProPlete, so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete meal replacement - at very least take a multivite with it. The plus side is that this keeps the carbs and calories relatively low for consuming 60g protein (most other brands deliver around 40g protein for the same calories/carbs).<br /><br />Now whether the body can actually use 60g of protein in one dose is still up for debate. Since this is a relatively high dose of protein (assuming you're consuming 4-6 30g scoops per day), I would strongly recommend consuming a half gallon of water each day to minimize the strain this puts on the kidneys.

review/summary: Smooth Mix
review/text: Regardless of what you have read, this product mixes smoothly in a blender or with a spoon.  I use this everyday and the only thing I can tell you is, you may need to have a spoon handy, if you use a blender, to scrape the excess powder off the sides of the blender back into the mix.  10-15 seconds you have a smooth fairly decent tasting shake.  I add fruit, and would suggest you do too.  16 oz of milk= about 30 oz of shake.  I drink one for breakfast and am not hungry all day.  Its ideal for meal replacement, or for somebody looking to build muscle.  60g protein and 310 calories.  I recommend this product for those looking to lose weight, or build muscle without consuming thousands of calories per shake.

review/summary: Labrada rocks as always!
review/text: My wife and I have both been using Labrada's products for the past year. We originally started with the Lean Body shakes but soon found the ProV 60 was cheaper when purchased in bulk like this. The vanilla is very versatile and we get rather creative with our shake flavors by adding fruit, chocolate or PB2. Between the two of us we have lost 120lbs and built some serious muscle. I have tried other brands but I always come back to Labrada because I get exactly what I expect and nothing that I don't want. We recommend this protein to all of our friends at the gym and my wife's personal training clients.

review/text: I've been bodybuilding for a few years (5'6"/205LBs)I like this product, been using it for a while, I've only had strawberry ice cream and vanilla ice cream flavors, both very good.<br />60 grams of protein per 2 scoops. I use 1 scoop in a protein drink right after my workout(30grams) and another one before bed just the protein and water. The one after working out is a little more elaborate. It has a blend of 5 proteins one being casein pronounced(kay-seen)which is slowly absorbed which is great at bedtime to keep you from becoming catabolic during the night. Good price and delivered right to your door, Cant beat it!!  If your interested my post workout shake consists of...A few ice cubes and spring water,1/3 cup of raw oatmeal,banana,2 heaping tablespoons of 0 fat plain Greek yogurt (Greek is thicker and creamier)1 scoop of Labrada V60. If you want you can add a little olive oil for some EFA's. Good Luck!!

Not even close.  I'll consume as much as I want during the day when I want.  I feel completely full for a few hours with one drink. I mix it in a 20 ounce bottle with two scoops.  Your body will appreciate the health benefits of this drink, unlike fried or fast food that will take down your energy level and leave you feeling groggy.  You will lose weight also from taking this product.  I lost 20 pounds and am now at a level of maintaining my current weight, and I owe a lot to Naturade Soy.  I've also tried the Vanilla flavor.  I was not impressed. Buy the Bavarian Chocolate and try it out.  You'll be glad you did.

I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't  keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!!

review/summary: As good as they say...
review/text: This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try...

review/summary: Tried others, this one is best value
review/text: I have purchased another soy based chocolate power product (ASIN: B000HCX5RQ), and that other one wasn't as good as this Naturade Total Soy.  We have this just about every morning in smoothies (1 1/2 scoops, 8-12 frozen strawberries, 1 TBS chocolate cocoa mix, 3 cups milk, 2 bananas).  Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.<br /><br />Also with respect to the other brand mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.  This Naturade version has a very slight after-taste - probably due to the soy - but it's better than using pure cocoa!<br /><br />Update: All Star Health is very very fast.  I reordered it on 9/10 and received the very next day.  It wasn't expected to arrive until 9/16.  I will order from them again.  It's too bad this item from them is not on the subscription program.

Imagine my dissapointment(since I have tried approx 19 others before now)cup after cup, with bland, boring, tastless and often downright nasty coffee.<br /><br />You know, if you have a Keurig that the larger quantity you buy, the less you pay. So you either buy a large quantity of something nasty or you pay even more for something that will take FOREVER to get through. We have the carousel and this last time I bought 4 different types of K cups. One of them was "Black Tiger" by Coffee People. Now I have to tell my husband that he has to drink three others to each Black Tiger to get rid of the others. I will put only three black tigers on each side and until we drink the others we can't have our 'favorite'. If you like strong coffee then this is "The One".<br /><br />TAKE IT FROM ME,  THIS COFFEE IS THE BEST I HAVE HAD SO FAR. TRUE COFFEE TASTE. I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY JET FUEL, ANYONE WANT TO TRADE SOME FLAVORS?? LOL

review/summary: So good
review/text: I'm a huge fan of these marinated tuna packets by Starkist.  They're so flavourful, and you don't have to worry about getting any bad bits like you do in the cans, and you don't get the added calories of mayo.  I've been using it as filling for homemade sushi, and to make tuna melts.  Very rich, high-quality flavour.  Definitely recommended.

review/summary: weird package, kinda dry, not very spicy
review/text: I bought some of these after looking for the bumblebee tuna thai taste sensations tuna.  I love that stuff, wanted to order it online, but it wasn't available with free shipping - so I went with the starkist instead.  Not as good.  Issues:<br />1 - package isn't very useful.  The packet has a potential for a mess when opened properly, and then what?  You can't set it down without spilling tuna juice on your desk (nice).  You need a bowl to put it in.  Kinda wasteful.  The bumblebee setup let's you eat right out of the can conveniently.<br />2 - it's kinda dry.  Not near as moist as the bbee.<br />3 - the flavor isn't as good.  The bbee stuff has an actual chilipepper in it, for example.  Nothing quite so exciting going on here.<br /><br />It is pretty tasty nonetheless and I believe I'll be able to enjoy all 24 packets i bought... but them I'm switching back.

review/summary: Great package, quickly delivered, with excellent service.
review/text: This is a great package and an easy way to get three surprisingly different orange bitters. If you're really getting into cocktails as I am, you'll quickly realize that a large number of cocktail recipes from the 1950's and earlier require orange bitters. Just substituting Angostura is okay in a pinch, but you'll really be missing out on the subtle flavors that true orange bitters add to the drink. Depending on where you live, some of these may be hard to find. I can't find the Fee Brothers or Regan's at any of my local stores, and these two are both well worth trying. Satan's Whiskers, for example, is a heck of a cocktail, but try it with Regan's. Wow.<br /><br />Also, a plug for the folks selling the product at Kegworks: I made a mistake when I placed my order on Amazon and the guys at Kegworks were able to fix it and redirect the shipment to get it delivered in time. Excellent personal service.

review/summary: Where's the Lobster or flavor?!
review/text: In my quest for a lobster bisque that carries a genunine taste of lobster, this one (so far) would sit at the very bottom of the list. The label says that it includes minced lobster. As there did not appear to be any discernible chunks in the gelatinous contents (minced or otherwise); it would seem that the minced lobster meat must have also been pureed. There was nothing in the flavor of the bisque that suggested lobster was any part the ingredients. In addition, this is not an item that I would consider using as a base for some other recipe. If you are looking for the taste of lobster, this isn't it.

review/summary: Pink Lobster Bisque
review/text: This is a condensed soup and comes out of the can as an alarmingly orange gelatinous blob!  Cooked with half and half and a touch of sherry it becomes a tasty pink-colored lobster bisque.  The lobster meat is definitely pureed into the soup (you can taste the occasional fleck of lobster in this).  If you like your bisque chunkier you might want to consider adding some diced lobster meat, crawfish tail meat or chopped shrimp to the soup for a heartier experience.  A dash of brandy would also be a good addition.  I haven't tried the Chincoteague brand bisque.  From the picture on the can it looks like a white, rather than pink, bisque.  From its reviews the Chincoteague sounds like it has more lobster meat in it than this brand does and is more assertively seasoned.  The Chincoteague could be made pink by the addition of a little tomato paste or sweet paprika.  I'll be curious to try it and compare the two brands.

review/text: I have recently switched to a wheatless food plan and was searching for something to eat for breakfast and when I need a quick meal and no time to cook. I found this at my local grocery store in the cereal section and was delighted to see it was absent of everything I'm trying to avoid. My surprise came when I tasted it and found it's delicious. I love the crunchiness, the taste, and the blend of foods. The calorie count is high for one bowl but so is the nutritional value so it's an easy compromise for me. I highly recommend this not just for those with dietary restrictions but for anyone who simply wants a tasty breakfast. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HTJH58">Bakery On Main Nutty Cranberry Maple, Gluten Free Granola, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

Bakery on Main has come up with a great combination of flavors and textures that ensure you don't care you're no longer eating regular cereal/granola.<br /><br />This granola is also wonderful as a topping on Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Oatmeal.  It gives the oatmeal more texture and flavor.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cost.  I was happy at first to get it on Amazon, because at my health food store it was $7, and I could get it on Amazon for about $5/bag.  However, now that I've purchased 2-3 cases, they've raised the price higher than my health food store, while the other flavors from the same brand are still at the lower price.
