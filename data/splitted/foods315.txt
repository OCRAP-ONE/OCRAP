review/text: If you, like me, are crazy for the sweet and salty chex mixes, but can't stop yourself from eating a whole 3.5-serving bag of them, then look no more!  These 100 cal pouches hit the spot and help me control myself!  More caramel than chocolate, but a wonderful little sweet treat!

review/summary: Too Sweet/Sticky
review/text: These are a little over the top. With Chex Mix you kind of want the sweet and salty balancing. These have so much coating that they are very hard and sort of sticky when you chew them. I felt like I had residue all over my teeth. Wound up giving them to a less discriminating sweet tooth in my life.

review/summary: Don't waste your money!
review/text: I love my kitty, and spoil her in every way possible. I feed her can food, and hard food, and I mix up brands to give her a good "spread". When I saw this at my local store, I thought "She is going to love this!"<br /><br />For starters, it comes out of the pack in a strange gelatinous form. (It looks like something from another planet, honestly.) You can see the fish, so I was optimistic. She ate some of the gooey gelatin stuff, sniffed the fish, and started meowing (meaning, please don't let me eat this.) I left it out thinking she would maybe nibble on it more when I wasn't looking, and needless to say, a few hours later, it was still there, only it had dried up significantly. (The gel stuff was gone, it looked like something out of a horror movie, and this happened during the 6 hours I was at work.)<br /><br />**If you have OUTDOOR kitties, don't even go here. This food attracts flies like nothing I've ever seen, and if your kitties don't eat it, you will find yourself with a colony of maggots in a day or two, no kidding. HOT MESS.<br /><br />That being said, our dog ate some of it, but then again, he also eats his own poop when I'm not looking.

review/summary: Absolutley refreshing!
review/text: While I hate using exclamation points to get my message across, I have to with Big Train Raspberry Chai!<br /><br />I first had this product back in Christmas of 2000. My mother received Big Train Chai drink mixes as a "Secret Santa" gift from her work. My mother is a hardcore coffee drinker and wanted nothing to do with this "chai" drink. So I took it upon myself to try all the flavors - Spiced, Vanilla, and Raspberry. Raspberry sounded dreadful so it was the last packet I drank... and the raspberry flavor turned out to be my favorite!<br /><br />There is something so soothing yet refreshing about this drink. It's absolutely addictive. The raspberry flavoring isn't a tart flavor as you might think. It adds the right amount of sweet flavor to the drink.<br /><br />Just make sure you measure out the water properly... It's really easy to water down the product, and ruin the taste (although, you could resolve the issue by adding more powder).<br /><br />Remember to serve hot and enjoy often!

review/summary: Variety the Spice of Life for Dogs' Treats
review/text: We have 2 dogs and, to be honest, we spoil them. One is a Cairn terrier/pug mix and the other an Australian Shepherd/Labrador. They love their treats and would live on them day in and day out if we would let them.<br />Since the 2 dogs vary so greatly in size (15 lbs. vs. 55 lbs.) we buy different types and sizes of treats all the time. The two have their individual preferences and there would be times that one would turn up her nose on a treat that would appeal to the other. We would have at least 6 different bags open at any one time.<br />Very messy.<br />The Western Grill package gives us 5 different types of treats in one bag and they are all liked by the dogs.<br />We now have a neater drawer and no rejected treats that get stuck in the drawer till a visitor's dog comes over to visit.<br />And, by buying a number of them at one time, we save big on the dog food bills aside from not wasting time stocking up. Really appreciate that.

review/summary: Didn't expect much at first, but now I am amazed! BUYING NUMBER 2
review/text: I bought this tree last year to honor my daughters birth. When I recieved it in the mail, It was in good green condition and looked very healthy BUT it was tiny, it had one half inch leaf growing from the tiny stem. I thought "this thing will take forever to grow!" But I stuck it on an end table by a window and watered it about once every week and half to two weeks, I am absolutely amazed at how huge this tree has gotten! It's healthier than I ever though, It has probably 75 leaves on it and it approx. 2 feet tall. Which is great for what I had gotten. So, yes my inital impression of the company and tree was not too great but now here I am ordering my second tree for my brother for his 1st daughter as well. These trees have an amzing growing quality. I am not a huge green thumb person or anything, I simply watered it and stuck it by a window..I would 100% reccommend this company.

review/summary: My plant is thriving--this is a great deal!
review/text: Having read the bad reviews, I was hesitant about ordering this plant, but it arrived promptly and was very well packed so as to be protected during shipping.<br /><br />I repotted it immediately because it came in a very small pot, and since both shipping and repotting are shocks to plants, I wasn't sure if it was going to survive. One set of leaves did fall off, and that made me even more concerned, but as things turned out I needn't have worried.<br /><br />These plants enjoy bright indirect sunlight and a lot of humidity, but don't want to be overwatered, so I set it in front of the window but behind another plant to filter the sunlight, and put it in a pan with water and pebbles so that the bottom of the pot doesn't touch the water but the water can evaporate around the plant to provide humidity. It has been less that two weeks now and the plant is growing six new shoots, each one of which has five tiny leaves. That's 30 new leaves, so I know the plant is now adjusted and doing well.<br /><br />If you do an online search for "Breathe Easier: 12 Houseplants to Purify Indoor Air" you'll find a list of some of the best indoor plants to have, which toxins each plant is best at removing from the air (according to NASA studies), and a brief description of how to care for them. More detailed instructions can also be found by searching online for each plant's name.<br /><br />The Money Tree Plant and the Areca Palm are the two plants on the list that require a little more care, but there is also a plant called the Mother-in-Law's Tongue that is extremely hardy and needs very little care at all. If you don't have the ability to care for plants, you should choose those that are easier to care for.<br /><br />The Money Tree Plant is one of the top three on the list of the best indoor air-cleansing plants, and I'm very happy with this one. It looked exactly like the picture when it arrived and looks even better now. When I want new plants I won't hesitate to order from this seller again.

review/summary: Pretty much what i expected.
review/text: Product looked great, read many great reviews so i went for it. I got the money tree about 4 days after odering which was just awesome. It was almost just like the picture, and it was as tall as i thought too. I will say though whatever their watering their plants with is really really hard water, every single leaf has hard water stains on it like crazy. So if your buying this go ahead and grab some hard water stain remover for plants and your local Home Improvement store cause you'll need it. My overall rating though other than the un-necessary spending of money for stain remover.... excellent plant.

review/summary: Terrific little plant!
review/text: I have had one of these plants for years. The only plant I've managed not to kill. So I ordered a small one for a friend who also has a black thumb. This little guy was shipped during a horrible heat wave and arrived in beautiful condition. It was really well packed and shipped very fast. The price is just terrific for such a great little plant. Highly recommend seller.

review/summary: Better Than I Expected
review/text: I ordered this awesome little tree from 9GreenBox on the 25th of Sept. and received it today, just 3 days later, and it was in great shape. It's got a ton of leaves all over it, and is pretty tall, too. Very healthy looking.<br /><br />At first, I was a little doubtful of buying a live plant online, but after reading a bunch of reviews about this seller, I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did! I've always wanted a money tree ever since I bought one for my mom years ago for her birthday, I just have never been able to find one in any stores near me, so I was excited when I read about this.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend buying from this seller (again, I ordered from 9Greenbox, I don't know about any of the other sellers that offer this), the tree was packaged securely with packing peanuts, wrapped in plastic, with a paper towel taped over the pot to protect the dirt, I assume, and arrived in a timely manner. Hopefully I don't kill mine now, but from what I remember of the one I got for my mom, they're relatively easy to care for, and apparently do pretty well being shipped across the country, too. :)

review/text: I was looking at the home depot for money trees.  I checked back three separate times.  They did not have them.  So I looked on line.  I was suspect of the trees arriving and being alive.  But they came promptly, wrapped securely, with detailed instructions and to how to take care of the trees.  I planted them and it's been about a month now, and they're doing fine.  I hope they bring me money.  The price was less than the home depot, and I think I got a very good deal all in all.  I'm very pleased.

review/summary: Very Healthy Plants
review/text: I ordered two of these money tree plants for 5.57 each plus Shipping. They arrived in very good condition . Each having a very good number of leaves and very healthy  . The pot is encased in a plastic bag and rubber banded to the base of the plant . As it is shipped when they are dry  I watered mine as soon as I could.  I am going to transfer to a larger ,wider pot . The small 4 inch wide and 3 inch deep pot makes it unstable due to being top heavy.<br />  For the price this is a very good bargain , if I were to purchase another It would be from this supplier -9GreenBox-

review/text: Ordered the week before Mother's Day for my mom but the first tree never arrived. I gave it a day or so past the estimated shipping date before I contacted the seller and had them reship. That second one never arrived either. I contacted the seller again asking for a refund but they refused and rush-shipped another tree. This one finally did arrive, but by then, it was already June 1st, almost 3 weeks late. So much for a Mother's Day gift. Fortunately, my mom understood and was just happy to receive it. Haven't seen it in person yet, but my mom sent a photo and it looks green and healthy. It has a lot of leaves but looks very small. Hopefully it will keep growing.

review/summary: Dissappointment
review/text: The plant in the picture looks so much greener and healthier than what I received in the mail today.  The pot is a very inexpensive 'growers' pot, and does not add at all to the over-all look and appeal of this half-dead plant.  My plant contains two braided brown trunks with no foliage, and three yellowish stalks with yellowed leafs.  The 'braid' is held together at the top with a green bread twist-tie.  Over all, I wish I had spent a little more money and ordered a better plant from a different supplier, and I should have made sure the pot was nice enough to keep the plant in for some time while adding to the decor of my home.  With the ill-health of this plant, I am afraid to upgrade the planter/pot as I might further stress this suffering little thing.  Maybe this one should have been called the "waste of money tree'.  If you really want one of these, look elsewhere - this one is just not worth it.

review/summary: As is it's pretty good, with some help it's amazing, but best available for Keurig
review/text: I'm a confirmed hot chocolate snob and yes, I admit I only really wanted a Keurig to make a really quick, banging cup of hot chocolate (and maybe not be on a first name basis with every employee at Dunkin Donuts).  In fact, I don't even drink coffee, so the quest for the perfect hot chocolate for the Keurig is not one I take lightly.<br /><br />Of the brands of hot chocolate I've tried that are made specifically for the Keurig, this one is the best.<br /><br />I tried a couple of brews before I reviewed this...  So here's the conclusion that I've come to:<br /><br />I have a Keurig Special Edition B60 brewer, and the first brew I did as was suggested by the maker (shake the K-Cup before brewing, brew on 8oz setting).  Of course my brewer doesn't have 8oz, so I brewed at 7.25oz, the "middle button."  The result was a watery cup of hot chocolate with a fair amount of chocolate flavor, but still a little too watered down for me.  The color was really good, rich, dark, and even had some of that nice foamy goodness on the top.  I was *very* happy to see when I looked at the empty K-Cup after brewing that there was almost no powder or residue left in the K-Cup, a problem that the other hot chocolate K-Cups really suffer from no matter how hard you shake them and there was almost no thick chocolate gunk at the bottom of the mug when finished.  Awesome.  So overall, when brewed as suggested, it was the best hot chocolate I've tried for the K-Cup when prepared as-is, but not the best cup of homemade hot chocolate possible.<br /><br />The next brew I did I shook the K-Cup and brewed on the small cup setting, the 5.25oz brew.  The result was a hot chocolate that was a little thicker, beautiful color, lots of that spectacular white foam on top, something that looked like a REAL hot chocolate.  The flavor was much more defined, a lot more chocolaty, and very smooth and tasty.  Though I did notice that slightly Splenda-like aftertaste which kind of surprised me since I'm largely desensitized to that taste (thank you Fruit2O) and honestly it was ever-so-slightly just too sweet.  But wow was it good.  Still not the best hot chocolate to make at home, but really good.<br /><br />Third brew I did I did again on the 5.25oz brew, put a splash of half-and-half in the cup, then brewed.  Holy cow in a hat...  That was awesome.  Finally a substitute for my Dunkin Donuts trips.  So, so, so good.  No aftertaste, right amount of sweetness and creamy texture.  Great, rich color that looks like a melted Hershey Bar.  Right up there with the best hot chocolate one can make at home for sure.  For sure a taste that competes with hot chocolate I've tried from Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />So rating this for me was hard...  When made, straight up as suggested, it's OK and even when it's made with less water it's pretty good.  Since I think the Keurig is designed for speedy ease-of-use, I think a lot of people are looking for and expecting that great cup of hot chocolate right out of the box.  In that way, it delivers an OK product, the best K-Cup hot chocolate available now, but not an overall great cup of hot chocolate.  But if you're willing to put two seconds worth of time into making it positively delicious, you will be very richly rewarded with fantastic hot chocolate.<br /><br />I fluctuated between rating 3 stars because, out of the box, it's only OK, and 4 stars because when adjusted it's amazing...  I ended up going 4 star with the assumption that there are a lot of people out there with a Keurig who do coffee or tea where they add creamer and/or sugar to adjust it to their taste, and I see doing this as much the same sort of thing.<br /><br />Hopefully Keurig will put out a hot chocolate soon that's amazing right out of the box.  If we could get them to talk to the Land O Lakes folks (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M5RNTS">Cocoa Classics Hot Cocoa Drink Mix 7 Variety Pack</a>), there would never be a reason to leave the house for hot chocolate again...

Why they need to add this to a product that already contains sugar, I will never know. I noticed the kids also were leaving their cocoa almost untouched. It is just as easy to dump an envelope of Swiss Miss into a cup and add hot water from your Keurig Brewer, and you'll have a much better (and cheaper) cup of cocoa!

review/summary: The best of the K-Cup Cocoa I have tried. Delicious!!
review/text: I have a Keurig coffee maker, which brews a fresh cup of gourmet coffee, tea, or cocoa in less than a minute. If you are not familiar with this machine, it is wonderfully convenient, especially for me, as I only make 1 or two hot beverages at home per day. But I am not reviewing the Keurig coffee maker. I am here to write a glowing review for "Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa K-Cups for Keurig Brewers."<br /><br />In the winter hot cocoa is my favorite coffee alternative, and I recently tried Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa K-Cups. Caf&eacute; Escapes Cafe Mocha used to be my favorite brand/blend. However, I now find this Milk Chocolate Cocoa K-Cup absolutely delicious and, by far, the best K-Cup cocoa I have sampled to date. I have tasted 2-3 other brands and flavors, but nothing compares to the full, rich, creamy flavor of this product - much more so than the Cafe Mocha, which is also good but not as creamy.<br /><br />I respectfully disagree with those reviewers who have given Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa a poor rating, especially those who didn't care for what they stated was the taste of sucralose, an artificial sweetener. I have a relatively sensitive palate and am usually aware of these artificial flavorings and sugar substitutes. I do not taste these here, nor does my daughter, who also loves hot chocolate....and she is REALLY picky! Of course, this does not taste like the hot chocolate made with whole milk and shaved chocolate - but it is an excellent substitute.<br /><br />It is important to remember to shake the K-Cup before brewing any kind of hot beverage.<br /><br />This product contains milk, soy and tree nuts (highly refined coconut oil). Product is trans-fat and gluten free. Caffeine content is estimated at less than 10 mg per serving (versus 100-150 mg in Arabica coffee). Contains a combination of natural and artificial sweeteners.<br />Jana Perskie

review/summary: Tastes like swiss miss, but so convenient swiss miss
review/text: I'll be honest, I'm a bit lazy when it comes to things like hot chocolate.  I really enjoy hot chocolate, who doesn't? The issue is I seem to crave it when I'm so comfortable on the couch after a long day and don't feel like warming up milk, mixing in cocoa, sugar, and a touch of salt to get delicious hot cocoa.  So where does this leave me?  I could, for about 20 cents per packet, get swiss miss hot chocolate packets and dump it in water and drink it, is it delicious? Not really, but I get my fix.  Problem is, you have to heat the water, pour in the powder, mix it, and deal with the clumps and clean up.  Not my favorite thing to do at 930pm (do your best to not think I'm completely worthless).  Now that I have a keurig, I thought this would fix everything AND give me great hot cocoa.  Well, I do have convenient, clean, easy to prepare hot cocoa, but its...about as good as swiss miss.  So yes, it does satisfy my fix, and at only 70 cals and 5 g sugar, I can deal with that as well.  I'm sure if mixed a little land o lakes low fat half and half in there it would be significantly better.<br /><br />I'm astonished by all these negative reviews of k cups in general, the idea behind k cups was convenience, not necessarily the BEST beverage available.  Lets be honest, using a burr grinder, fresh beans, and a french press  = best coffee ever, loose leaf teas and kettle of water = best tea ever, and the aforementioned steps to hot cocoa from scratch = best hot cocoa ever.  The problem is, all of these methods require time to be spent on ourselves, something our society so heavily frowns upon.  With my keurig, I wake up, walk down stairs, have a true American sized variety of well marketed beverages, pop one in, and have piping hot average to above average coffee and teas in less than 30 seconds.  So if you want GREAT beverages, make it yourself.  If you want GOOD beverages that are convenient and clean, get a keurig and lower your expectations a smidge!

review/text: Definitely a warm treat for cold winter nights, or any time the urge for smooth, rich hot cocoa hits.  The ease of use with the Keurig Brewing System makes this treat a frequent favorite.  I would recommend Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa by Cafe' Escapes to anyone who calls themself a chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />Marti Melville<br />Author of "Deja vu: Farriage"<br />[...].

review/summary: positive reviews are repeats
review/text: The only reason this stuff has even three stars is the repeatedly posted, almost exactly the same reviews, obviously posted over and over to raise the rating.  I just got a Keurig and am shocked I had not heard what a rip off the hot chocolate is.  It really ticked me off to spend $11 on something I could have bought for $2 and enjoyed much more.  True, Keurig is made for convenience, but really how much more convenient is it to add water and a kcup than to rip open a pack of cocoa and heat water in the microwave.  Totally agree, chocolate water, if you can even call it that.  Please don't waste your money like I did.

It tastes like some kind of weird, prune juice hot water chemical chocolate thing.  It's absolutely horrible and I am mad I spent the money that I did when I could have just squeezed some syrup in a cup of milk and heated in the microwave.

review/summary: DISGUSTING!!!!!
review/text: I love a good cup of hot cocoa now and then.  However, this product tastes awful!  My Keurig machine has two cups sizes and even on the smaller size the hot cocoa tastes very watered down.  We have to brew a k cup AND add half a packet of regular hot cocoa to make it drinkable!  I think that this is unacceptable especially since these cups cost more than the coffee ones.  We are gradually using our pack up, but WILL NEVER buy this product again!

review/summary: Absolutely Dreadful
review/text: I got a box of the Cafe Escapes Hot Chocolate with my Keurig last Christmas. I had no idea the machine made anything but coffee, so it was a welcome surprise. My girlfriend doesn't drink coffee but she loves hot cocoa, so I thought she would be tickled to have a cup of cocoa in three minutes flat.<br />I brewed her a cup after running the Keurig through the rinse cycle and made her a cup of cocoa in a small mug on the second-to-lowest size setting (we have a B-79). Immediately she grimaced at the taste and objected to drinking another sip. She told me it tasted weak, tasted like it contained a fake sugar-substitute and had a horrible after-taste. Reluctantly I dumped it, just thinking she was being picky, as she sometimes is.<br />A few days later I was still warming-up on a cold morning and didn't want another cup of coffee, so I figured I had 15 cocoa K-Cups left, so why not try one?<br />Not only was her description completely accurate, but she left out the fact it was so bad it would ruin the rest of my morning. It was dreadful in every aspect and although I really hate to waste anything, I had to dump it too. It was completely undrinkable and I'm typing this with the worst taste fermenting in my mouth. Ugh, my tongue is coated with artificial, filmy gross-ness and I have a feeling drinking the melted wax from a chocolate-scented dollar-store candle would've tasted better. This is absolutely the worst hot chocolate mix I've ever had the displeasure to attempt to drink. I have 14 cups left and I just might toss them all. I wouldn't give this to a prisoner. Awful. I wish there were "negative stars".

What can I say, but that when I answered the phone I never thought that I would get the bad news that I was told and then have this great man do everything in his power to make it right for me and I am sure so many others who were and will be affected by this whole thing.

review/summary: very sweet - too sweet even
review/text: Agree with some of the negative reviewers in that it tastes a lot like the packaged, instant hot cocoa mixes.  I use Cadbury's or even Safeway brand cocoa mix and boil the milk and all that - but as I do have a Keurig machine (actually Cuisinart now - Keurig brand did not last a year!) wanted to try this since it's at my grocery store.<br />It's very sweet.  It seems to be creamier than the packet versions (no lumps of powder) but it is definitely sweet - and as much as I like sweet this was just too much.  Maybe as other reviewers have stated it is because it is made with a sweetener rather than sugar.<br />So - no I wouldn't recommend this at all if you expect 'chocolaty' because you do get a 'sugary/strange sweetener' taste.

I don't use artificial sweeteners or drink diet sodas because I hate the chemical taste.  If you can tolerate those, maybe you'll like these.  It's what I envision Diet Cocoa tasting like if it were made by a major soda manufacturer.  Yuck!  Guess I'll have to stick with good old-fashioned hot milk, cocoa, sugar, and vanilla.

review/summary: Best milk chocolate available for Keurig
review/text: We purchased a Keurig last Christmas holiday, and have been very pleased with the purchase.  It came with a sampler of different coffees, teas, and chocolate milk.  And for the most part, I enjoyed most of the sample options.  The chocolate milk in the sampler (which was not Cafe Escapes) left me disappointed.  It was a rather water-down version of chocolate milk, with very little flavor.  Unfortunatley, I had bought a whole box of that same chocolate milk in the store before I had a chance to try it.  After some research, I came across the Cafe Escapes brand, which makes a chocolate milk for the Keurig, and in my opinion, is the best of the chocolate milks available for the Keurig.  It has a creamy taste, like chocolate milk made with milk, even though you're using water to create it.  It's full of flavor and in my opinion, what a good chocolate milk should taste like.  Now I've read opinions where people think it has an after taste, which I didn't perceive, but to each their own.  I thought the flavor was amazing.  My only regret about Cafe Escapes is that it's seems to be harder to find and is sold out a lot, although I've consistently been able to get it through Amazon.

review/summary: Tastes like hot water with some chocolate in it
review/text: I was pretty excited when I bought the B70 for my wife, she likes coffee and I'm a hot chocolate drinker.  I ended up buying the Cafe Escapes, got it home, put it in the brewer and the last half second that comes out of it is clear water, thought right away uh-oh real bad sign.  I added some milk to the finished product, topped it with some whipped cream, took a nice sip and thought wow this cup of hot water tastes just like a cup of hot water with some chocolate in it.  The next step was to Escape (BAM!! RIM-SHOT!!) from this horrible cup of hot chocolate, walk over to the sink and poor it down the drain.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />I guess I'll stick to boiling my milk on the stove for 10 minutes, pouring in 4 nice scoops of Nestle Quik and enjoying a real hot chocolate.

review/summary: 3 Paws Up, Innova Regular (old Name), NOT Grain Free, Excellent Rotation or Primary Food
review/text: Opening Notes: this is not Grain Free Cat Food.  The ingredients specifically list brown rice. Grain Free cat food has no Rice. This is also not Evo, nor California Natural.  The tags for this product are mislabeled. It IS good cat food to use in Rotation, with your other grain free Varieties.<br /><br />Background: this was one of the cat foods I used for quite awhile after the 2007 pet food recalls (btw, this month is the 4 year anniversary of the massive recalls).  Then, there was some controversy about objects found and potato integrity in the food. I switched to Wellness Chicken (waiting for Amazon to replace), exclusively.<br /><br />Personal Experience: though I personally was unaffected due to the Wellness problems, I decided that rotation of Wet Food for cats would be a good thing.  If something went wrong with one of the foods, then they wouldn't be severely affected.  I decided to try this brand out again.  Its the only food I use that contains fish (fish is not good for kitties, can exacerbate the Vitamin B deficiency).  The cats ate enthusiastically (probably remembered the flavor), but we had a few loose stools while adjusting (they are fine now).<br /><br />This is a wholesome alternative, since the grain tends to be minimal.  The company is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding their food. The food is canned by Simmons, in Emporia, IL. A sinle location seems to offer more consitency between batches.<br /><br />Since it is a Rotation food - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />Conclusion: Recommended as a Rotation or Primary food.  Cats give it 3 paws up, a little less expensive than pure grain free.  I suggest, if you can - getting some sample cans to try out on your cat(s) first.  I was a LITTLE worried about potato in Innova and Potato in Weruva, but with Rotation, there seems to be no problem.

review/summary: A good choice for healthy pet food.
review/text: I buy this in bulk for my four cats. The canned food gives them moisture in addition to dry food. They all love it! I like the healthy ingredients with no bi-products, no grain and not loaded with carbs. When I look at the ingredients compared to many popular brands, Innova is a great choice. My vet also recommends!

review/summary: The Only Food My Cats Eat!!!
review/text: This is the only food my cats eat. I have tried many, many food and they just don't eat the other foods. Innova is the only one. I travel 15 miles to get their food because not to many pet stores in the area sell it.

review/summary: Healthy, tasty and economical
review/text: I have 3 cats, currently aged 11, 7 and 8 months.  Innova cat & kitten food takes care of all three with canned food that is high in protein, lower in fat and carbs, and has a taste all 3 cats love.  I do not buy from Amazon as I've found a better deal from a website that starts with C and sounds like the nickname for Chewbaca.  I've compared this to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ANCEI6">Wellness Grain-Free Canned Cat Food, CORE Chicken/Turkey/Chicken Liver Recipe, 24-Pack of 5-1/2-Ounce Cans</a> (which I still have in rotation once in a while), and the stats were almost identical.  Personally I think Wellness smells a little better to me, but the cats love that funkier aroma of Innova.  I could care less about chunks of carrots - I know they're useless as-is to cats, so I just see that as little pieces of fiber.  I'm more interested in the protein, fat, carbs and moisture content, and the stats match up almost exactly to Wellness Core, and for quite a bit less.  I get a case for $19.99 with free shipping from the *other* website I buy from for pet food. I compared the cat/kitten food to the indoor cat food and somehow the indoor/weight formula has almost the same calories with less protein and more fat... so I'll be sticking to the regular formula and working on more exercise for the cats.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend Innova Cat & Kitten formula!

review/summary: Cats Didn't Like it
review/text: I bought Innova wet when I had 1 kitten in the house and he shunned it. I bought a second can when kitten #2 arrived and she backed away from it! I had one extra can in which I added some water to soup it up, and neither kitty ate it. After my unscientific tests, I can't recommend this formula for my cats. Maybe yours will like it more.

review/summary: Great food for cats with food intolerance problems, and they like the taste
review/text: After adopting them, one of my kittens had diarrhea that didn't stop for weeks. The vet thought he had worms, however the de-worming didn't stop the diarrhea. After trying various kitten foods, it became apparent that he was corn, wheat, and lactose intolerant.<br /><br />Both kittens are now eating Innova Cat and Kitten food which doesn't have any of the ingredients that make the male kitten sick. They eat it enthusiastically. I buy the 13.2 oz cans by the case, on sale if possible. It's more affordable than the comparable canned kitten foods like Wellness that only come in the small cans. I highly recommend it. My kittens love it. They also like the Innova dry cat and kitten food. Kittens like to eat small amounts throughout the day, so I leave the dry food out for them while I'm at work.

review/summary: YES! Finally A MIRACLE....
review/text: I have a very finicky cat who won't eat just anything and he developed digestive problems after being de-clawed. He was throwing up, losing weight and the vet put him on an expensive dry formula which he would eat but didn't love and only threw up about every 4 days. I did not like this pattern because he should not be doing that at all. We shopped around and many dollar later found another dry sensitive stomach formula which he loves and ate but would not touch wet food. He would throw up about every 9 days with it. When you love your cat you will go to any lengths to find the best for him. After being educated on the importance of a healthy and wet food included diet I began an extensive search for a wet food that I could get him to eat and tolerate. Many dollars and cans later of him turning up his nose and walking away I almost gave up. One day while shopping and I came across this new product," Innova" why not give it a try? I introduced it by inserting some of his dry food into it and voila, I was shocked because he always would sniff the food and turn away but with Innova HE TOOK A BITE and THEN ANOTHER and is now eating it several times a day. He is a nibbler and eats small portions, he drinks lots of water but I am in love with Innova because he finally has accepted a wet food and I can see the carrots in it along with the other healthy ingredients and the smell is inviting as well. The amazing thing and miracle is that he has "NOT" thrown up since! I call Innova "my MIRACLE Food", the solution to an extensive search and issue. I can't praise this company enough for solving my finicky cat dilemma! Yea Innova from Mick's Mom

review/summary: chocolate for healthy!
review/text: My cats did not like this at all and would not eat it. Some healthy cat foods have been refused by my cats and they are expensive. There should be more samples. I guess it would be like having a choice between broccoli and chocolate for most people!
