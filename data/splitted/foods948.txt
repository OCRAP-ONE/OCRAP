review/summary: Very good!
review/text: I love these! They are so cheap, but so tasty! My husband thinks they are way too sweet, but I love them! They don't have a huge coffe flavor, so they are a bit sweeter than an actual cappuccino. Regardless, they are very tasty and at this price, who can complain? Their hot chocolate is pretty good too.

review/summary: Can't stand Sucralose
review/text: Sucralose aka Splenda is an artificial sweetener.<br />I do not buy any artificially sweetened product knowingly.<br />Unfortunately I did not see this on the ingredient list.<br />Luckily I can taste it (yuck) and dumped it.<br /><br />The Chai Latte is another one that is artificially sweetened.

review/text: These are oh so delicious! Ok, if you're looking for strong coffee don't get this. If you're looking for deliciousness that feels like dessert, then this is the k-cup for you. Seriously. I'll make one of these when I'm in the mood for dessert and it totally satisfies my sweet tooth. It's got the perfect balance of hazelnut and coffee taste. Not too much, not too little. And the best thing? The freakin price! It comes out to approx. 54 cents a k-cup! Delicious little bargain, that's what it is.

review/summary: *NOT* real cappuccino!
review/text: If you're expecting a real cup of cappuccino you'll be disappointed. This isn't a creamy, frothy cappuccino, at best it's the same as the powdered "gas station" cappuccino you can buy at, well, the gas station. If you read the ingredients you'll see "instant coffee" listed, as well as artificial sweetners.<br /><br />I don't really mind this kind of cappuccino-ish drink once in a while, but be prepared for a very sweet drink. In addition to the super sweet flavor it was the only kCup I've ever had explode, and the company wasn't really interested in hearing about it.<br /><br />This flavor is something I definately won't be purchasing again, and the ones I have left are my emergency stash for when I'm out of everything else and unable to go to the store.

review/text: We bought a pack of thee to try. The first cup my husband made me he made on the bigger than regular size and it tasted a little watered down. I tried it today and did it on the reg. size cup setting and it was perfect. I would suggest that if you want more to use a bigger cup, but do 2 KCups and brew it once each. Defintely will buy again! And it's not too sweet!

review/summary: Pretty good if you aren't fancy like me
review/text: First off let me say what kind of coffee drinker I am. Before getting the Keurig, I drank mostly Folders medium blend. I don't have anything against gas station coffee - in fact I drink a lot of it. I like the cappuccino that you can get at a Casey's. I don't like the vending machine coffees at all - too chalky and gritty.<br /><br />Now on to my thoughts on this coffee - reminds me a lot of what I can get at Casey's - pretty sweet stuff. At Casey's gas station I usually get 2/3 cappuccino and 1/3 coffee. This isn't necessary to "water-down" with coffee. It is just right to me.

Also, the instructions on the box state to run a cycle of hot water through the Keurig after the Grove Square, otherwise it will clog the machine; same goes for hot chocolate, and apple cider k-cups....JimMc

review/summary: Tastes ok, but instants clog Keurigs
review/text: It wasn't until my Keurig got "backed up" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the Keurig or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my Keurig frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.<br /><br />As others posted, the taste is off as well. If you want to know what they taste like, go to your local gas station and find the "caramel cappuccino" dispenser and try that.

review/summary: Gas station cappuccino...and that's a good thing!
review/text: I must concur with previous reviews stating that if you like "convenience store caps",you'll probably be OK with this product.I used two 6oz passes through our Keurig,added an ounce of liquid French Vanilla creamer and then ran the mix through a Latte blender we have.Although a tad thin(next time-2oz of creamer),the end result compared very favorably with the local 7-11 caps,which my wife and I both love.As for previous remarks about sucralose;if I hadn't already known it was there-I wouldn't have known it was there(cannot speak to medical aversions,you're kind of on your own there).Bottom line;at $.35/cup vs $1.50 & up,this does the trick!

One review I read said there is 60 calories, but it is 80 calories a cup per the packaging, I probably wouldn't have ordered.  This will be a one time per day drink...also has a bad aftertaste.  On a positive note, the pricing is reasonable...however with one a day, it is going to take me two months to go through this drink that I am not crazy about.

review/text: I expected a nice rich vanilla cappucino flavor, instead got a very weak taste. Very disappointing.<br />This is the second "Grove Square" product I tried, and both were unsatisfying.

review/summary: Grove square cappuccino french vanilla
review/text: despite a lot of negative reviews, I still bought this product because of the great price. To my surprise I LOVED the cappuccino! I brew the small cup when using these K-cups because it's a little stronger, when you brew the larger cup size it's a little weak. Over all, loved the product and the price!!

review/summary: its instant coffee NOT real Coffee
review/text: SO BEWARE its instant coffee NOT real coffee I was expecting a dark roast sort of brew with a hint of vanilla... My mistake for not reading others reviews. That said it is not bad its is instant though so think those machines at the gas station that you pick your flavor from- that's what it is. I would but again but for different reasons NOT a morning pick me up. its also loaded with sugar and fat so dieters beware/

review/text: I tried this yesterday for the first time.  It tasted OK to begin with, but there is an awful, chemically aftertaste.  I assume it's because of the artificial sweetener.  It took me a couple hours to get the gross taste out of the back of my throat.  Completely not worth it!

review/text: Even for my hubby who likes just a little coffee with his cream and sugar (lol) this was perfect as is straigh from the Keurig machine!  I love how it tastes as well.  It is basically the powdered cappuccino mix in a k-cup. There is no filter inside it so you can't re-use them if you were going to use the K-Saver metal caps to re-use your k-cups.  Also you can't use them for more than one cup as you can some regular ground coffee k-cups.  Overall though - the flavor is excellent and well worth the 4 stars!

review/text: This coffee was WAY too sweet for me, I used one and I'm giving the rest to a good home.  By way of reference, I normally put a teaspoon of flavored creamer and 1-2 packs of splenda in a cup of coffee, so I do like mine doctored.  This reminded me of those nasty international delight flavored coffees.  It also clogged the needle on my keurig which was a pain to clean.  Never again!

review/summary: Frothy instant cappucccino - my gang loves it!
review/text: My guys travel frequently and like the sweet, frothy convenience store cappuccino.  This is a great replacement at much lower cost per cup.  With 80 calories a serving, it's easier on their waistlines too.  It's not even close to coffee shop cappuccino, which I prefer and they loathe.  I admit, it is a nice frothy drink, but if you're looking for "real" cappuccino, you will probably want to avoid this.

review/summary: Restaurant quality cappuccino
review/text: I was a bit hesitant to buy cappuccino K-cups.  After all, I had been using the cappuccino mix from Sams Club that provided a very good cappuccion.  It wasn't restaurant quality, but it was good.  Mix is soluable and doesn't need to be brewed.  The Sam's Club mix was cheaper, so why switch?  After the first sip, I was hooked.  This may not be the best cup of cappuccino that I ever had, but it is one of the best and far superior to many cappuccinos served at restaraunts and at 50 cents a mug, is a bargain considering the quality.  I recommend it without reservation.

review/text: I bought my son a huge variety of Kcups to go with his new Keurig coffee maker. After tasting about 20 flavors so far, this is the only one that we didn't love. It's not disgusting, but it's just not too flavorful. It had an odd aftertaste to it. We also bought the Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino and I thought that flavor was 10x better.<br /><br />We'll use these up, but I probably won't purchase this flavor again.

review/text: I recently bought a Keurig so I'm trying out different coffees.  I first found Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino in the grocery store.  Now I buy it in bulk at Amazon. I usually drink plain coffee, but sometimes, when I have the option, I'll choose hazelnut over other flavors.  I was so impressed with this cappuccino.  First, while brewing, the aroma was heavenly.  The first sip continued the experience.  It was quite creamy, and had a strong, but not overpowering, hazelnut taste. It was sort of like hazelnut hot chocolate.  This is the only flavor my husband drinks now and he has stopped drinking plain coffee altogether.  I hope they never stop making this.  I've tried the flavored hazelnut coffees, but prefer this cappuccino.  It's perfect for sipping on a cold, dreary day, or whenever you want that extra richness.

review/text: This kcup gets some odd reviews but I must say it is by far the best "quickie" I have had. I either make my own latte at home the old fasshioned way or I throw in one of these in the brewer when I am in a hurry. My hubby took them to the aid station and the soldiers devoured them like they were going out of style. I love the flavor nothing needs to be added to it. A dash of whip cream is a nice granish. But locally I can't find them anywhere. Walmart had them but now they are NEVER in stock. I have written to keurig asking them to start stocking these they are worth the try... and if you don't like it send them my way :P

review/text: There are 80 calories per cup of this coffee, 40 of those are from fat. The description says it is mildly sweet but I found it overwhelmingly sweet. There was little to no coffee taste, more like Cremora or Coffee Mate with fake sugar. I tried brewing one k cup of this coffee and then in the same cup added another k cup which was regular coffee in hopes of diluting the sweetness but even that way, it was still very sweet and whatever creamer they used was the dominant flavor by far.<br /><br />If you take a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you might like this coffee. I didn't like it at all.

review/text: Normally I don't care for coffee at all, but I absolutely loved these!<br /><br />My sister got one of the Keurig coffee machines, and there were samples of the French Vanilla ones included in the box. She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved the,, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon. After ordering those, I saw these Caramel flavored ones and knew I had to try them!<br /><br />I was so excited when they arrived that I didn't waste any time and instantly brewed one up and tried it. I liked it even better than the French Vanilla ones!<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. There is nothing I prefer more in the morning than one of these.<br /><br />Maybe these aren't for the hardcore coffee connoisseur, but for someone like me, they are awesome!<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book.

review/summary: Something we agree on!
review/text: My wife and I both enjoy this cappucccino!  If you enjoy a dark roast or coffee that is bitter and dark this is not for you. Its light and the taste is easy to drink.  My wife doesn't like a cup loaded with caffeine so this fit the bill for her.  I love that I can brew and go! No sugar or creamer needed unless you have a crazy sweet tooth.  I put a couple k cups to fit in a travel mug and I'm always sorry when its gone.  That means I will have to go back to the truely terrible coffee at work!

review/text: My wife loves it.  It's too sweet for me, but I don't have to drink it.  Reasonable price.  Good shipping.<br /><br />Be careful or it can drip down and you'll find yourself growing something slimy and green.

review/summary: It's instant
review/text: I was disappointed with this product.  It's instant coffee, sugar, and powdered creamer/milk.  It doesn't taste much like coffee.  It's okay, but not great.<br /><br />Also, after using the k-cup, you have to run a water cycle on your brewer.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: Perhaps I should have known when I read caramel but I found this item too sweet for my tastes. Nor do I remember reading that it is an instant not a brew product. A lot like International Coffee without the ability to adjust the flavor.<br />Taking it off my S&S list.

review/summary: Yummilicious!
review/text: These caramel cappuccinos are great - they taste great, they are a great pick-me-up and they are ready in seconds! Maybe they aren't like the cappuccino that you would get from a gourmet coffee shop, but you aren't spending gourmet time or money either! A very nice cappuccino for the price and the caramel flavoring is just right.

review/summary: GREAT IN THE MORNING OR EVENING
review/text: I enjoy all three of the Grove Square Cappuccino flavors as does my family. I have slowly stopped buying the regular coffee and have swapped over to this brand as I seem to have become addicted to the caramel as I can't get enough of its sweet flavor. At $7.98 a box at Walmart I can buy this and NOT have to buy those flavored creamers. I shake the cup prior to use and set the machine for 8 oz....YUM!

review/summary: Good product
review/text: This is instant cappuccino.  It is pretty tastey.  I like the cappuccino that is available at the gas stations, and this product is similar.  One caution is that it will clog up the opening on my Keurig.  (found that out the hard way)  Now I usually run through just a cup of hot water afterwards and that keeps it clean.

review/text: I really like the taste of this cappuccino.  Some complained that it's a waste because the k-cup is empty after it is brewed.  Why is that important?  I enjoy it and so does my family and co-workers.

review/text: This makes wonderful ice coffee...I have shared it with friends and everyone loves it. I know there have been comments that it is instant coffee but who cares when you have something that tastes good, and is so much cheaper then going to a coffee bar and paying $5 for an iced cappuccino...

review/text: LOVE THIS COFFEE! So delicious and love having the creamer and sugar right in there.  80 calories is a bit much but if I limit myself to 2 per day I'm ok with it.  Everyone in the house is loving this one and I ordered more immediately...it's currently on back-order but it's new so hopefully Amazon will stock up on it for me and I can get it faster in the future. Price is good too. Try it! You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: A great tasting Cappuccino
review/text: Initially I was a little bit skeptical about this product, but thought for the price that I should give it a try. I am happy that I did. It is a nice tasting cappuccino and is not too sweet. The taste is better with the smaller sized cups (6oz), it gets a bit watered down with the larger cup sizes. I will be buying this product again.
