review/summary: Best salt & vinegar chips out there!
review/text: Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.

You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.<br /><br />Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review/text: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

review/summary: Great Tasting Chips
review/text: After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips, Sea Salt
review/text: There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.

review/text: I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...

review/text: This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!

review/text: These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.  They are fantastic.  If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!

I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips.  The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open.  Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.

review/text: Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).

review/text: As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.

review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/summary: CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND ROBUST
review/text: We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.

review/summary: Tangy and delicious snack
review/text: For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less "natural" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: One of the better T-Discs
review/text: I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.

review/summary: Note: Rating both coffee and seller
review/text: This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this "Kona coffee" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.

review/text: My Nonna Lucia started buying this whole bean coffee at the Grand Union under the Pelham Parkway El,  MANY MANY years ago. The checkout station had a coffee grinder at the very end, so once Nonna paid for her groceries, she'd open the bag and dump the beans into the biiig grinder and flick the switch -- brrrrrrrrrrrrrp....!! the beans would grind, and oh what a wonderful smell!!!<br /><br />Every morning at breakfast, Nonna would set the glass percolator on our humble Bronx gas range, and brew herself a cup of 8 O'Clock Coffee. There she would sit at the kitchen table, listening to Italian operettas on Pasquale C.O.D.'s radio show, while dismembering a big chunk of Italian Bread (from Arthur Avenue), eating a soft boiled egg and regally quaffing her cuppa 8 O'Clock Coffee.<br /><br />The wonderful 8 O'Clock coffee, in its wonderful whole bean-ness, is still with us. Nonna, unfortunately is not. She left the world at the age of 94, and now listens to the angels (and most probably Pasquale C.O.D. himself) singing in Heaven.<br /><br />Nonna, this cup is in your memory!! * * Lifts cup, toasts Nonna Lucia, savors excellent brew flavor that brings back intense memories of a Bronx childhood and an Italian grandmother's love * *

review/summary: Proof that good coffee doesn't have to be expensive.
review/text: Eight O'clock coffee has been around since 1859. Can anyone honestly give a product a bad review that has somehow been sold for over 150 years?!? IT HAS BEEN AROUND THAT LONG FOR A REASON. Eight O'clock has known the importance of offering its customers whole-bean coffee instead of that pre-ground stuff in a can. For many years, this was the only coffee widely available like that and I'm glad to see that other coffees are finally coming around to what Eight O'clock has always known. Coffee is so much fresher tasting if ground just prior to brewing. This is a coffee that does not have to rely on a huge advertising budget and doesn't have to sell coffee at inflated prices just to turn a profit. Eight O'clock has been quietly plugging along for many years because it offers a great product at an excellent value.<br /><br />That being said, are there better coffees out there? Absolutely. Is there better coffee out there that can be purchase at this value? Not that I have encountered. The wonderful taste and aroma, the freshness and value, is what leads me to give this a 5-star review. I will mention that the price on line is more expensive than what I can find locally so it pays to shop around. In comparison to gourmet coffees, the roast is not consistent bean to bean as they are of varying shades. However to be fair, Eight O'clock roasts in larger batches and has never attempted to be a gourmet coffee. The other pre-ground coffees are likely the same but who could tell? Eight O'clock does use 100% Arabica beans so there is no chicory or Robust beans thrown in.<br /><br />You can purchase this pre-ground if you like but if you really want great coffee, buy the whole bean and grind just before use. Since coffee is 99% water, filtered water makes a huge difference for ANY coffee. Also, keep your beans stored in an airtight container out of sunlight, and NOT IN THE FREEZER!! If you like a bolder taste, the French roast is excellent as well. A darker roast has less caffeine than a medium to light roast so I sometimes mix 50-50 with the French roast. Either way, I enjoy my Eight O'clock coffee a lot. The bags have a one-way valve to let the built-up gasses escape and each bag has a best-by date. I have found the quality to be consistent bag to bag and year to year. If I had to compare this to my gourmet coffees I sometimes order, this would get an OK rating. But, when I compare it to all the other coffees it shares shelf space with...EIGHT O'CLOCK KICKS THEIR CAN!

Brewed in a real cheap(but excellent) drip maker,(at the GF's house) the results were outstanding. The nutty chocolaty taste really comes alive when ground real fine. And the slight hint of a wine finish leaves a lasting favorable aftertaste on the tongue. For the ease of availabilty and the price, the taste is hard to top.

review/summary: great coffee at a great price
review/text: I started using this coffee because of a consumer magazine's ratings of it; they said it was very good stuff, and lo and behold, it is.  I buy from Amazon because of three main reasons:  first, the price is right--shipping is free, and the price is competitive.  Second, I can't find this coffee in Northern California (where I live) as none of the grocery stores seem to carry it.  Third, they automatically ship it two you at intervals you select (I started with every two months, now I'm at every three months).  It's a high quality coffee, full of flavor, and the packaging (like most of the better coffees) tends to prolong the quality.  I am somewhat of a connoisseur of coffee; I grind my coffee and I use a French press to get maximum flavor.  I highly recommend the coffee and buying through Amazon.com.(and no, I don't get a percentage, this is an honest appraisal for the reasons I listed above).

review/text: I started buying Eight O'Clock Coffee five years ago because it was the cheapest whole-bean coffee I could find in the supermarket. Surprisingly, despite its lower price, it is also one of the top quality choices on the shelf. It offers a smooth, light roast flavor that I prefer to the darker roasts found in the more expensive Starbucks and Peet's Coffee brands. I have brewed my coffee via French press, AeroPress, and drip coffee maker over the past few years, and this is the variety I prefer. It's great coffee at a great price.

Even the variety store that begins and ends with a t.<br /><br />All that to say that we buy this whole bean exclusively, grind it by the pot every morning, and just sit back and enjoy that incredible aroma and flavor that we have for most of our lives.

review/summary: Great coffe but dont buy it here
review/text: You can buy this coffee at places like Walmart for $3.45/12 oz bag. The 4 bags for 24.62 you see here works out $6.15 a bag. Almost double the grocery store price. You'd be paying for shipping here as well.

review/summary: Simply great coffee
review/text: Consistently tasty coffee, and an incredible deal.  Tested this versus all sorts of whole beans and Eight O'Clock is generally better and always cheaper!  Only brand that has clearly surpassed it has been the local coffee roaster -- but that is a high standard...
