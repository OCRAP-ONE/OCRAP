review/summary: delicious dark chocolate treat!
review/text: I really enjoyed Riesen and i found this candy thoroughly pleasurable.  This treat is dark chocolate on the outside and has a chewy caramel center on the inside.  Its taste an texture were a real delight.<br /><br />riesen is different.  Unlike other candies that are overwhelming sweet and sugary, riesen is full of flavor.  Th exterior dark chocolate has a smooth feel, and a rich chocolate taste.  For me, its the flavor of the exterior that does it for me.  Unlike other dark chocolates which can be bitter this chocolate is only 45% cacao which gives you a great mix between sweet and dark.  I just wish there was more dark chocolate.<br /><br />the interior of a riesen is chewy and has a deep rich creamy sticky caramel flavor.  again this caramel does not have that strong sugary taste instead you taste the richness of creamy caramel but in a hard format that becomes softer and chewier over time until it melts in your mouth.  This delicious long lasting caramel was excellent.<br /><br />My only problem with this product is the lack of nutrition but im not expecting to eat kale or Goji berries,  i come to this product for pleasure, taste and texture.  My hats of to stock manufacturer of this wonderful candy,  i will continue to buy it in the future

review/text: I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for broke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.

review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee if You Like Dark, Strong and Robust
review/text: I like my coffee dark, strong, bold and black, no sweeteners, no cream.  This is thus an ideal coffee for me.  If you like a much milder coffee, say medium roast, you may not like it nearly as much as I do. If you like cream and sugar, that may just ruin this coffee as it will dilute its strength and "strong" is what this coffee is all about..  The statements made in the description of this coffee here at Amazon are correct, i.e. the taste of an Italian roast with hints of chocolate overlaying it. Lately I've been able to buy mine at Sam's Club locally in a big bag for $16.

review/text: This is my favorite coffee of all time!  It's just perfect.  Not too strong and not too weak.  I've tried many and this is the one I always grab.  Of course you must buy the whole bean and grind it yourself because it will always taste a million times better.  I don't find the price to be a problem at all compared to other coffee brands.  I do always make sure to get it on sale AND if you happen to have a Kroger nearby you can usually get a bag for around $7.00 which if (like me)  you have a husband who doesn't do coffee, it'll last you at least two weeks! :D

review/summary: Prepare yourself for a rich coffee experience.
review/text: Starbucks Caffe Verona is one of the most full-bodied, aromatic coffees sold by Starbucks.  It can be enjoyed at any time of day, but it is best served to late-afternoon guests or after dinner with dessert.  To anyone familiar with the rich aroma of coffee beans roasting, this coffee tastes like that smell.  Few cups are as fraught with flavor and richness as Caffe Verona, short of a well-crafted macchiato.<br /><br />In spite of its boldness, this coffee manages to retain its distinctive characteristics.  Where some of the darker roasts tend to become uniform and mundane, Caffe Verona is unmistakably unique and memorable.  Its flavor and aroma linger long after you have finished the cup.<br /><br />Whether you are the kind of person who gets hooked on one coffee, or if you like to try different kinds, this pack of three is simply a great deal.  If you truly, truly enjoy coffee, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy Caffe Verona.

review/summary: So much better than the store brands; great value too
review/text: I purchased this product out of curiosity -- to see if it would work differently (or as well) in my homemade yogurt than the instant powdered milk. And oh, yes, there's a big, big difference -- in taste and consistency (in the liquid milk *and* the yogurt). Based on the cost of instant dry milk around here (GA), it's quite a bit less expensive too -- you use less of it to make a quart than with instant.<br /><br />While I've heard that this form of milk is harder to mix, I didn't find it that much different from reconstituting the instant version, except that I needed to use warm water instead of cold. I did have a first trial that gave, ahem, unexpected results. ((YMMV, of course -- but if you end up needing to use a whisk, and plan to use the milk for yogurt, you might get an interesting "bubble effect" texture in the finished product. :))<br /><br />On my next experiment, also with warm water (just under 120 degrees), a few rounds of patient (slow) spoon-stirring was all it seemed to take -- I just waited a minute in between stirings. In each case, adding the nearly-room-temperature starter-yogurt made the temperature just right for the yogurt-maker. (If you use warm water and plan to use the milk for drinking, you'll want to refrigerate until chilled -- in other words, plan ahead.)<br /><br />So again, the mixing process is a little different, but not that much different -- and the results are very much worth the little bit of extra care. To me, the chilled liquid tastes as good as regular milk from the store -- I didn't think I'd ever say that about powdered milk!<br /><br />Just a couple of downsides to mention, though they're minor:<br /><br />- I wish there were mixing directions on the package -- how much powder to use to how much water. But I eventually found ballpark directions on the Internet. I used about a cup of powder and a bit over 3 cups of water to make a quart of yogurt, but it turned out so thick, I'll probably try a little less next time.<br /><br />- While the product packaging doesn't say this, I suspect this form of milk is the kind without the added Vitamins A & D that most store milks have. I get plenty of these vitamins from other sources, so it's not a deal breaker for me. It might be for you.

review/summary: Non-Instant Dry Milk (tips)
review/text: Even though I just did a review for Barry Farm, which is a highly reputable supplier, for their INSTANT non-fat dry milk powder... I ACTUALLY prefer the NON-instant dry milk powder.<br /><br />One reviewer sought for their ingredient list. I pointed out that the ingredient list IS actually (the label) on the package; the product is simply dry milk powder (whether instant, as in that case, or non-instant in this one).<br /><br />I added: The fact these powders taste sweet may also be a very good indication they products are FRESH. Since any dry milk only has a 6-month shelf life, you seldom want to purchase large quantities. Only buy quantities you will use within 6 months. Whereas, any classic off-taste people dislike about powdered milk is when the dry milk is old.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated she makes superior YOGURT with non-instant powdered milk, which I do too.<br /><br />(Tips & Techniques...)<br /><br />For any who wish for information how to reconstitute this product.<br />Combining 2 1/2 Tbsp NON-instant powder with 1 cup water = 1 cup milk (should be correct).<br /><br />The easiest way to blend, is with an immersion blender. Amazon offers one by Cuisinart, at an affordable price see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G3JRO">Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper Attachments</a>.<br /><br />I wish to add that I also make Better Baking Buttermilk (aka: BBB) with non-instant powdered milk, to make much better breads! For more cooking tips and techniques, simply do a search for my name Sharon Anne, i.e. cooking and sharonanne.

review/summary: Makes firm cheese. Not allergy-free.
review/text: Got it for home cheesemaking.  I add it to barely warm non-ultra-pasteurised store-bought whole milk, let it sit for an hour or so, for it to dissolve, stirring occasionally - and the result is more cheese, higher protein, less fat. makes very good cheese. My husband enjoys it. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction from this powdered milk, so a warning people with food allergies: it's not a "pure" product.

review/text: The first time I ordered the pizza flavor of this snack...I loved it!  Ended up giving at least half the bags away and recommending to friends and family.  When I re-ordered more, I opened my first bag and the pizza flavor was overwhelming...like they it had been over applied to the product.  Too much pizza flavor in this case was not a good thing.  Just about gagged me.  I thought it was perhaps just that bag.  No the entire case was all made incorrectly.  Ended up throwing them all out.  What a waste.

review/summary: Ahh, finally!
review/text: I wondered when Amazon might get around to offering this product. I've loved eating these basic fried and dehydrated noodles for decades, and will be glad to order them by the case. These simple noodles are great with tons of Tabasco--quick and satisfying.<br /><br />The instructions are plain silly, though. My family has always prepared these noodles this way: 1. boil water in a pot, 2. add in the soup base, 3. add in the noodles, and then cook them together till the noodles are soft enough to eat (I like them slightly undercooked). Cooking the noodles in the soup base makes them taste better. Do not overcook, and do not let noodles sit in soup for too long while eating (e.g., longer than half an hour), or noodles will become too soft and fat.<br /><br />Then I pull the noodles out first and douse them with hot sauce--so the hot sauce will cling to the noodles as well as the soup--and then pour in the soup. That vinegary Tabasco taste mixed with the salty noodles and soup is very good. The noodles are also good with an egg--cracked into the pot after the soup base, and cooked together with the noodles.

review/summary: Good quality, highly recommended
review/text: The Sapporo noodles are more expensive than the ones you find at the local supermarket, but they are also a notch above the cheaper brands. The noodles do not bloat up and get mushy when boiled. As a consequence, the cooked noodles have a pleasant Al dente bite. The spice pack is pretty delicious, and I frequently boil some frozen dumplings from Trader Joe's when I make these noodles. The price offered on Amazon is really awesome. My local supermarket is selling these for $1 per pack.<br /><br />To be healthy:<br />(a) throw away the spice pack. These noodle spice packs, any brand, are high in sodium, fats, MSG.<br />(b) boil noodles and throw away the water. These noodles, any brand, are coated with a waxy substance to protect their freshness. They will come out when you boil it- so pour away the water. The noodles will taste better too.

review/summary: lots of better ramen out there
review/text: I bought a case after reading all the glowing reviews here. Big disappointment. Sure, it is a little better than the 10 cent supermarket ramen, but not much better for 10 times the price. Frozen ramen from any Asian grocery store costs about the same as this stuff and does taste 10 times better. Korean ramyun (various brands) also costs about the same and tastes much better, especially if you like spicy foods. And of course none of these instant noodles tastes anywhere near as good as the ramen in a half decent Japanese restaurant.

review/summary: The soup base is key to this ramen!
review/text: I prepare this ramen like most of you except I drain the 2 cups of water the noodles are boiling in. I prepare another pot that heats up the soup separately and after draining the noodles (because the water gets starchy and the soup has a cloudy look to it) I pour the soup over the noodles with bean sprouts, chinese red pork (char siu)or left over beef steak or spam cut up into bits that will fit on my chinese soup spoon. Bits of spam is one of my favorite meats to eat with because its saltiness gives the soup base another dynamic flavor along with Tobasco Sauce. When eaten with chinese red pork there's another tasty dimension and leftover steak (usually NY or rib eye) makes for a hefty beefy brothy change. Sprinkle fresh cut green onions and I don't know how you can go to a Pho' shop. When I use the chinese red pork I keep it out of the soup till it is joined with the noodles otherwise your broth turns a not so appetizing red. Snap peas, bean sprout, cabbage and any of your other crunchy vegetables will make this dish fit for a King.<br />  One improvement I wish Sapporo Ichiban would make is: add about 10-20% more noodles. 2 packages is a bit more than my bowl or my stomach can take but I find myself running out of noodles and the meat, vegetables and broth populate the bottom of the bowl.<br />  I've been having this for breakfast every day during a work week for the past 3 years I believe and wonder when I'll break this culinary habit. I've alternated my meats and vegetables around this Ichiban dish which probably has me thinking that I'm getting a variety making my obsession last this long. I guess the change to french toast and bacon on the weekends has helped.<br />  Of course, you know that in Hawaii it is called Saimin. After a high school game, dance or event we would head over to the Saimin House in Kalihi and along with Teriyaki sticks would wolf down a large bowl. Of course now its a Pho' shop that we eat noodles at huh? Sorry it isn't the same.

Nooodles are best when water is brought to a high rolling boil, the noodles dumped in, the sauce pan covered and allowed to steep for about 1 1/2 minutes.  Then pour contents into a bowl where you have already dumped in the flavor envelope. Stir, let stand for about a half minute and then enjoy without adding anything else.<br /><br />John Hyatt

review/summary: The best basic ramen noodle out there
review/text: Nearly every day for my work lunch, I eat 1/3 of a ramen noodle packet, embellished with some leftover grilled meat and tons of vegetables from home.  I've tried dozens of different brands/styles and this is my hands-down favorite.  The broth is tasty but interesting and not too chemical-tasting (I usually use about twice to three times the amount of water called for and it's still fine, given my additions).  And the noodles cook up with a nice bite and aren't at all mushy.<br /><br />I've already gone through a whole case and am ordering my second.  The price at amazon is the best I've seen.

review/summary: Made in USA!
review/text: I personally didn't like this flavor but I like this brand because it is made in the USA. I sometimes worry about food products made in China (chemicals, poor packaging, poor quality, etc).<br /><br />The fact that these ramen noodles are made in the USA is a plus as far as I'm concerned. Further, these have more noodles than other brands so while they are a bit more expensive that what I can find in my local store, it's probably worth it.<br /><br />I would give these 5 stars if they were as cheap as what is in the stores.

review/text: This is by far the best Irish tea I've had.  Forget the stuff at the market once you've had a cup of this.  The only other tea that compares is Sainsbury tea, which you can only order overseas( a true English Tea).<br />All you need is one tea bag and you have a wonderful full bodied, bold yet smooth cup of tea. I like my tea like my coffee, good and strong yet not bitter. This is for those who like to taste their tea, if you like a mild tea this is not for you.  I am so glad they sell it here because since we moved, I haven't been able to find it.

My younger cat was very sick when I brought her home and I was nervous about putting her on a vegei diet until she was well. My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery. Everyone that has had contact with my pets have made comments on how beautiful their fur is.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/summary: Relaxation without drowsiness.
review/text: I suffer from anxiety almost constantly and am always looking for ways to ease my days a bit followed by ways to ease my already anxious stomach. Basically looking for both, relaxation and soothing my digestive. I have used Yogi teas for ages now! They should be in my medicine cabinet rather than my pantry. I've used Yogi Kava Kava Stress Relief and Bedtime - both are strong and will sleep you or make you really mellow unable to be social. I only take them when I am about to panic and trust me, they will ease you... to sleep lol.  Calming and Relaxed Mind tea are good and more for taste and a light relaxation. Eh, can't complain. But this one, THIS ONE has it all. Definitely for the mind (chamomile and lavender) and body (lemon balm, lemongrass, etc and of course the MINT). Don't need to take two teas. This will sooth my nerves, NOT drowse me, calm any digestive disorder that might be present.<br /><br />Taste: Definitely the lavender comes in first but not overpowering like Relaxed Mind. Mellowed by the chamomile, mint with the "tail" being the honey? Not sweet though just sorta smells like honey. (Shhh! probably honeybush but they didn't include it lol :X) Red tinted due to rooibos. Has that earthy-ness of rooibos too. Very beautiful tea. The combination dances well with one another, and we are talking about strong herbs here. Good job Yogi! Lately, Yogi's been coming up with awesome new teas. Must be a new tea chef!<br /><br />I am buying two of these at a time till they go 6 pack and then I'll stock up. I am drinking this every single day and am scare to run out. For this price? You just can't go wrong. I KNOW I won't find this in stores just yet as it's a new tea. I had low expectations for it's job, but for my surprise, it taste like it says and does what it suppose to do... relief my stress.

review/text: I ordered quite a large order from Barry Farms which included the dough enhancer. Their website said that orders would be filled and shipped usually in 48 hours. My order did not ship out for a week, after I sent them an email asking if they had shipped my products yet. I got them today and the whole box of food items that I ordered smells like cigerettes. I thought at first maybe it was the UPS driver but the inside of the cookbook smells like smoke so I am guessing it is at the farm not the driver. Also, the dough enhancer was not at all similar to a different product that I have been using for over a year but there were not ingredients list so I could not compare. I say buyer beware.

review/summary: failed experiment
review/text: I am combining white and whole-grain flours for my bread machine (60% white+40% brown) resulting in a "half brown" loaf of bread. Whole-grain flour needs a "booster" to properly rise and to get a more airy, less dense texture. I ordered several brands of "Dough enhancer" from Amazon to compare and to try out of them. I tried Barry Farm's in accordance with the suggested usage but the result was disappointing.<br />The bread not only rose less than usual but the crust got severely burned - using standard machine setting. The failure was so palpable that I discarded the product after only one application. I found other enhancers from Amazon which worked wonderfully.

Why have your coffee surrounded by plastic when it is absolutely unnecessary? This is a GREAT cup of coffee. If you like Starbucks, you will love this. May even be better.
