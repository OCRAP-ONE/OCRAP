review/summary: Colombian decaf
review/text: I have tried several decaf K-cubs and have found this to be the best. My husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste.I find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it. I will be ordering it again and again!

review/text: After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.  It's OK coffee.  I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones.  To gauge my review for others, my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, and Tully's Kona Blend.

review/summary: Favorite!!!
review/text: For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.

review/text: Our Keurig coffee maker was a great Christmas gift last year. One of the pleasures of this device is the experimentation with various coffee blends. Some have worked well; others have not. Some are too mild; some are a bit "off" on taste.<br /><br />This Wolfgang Puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the Keurig machine. It has a rich taste and still remains smooth. Not too strong a flavor, but it does have flavor.<br /><br />So, the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew.

review/summary: Great, but not perfect
review/text: I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.

review/summary: Spicy sweetness!
review/text: I've always been drawn to K-Cup varieties with out there names (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger) and distinctive flavors (Golden French Toast, Spicy Mayan Chocolate). This offering melds those two features into something I'm happy to wake up to!<br /><br />To me, Jamaica Me Crazy's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to Dunkin' Donuts coconut flavored coffee, but it's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics I've come to expect from K-Cup chocolate brews. Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties. Sure, the name's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated, but that's what makes this cup of joe so fun!

review/summary: WHAT WILL A 6lb. 13oz. Huge Can Of Amarena Cherries Be Like?
review/text: As soon as I opened this very large can, I WAS IMPRESSED!! THE INSIDE OF THE CAN COMPLETELY LINED WITH A VERY SPECIAL "BAKED ON" WHITE  ENAMEL OR TEFLON FINISH!! The cherries<br />looked terrific, almost completely filled the can, and I was prepared with 6 New Strilized Canning Jars!  In<br />order to very carefully remove the medium viscosity syrup, I DID THE FOLLOWING: 1. USING A ;LARGE<br />TEFLON draining spoon, I carefully scooped up  over 1/2 cup of cherries, and permitted the syrup to quickly drain into a very clean container! 2. I then placed the drained cherries into  one of the new Canning One Pint<br />Jars. 3.When I reached 1 cup of cherries, ( not "packed" in the Jar, I carefully added sufficient syrup to cover. 4. I the added 2 tsp. (measuring teaspoons of Peter Herring Cherry Liqueur, followed by less than 1/2<br />tablespoon (measure carefully) of either VS Cognac or Quality US Brandy-(I alternately used either the VS<br />Cognac, or EJ XO Brandy ($13.50 for 750ml)  5. I continued by carefully filling the jar with 1 additional cup<br />of drained cherries and then proceded with all of the steps I had done in "STEP 4." After EVERYTHING HAD BEEN ADDED, I sealed the Jar with the 2-part Canning Lids, after which I carefully inverted the Jar several times, (4 or 5).  6. I then placed Jar 1 into a very cold Refrigerator, and left undisturbed for a week! Actually, I would use the inversion technique I described!----REMEMBER, after seven days, open and SMELL! Also taste both syrup and cherries; they will change slightly for at least 3 weeks. At this time, if you feel that a small amount of Brandy is needed, you may add several teaspoons, "OR" instead 1 scant measured Tablespoon, BUT, it is always best to add less than you would like!  Now, after sealing the Jar, continue with about 5 careful rotations!<br />After several weeks, only occasional rotations are needed-perhaps every 4 days. The small amount of added alcohol should make each Jar last a very long time in the refrigerator!<br />You should have more than enough syrup and cherries to loosely fill all 6 Jars.  The cherries are really delicious!  The Luxardo Marasca  Cherries are actually a somewhat different cherry, but also delicious!<br />However, its syrup is much, much thicker; therefore, before I added the same 2 "liquors", I first carefully diluted its syrup, very gently stirring until the proper viscosity was achieved! Then I proceeded<br />to very carefully experiment with liquors. ALWAYS USE A SPECIAL CANNING JAR WITH 2-PIECE LIDS! THE Luxardo Cherries are smaller and delicate, but intensely flavorful!!

review/summary: Delicious cherries, and still good after three years.
review/text: These cherries have good flavor, and are a great value compared to the fancy jars they usually sell them in (if you can find them at all). Just put them in your own glass jars and you can share with friends. And because of the high sugar content of the syrup they will keep well, especially in the fridge.<br /><br />UPDATE May 2012: I ate the last of the (refrigerated) 2009 cherries about a week ago with no ill effects. They were still delicious. And I just packed the new batch in six 12 oz. jelly jars, with a little syrup left over to drizzle on ice cream in the next few days!

review/summary: Not quite what I was hoping...
review/text: After searching around for affordable imported amarena cherries, these Roland brand cherries came up at Amazon. Because of the great price and the fact that they seemed "authentic", i decided to purchase them -- all seven pounds of them. Unfortunately, the cherries don't have that richness of the Fabbri brand, and the syrup is more "medicine" like than I was hoping (almost too much like that old cherry tylenol taste I recall as a kid). The cherries were chewy but didn't release a lot of juice; and there is no visible expiration date on the large can, though the copyright date is 2004. Basically I feel that they are a glorified darker version of maraschino cherries with a thicker syrup. if you want a real amarena experience, stick with the more expensive Fabbri brand for sure. Or, find out what brand of amarena cherry is used at Carnevino restaurant in Vegas... that's where i first learned about amarene, and they changed they way i think about cocktails!

She went to the back room, looked in the pantry, and told me the name of these cherries.  My friend and I went in on a can and divided them up into six smaller mason jars.  We both brandied a couple of our jars and they are perfect for Old Fashions and Manhattans.  These are truly delicious, decadent, and worth the money.

review/text: When I received the shipment the packing box was in great condition.  I opened it to find the box tightly packed with bubble wrap and securely taped with shipping tape.  It took a box cutter to remove the protective bubble wrap.  Once removed I found the can of cherries so badly dented and damaged that it looked like it had been dropped from a third-story window and there was no way to even attempt to open it.  It had clearly been wrapped for shipping in that condition.  My only conclusion was that the product is being sold by a distributer who has a a badly damaged shipment that they need to unload because they can't sell it to their usual restaurant clients.  To Amazon's credit, when I contacted them about the problem they responded to my email within about two hours and had credited the cost of the purchase back to my credit card by the end of the same day.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

review/summary: Very Weak Coffee
review/text: I purchased this coffee along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZI9VSQ">La Crema's Hazelnut flavored coffee</a> and they were both very weak. While I found the flavor of St Nick's Nog to be somewhat better than that of the hazelnut, both required two tablespoons per cup in my drip maker to brew a drinkable cup. This effectively doubles the cost of the coffee, making it one of the most expensive coffees I've ever purchased.<br /><br />Update: I threw out the remainder of this coffee shortly after writing this review. The coffee wasn't enjoyable and began to feel like a chore to drink. I originally gave this coffee one star more than I gave the hazelnut for what I perceived as a somewhat better flavor. I'll leave that extra star, but only for this coffee's more pronounced flavor, which helps cover the same bitterness found in the hazelnut, and also because the hazelnut was that bad. Something else to note about this coffee is that it made me strangely thirsty. Even between sips, I found myself thinking about a glass of water.

review/summary: Delicious & spicy & easy to prepare
review/text: This spicy tomato rasam style soup is a pleasant change from bland canned soups.  The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality and this one is my favorite.  It is made with typical Indian spices and definitely scratches the itch for the flavor of Indian food.<br /><br />I make it with water as directed without milk but enjoy a dollop of sour cream and chopped scallions on top.  It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, red gram dal (red lentils), salt, tamarind, coconut, coriander, edible starch, red chilli, ghee (clarified butter), cumin, fenugreek, jaggery (raw palm sugar), mustard, coriander leaves, curry leaves, turmeric and asafoetida.<br /><br />The spices are authentic and sometimes I have found a whole curry leaf in the paste.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains ghee.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup.  Note that the nutrition information is for 5 servings per container, which would be a little over half a cup per serving which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 45<br />Calories from fat 15<br />Total fat 1.5g<br />Saturated fat 0.5g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol less than 5mg<br />Sodium 900mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 4%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4.5g of sodium.

So quick, and so truly delicious:  The spices are well-balanced, the yogurt tangy, and once you saute the chicken, you're practically done.  Plus, it's fresh tasting, not like some jarred sauces which taste like they've been sitting on the shelf for years.

review/summary: No better than Campbell's
review/text: I'm reviewing the Organic Chicken and Egg Noodles soup.  I'm puzzled by the reviews that rave about the soup -- the only thing I can think of is that perhaps they are reviewing different kinds.  This particular soup is not worth the money.  You will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken.  The egg noodles are "okay."  You'll get lots of water and celery, so if you like that, then this is for you.  The flavor is good, but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store.  I'd say save your money.

review/summary: Simple, lightly rich, REAL Food to Slurp!
review/text: The soup's consistency and flavor is more mild than I thought it would be, but that makes it soothing and light, so it settles well, yet it is filling.<br /><br />The chicken chunks are hearty, larger than in most canned soups, with some white and dark pieces. IMO the dark meat gives a deeper flavor, with the white being more creamy. The combination is great. At first I thought the amount of chicken was sparse, but as I kept eating I realized that I had a piece of chicken in most bites.<br /><br />After the soup is steaming in the bowl, I add fresh or dried parsley, extra garlic, and fresh cracked pepper and sea salt.<br /><br />It's so nice to be able to buy canned soup like this, simple, and free of life draining, unnecessary additives which sometimes appear to be providing a way to get rid of waste products from various chemical productions.<br /><br />I honestly didn't think it would be possible to find canned goods like this... sane, and honestly, simply healthy. I'm especially thankful that it doesn't have any soy in it. I was surprised to see that some of Wolfgang's soups do have soy, which is what I most want to avoid when possible, which isn't often when shopping in regular grocery outlets and restaurants. It feels like a miracle to me to find prepared foods without soy, or to find any kind of food without genetic alteration, synthetic chemical intrusions, and soy impregnation.<br /><br />I'm also stocking the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PH0">Wolfgang Puck Organic Creamy Tomato Soup</a>.<br /><br />Thank you, Wolfgang!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt

And frankly, I'd rather not eat than eat soup that I have to add a can of water to.<br /><br />This is not a heavy soup, but a nice, light one.  It has just enough noodles for me.

review/summary: great soup, a bit too much sodium
review/text: Canned or packaged foods, even if organic, are never as healthy as fresh or home prepared. However, given the "rats on meth" pace of our lives these days, we don't always have time to eat properly or prepare healthy meals. In that case we need to pick the healthiest "convenience" foods we can.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck is a famous chef and his line of foods includes some organic (only USDA Organic; a weak standard, but better than nothing) foods like this.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I found it very good, although much better with some organic butter added. The "low-fat" nonsense that has poisoned us for decades takes its toll on taste as well as health. One finds people adding more salt or even MSG in the absence of real flavor, which is mostly in the fat. (Hmmmm, oh, well, no time to go into a rant here.) Which is not to say this is billed as a "low fat" soup.<br /><br />Most of the ingredients listed are organic (USDA), and there are only a couple of questionable entries. One finds "spice extractives," "natural flavor," and "organic spice" all listed, and all of these can be code words for MSG. MSG can legally be called a dozen different such things, and while they might also be part of a "secret recipe," it raises the specter of doubt. That could also contribute to the sodium content, which is over 1.4 grams in the entire can (supposedly two servings - I find it more like one). If I could be sure there was no MSG in it, I would rate it higher.<br /><br />Still, it is far better than your run-of-the-mill non-organic soup, and I keep it around for those times when a quick bowl of warm chicken soup is just what one needs. There is a good blend of protein and fat in here, and it does taste good.

review/summary: Best Soup Ever
review/text: This soup is in a class by itself.  The ingredients are all the finest and the broth is thick and rich, but not too thick for a chicken noodle soup.  The flavor is out of this world compared to other canned soups.  If it seems a little pricy that's only because it is.  But it's well worth it!  NOTE:  If you like a thicker, even richer broth try the Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Wild Rice.  The chicken is often more dark meat however, so if you're not a dark meat chicken fan stick with this chicken noodle.<br /><br />I was a bit worried about the cans being damaged in shipping when ordering from Amazon, but they are well packaged and after two deliveries so far, they are in pristine condition when they arrive.

(the difference, aside from casein, is the color of the packaging.  veggie products have a green background, while the vegan products, shown here, have a purple background.)<br /><br />that being said, this is a great substitute for parmesan cheese--but it's not identical, so don't purchase it with the expectation that it will taste exactly like the Krafty Cheese Product you're used to sprinkling on your spaghetti.  in my opinion, it tastes much better than that.  :)  i agree with the other reviews that it's a great addition to a vegan pantry, and it adds a great finishing touch to a lot of dishes!

Unfortunately, since the shipping is outrageous and this doesn't qualify for Amazon Prime (free shipping) I will be getting it through my local health food store, but the product is delicious and even has some calcium in it.  I personally think the flavor is almost identical to Parmesan, and if the shipping were free I would be buying several to have on hand.

Its Organic !!<br />2.  Its  NON-GMO  even [...] verified<br />3.  It's Vegan and gluten free.<br />4.  It the smoothest protein powder ever, I can't stand the grit in other brands.<br />5.  It taste sweet with natural organic stevia. I've only tried the Vanilla, wonder if the original is as SWEET.<br />6.  Can i say it's super smooth again, the powder is so fine you don't even need a blender.<br />7  The brown rice is sprouted, so it's the only rice protein isolate 90%<br />8.  Sprouted Brown riceis easier on digestive system than other types like Hemp.<br />8.  Love the Amazon subscribe & ship extra 15% discount, best thing ever<br /><br />Go to growingnatural.com website read more about it.

review/summary: Best Protein Powder!
review/text: I've tried so many protein powders out there & have found them to be either gritty & they upset my stomach. Months ago I tried the three quality brown rice protein powders that are out & have found this to be the best. I been buying ever since. It's the only one that is organic, 90% Rice Protein Isolate & is dairy, lactose, soy, corn and gluten free. Compared to whey, it has a great amino acid profile. I was also looking for a higher Lysine level in comparison to Arginine which this has. Above all of this, I really love the taste and texture. It's very smooth, not chalky at all and has 24 grams of vegan protein, sweetened w/a small amt of stevia. I especially love the chocolate, blended w/almond milk, some fruit, & alittle extra stevia. I deal w/stomach problems & every other quality vegan protein powders other than brown rice, have caused me problems and I drink this every day. I couldn't tolerate the Whey or Green Pea & Brown rice ones as I experienced alot of bloating, etc. The last thing to point out is that this company offers a one pound bag where as the other companies only offer 2 pound bags and are more expensive. For me the taste of this one was the best. I just found today that Amazon is offering this brand now and at a really great price, so wanted to leave a review.

review/summary: Favorite vegan protein so far
review/text: I have been playing around with a bunch of different proteins and this one is probably my favorite so far. I like Vega and Manitoba Harvest's Hemp Pro 70 concentrate as well, but this stuff is a little more economical, at least on Amazon's Subscribe & Save pricing. I haven't seen it from any other sellers at a price that I'd be willing to jump at. As far as I know, this is the only organic rice protein isolate. I mix it with unsweetened chocolate Almond Breeze and a scoop of Amazing Greens Chocolate Green Superfood and sometimes a teaspoon of creatine. Great flavor, doesn't give me any stomach problems and seems to have a great amino acid profile. I do wish they had packaging with more servings per container as there's only 14 in here.

review/summary: Quality product
review/text: This is a very fine, quality product. I have tried other rice protein, and this one looks to be the best one. Very fine refined powder, made up of Isolate (not concentrate), gluten free product. Although expensive, but a quality product does come with a price tag. The only reason of giving a 4 star rating is that, I was not able to take it alone. I had to mix it with a equal amount of Pea protein (either with water or in a smoothie) for it to digest it properly. If not mix with Pea protein, my body was having lot of gas problem if I take this rice protein alone. I highly re-commend this product.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: I have been trying different non-dairy, non-soy proteins as an addition to my diet, and this one has been the best so far!  It has a fairly pleasant vanilla taste and the texture isn't too bad.  I use about half a scoop in my morning oatmeal and about half a scoop in an afternoon smoothie with pineapple juice, and it's a good addition to both.  I haven't tried it by itself, and about half a scoop is enough for the quantities of food/drink i'm preparing.  I don't have access to a blender or other ways to prepare it (i'm deployed to Afghanistan) so I look forward to seeing how it fits back into my diet at home.  The price is right, and the taste is good, so i'm going to reorder!

review/summary: Great protein!!
review/text: Amazing product, it does not have any taste whatsoever. It is a bit grainy, but nothing like the other protein powders I have tried.<br /><br />After a while it settles in the bottom of the cup so you must shake it to have a evenly smooth drink. The original flavor goes with everything, I have also tried Chocolate and Vanilla. And it is hard to decide, but like mixing the chocolate one with coffee like a mocha is excellent. One thing though, Chocolate is to sweet for my taste. And coffee make up for it. But then I must say, I do not have a sweet Thoth.  Vanilla is the one I drink the most, I like to mix it with Matcha Powdered Green Tea, and with a teaspoon of Maca powder. That makes a healthy energy/protein shake for breakfast.<br /><br />Great for girls with PCOS since is low carb and contains Stevia as a sweetener.

review/summary: Good not great
review/text: This rice protien has the best flavor of any rice protein I have tasted. It has a dark chocolate flavor that is not too sweet. The reason for three stars is because of the gritty texture and I find it hard to mix in a blender or shaker bottle. I would recommend Sun Warrior warrior blend protein if you are looking for a vegan protein, it has a much smoother texture. But if you want a 100% rice protein then this one is not a bad choice.

review/text: I had high hopes for this product as I want to stay away from whey and soy protein powders, and I think this protein powder does the job, but it tastes so nasty that I can't force myself to drink it. The one time that I did drink a full serving, it left a terrible after-taste that stuck with me for a couple of hours. Not good.

review/summary: excellent staple food--and very healthy, too
review/text: Starkist Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water makes for one of the healthiest foods on your grocer's shelf. This tuna provides you with protein. It has hardly any fat and there is almost no cholesterol--big plusses in my book! It is certified kosher, too, if that's important to you.<br /><br />Starkist packs the tuna in water to keep it moist and fresh for months at a time while it is in the can before you open it. You may want to drain the water from the can before you remove the tuna. This tuna always tastes delicious. While you certainly can eat it right out of the can; it mixes particularly well with products like onion powder, mayonnaise and reduced fat mayonnaise.<br /><br />One caveat, however: the water in the can may contain soy, salt, and pyrophosphate. If you are allergic to any of these ingredients or if you are on a salt free diet consult your doctor before eating this tuna. Starkist may make this tuna with reduced salt; and there are other brands of tuna that definitely contain less salt.<br /><br />Overall, Starkist solid white albacore tuna in water offers an amazingly healthy meal. It is especially healthy for you because it is lower in fat and cholesterol than meat or even poultry. It tastes great directly from the can; and it makes an excellent ingredient for tuna fish sandwiches with mayo or any recipe that requires tuna. I highly recommend this tuna for people who want to eat healthy foods; and this tuna fish will never disappoint mothers who want to feed their children well.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!

review/summary: The classic!
review/text: Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde.

They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!

review/summary: Kinda Pricy but good!
review/text: If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.

review/summary: DOG LOVES THESE
review/text: I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth.

review/text: I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door.

All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe.

review/summary: My dogs' teeth are pearly white
review/text: My dogs love their Greenies, and their teeth are pearly white from chewing on them.  The only problem is that Greenies are expensive, so I buy them in bulk on Amazon to keep the prices down a little bit,

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.  My dog is a chewer so it works out great.  She is addicted!

review/summary: Good Deal for my Good Dog
review/text: My dog looks forward to a Greenie dessert everyday.  You will NOT find this deal at the local pet stores.  I love the fact that I get a good deal at Amazon.  I save time and gas.  My dog thanks us both.

review/summary: Teenie Greenies
review/text: My little dogs really like these "teenie" Greenies dental chewies. Not only are they good for the dogs' teeth, the dogs consider them a treat! I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are "petites" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!

review/summary: Expensive treats but my dogs LOVE them!
review/text: I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say "Time for your Greenies!" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive.
