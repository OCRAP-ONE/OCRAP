Great right out of the bag or ground for recipes and whatever you what to do with them. Remember to always refrigerate or freeze to keep from going stale because of the oil they contain. Wasn't able to find them like this in any store in my area.  Will definently by again and again.

review/text: I'm not a tea snob. I just want a good strong cup that can stand up to some sugar, and I have to watch my caffeine intake. I've now tried several, and I don't care for the taste of this one. It has a grassy overtone to it that I just can't get past. If I increase the normal amount of sugar I add by about one forth, I can deal with it. I won't be getting this brand again. The compost pile seems like a good place for what's left. I much prefer Typhoo or Tetley to this type.

review/summary: Oh my Gosh!
review/text: Ok this is my first review so bear with. This product is so good I had to share my thoughts about it. First off let me say that I am Italian. I have chosen to go low carb in the past with much success. The only problem is, is no pasta. That's a really big thing for an Italian. I can go without the bread, potatoe, rice, and sweets no problem. But when it comes to pasta, that hit me really hard. So I go to Amazon to order it after hearing from a friend of mine how good it is. I am also one of those people who have tried every other low carb pasta on the market and thought they all tasted like cardboard. Yuk! I recieved Dreamfields and the same night made some to go with my dinner. To my surprise this stuff was heaven. I know other reviewers say to only eat this as a treat to yourself, but I eat it maybe 3 or 4 times a week. I am still loosing weight. Actually loosing at a faster rait than before for some reason. Now I am not diabetic so I do not have to watch my sugar spike levels.I don't even really watch my portion. I plate what I think will fill me and that is that.Probly 2 to 3 portions (1/2 cup is one portion). I never have that bloated feeling I used to get after eating a plate of normal pasta.And I never get the sugar carb crash 2 hours later. It has been almost 2 months of eating this pasta whenever I feel like it. The freedom is great.I have also made this pasta in several different ways. Macaroni and cheese, Alfredo style, garlic and butter with roasted veggies, you name it. Now I like my pasta "al dente" meaning almost cooked. They say you should not over cook the pasta because it will change the way it digests. Doesn't bother me I like it just on the chewy side of done. As far as reheating it, well just make sure you cook it al dente and when it comes time to reheating it should still be fine. Soups maybe a problem though since the pasta stays in the soup liquid and reheating to many time can cause the pasta to go mushy. So please do yourself a favor and either get Dreamfields from Amazon or from some of the local grocerie stores. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!

review/summary: Dreamfields is way better then wheat pasta!
review/text: My cousin started the Atkin's diet to lose weight before his wedding.  I was getting married 2 months after him and needed a diet buddy.  Since we worked & lunched together it was perfect.  He was eating pasta one day and told me that I could have pasta too as long as it's Dreamfields.  He suggested that I buy the Victoria's Organic Tomato & Basil sauce it's lower in carbs (4 net carbs per cup).  I bought it and added a splash of red wine, a bit of garlic, some fresh frozen basil leaves crumbled up and a dash of salt and pepper.  I had a low carb spaghetti dish that my Italian fiance drooled over... haha!  Good stuff.  Just be sure to follow the directions so that it's not over cooked ;o)

review/summary: Normal Blood Sugar Readings
review/text: I am a Type 2 diabetic and I experimented with Dreamfield's one day for lunch. I tested every hour after eating for a total of four hours. (I tested for four hours because, apparently, some diabetics experience delayed blood sugar spikes in the third or fourth hour.) I had one serving size and I used an oil and garlic sauce rather than a tomato-based spaghetti sauce. All numbers are in mg/dL.<br /><br />Before eating: 69<br />1 Hour: 62<br />2 Hour: 70<br />3 Hour: 82<br />4 Hour: 69<br /><br />There was a bit of a delay. My blood sugar peaked at 82 at the three-hour mark, whereas I'm usually higher at one hour. That being said, my numbers all stayed in very good range. I had normal blood sugar (&lt;100 mg/dL) the rest of the day.<br /><br />I know many other diabetics who haven't had as much success, so, if you are diabetic, run an experiment of your own. Keep your portions moderate and don't add unnecessary carbohydrates in the form of sauces or side dishes.<br /><br />As for the taste, I can't tell the difference between Dreamfield's and regular spaghetti, but keep in mind that I've been on a low-carbohydrate diet for a long time now. I'm very satisfied with this product.

review/summary: What a find!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with Type Diabetes last year, a low-carbohydrate diet proved to be the best approach to managing my  blood glucose, along with an oral medication. Pasta sounded like a thing of the past. Dreamfields pasta does not have an adverse effect on my blood glucose. I'm not qualified to enter the debate about whether the product is "truly" low carb. Perhaps diabetics should find out for themselves. I do know that it has a great taste, texture and consistency, and I  am now a repeat buyer of this fine product!

review/text: Reviewed by my girlfriend:<br /><br />I'm a type I Diabetic, and I was very hopeful when I tried this product. My favorite soybean pasta has been discontinued, and after a search on the web, this seemed to be a good alternative. However, this affected my blood sugar exactly like regular pasta would. The claim of "lower digestible carbs" didn't ring true. My blood sugar was through the roof. I don't recommend this for diabetics. Unfortunately, I've yet to find anything out on the market that will substitute for the real thing.

review/text: We are a 2 person household with one diabetic and one low-carber.  We love this pasta and eat it at least once per week.  We haven't noticed any appreciable rise in blood glucose level, or any negative effects on low-carb dieting while using this product.  Of course we limit the portion and eat it with plenty of protein and vegetables, which probably helps prevent glucose/insulin spikes.  I think we have had success because the proportion of pasta to protein and vegetables is low.  But essentially this pasta is delicious and we highly recommend it.

review/summary: Fanastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended!
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: A family member was diagnosed diabetic a while back.  The low carb approach seems the best control for glucose.  The diet is limited especially since the low carb versions of bread and pasta were disappointing and/or inedible (not to mention pricey).  UNTIL dreamfields.  What a great find!  This pasta is every bit as tasty as the regular high carb version (and we tried many low carb brands).  It is worth every penny and I hope will always be available.  If dreamfields could somehow create a similar product for bread/pastry flour life would be almost like before!

For a perfect match, there's a marinara sauce called Vito's Garlic Sauce. It's one of those great tasting things that is coincidentally zero carbs! So I cook up half a box of these spaghettit noodles, pour 1/3 a jar of Vito's on it along with some sliced mushrooms and parmesan cheese and altogether it's maybe 18 carbs. And that's a heaping mountain of spaghetti! Life is good! 8^)

However, due to the convoluted "digestible carbs" issue I would be extremely loath to recommend this to either low-carb dieters or diabetics, as there's a lot of evidence that it's not truly low-carb.

review/summary: Diabetics Beware
review/text: Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta?<br /><br />It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs.

review/summary: Better than oatmeal!
review/text: I love these quinoa flakes...they are relatively easy to make (I just cook them in the microwave.  They have a very unique, kind of nutty taste (I guess like quinoa) and can be made thick or thin.  It has the texture of grits or cream of wheat and, like quinoa, is a great source of protein...and it's gluten free.  I have served this for friends at a brunch and they loved it.  I sometimes put warmed fruit (microwaved frozen berries) in it...and it is a great treat.  Highly recommended and a great deal.  Also, the boxes came with a very long shelf life, but I am sure that they will be gobbled up fairly soon.

review/text: Ancient Harvest Quinoa Flakes cook up into a hearty hot cereal.  They taste great on their own, sweetened or with butter.  It cooks very fast, which is a definite plus.  Just don't expect a texture like you'd get with whole quinoa.  It's more a mush like well cooked cornmeal, but it's higher in protein.<br /><br />For those who can't eat gluten or are allergic to wheat as I am, this makes a great substitute for Cream of Wheat.  Actually I prefer the taste of the quinoa flakes.<br /><br />BTW, I was happy to find it here at this price since the few times I was able to buy it at the store it was $5.99 per box.

review/summary: a QUICK hot cereal that isn't overly processed - and is Kosher, gluten free and organic
review/text: Breakfast time in our household is very busy, so often I've been setting up our rice cooker with a timer the night before to cook hot cereal that's ready when we are.  This works great, but we wanted to expand the cereal choices.<br /><br />Not ready to order a multi-pack of Quinoa (pronounced keen-WAH), I got a single box of these Ancient Harvest Quinoa Flakes at the local health food store.  It wasn't til I got home that I read on the box that a single serving (1/3 cup dry and 1 cup water) cooked in the microwave in only 2 and 1/2 mins.  Cool.  I was also pleased with the protein content - 4.3 grams per serving, not as good as oatmeal but better than all the other common hot cereal grains.<br /><br />Not an issue for us, but if it is for you, you should know this cereal is gluten free, and per the manufacturer's website, processed in a gluten free facility, as well as Kosher and organic.<br /><br />My husband found the taste a bit odd.  I loved this cereal myself.  To me the taste was ok, but the best part was the texture - it is extremely smooth and creamy, and a bit of Splenda and half and half made it perfect.  It's far finer than Cream of Wheat or grits.  The flakes really don't have a lot of taste which should make folks who like to creatively dress up their cereal happy, and if you like a chunkier breakfast there's always fruit and nuts to add if you want.  If you have ever had bitter quinoa, you should know these are pre-washed and the bitter coating taken off, resulting in a very mild taste.<br /><br />With this cereal, because of its quick cooking time, I don't use the rice cooker, just the microwave.  It's no fuss, meaning a single stir when it's done is sufficient, you don't need to check and stir as you go.<br /><br />The flakes can also be used to make pancakes or waffles, coating for cooking fish or chicken, baked muffins or cookies.  There's recipes on the box.<br /><br />If you're looking for a way to enliven your breakfast easily, a box of Quinoa Flakes is very worth a try.  I can tell this will be a staple for me.

review/summary: Great and Versatile Product
review/text: When I first tasted quinoa flakes made as a hot cereal, I found them really bland.  As I continued making the cereal, I found that this wasn't a bad thing but a completely blank canvas for me to create whatever flavor I wanted.  It mixes well with honey as well as a combination of ginger and cinnamon.  The quinoa flakes have a great texture, and the amount of water I use determines the thickness of the cereal.  I haven't made muffins with the quinoa flakes yet, but there's a recipe provided on the box.  For anyone eating a gluten-free or reduced gluten diet, I would definitely recommend this product.  It's a great value for such a healthy, versatile food.

review/summary: Spicy, filling, hot  and absolutely nutritious breakfast
review/text: In East Africa, where I'm from, we have a porridge called Uji, which is essentially made from ground maize and millet. Very nutritious, even one of the first foods you give your baby when you're weaning him/her from milk. At our house, we're big fans of oatmeal, which we've cooked up with bananas (no honey, no sugar) and serve with blueberries, or with some adad lentils with a base sautee of onions, garlic, cloves, cinamon, and chilies. It's absolutely fab. My 20-month-old loves it that way. Until I bought quinoa flakes and made it for him that way--he loved it even more. Today, I made him some garlic peas and carrot hot cereal. Basically, boil the water, add in some peas and carrots (I'm sure corn and potatoes would be divine, too!), salt and pepper (or chili powder), and a chunk of minced garlic. Bring to a boil and then stir in the quinoa. I'm having mine with a dollop of homemade yogurt. Delicious!!!!!!

When done, I place a small amount of honey on top for extra flavor.  It is filling.

review/summary: Nutritious and flexible food
review/text: I raised my daughter on quinoa. She has it as a side dish (like rice), as pancakes and waffles (with no other flour), and the flakes as "porridge" at least once a week. She likes them all. The flakes, having a fairly neutral taste, can be flavored in many ways. I usually make her flakes with cow's milk, which is slightly sweet, with added cinnamon and vanilla. Sometimes I blend half a banana into the milk. For a varied flavor I use vanilla flavored PureCoconut milk which has a small amount of sweetener. I never add additional sweetener. Unlike wheat, corn, or oats, quinoa is very nutritious, and I feel comfortable feeding it to my daughter.<br /><br />By way of comparison, on the date of this writing (May/11), Amazon's 6-pack price works out to $5.23/box with free shipping, and Whole Foods charges $5.99/box. (Whole Foods does also give a 10 percent discount for case purchases. The Amazon price still slightly cheaper than the WF case price.)

This stuff tastes very good, and is hot, although in my opinion, it wont kill you like other ghost pepper oriented products might. I've been using it on eggs and also threw some in with my beer when making brats the other day. Both have been excellent uses. I would say use it sparingly, especially if you are sensitive to heat, but the flavor is good and the extra kick is nice. A definite winner IMO.

review/text: I ordered a one pound package for my Dad this Christmas, so I can't really comment on the flavor yet, though my Dad has liked pepper flavored salt before.  However, I was very impressed with the speed with which The Spice Labe sent it.  I was also expecting to get a sigle large box or bag, like you'd see on a store shelf.  Instead, the salt came in eight 2oz. vacuum sealed, durable plastic bags, so I know that the salt will maintain its freshness no matter how long it takes for my Dad to get through it.  Very nice.  Also, they included several differnt little sample packets so I could try some of their different flavors of salt without having to order tons of it.  My package included a sampler of himalayan sea salt (larger chunks), french grey salt, himalayan salt (with crystals sized like table salt, hickory smoke salt, and haba&ntilde;ero salt.  Very cool.  I will be getting more stuff from them.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 12/26:  About flavor:  my Dad says this salt tastes better than other ghost pepper salt he's tried.  He attributes it to both a better product and better packaging (see my above comments).

review/summary: Nice taste, not that hot though
review/text: I just received the spice bottle of this ghost pepper salt. Large crystals like you'd expect from sea salt, infused with ghost pepper. I put in a pepper grinder and seasoned some deep fried french fries. Adds a nice flavor and a little bit of kick. I'd say hot store bought mass produced salsa is hotter. Flavor is great though, and I would buy again. If you want something really hot, look elsewhere. If you want nice flavor with a little kick this is a great product.

review/summary: very good
review/text: I felt it was very good but not great. I recently purchased a similar product from The Spice and Tea Exchange in Tarpon Springs, FL. Their product has a fresher taste and smell.<br /><br />If you're a heat freak like me don't be misled by "Hot! Hot!". More of a medium heat but the flavor is good.<br /><br />I will place another order simply to determine if I was unlucky and received a package which had been sitting around a while.<br /><br />UPDATE: My second order was perfect. Brett took a personal intrest to make certain I was completely happy. Still not as hot as I would like, but I will order again.

review/summary: GREAT product
review/text: I absolutely love this product and fine myself putting it on a great number of foods.  My only complaint is it isn't quite as hot as I'd like so you end up making your food a bit too salty to get the desired amount of heat.  Still, a great addition to your spice cabinet.

review/text: I used to order Gerber 2nd Foods Bananas with Apples & Pears until I tasted it. I found it extremely sweet, so I did some research online to find out that it contains 15g of sugar per container.<br />When I looked for a substitute, I came across this fixed fruits, "Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit", which has 50% less sugar (10g per container) and has apricots in addition to apples, pears and bananas.<br />My son loves this mixed fruit puree and I love it too!

review/text: I just found the Mueller's on Amazon.com and did a little price shopping.  Looks like with the Subscribe and Save option the pasta is only about $1.15 per box.  This is an incredibly good deal for an everyday price on Mueller's pasta.  I really like the quality of this brand and the price with the Subscribe option can't be beat.  It is 20 boxes, but I just used the 3-month subscribe option.  We will eat 20 boxes of pasta in 3 months (big family).  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: When purchased through subscribe and save, this pack runs less than $1.20. While I can sometimes find store brand pasta for around $1.00 a pack in the store, for the taste and how well this pasta cooks - it is a great buy. This brand runs more in my local stores (around $1.69 a box). The good think about the pack of 20 is that we eat a lot of pasta. I would never pick up 20 boxes at the grocery store, but I end up running out and being frustated. This stores well in my pantry and allows me to fix a quick meal anytime. Also, since I have so many boxes I am more eager to stretch my cooking skills and try new recipes. A great price, very good product, and what can beat home delivery?

review/text: My Brazilian Raintree is thriving in my livingroom, sitting under a plant grow light, receiving daily mistings, lightly moist soil, and weekly light fertilizing.  I can't keep it outside at all right now because there's a horrid white fly infestation needing to be attacked first.  But this wonderful Raintree bonsai is doing just fine with the attention I'm giving it -- which, by the way, also includes very light pruning on a regular basis since it wants to grow a great deal, but out of shape.  Obviously it's happy.<br /><br />I want to praise the seller, Bonsai Boy:  I've bought other plants and items from them.  I'm convinced my plants are doing well because Bonsai Boy sent healthy plants to me.

review/summary: LOVE MY TREE!
review/text: I bought this Brazillian Raintree from Bonsai Boy about 6 months ago now. It arrived  safe and VERY well packaged! It's taken some time for this plant to get its bearings. It didn't grow much at all when I first got it, and shortly thereafter it shed all its leaves and I thought it was dying. But it's come back in MUCH better shape with nothing more than very light fertilizing and regular waterings from me. It's now growing almost out of control (hehe, I love to see a happy plant), and has tons of leaves. It hasn't bloomed for me yet, but I can't wait for that to happen. I find it doesn't need as much water as I've read. My plant will develop yellow leaves (from overwatering) if I water it every single day... so usually I just make sure to keep the soil moist (that's watering 3-4 times per week).<br /><br />I love my raintree!

review/text: We were in Italy this summer, and bought these biscotti to bring home at the hypermarket--like an Italian Costco.<br />Of course, they were relatively inexpensive there, but after finishing the box, my husband and I unanimously agreed that we'd never tasted better in the U.S.  So--I bought them online, and am about to re-order.  They aren't cheap, but they lasted us almost 2 months, so that's not bad.  Until I can find something locally that's as delicious and satisfying (nothing fake or chemically in them either), they're our biscotti of choice--you can taste the almonds, and with a good cup of coffee, or with capuccinos, can't be beat!

review/summary: A lightly salted roasted almond that is actually a good snack for you!
review/text: I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks. This flavor is just the roasted almonds and they are lightly salted for flavor. I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods. It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.  If you don't like the bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />This is a 5 star product but the pricing here is quite high.  The manufacturer and stores are less expensive.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

I have used it for everything, cooking, Popsicles, ice cream, floats, and just plain drinking.  Now, I live in Hawaii and MISS it!  Thanks Amazon for letting me share this with my kids even thousands of miles away.<br /><br />As I stated, the flavor describes explanation, but it is delicious.  Ordinarily, I'd say it's a little pricey for soda, but it has always been a regional product and nothing I have encountered elsewhere comes close.  It's one of those flavors you will either love or hate, but one that kids will inevitably adore.
