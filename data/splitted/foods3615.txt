review/text: This distinctive old fashioned type mint/candy is not easy to find in my area.  We are having a family reunion in July and I wanted to have Sen-Sens for all the great-great grandchildren to be able to sample.  My grandmother carried these in her purse in the 1950's and 60's and would share with us if we were good.  That licorice flavor brings back many memories!  Thank you for the fast and efficient service.

review/summary: Whoa...
review/text: A friend and I stopped by the candy shop before a movie and I was drawn to these little small antique-looking packets. I turned it around and read how it had been known as the very first breath freshener from the 1890s. It was .99 cents and quite a curiosity to me so I ended up buying it. As my friend and I were standing in line, I ripped it open, handed him a few and popped a small, black square into my mouth. I was in for a surprise...and not a very good one I might add! As my friend and I gagged for a few seconds, he ran to the trash can and spat them out. I was so confused...is it supposed to taste like perfume? You might as well grab a bottle of perfume and spray this stuff in your mouth! Yuck! I think I'm going to have nightmares about this stuff...

review/summary: Great Flavor!!
review/text: Got this and the chicken base from Vogue with very low expectations.  Fantastic!! is it in a word.  Made chicken noodle for my hubby with the chic base and he loved it (veggie chic noodle for me, real chicken for me, the broth, veggies and noodles were the same for both versions.  Well thought I what to do with the beef flavor (in case the hubby doesn't like it) So I made "beef" barley and vegtable soup.  Small batch in case I was stuck eating it.  Looking for some new hurricaine recipes anyway so I used the veggie mix from harmony house, the base from Vogue and some "beef flav TVP", some rosemary, parsley Barley and s&p.  Came out great!!  He had seconds and  asked for me to make it again and put it into the rotation.  You have to understand my carnivore husband to realize what high praise this is.  Course I made it with some killer biscuits to round out the meal.  Keep up the good work, I reordered some more and would request that you put it on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Very bland and disappointing
review/text: I was so excited when I ordered this seasoning base. Finally a veg-friendly soup base with low sodium! Sadly, however, I was disappointed. The seasoning is quite bland with no resemblance to beef flavor what so ever. Just because there is less salt doesn't mean they can't add other seasonings to make it flavorful! And because there is so little flavor, you have to add more of the product to water to get any kind of flavor. This means you end up with the same amount of sodium or more as if you were to use less of the sodium-laden bouillon cubes sold everywhere.<br /><br />Honestly you're better of just buying vegetable soup base or vegetable bouillon cubes. You'll end up with the same amount of sodium while saving on calories.<br /><br />VEGANS be WARNED: It is listed as being vegan on the site, however there is NOT a vegan seal of approval like there is on the chicken base.  The ingredients do not state any animal products being used, but the phrase "natural flavorings" can be a warning sign of animal products unless stated otherwise. And if they were willing to certify the chicken base as vegan why not do the same for the beef if it too were vegan?

review/summary: So worth it
review/text: While these are insanely expensive, they are wonderful and keep a long time in this dried form.  I was lucky enough to find them on sale so got several bags and they've kept beautifully.  This is a good-sized bag and because of the robust flavor of the porcini mushroom, a little goes a long way, so a single bag lasts quite a while.  Many soups seem to be better with a bit of this added and a mushroom soup is to die for.<br /><br />The mushrooms reconstitute really well and are in big enough pieces to make a hearty mushroom accompaniment for poultry or steak.  They can be chopped into smaller pieces, of course, for other applications. The richly infused reconstituting water offers a good base for a sauce.  I don't usually even bother to strain the broth since the product is quite clean.<br /><br />I've tried other dried porcini in the past and have not been impressed, which is what led me to go with this brand even at its higher cost.  I'm so pleased, I'll be sticking with it.  Highly recommended.

Plus the quality of this cat food is great, which is something I really care about.<br /><br />This 12 lb bag is a great deal.  At whole foods, it's $14 for a 3lb bag!  With the 12 lb bag, I save $22.  Plus with Amazon Prime the shipping was free, so it works out great (even if I paid for shipping though it'd still be saving me money).<br /><br />I really like this food for my cats, and plan to keep using it.

review/summary: Expensive - But great food
review/text: I'm usually the type of person to buy whatever is on sale to give to her cats. But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on. (Sometimes I get kinds that literally would be the size for a smallish dog and not a cat. They have problems eating it and the pieces fall everywhere.)<br /><br />I will continue to buy this kind as long as it remains available.

review/summary: An excellent, high-quality food
review/text: This is an excellent, high-quality cat food. If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Gonna be a lifetime customer!
review/text: I adopted my boy kitty (Boo) about a year and half ago and my girl kitty (Poxie) one and half months ago from the local pound. They both had a clean bill of health without any allergies or problems (other than the occasional hairball) but I started them on this brand after some reasearch because I wasn't happy about the nasties in the old food and how it left dye all around the water bowl (Boo = messy eater, he likes to pick out his food and it ends up all over the place).<br /><br />After a couple months of changing Boo's food, there was less bits of food being flung around and floating in his bowl, there wasn't a brown ring around his drinking fountain and there was even less fur in his foutain (granted, the latter may have more to do with the seasons and shedding).<br /><br />When I took Boo back to the vet about 6 months after changing the food, the Dr. mentioned that he was a bit iffy because it was werid to have fruit in cat food. He also said that he's noticed several cats that have kidney problems after years of eating Wellness (and checked to see if I was feeding them wet food as well - they eat Nutro Max pouches too. However, throughout the whole exam, he commented several times on how Boo's fur was very shiney, full and didn't have any flakes or dandruff like some of the other black cats he's seen.  At the end the Dr., somewhat jokeingly, said "Ok, if his coat is THIS nice, I have to look into this some more and change my mind about the brand!"<br /><br />Poxie was a scruffy looking girl and spent a couple months at the pound before we adopted her. She had just given birth to kittens before being placed for adoption and was spayed ASAP. She had her own room and didn't have to fight for food while at the pound, but she was on the thin side and her fur was dry and had a brittle feeling. She's been eating Wellness for about three weeks now and her coat has already settled down and is more sleek and silkier.<br /><br />So overall, notciable changes in both their coats (as a general indication of their health) and a huge improvement quality/ingredient wise compared to what they were fed at the pound. I have been recommending Wellness to everybody who askes me about my kitties!

Before I learned about feline nutrition, I fed my cats dry food and poor quality canned food. Now they won't eat any good quality canned food, or raw diet, and they are addicted to dry food. I still feed them Fancy Feast canned food (it's the only wet food they will eat) and I am happy that I found a good quality dry food that they will eat! I've offered 4 different premium quality dry foods side by side, and the cats prefer this one! They won't touch most healthy foods, so Wellness must have a palatable formula. I recommend this food to anyone with a cat who insists on eating dry food and is finicky!

review/summary: Worth the expense!
review/text: Moses, my 8 year old cat, was having trouble with itching, dandruff, and excessive earwax accumulating in his ears.  His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).  This was never a problem before he started eating this brand, so beware.

review/summary: it's cat food...
review/text: My cat likes this food. An 11yr+, part Maine Coon, &  fussy as cats can be, she eats this happily. Even in preference to Wellness canned food which she detested. I like the product as it is high protein and grain-free. Still searching for the ideal wet food to accompany it.

review/summary: Amazing Food!  All Six Cats love it!
review/text: This is the FIRST food that all my cats eat and love.  I can't get enough of it!  I had a huge problem with feeding the cats, so much so that one of my kitties got Fatty Liver Disease which nearly killed him.  After syringe feeding him for 6-8 weeks, he turned to THIS FOOD!  We had just purchased it and he like the smell and taste.  He won't eat any wet food now, but I feel good that he's eating this (and I syringe him some wet food just in case - with some supplements for his liver.)<br /><br />The other cats are doing GREAT, and I recommend this food to anyone.

review/text: At $34.99 for 12 pounds I did save gas money and tax. You might want to check PetSmart, Petco, PetSupermarket, etc before buying on Amazon.<br />The food itself is excellent! Our cats are doing great on Wellness Complete Health dry plus Wellness canned. Their coat has improved and they have more energy. There hasn't been any change in litter box odor. We've also noticed fewer hairballs and our "sensitive stomach" cat vomits less!!!

If I could find a food that produced the opposite effect, I would be pretty happy. I tried this after the local pet shop stopped carrying their last food, Royal Canin Siamese (which the skinny one went crazy for at first [she doesn't know that she's not Siamese]). This one is less expensive, and even more so on Amazon.

review/summary: Litter box smell could gag a skunk
review/text: Switched my non-diabetic (I have one diabetic on wet only for the past year) cat from EVO to Wellness Complete (blue bag) in an attempt to save $ while still providing good nutrition for the fur baby. Ever since starting the Wellness food his litter box has had the most foul odor I have ever smelled in a litter box. Visitors can definitely tell I have pets!! Heck, they probably think I'm secretly hoarding zoo animals. This hasn't been a problem before and I had really been hoping this was a temporary thing but we're almost three months into a bag and there's been no let up. We're finally getting to the last of the bag and I'm going to start switching him back to the EVO because I literally can't take it anymore. I'm quite frankly shocked that no one else has complained about this.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Pretty solid nutrition<br />Cat seems to really like the taste<br />Cheaper than other holistic brands<br /><br />CONs:<br />Twice a day it smells like raw sewage all through-out my house. No thanks!

review/text: So far, my cats appear to like this food. While I'm against feeding cats dry cat food, this food appears to be balanced in ways that other dry foods are not. From some reviews that I've read about this food, most people agree that it's a better quality dry food and made without many of the by-products. The only issue I have with it is the cost. Yep, it's much higher than others but I'd rather pay a higher cost and know that my kitties are getting a better quality food. Look forward to trying some of the wet food as well.

review/summary: My cats eat it...begrudgingly
review/text: As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.  Especially when you're paying a premium.

review/summary: Made Cat Sick, Cost $200 to Fix, Company Wouldn't Reimburse
review/text: I purchased a bag of WellPet's Wellness Complete Health (blue bag) dry cat food at a local pet store.  I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem.  The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure.  The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200.  I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem.  Please advise other customers of this potential problem so they don't waste their time and money on the product, or cause their pet to become painfully sick.

review/summary: Was the only thing my infant could have
review/text: My baby was born soy & lactose intolerant. To make matters worse, she suffered severe acid reflux. The only way to handle it was medication and this formula, with a bit of added rice cereal for added calories (she was a little underweigh due to health problems), and to make the formula a little heavier to keep it down. It tastes horrible, but she didn't mind..... immediately, her health improved and her weight was better.<br /><br />One little tip: Some infants refuse this stuff. I admit, I've tasted it. I told myself that if I was going to feed my daughter this stuff, I wanted to know what she was tasting. To describe the taste, I would compare it to chewing a tylenol....meaning: incredibly bitter! Thankfully, babies don't have matured taste buds by then so they don't care. Those that do (and I have friends that would give this to their child and it was refused due to taste), added just a few drops of Vanilla to mask the flavor. No problem after that. Enfamil makes a rice enriched formula just for babies who spit up, but it didn't come in the hypoallergenic formula, so I constantly went through rice ceral, mixing 2 tablespoons for every 4 ounces she ate.<br /><br />Now, she is completely off the formula. She takes normal food and loves the taste of milk. Go figure....without this formula, I'm scared to imagine what would have happened to my little girl.

Close in flavor to other British breakfast teas, Typhoo is smooth and cheerful.  It's a bit pricey, and I recommend purchasing in quantities that will garner free shipping.  It stores well for long periods if you don't break open the inner seal.

A good amount of chocolate and sugar, but not too much. Unfortunately between the constant snacking it only lasted 2 days. It's sold out at the moment but I have it on my wish list and I'm ordering the cinnamon in the hopes it's just as good. I think that pretty much explains how good it is :)

It is way to rich to eat a piece with a fork, can only eat a tiny bit at a time.<br />It is certainly different, richer and more chocolatey that anything I have ever experienced before...much richer than cheesecake.<br /><br />My niece just informed me the best way to serve it is to slice it as thin as you can.<br />If anyone out there knows how you're supposed to slice/serve it, let me know.

review/summary: Best Sea Salt I've Ever Used!
review/text: Over the years I've randomly picked up various sea salts hoping to find that perfect salt crystal that almost looks like it formed into tiny little delicate flakes. After running through quite a few, salt shakers, salt grinders, natural sea salts, salts harvested by natives who have been doing it for hundreds of years, you name it! They all seem to come up the same for me, the texture is never right. Even salt grinders can't get that perfect texture. So to make a long story short, I picked a shaker of this stuff up in the health food store one day and haven't looked back since. I've found my perfect salt! The texture is flawless; flakey and just slightly clumpy without over doing it. About the only thing I can say that's negative is the shaker dispensers tend to clump at the top and it takes an occasional reverse tap to clear the holes. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />I do wish you could buy one bag of this stuff instead of 6! The salt shakers are 7.5 ounces and last me forever. These bags are 35.3 ounces and there's 6 of them! If you have extended family then I suggest you give a  bag to each family member and save one for yourself. Otherwise don't hesitate to get this stuff, I love it!

(There isn't a Cracker Barrel less than 100 miles away).<br /><br />This mix is addictive. It's sweet and doesn't have an overly strong licorice taste. I like having some before I drink a cup of coffee--reminds me of sambuca.<br /><br />Amazon's price is very good considering the price on Jelly Belly's site is $9/lb.

review/summary: taste good, not hot enough though
review/text: Nom nom yummy sweet heat.<br /><br />A little disappointed that they aren't hotter.  I was expecting these to be a mega-spicy-punch like putting straight sriracha on your food.<br /><br />Nah.  A little garlic flavor, a little tiny sweet hot tingle.  I could eat a whole can and not go for a drink.<br /><br />Will I buy again?  Maybe, but certainly not to satisfy that crazy chili-head demon.

Great snack for a person on a diet because 24 of these peas (14 grams) are only 60 calories.  Great for a snack when you are on a diet like me.

I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

review/summary: Looks good, tastes bad
review/text: I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea.

review/summary: Not particularly strong
review/text: I have a wrapper from a single teabag of Nummi Tarry Lapsang Souchong, and the wrapper alone smells stronger after being opened for two months than a whole 3.5 oz bag of this smells fresh. This tea only has a light smoky scent and flavor, whereas the Nummi tea had a strong pine smoke scent and taste. I know that tarry lapsang souchong should be stronger, but I'm still a little disappointed at how weak this one is. Maybe I'll just use more tea for stronger batches.

review/summary: Great green tea for not too much.
review/text: Stash's gunpowder green has been a staple tea in our house for almost a year now. We prefer it iced, but it is decent hot. It is much more affordable than most other green teas and the quality is right up there with other good gunpwder greens we have had. Like most green teas, steep at 180 degrees for 3 minutes to get the best results. We go through a 3 pack of this stuff every single month.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E268">Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/text: Excellent tea.  Normally I am a black tea drinker, but this is an exception.  Superb when you have a cold or tummy ache.  A must have on hand tea.

review/summary: good but pricey
review/text: A friend requested loose Jasmine tea for her birthday and there weren't many options. Being in a hurry, I bought it, keeping one of the 3 packs for myself. I think the price is rather high, but the package zip locks, and the favor is nice. Strong enough to know it's jasmine, but not annoying.
