review/summary: A Great Cup of Joe: A Saeco Vienna Plus Super-Automatic Espresso Machine Review
review/text: We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010.  The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age.  The Saeco Vienna Plus is the updated version of the Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />Saeco's Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use.  Add up to 57 oz filtered cold water to the reservoir, up to 12 oz beans in the hopper, and then turn the machine on.  While warming up, adjust the volume dial for a 1 to 6 oz pour. Once ready, press the coffee button once to make an espresso or twice for a double shot or two espressos.  If a latte is desired, press the steam button after the espresso has finished brewing and turn the steam knob to activate the pannarello to steam the milk.  Turning the steam knob without pressing the steam button will produce hot water from the pannarello instead.<br /><br />The perfect espresso may require adjusting a couple dials in the hopper. A strength dial controls the amount of grounds used per cup.  A second knob controls the grind's coarseness. These settings are typically adjusted once then left alone if you chose to alter the factory setting.  The factory settings work well for us, so we didn't adjust these controls.<br /><br />Maintaining and cleaning the Vienna Plus espresso machine is just as simple.  Cleaning consists of a weekly (or after every 15 pucks) wipe down of the machine, rinsing off the brew group with warm water, and emptying and washing the drip tray and grounds drawer.  Incidentally, the used coffee grounds are beneficial to soil when spread out in the gardens or lawn.  Once every three months, running descaler through the boiler keeps the inner workings in good condition.<br /><br />A common complaint about Saeco Vienna espresso machines is the outer plastic cabinet.  The durable plastic cabinet was not a problem for us on the old machine, as it didn't chip, crack, or break with normal use.  The Veinna Plus uses the same plastic material for the outer cabinet, and is probably used to keep the cost down.  The internal workings, like the stainless steel boiler, are hidden from view and use more expensive materials.<br /><br />Another complaint I've read about is the grinder getting clogged.  Our local coffee shop advised us not to purchase oily beans like many flavored coffees.  If you enjoy flavored coffee, add syrup to the cup instead.  Choosing the right beans, and regular cleanings has kept us from experiencing this problem.<br /><br />Compared to the Vienna Deluxe, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine has an updated look, but operates the same and is similarly sized.  However the Vienna plus is quieter, and the pannarello has been improved for easier and more consistent frothing.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use and maintain; plus produces a great tasting espresso and Americano.  If you're looking for a fully automatic espresso machine, this one is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fresh quality coffee made at the press of a button<br />Makes consistently great tasting coffee/espresso<br />Simple to use<br />Easy to clean/maintain<br />Biodegradable waste is great for the garden<br /><br />CONS:<br />This espresso machine is sure to spoil its owners<br />Cannot handle large quantities quickly

review/summary: I love this espresso machine!
review/text: We had a Saeco Vienna Deluxe for several years.  The machine finally died on us.  In searching for a new machine, I saw the Saeco Vienna Plus and knew this would be the next machine.  It is very similar to our previous model.  It is much cheaper than when we had purchased our first unit.  I feel there is value in what we are getting.  It saves us a fortune from having to run to the more expensive coffee shop chains to pick up a mocha when it can easily made at home.  At the touch of a button or two, the coffee is ready to go.  The ease of use is amazing.  Clean up is easy.  I would definitely recommend this machine for those who want to be able to make espresso with ease.

review/summary: Fast, easy and excellent espresso
review/text: In about 3 minutes, this machine grinds the beans (no separate appliance needed for that!),<br />tamps down the grind (no separate tool for that!)and produces foamy hot espresso. Plus, the<br />steam is strong enough to foam up 2% milk!  Everything cleans up in a flash...second cup, no<br />long wait.  If you like strong coffee set the grind about four clicks from the maximum setting<br />and the setting for amount of coffee for each use at the max.  Lovely.

review/summary: Saeco Vienna Plus Expresso Machine
review/text: Easy to use machine that works well making espresso or just an single cup of coffee. The only complaint I have is if you are using a large cup for regular coffee you have to angle putting in and removing the cup since the bottom of the drip spouts are not high enough even when adjusting the pull-down or push-up spout that is provided. This is a well priced unit for what it provides you. You can adjust the grind of the beans but it comes manufacturer set for a medium grind. It comes with lights that once turn solid green let you know that you are ready to use whatever function you choose and dial for adjusting espresso to a full cup of coffee is clearly marked and easy to read. Steam is provided when pressing the 3rd button on - when it is off you get very hot water dispensed. The area for grinding the beans handles a lot so if you like switching types of coffee then you have to keep only the amount for what you are using in the grinder since there is no way of easily switching coffee beans once the container is full. Overall I would recommend it for anyone who likes to prepare their own coffee because of it's price and ease of use.

review/summary: Geat no frills superautomatic espresso maker
review/text: We've owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it's worth more.<br /><br />Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don't assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn't a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you've optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you'll have great results each and every time.<br /><br />Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time.<br /><br />Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first "coffee machine" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck's with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you'll get from most cafes. However, it's not as good as you'll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it's quite consistent. Don't forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance.<br /><br />Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can't do true microfoam.<br /><br />Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we've otherwise not had problems. Also, it's the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines.<br /><br />Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price.<br /><br />Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important.<br /><br />Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want.

review/summary: Works great for what it is.......
review/text: Got this for Christmas about a month ago; I've put 5 lbs of beans through it so time for a quick review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Quick brew time - you get a double espresso in 2 minutes or less (from completely off).<br />2. Well-brewed espresso - good extraction, nice body and crema. No adjustments to grind or tamping required, straight out of the box. Does justice to good beans.<br />3. Excellent frother/steamer - can scald 4 oz milk to 190F 2-3 minutes from pressing the "steam" button. Great froth for cappuchino, extremely quick and easy compared to my (very old) DeLongi manual.<br />4. I'm getting ~15-18 double espressos from a tank of water and a fill of beans. Holds about 1.5 quarts water, and a little over 1/2 lb beans.<br />5. Simple, well-thought-out maintenance - once you figure it out.<br />6. Inexpensive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Not the prettiest machine on the block - plastic-ey, rounded. The VW Bug of automatic espresso machines.<br />2. No "grounds full" indicator - you need to remember to empty it, and the drip tray, every 10 cups. Huge mess if you don't remember.<br />3. Yes, cold espresso if you use a cold cup. Not sure the extraction temperature is high enough - supposed to be about 190-195F. If you do 2 doubles in a row the second is significantly cooler.<br />4. The volume dial - I have to keep it on the lowest setting to get a reasonable 1-1.5 oz double espresso. On the highest setting it puts about 16 oz through your grounds (thus making cool, colored water).<br />5. Not very quiet; lots of grinding, clacking, and pump motor noise.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It makes really good espresso when I use good beans, and the milk frother is marvelous. It does everything I need without fuss, and quickly (which is important to me). On the other hand, it doesn't warn you when the grounds container is filled, and it needs refilling a little too frequently. It won't make American-style coffee, either; it can't heat that much water that quickly.<br /><br />Not 5 stars; but for the price it's definitely 4 stars.

review/summary: Expensive but worth it!!!!
review/text: I have had this machine for 6 months now and use it every business day.  It has worked perfectly since day one.<br /><br />I used to go to Starbucks almost daily and now I can't tell you the last time I went. It has already paid for itself! I make a mocha for a coworker daily who helps cover the costs of the beans, milk and chocolate as well.<br /><br />IMPORTANT!!!  This machine takes some tweaking of all settings to get what you want how you want it.  It also takes tweaking of finding the right beans for your taste, right chocolate if you like mochas and even a good frothing pitcher to get a good froth.  I probably spent a month before I had what I wanted exactly.  For those looking for a Starbucks like mocha I use Starbucks espresso beans and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate syrup along with 2% milk.  It's nearly the same.<br /><br />As for the machine, in my opinion very low maintenance.  Make sure you empty the grounds container fairly regularly so it doesn't back up into the inner workings of the machine and you should be fine.<br /><br />As for the negative review that seemed most helpful to others....this person is correct about the grind and water settings.  If you make the grind too fine the machine will take forever to push the water through and you will wait 5 minutes just for one shot.  The key is to adjust it slowly. Meaning just make one small adjustment at a time and then let it make several shots before deciding.  I took an old bag of beans I had and just experimented on the settings until I got the flow just right.<br /><br />To be fair, I make mocha's, I like them strong with half the normal chocolate so I can taste the coffee, BUT, it's still sweetened to the point that if you really just want cappuccino I can't tell you if it makes it perfectly.  For the money I think it does a great job.  It may seem expensive but if you research these units you will find this is one of the cheaper ones.<br /><br />As for reliability, the above mentioned reviewer seemed to have a few issues.  I have not had any in 6 months of daily use.<br /><br />As for any cons: the water tank is OK but when you make two mochas daily I have to fill it up about every 3 days.  Since this is in my office not near a kitchen this isn't horribly convenient but still...I'm not really complaining, just mentioning it.  If you are really serious about this and going to make a lot of coffee, find one that hooks up to a water supply.  Otherwise, this is just fine.<br /><br />EDITED..... 1 year later....everything above still stands....works like a charm...still making 2 a day....

review/summary: Third Time's The Charm
review/text: I had an "El Cheapo" espresso/coffee combo from Krups that worked well for many years until the pump gave out. I scoured the Internet for a worthy machine that I could depend on and purchased one of the Breville espresso makers. I returned it the next day. It made terrible weak coffee. Then I happened to be wandering through Wal Mart and saw a $70.00 Hamilton Beach machine. It made great coffee with crema and it was strong enough to froth milk. The next morning, I went to make a cup and the machine had leaked all over my countertop! I was lucky to have unplugged it the night before or else there could have been an electrical fire. Back to Wal Mart it went.<br /><br />Neither of these machines were automatic and I had to grind my own coffee beans (which I prefer, even with my regular coffee). I saw the Saeco, read the reviews and said, "If this doesn't perform, I'm not making espresso ever again." When it arrived, I followed the "Quick Start" instructions and filled the hopper with my French roast beans. I crossed my fingers and pressed the "On" button. When all the lights were ready, I pressed the "Coffee" button. In about 15 seconds I had one of the most beautiful cups of espresso complete with a heady froth of crema!<br /><br />I was so impressed, I made another cup. Ahhh, heavenly. Of course, I couldn't sleep that night - the caffeine replaced the blood in my veins.<br /><br />The milk steamer wand is also mighty powerful. It froths milk just like a commercial machine. Something my Krups didn't do very well.<br /><br />In summation, this is a wonderful machine in its price range. I highly recommend it. Oh, and by the way, the clown who gave it a 1-star review? That's a hoax. There is no such wording on the box or in the manual.

I also save counter space, as I do not have to share it with a grinder, anymore.  It is also very nice to have a HOT cup, finally!!!  Every other machine just never seemed to get hot enough.  I highly recommend this machine to all!!!:)

review/summary: A waste of money--a lemon!
review/text: I am from Italy and own a machine from this brand there. The machine over there works. The one I bought here in the USA broke after 8 months. I had to pay all the shipping costs for them to fix it, and they sent it back and it worked for a few more months. But now it broke again and it is no longer under warranty! There is not anyone in the entire state that services it, so I am stuck with a broken $500 machine. Not worth it at ALL!!! Don't buy it, the customer service is awful and the machine is not built to last.

review/summary: Terrible choice-do not buy this machine
review/text: I purchased this espresso machine on-line after having an older version for over 8 years.  I had neglected the older machine quite a bit in terms of descaling, etc, had shipped it twice all over the US and never had a problem with it.  This new machine arrived and the plastic front was loose and very flimsy.  Still, it seemed similar to the old one and I set it up.  Within a month the entire machine just died.  It wouldn't turn on.  I contacted customer service and shipped the whole machine off.  After over 6 weeks it returned, this time it worked for about a week before shutting down with the brew group in a jammed position.  I contacted customer service again and asked for my money back.  They refused and sent me an email on how to take the brew group with a screwdriver.  5 screwdrivers, a stripped screw and 1 allen's wrench later, I finally managed to reset the thing.  For the moment, it is working but the espresso is barely warm when it comes out, not piping hot like it should be.  The 8 year old Saeco, by the way, is still chugging along after I cleaned it out. Sadly, I cannot recommend this machine or brand anymore.

review/summary: Great Machine for the Money
review/text: I looked to this machine after I purchased and returned a Saeco machine costing more than 50% more than this one. Sure, it had lots of sensors, bells and whistles and a complicated milk frother, but guess what? It was dead on arrival. The machine couldn't hold its water--literally--and as it heated up water ran out the back and all over my countertop. I took it as a bad sign.<br /><br />Trust me, the more bells and whistles, the more things that can go wrong. This Vienna machine, on the other hand, hits a sweet spot. Just enough controls--grind, coffee dose, serving size, single or double shot)--and one fault sensor. The brew group (the inner assembly that makes the coffee) seems solid and is easy to remove and clean. The unit's lower cost seem to come from a cheapo-looking plastic housing they use; it's totally uninspired. Can't say it is flimsy in that I've had no probs with it so far. Besides, the coffee tastes very good, and you can't drink the housing anyway.<br /><br />I am sure there are all-metal authentico machines with big boilers and electronic controls that make a somewhat better cup, so I can't give it 5 stars. But are you a professional coffee taster? I can say that four months since purchase it has worked flawlessly and consistently. I like its coffee and the wonderful crema. Foams milk quickly as well. To keep your beverage hot, do microwave water in your half-filled cup until hot in advance of brewing (discard the water once hot unless you are going Americano).<br /><br />The critics are right when they say this unit wont pump hot water thru the finest grind settings, nor can you get true cafe Americano simply by choosing a large serving size. So stay south of the halfway mark on the serving-size dial. To go American use the micro as I suggested above and add a couple of espresso shots.<br /><br />Hard-core coffee geeks will say you can do better than this machine but I say it isn't worth it. I have been to Italy and done many shots from the "bars" there and I still say get this one. Save money by buying this one so you can go to Italy and study up on becoming an espresso snob!<br /><br />Oh and a warning: you will drink a lot more coffee, but you will also add a lot more bright-eyed joy to your life!

review/summary: Grinder failed after 21 months. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.
review/text: I edited this review in October 2012, after my machine broke.<br /><br />I bought the Saeco Vienna Plus 21 months ago to replace a much-loved and much-used Solis Master 5000. My understanding was that the Vienna Plus had basically the same internal components as my old Solis. I got over 8000 coffees out of the old Solis over the course of 8 years, before its boiler gave out. (The Solis had a digital coffee counter). I loved the Solis.<br /><br />The machine had some minor problems, for example, it seems to leak water into the drip tray (I read somewhere that's a feature, not a bug), a plastic knob broke (fixed with glue), and the dosage dials stopped adjusting. A few weeks ago, however, the machine began to smell like burnt machine gears, and as it worsened, the stench now contaminates the coffee. The cost for repair would be $150 labor, plus $225 for a new grinder ($350 total). Less for a used grinder. I'm 9 months out of the 12-month warranty. We make an average of 3 espressos daily.<br /><br />I would *not* have bought this machine had I known the experience I would have. I have lowered by rating from 5 stars, to 1 star. I agree with the sentiment of some other reviewers that this superautomatic machine makes most sense if you don't expect longevity. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.<br /><br />Another point of interest, if you follow the Solis/Saeco product line, is that there is no water-level detector. The machine just runs, and if the water runs out, it times out (it does not overheat). You just refill the water tank, re-prime (e.g., run the water wand for a few seconds) and make the coffee again.<br /><br />I'm replacing it with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S51RQG">Breville Barista Express BES860XL Machine with Grinder</a>, which requires an extra step when making an espresso, but after watching several videos, I think the BES860XL will taste much better, and be a convenient part of my morning espresso.

review/summary: Espresso in a hurry
review/text: Update #1, I've owned it for over 1 year and make 6 shots per day. It makes excellent espresso and has worked perfectly. I have upgraded it from 4 to 5 stars. It's still a bit noisy and inexpensive looking, but it works great.<br /><br />Original review... My impression upon unpacking is that there's a lot of plastic used everywhere visible. In fact the only metal visible is on the frothing wand.  At the price point I don't object, but be ready for it. The plastic used is similar to that used in model cars and planes, rigid, but possible breakable.  It is, however, reassuringly thick and I expect it to be durable.<br /><br />The Vienna Plus has a "form follows function" look as opposed to "styled".  To my eye it's sort of an R2D2 look.  Another reviewer said VW Beetle looking...I can see that too.<br /><br />My hand fits into a recess in the back of the water tank perfectly making it a cinch to remove and carry.  Frothing the milk is very easy.  Depress the steam button, wait for the green light and twist the steam valve knob on the right hand side until the water spurts stop and only steam comes out.  Twist the knob the other way to stop the steam, submerge the tip of the wand in your cold milk and reopen the steam valve. That's it.  You don't have to do anything else because the "Panarello" wand draws air in from the top.  That means you don't have to keep the tip just at the milk's surface, submerged works just fine.<br /><br />After you froth the milk it takes quite a while to cool the boiler enough to make espresso.  If you "un-depress" the steam button, open the steam valve and run some water through the wand it will cool the boiler enough to stop the blinking "too hot" lights in a few seconds.<br /><br />Both the grind and quantity of ground coffee can be adjusted whilst it's grinding.  Mine remains at the mid range factory settings.  The espresso comes out hot and rich with lots of crema.  It does make noise during the pre-brew, brew and grounds expelling process.  For maintenance, removing the brew unit to rinse under hot water is very easy.  I'm impressed with the ease of use, maintenance and the flavor of the espresso.

review/summary: Saeco Vienna Plus A Worthy Successor To 8-Year-Old Vienna Deluxe
review/text: I recently purchased a Saeco Vienna Plus to replace a Vienna Deluxe model that provided great service for eight years. We make about 24 shots of espresso a week, on average, so over the eight years the old machine pumped out about 10,000 shots. I felt we got our money's worth from that machine and was eager to replace it with another Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />When I went to do my research, however, I found that Saeco had discontinued the Vienna Deluxe model. The Vienna Plus appears to be the only current model in the old Deluxe form factor. I initially was tempted to buy up into one of the pricier "Giro" machines, mostly for the more stylish design. But after talking to a couple of Odea and Talea Giro owners, and reading lots of online reviews, I decided these more expensive machines also might be a little more temperamental. So, I chose the Vienna Plus.<br /><br />It's only been about three weeks, but so far the Vienna Plus is meeting my expectations. The main difference between the old Vienna Deluxe and the new Vienna Plus is in the boiler. I assume the Deluxe model had two boilers, one for coffee and one for steam. (I think Saeco is now calling this feature "Rapid Steam".) I assume that because there was no wait time between steaming and brewing, or brewing and steaming. I always steam my milk first, and the Plus model makes me cool down the boiler from steaming temperature to brewing temperature before brewing the espresso. That's easy: you just disengage the "steam" button and open the steam control to run hot water through the wand. After less than a shot's worth of water comes out, the "brew" light comes on and you can brew your coffee. The wait time for this is under five seconds.<br /><br />Other than that small difference, I'm finding the Vienna Plus comparable to the Vienna Deluxe in terms of both the quality of the coffee it produces and convenience. Who knows how long the new machine will last, but if it comes anywhere near the eight years I got from the Vienna Deluxe I'll be delighted with the investment. Speaking of investment, while the list price on the Vienna Plus is similar to what I paid for the old Deluxe model, the street price on the Plus model is quite a lot lower. I was able to get the Vienna Plus from a local warehouse store for $380 including business delivery. California sales tax ran the total to about $416, but even so I paid about $200 less for the Vienna Plus than I paid for the Vienna Deluxe eight years ago.

review/summary: Great Cup. Form Follows Function.
review/text: We bought an Incanto Sirius at twice the price. It looked Marvelous with it's stainless and digital exterior. It cleaned it's self and did interesting tricks with the display. Then on the third day it went bizerk and consumed a full hopper of Lavazza Oro without delivering a single cup of coffee. The seizure was fatal and the machine could not deliver another cup. Oh did it hurt being coffeeless after those three days of pleasure with the cost of a short vacation.<br /><br />Returning the Incanto Sirius to the store, I came home with the Viena Plus. It is a little plasticy looking and the tray does not click into place the way the Incanto did. There is a blinking green light to indicate that the machine is warming instead of an LCD temperature indicator. There is only one boiler that has to be shared for seam and brewing. It is somewhat Spartan in fact.<br /><br />The coffee brewed by the Viena Plus is excellent. The crema is thick and rich. Frothed milk climbs vertically out of the cup. The dreggs pucks are firm and lightly moist. There is no leaking and very little spillage from the brew group which is easy to remove and clean. This machine might not be the expensive, flashy, big show, high maintenance beauty queen, but it does deliver at about half the price.

review/summary: you get what you pay for
review/text: As with most Saeco products the life expectancy is less than 2 years, and then the price to fix the broken pump or the leaky insides cost more than the machine itself. I have been through 2 in less than two years and the warranty requires you to pay for the shipping (heavy machine) and they won't guarantee that they will fix it, and then you have to pay to have it sent back. I regret ever looking at the machine - next time a Breville - my daughter has had hers for 5 years with no issues, ever.

review/summary: Great value, great coffee.
review/text: I grew up in Italy where I owned and operated a cafe' with my family. Needless to say I am very picky about proper espresso making. Although the Vienna has a plastic-like appearance, it is a very good machine overall. The crema is consistent, the frother works very well.<br />It will take some time to learn the proper combo of grinding size, dose,type of water and beans,but your espresso will turn out to the best of your expectation. If the machine is on sale, don't hesitate to buy it. Two friends of mine have had it for 7 years, and the quality of the coffee is still excellent.<br />My only complaint is the temperature of the coffee; it could be a bit higher, and I wish it had a cup warmer at the top.

review/summary: Great machine
review/text: This is my first automatic machine, I had bought a manual one before this one but it was a pain to use.  It may not look as fancy as some other ones, but it does an excellent job.  It's relatively easy to clean, and Saeco's customer service is excellent if you have any issues.  I had contacted them about the panarello (frothing wand) that I was having issues with and they sent me a new one under the 1-year warranty within 3 days!  I use it mainly for making lattes, mochas, and caramel machiattos.  All of which turn out even better than Starbucks, even though I use their beans, mocha powder, vanilla syrup, and caramel sauce.  All in all, I give this machine a 4, not because of how it works but only because it is a little plastic-looking.

review/summary: Would buy it over and over again...
review/text: This is the 3rd machine I got (bought the 1st one in 1999 in Germany) and it has constantly been the same quality. It usually needs to be repaired after roundabout 4 1/2 years. If you like a good coffee with no what we call 'SchnickSchnack' (that means no Cappuccino, no Latte etc., just Coffee) go for this one. My new machine is - compared to the 2 I had before - actually a little bit noisier, which doesn't bother me as long as the coffee tastes good. Depending on the coffee beans you use, you will have excellent coffee. It's a good price, actually it's gotten cheaper througout the years. Anyways, you cannot compare a SAECO to a JURA (which, in my opinion is too expensive). If you want good coffee for a reasonable price, buy this one.

review/summary: So far, great experience
review/text: I tried a De'Longhi BAR32 pump driven espresso machine, and was very disappointed.  I've returned that unit.  It was simply ineffective.  Boiler capacity too small, can't make doubles, too cold, can't froth any reasonable amount.  Just not good.  I had a Saeco/Starbucks pump driven espresso machine previously, which finally failed after 12 years of service.  The Saeco/Starbucks was a pretty good machine that performed well - fully manual.  However, it finally bit the dust.<br /><br />So, I tried the Saeco Vienna Plus.  Sure, it's a lot more money, however it does a lot more and (though I've only used it for 2 days) it has performed very well.  No problems on capacity.  It can make double, or quadruple shots with ease.  It heats up very quickly, and has very good capacity.  I never thought I'd like a "super automatic" but now I'm loving it.  Frother works perfectly fine.  About the only thing I can say I wish it did were one thing.  That would be an easier way to swap out coffee beans in the hopper so I could do Decaf later in the day.<br /><br />Instructions are simple - maybe a little too simple.  I'm still not clear on instructions to clean the brew assembly.<br /><br />Setup was very easy and straightforward.  The unit worked perfectly out of the box.  Espresso can be dialed in great, and quality is excellent.  Frankly, it makes brewing an espresso or capuccino so easy and fast and so good that I'll be making WAY more.  So long as my experience stays consistent with the past two days, I'm very happy.

review/text: I had been looking for a combo grinder, espresso, cappuccino machine for a while. I've seen Saeco units before and find them to be adequate for the "less than $1,000" purchase.<br />Pros - Great coffee, easy to set up, a little quirky on operation but once you get used to it is wonderful<br />Cons- Too many plastic parts...worried about thinks breaking. Also, sometimes when you add new water you have to "prime" the water circuit...seems odd. Also after using the steam, you have to vent the steam line to go back to using the grinder. Not sure why this has to be done...seems odd

review/summary: Excellent Super Automatic Espresso Machine
review/text: This machine is for the serious coffee connoisseur.  It has an adjustable conical burr grinder that creates the perfect grind for a premium espresso. Not only can you change the fineness of the grinds and the amount of water used but also the amount of ground coffee used to make each individual cup from 6 to 9 grams.<br /><br />I've tried it with my favorite gourmet coffee, Caffe Bomrad Torino from Italy ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NV44AE">Caffe Bomrad Torino, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2 Lb/1 Kg Bag</a> ) and needless to say, the result was amazingly superb! A divinely perfect espresso with a crema so thick the sugar cube floats!!!

review/summary: Great Price for a Super Automatic
review/text: This is my second Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It's the lowest priced model available and is pretty good considering the price. The lack of extra features is not a problem. However there are some issues you might like to know before buying. Overall, it makes a decent espresso at the touch of a button. It's easy to clean and maintain and for that alone it's worth it since it saves you so much time.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso is decent - not bad, but not great either. It's far superior to drip coffee and easier than grinding your own beans. It took about a week to get the dosage and grinder settings to where I was satisfied. The defaults didn't use enough beans and the grind was too course which made the espresso quite bitter. You don't want run too much water through the grinds once the initial flavor is extracted.<br /><br />The temperature of the espresso is a little low. It's fine if you drink it right away or don't add cold milk. The only other little issue is the frother dispenses quite a bit of water before the actual steam. Therefore you have to use a second cup and run it for a few seconds until the steam flows consistently, then switch to your milk so you don't dilute it. Not a big deal but my last machine didn't require this step.<br /><br />Finally, the last issue has to do with the horrible packaging. The main box is contained in an outer box that's almost twice its size. The problem is there was NO PADDING whatsoever in the outer box, so the inner one is left to get slammed around throughout its entire shipping journey. My machine become separated along the main seam that runs all the way around the unit so it didn't even close properly until I pushed it back into place - there's still a small crack on one of the plastic pieces. Also, some of the buttons popped off. I would have returned it but it's kind of a hassle to ship something so large and it still works okay, so not a big deal, but wouldn't order one from here again.<br /><br />The bottom line is Super Automatic Espresso makers are an amazing convenience for those who appreciate fresh coffee. The quality is much better than the pod makers and far easier than grinding your own beans and making a whole pot at a time. The espresso isn't as good as a manual machine and this model doesn't have any fancy features, but still an amazing value for the price.

review/summary: Fantastic espresso machine!
review/text: I admit it, I am a espresso snob.  It's either Americanos or straight up espresso shots for me so I can really taste the quality of the espresso shots that the machine makes.  I have found that Saeco Vienna machines make the best espresso.  The reason why I just bought this particular machine is because my old Saeco Vienna (which I loved immensely) died yesterday.  I bought the old one in either 2004 or 2005.  I have used it everyday (3-5 shots per day) for the last 7+ years!  To me it is amazing that any kitchen appliance could last that long in this day and age.  Very good product!  It is super easy to "clean" and maintain.  My form of cleaning is to pull the main mechanism out (very easy) about 2 times a month and rinse the whole thing in the sink and set it out to air dry for the day.  Probably not even close to the amount of cleaning the manufacturer recommends, but it's just that easy and like I said...7+ years!

review/summary: Saeco Vienna worth it if you love coffee!
review/text: Our sister has had this espresso maker (in black) for a while, and when visiting her recently on vacation, we decided to purchase this machine upon our return after using it at her place for a week. We paid 399.99 for it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PI82P0">Saeco 4038 Vienna Plus 15-Bar-Pump Super-Automatic Espresso Machine, Graphite</a>, wouldn't pay more, though.  We bought the silver-colored machine and was actually surprised that it was ALL plastic except for the grinder inside and the small silver arm-part thingie at the top of the milk frother (I discovered it was metal when I grabbed it to push it back after using it...ouch).<br /><br />Other than the plastic issue, we love this machine. Love that we can select how much coffee we want, how strong we want it, and when we want it within minutes. Would definately recommend this espresso maker for home use.

review/text: Had it for 4 weeks making 1-3 cups per day. Works really well. I did not have to tweak the factory settings, they suit my taste perfectly. I use Lavazza beans in the machine and the taste is great. Easy to clean. I have to admit that the buttons and the finish overall seem cheap, but I care more about the quality of the coffee and THAT is wonderful. One more observation: i have seen the price of this machine bounce from under $400 to over $500 in 4 weeks on amazon.<br />Edit after 4 months: machine works flawlessly, easy to clean, I now adjusted the bean quantity and the result is immediate and predictable. Good buy.<br />Edit after 7 months: machine worked well until yesterday when it quit pulling in water. I tried everything to get the water into the unit but it just quit. Amazon will let me return it.

review/summary: 20000 shots and counting....
review/text: I don't usually leave reviews, but felt I should say something about this wonderful machine.  We bought the Vienna Deluxe in 2002, averaging about 6 cups of coffee a day between my wife and myself.  I understand the Vienna Deluxe and Plus are very similar, most importantly it shares the same brew group design and grinder.<br /><br />Its 9 years of service includes 4 years in a foreign country hooked to a 110/220 1500W transformer (on spotty voltage, I might add, based on occasional flickering/dimming of lights in the house), and surviving being shipped back and forth.  During the outgoing journey, the plastic water container broke, probably through rough handling of the box, but the Vienna itself was fine once we got the replacement water container.<br /><br />5 years in USA was using soft water, filtered through a reverse osmosis system.  4 years in a foreign country was hard tap water.  I don't believe I've descaled it more than 3 times ever.  I usually clean the brew group once every couple of months.  Yep, we're not good models of consistent maintenance, and it's a tribute to the Vienna that it has stood up to years of abuse without ever breaking down.<br /><br />We used a variety of beans, including oily Starbucks, Lavazza, Illy, Malabar Gold Espresso (my personal favourite) and a handful of other varieties, although recently we've largely been using the cheap Starbucks large packs at Costco.  We're not coffee fanatics, but do have pretty high expectations, and the Vienna does not disappoint.  However, coffee is a personal taste, and your mileage will probably vary.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it depends on what you're looking for.  If you want pretty designs with shiny stainless steel, you'll have to pay more, and not necessarily for better coffee or better reliability.  Avoiding complex electronics and touchscreens in a damp environment sounds like a smart thing for me.  I like simple, reliable designs that performs consistently, and would look for another Vienna when mine eventually dies.<br /><br />About the only thing that I wish for, is an alternate way to feed in a different coffee powder so we can occasionally have some variety.

review/summary: Fantastic for the $$
review/text: This is my first super automatic machine, after two Saeco automatic espresso machines. The build quality of this machine isn't great--it is a big hunk of plastic. But that helps keep the price down to a rational level and it is a trade I'm willing to make. Care and maintenance is easy but important to do--I suspect that most folks who have issues are letting that slide. The quality of the coffee is quite good and it is very easy to make everything from a ristretto to a lungo or americano. It may take a few days to get the adjustments set correctly for your tastes--but it isn't difficult to do. Steaming is simple once you understand that after steaming you need to turn off the steam button and release the pressure before making coffee again. the machine heats up very quickly and is ready within a minute or so from powering on. The only real negative is the water reservoir capacity is a little on the small side and you will fill it often. The bean capacity on the other hand is quite large. If you drink lots of coffee or regularly frequent espresso shops this machine may save you money over time as it clearly costs less to make at home vs a shop and we don't throw out any leftover pots of coffee anymore. Overall the machine is a good value and Saeco is a respected name in Italian espresso manufacturers. I don't expect it to last forever, the plastic structure will prevent that. If I get three years of use from it I will consider myself money ahead.

My husband was able to snap it pretty much back in to place.  But the door was loose, and the panarello was loose and flimsy.  I made some espresso and cappuccino with it, and it turned out OK. But I'm returning it because I just can't live with the build quality. I'm really surprised that no one mentioned the build quality in the reviews I read.  It was much lower quality than the previous Saeco Incanto Rondo that it was replacing, which gave me years of good service.  I'm going to try another brand. I ordered a DeLonghi ESAM 3300 Magnifica instead.  I'll see how that one does.

review/summary: Pretty Darn Good Machine for a Hunk of (mostly) Plastic
review/text: This machine was recommended to me by a former employee of Starbucks, who said that for a mid-range machine it simply cannot be beat.  To be frank, I owned a Rancilio Silvia when I did my Master's degree, all 3 years of it in fact.  The Rancilio was great, but it took real finesse and way too long to make quality drinks.  This machine, with the right settings for you, will churn out quality cappuccinos in less than 5 minutes.  I should add however, as a caveat, that it makes better lattes than cappuccinos.  I've had the Saeco for 3 weeks now and it works amazingly well.  Every morning I wake up, turn it on, grab a mug, get dressed, go back to the kitchen, hit brew and I have a perfect double shot of espresso in about 1.30 minutes.  It takes another 2 minutes to steam the milk.  All in all not a bad machine for a busy full-time PhD student! If it's fast enough and makes espresso well enough for me, it should for anybody.  Also, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! If you don't, I have a suspicion based on the one time I didn't and it got weird quickly, you can avoid any problems.  Finally, don't forget to descale the machine every month or so if you're a heavy user.  So, go out, grab yourself a Saeco Vienna, call up your math. friends and get rocking & rolling! Espressos and biscottis for all!

review/summary: Great little machine except for the steaming wand!
review/text: I bought this as a treat for my business partner and me because we were always leaving the office and spending lots of "our bucks" and Starbucks! When I initially set it up, I found it very easy to figure out and was especially pleased with the quality of the shots that were coming out. Nice rich crema and very hot! Of course the flavor is all in the coffee you buy. You can put to large coffee cups underneath to brew to cups at once which is nice.  I also love that you can adjust the grind and amount of coffee per shot. Sometimes you want it strong, sometimes just a regular cup of coffee strength is nice too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that you can't change out the coffee beans once you fill the grinder. Not a big deal but it would have been an option I would have chosen in a machine if I had known. I'm also not that thrilled with the plastic build. I know it's hard to find things that aren't made of plastic at a good price, but this one is just a little too "plasticky" in it's appearance.<br /><br />Now the big gripe - the steaming wand! It worked pretty well, although it seemed to take about a minute to froth a pitcher of milk. When I took it off to clean it thoroughly, it never quite fit right again and would constantly pop off mid-steam. I would adjust it it and adjust it but to no avail, it would keep popping off.  I found an OEM replacement for it here - [...] and now it works like A DREAM! Consistently frothy milk in less than 30 seconds! I don't know why they didn't make this the wand that is included, but it made the difference between almost sending this thing back to bragging about it to everyone I know! If you already own this machine, definitely spend the 18 bucks to buy the new wand and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />In conclusion, I bought this espresso machine because of the price point. Amazon had the best price I could find! I don't think I would buy this one again, but I would definitely buy a Saeco. After much research, people are always pleased with Saeco and I would have to say, other than that pesky wand, I am pleased with this machine's ability to perform daily and consistently offering up rich espresso with great crema. Next time, I would buy one that allowed me to switch out the coffee and perhaps one that was a little more attractive.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Very fast and easy to use once you learn how.  More importantly, excellent espressos and cappuccinos.  Very easy set up and clean up.  Has me drinking way too many cappuccinos these days.  My only criticizm is the user manual is awful, particularly explaining the dose and grind features.  If you set the dose too high and the grind too fine, it reduces the brewing to a very slow drip.  It took me a while to get this set right, as I prefer strong coffee.  The double dose feature also causes problems with brewing (very slow).  The user manual doesn't explain this at all.  Having said this, I was able to figure it out although I used about a pound of beans getting it set for my taste.  If it weren't for this I would have given it five stars.  Overall, I love this machine.

review/summary: Works well
review/text: I've used a Jura Capresso at work for the last year and loved the coffee that it makes.  I'm not a milk-in-my-coffee guy so don't have a need for the steam wand but the coffee this makes is superior to any drip machine I've tried.  I especially like the fact that you can get a single cup and don't have to pay the high price per cup for the k-cups or similar.  In addition, the grounds are compostable and the coffee is much better.<br /><br />Machine works well, reheats for the 2nd cup almost instantly.

review/summary: A great product
review/text: I bought this unit as an upgrade a month ago, to replace my manual Breville machine. From the get go this machine performed very well. In the short time between my Brevilles design, purchase and my subsequent use, the tech has come a long way to "more affordable." this machine is great for those who don't want to have to do all the work and have an extra grinder appliance on the side.<br />This machine pulls great shots, with a fully adjustable grind and volume controls to tweak the shots to your preference. On a whole the machine is quite easy to control and seems to require very little upkeep at present.<br />You'll read that the unit can seem to have a cheap feel due to the use of plastic just about everywhere, and this is true. It's the trade off I think for getting such a good unit for such a low cost. I recommend this unit for anyone looking to upgrade that has some cash but don't feel like breaking the bank.

review/summary: Saeco
review/text: Drip coffee was not getting the job done for us. We had a Saeco Incanto Deluxe previously and after several weeks of research, friends testimony and demonstrations we selected a Saeco Vienna Plus. This machine offers some of the advantages of higher end machines at a very affordable price. The only addition we desired was a dual boiler (one for coffee and one for steam)but price was a factor. Now that we have used it for a few weeks the double boiler would be nice, but the time hassle of going from steam to coffee is not as bad as we thought. This machine, with Lavazza Super Crema beans, makes great coffee. We have the grind on number 7 (finer) and the strenth to about 3/4 of Max.<br />Minor negatives - the front cover is very 'plastic' but works fine and the water tank is only just big enough and would be a hassle at a big dinner party. Apart from that we love this machine. Cleaning is easy, the bean hopper is large and accessable, the drip tray holds a lot. The machine is reasonably quiet. Saeco make the best steamer wands in the business so perfect milk every time. Overall - Just get one!

review/summary: Automatic isn't synonymous for great.
review/text: We had a manual Saeco (Starbucks Barista) espresso maker for many years and decided to give one of these automatic machines a try. After about 10 days of fiddling with grind, amount of coffee ground, and amount of water we have reached what is probably the best this machine can do. While it's true that this machine is much easier and less messy to deal with than our old machine it does not make nearly as rich and wonderful a cup of espresso. That being the desired goal of any espresso maker I can only give it 2 1/2 stars. I gave it 3 because 2 1/2 wasn't a choice. I hope this helps anyone who is thinking of ditching their old manual machine for a new automatic one.

review/summary: Completely inconsistent
review/text: As a child and even as a younger adult I remember being bewildered at how much time, effort and frustration my parents wasted on various coffee and cappuccino machines.  They always seemed to spending inordinate amounts of money on what seemed to me to be a bad and unrewarding habit.  What more, it seemed that the more money they spent on a device, the more often it broke.  This seemed even crazier to me as the $20 coffee mate worked fine - for 10 years.  and there was no discernible difference in taste.<br /><br />Then I had kids.  Everything changed.  I don't want to drink cokes anymore and i can't drink swill coffee.  I like the good stuff.  I now understand why people will pay upwards of a thousand dollars for a good coffee machine.  It's crazy, but I understand.<br /><br />So - we bought this $500 coffee maker & nothing has changed w/ the passing of the torch i guess.  It has been nothing but a headache.<br /><br />When this machine works, I love it.  The coffee is good - the lattes are very good.  I like the footprint.  Use is simple.  The problem is it is completely inconsistent.<br /><br />I turn it on.<br />The hopper is full.<br />The water is full.<br />The grind filter is empty.<br />the drip tray is clean.<br />the brew group is clean.<br />the device is primed.<br />I press the coffee button.<br /><br />Scenario A:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip - red light.<br />I push it again, perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Scenario B:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip -  red light<br />I push it again, no coffee<br /><br />Scenario C:<br />Grind grind grind - No drip, Red light<br /><br />Scenario D:<br />Consistent cups of coffee, first time.<br /><br />Scenario D never happens.  The rest happen about equally.<br /><br />I simply can not figure out what i am doing wrong.  I do the same thing three times and it behaves three different ways depending on its mood i guess. I feel like a lab rat trying to pull a lever for my food pellet.

review/summary: Necessary compromises
review/text: Convenience is probably the best feature of this machine but a machine that heats, grinds, steams, packs and pumps is bound to compromise somewhere and this machine is no exception.  The Vienna Plus will not pump coffee at the finer grind settings.  On the other hand, coffee at the factory setting is not bad.<br />I drink my coffee black which means that the taste is not obscured by milk, froth, or spices.  But coffee straight from the Vienna Plus is muddy, foamy, and poorly filtered. Since I like the speed with which a cup can be produced on this machine I pour it through a chemex paper filter and lo! poor coffee<br />is transformed into something quite good! It's not quite as good as chemex coffee made manually but it's in the ball park and it is much more quickly produced.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the plastic housing of the Vienna Plus but I suppose a solid metal housing would cost far more.  A more serious complaint is the plastic interior. The water may be heated in stainless steel but it is poured through a plastic brew group and hot water processed through plastic is likely to release small amounts of toxins into the coffee.

review/text: It was very good while it worked. We have had our Saeco automatic expresso maker for three years now.  When it arrived we thought it looked awfully flimsy for a $600 machine. We were right. After the first year, knobs and buttons started falling off, and month by month after that the tolerences opened up, and the whole thing fell apart. You could hear it creeking and groaning ever more loudly as it did so. Finally, after three years, it's dead.  You get what you pay for: in this case you'll pay $500+ for great expresso/coffee for three years.

review/summary: So far, so good and love the coffee
review/text: We purchased this as a reconditioned unit at a much lower price than brand new. So far we have been very happy with the end result. Our coffee is frothy, foamy and delicious. We don't like super strong espresso-type coffee but love the convenience of grinding and brewing one cup at a time. We've figured out how to adjust the grind so the flavor is not so strong. This method of brewing one cup at a time is so much more environmentally-correct than the pod-type coffee makers. What the heck do you do with all those leftover plastic pods? This machine grinds the beans, compresses them and then forces the water through the compressed puck of ground coffee. Great taste and then just throw out the coffee puck. There is a bit of labor intensive cleaning, however. It needs to be kept free from clogs and oily build-up. It comes apart and cleans easily so it hasn't been a problem. We are very happy with our purchase and hope it lasts for many years to come.

The grind and volume settings for the beans allows you to fine tune the strength of flavor in the brew and the steam/water wand works well to make americanos and latte's.<br /><br />Easy to clean with removable drip tray and 'grind bucket'. Only improvement is the used grind bucket could be a little larger - we have to empty it out multiple times per day (the bucket holds about 25-30 runs worth of grinds).<br /><br />Great for the money, been very reliable for us thus far.

review/text: The Saeco machine gives my wife and I that perfect cup of coffee brewed from freshly ground beans, at whatever time we want and in whatever quantity from 1/4 to full cup.  And, we don't have to leave home to get it!  The strength of each brew can be adjusted with the turn of a knob.  The machine is light weight and setting it up is easy.  The Saeco is easy to clean and has a nice upscale look on the kitchen counter.  Each individual cup is quickly made with the push of a button which provides a fresh hot cup rather than a pour from a pot that has been sitting on a warming plate.  There are no pods to open and change out each time, either.  We just bought another machine for my office!

review/summary: great espresso at home
review/text: This is a great espresso machine.  It is so nice to drink a smooth cup of espresso with the perfect crema on top.  It took some getting used to drinking espresso that was not bitter.  I have been using a stovetop espresso maker for 13-14 years.  The difference between correctly made espresso is like night and day.  My taste buds were accustomed to drinking bitter espresso at home.  Now, I am spoiled with this smooth and perfectly-made espresso.  So good, I even drink it without my usual spot of cream and sugar.  Another bonus, is the panarello steam wand.  My kids really enjoy it when I steam a cup of milk for them and then add hot chocolate mix to it.  THey get a kick out of how good the hot chocolate is.  I highly recommend this product.  You could pay more to get a machine built with an exterior of stainless steel, but why bother?  This machine's exterior of plastic is fairly sleek, high-tech looking, and handsome.  It looks good on the counter top.  Before you make yourself an espresso, remember to pour some steaming water into your espresso cup to warm it up.  I find that my espresso cups are on the cool side and tend to make my espressos turn cold rather quickly.  Go ahead and  splurge, this makes a great gift!

review/summary: Simple, but Wonderful!
review/text: I am just getting into making my own Mocha/Latte's and this machine was perfect for me. The instructions that came with the machine were not very detailed, but I watched some YouTube videos and learned how to froth in no time! Machine is easy to clean. We have soft water so I think that helps with the frothing. Sometimes the wand will get plugged, but if you take off the end and dip it in a little water and let steam out it seems to clear in no time.

review/summary: Great Coffee and Warranty, but...
review/text: Bought our unit in January, 2011 and made delicious lattes for a few weeks until we had to call Saeco Customer Service for help. Our  machine leaked leaving water on the counter after every use. The knowledgable rep talked me through several checks before asking I return the unit for a repalcement. It was at this point I learned the unit purchased through a Amazon retailer had a serial# showing it had been originally  purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Our new unit arrived a week later. After three weeks it stopped working. Seems the heating unit had gone out. I made sure I contacted the same Customer Service rep who promptly - - in only two days - - replaced the unit.<br /><br />We love the coffee our Saeco makes and hope we just caught a couple of lemons. I can attest they stand behind their product and hope my new unit keeps delivering without future problems.<br /><br />We've had our unit for eighteen months now and have had to replace the on/off button multiple times. Gets less use than the other buttons but because of an obvious design flaw just comes apart. In January we bought multiple buttons from parts department. Good thing... last button lasted about three months.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I bought this as a very special Christmas gift for my parents.  My father had seen a similar model in action visiting friends and went on and on about it.  Imagine how excited I was to find it here for less than half the price I could buy it in Canada!!!  I was very excited to give it to them and hoped it lived up to the hype.  It totally did.  They LOVE it.  They have coffee all the time now.  It's very easy to use, clean and makes consistently excellent coffee with plenty of crema.  I expected to see crema on espresso shots, but I'm talking a good head of it on a cup of coffee.  It's so amazing that my dad now makes a coffee for my mom at the first sound of her moving in bed in the morning, which he has never, ever done in the past.  It totally lived up to all the hype and is well worth the money.  Couldn't be happier!

review/text: My old Digital Italia Saeco/Starbucks gave up the ghost after 6+ years. I was looking for a replacement and was very interested in this machine, seemed to good to be true. I've had the unit for a couple of days and can tell you, this is the best value on the market. The quality of the espresso is astounding, especially when you consider the reasonable price of the machine. While others may look at the plastic and complain, the proof is in the product. Simple, well designed and the most amazing value I've encountered in espresso. WAY RECOMMENDED!!!!

review/summary: disappointing for the money
review/text: OurSpydem Digital Plus died after 8 yrs and 6500 cups of coffee - a great machine.  We bought the Saeco because it was priced in our comfort level, and we assumed it was the closest to the Spydem that died.  The Saeco makes an OK cup of coffee, however for the money it is really stripped of features we were used to. For example -no dreg drawer warning, no empty water warning, even though the manual says its there. Also no energy saving mode. Single boiler, and of course a lot of plastic. It seems all these machines are quite expensive for some reason - probably largely because they're built in Italy. Hopefully someone in the far East will catch on to the money that could be made if they were to start building these machines, and we could all be paying $300 for them.<br /><br />Added 8/12/12 - we've had the machine for about 2 years now and it has been very disappointing.  Makes an OK cappuccino, but not hot enough.  In spite of being cleaned regularly it has been temperamental, stopping in mid cycle and freezing.  Takes numerous restarts and disassemblies to get it working again.  The problem is getting worse, now it's occurring on an almost daily basis.  This is a piece of junk - spend the money and get something decent - it will be cheaper in the long run.

review/summary: Great espresso maker
review/text: I received this espresso maker as a gift from my husband and it's pretty awesome.  I'd asked for an espresso maker and was expecting a manual machine but my husband wouldn't hear of it.  He did his research and decided on this model - primarily because an older Italian gentleman that he works with raved about it (and Italians know their espresso).  I was a bit leery when I learned how much this cost, but after having it for a few months it's absolutely worth it.<br /><br />When it arrived in the mail I was intimidated - but the setup was easy and within minutes (literally) we were making espresso shots and taste testing the various settings to see which one we preferred.  As one reviewer noted - the machine is plastic and doesn't expensive, in fact some of the parts feel like they're going to fall off if you pull too hard, but despite that, it's a sturdy machine.<br /><br />My only gripe with this product is the design of the bean loading area - it only holds about 1/4 lb of beans and sometimes the beans don't slide down to the grinder so you have to stick your hand in there and move them around so they slide into the grind area (but that only happens occasionally and shouldn't deter anyone from purchasing this model).<br /><br />When you consider that a large latte at Starbucks costs around $5 (and I was drinking at least 3 or 4 of those a week) - we'll have recouped our money on this within the year!  What a steal! :)

My only complaint would be that they are a tad expensive, since there's only 6 in a package, but I do understand the expense, and I did feel it was worth the money. We ran out quickly, so if we do a "Full Irish" again next St. Patrick's day, I'll probably be doubling my order, but I definitely would order again.

review/text: I bought these as my boyfriend took a trip to Ireland as a teen and remembers the rashers fondly.  For his birthday I am doing a surprise breakfast party including some of his favorite treats.  Rashers are hard to find in the US even though I live in a larger city with multiple European markets none had these.<br /><br />I ordered these on a Thursday and got them Wednesday the next week.  All the dry ice was gone but they were still cold but not frozen.  I would recommend ordering them on a Monday but they were still good!<br /><br />The meat is awesome.  I would say each package would comfortably feed 2-3 people (2 would be best  They are delicious!  Fry them in a pan until browned but not crispy all over like US bacon.  Also since the shipping is the pricey part I would recommend ordering as many as you can afford at one time and freezing them.  The shipping doesn't increase significantly for multiple packages.  I bought 5 on my first order.

review/summary: BUYER BE WARY
review/text: This is for one (1) yes 1 bottle of this nice product. I am very familiar with this product and knew I would like the actual product. When I reviewed possible sellers and saw this price I thought this must be for a case of the product based on the price. When I was unable to find any quantity in the description, I assumed (I understand I take some responsibility) based on the noted ($0.06 / oz) beside the price after a little basic math I would receive approximately 360 ounces. Instead I received one 17 ounce bottle!! Again using my basic math skills, I was able to calculate the approximate per ounce value to be closer to $1.27/oz. a far cry from the .06/oz noted in the description. Of course based on the "list price" of $58.52 it would be $3.44/oz (thankfully i did not pay list). I have learned a lesson to make sure I verify the actual quantity. Thankfully this was not a terribly expensive lesson and makes me smile as I eat my chicken wing knowing the sauce cost more than then chicken I'm putting it on. I just consider it "gourmet" wings and it makes me feel better.

review/summary: Excellent healthy food for your dog!
review/text: My Shih Tzus absolutely inhale this! After I research and read the star ratings on all the major brands on the market, I was appalled! Here I thought I was doing right by my pups.. Wrong! Nothing but by products, crappy fillers and additives and perseratives.. On the website all were rated "1 star" out of 6! I had been running back and forth to the vet $$$'s because of allergies, about to chew their feet off and itching. Found out majority of dogs are allergic to corn and wheat and soy, alot allergic to chicken also. So on the hunt I went.. After researching I found Wellness and Blue Buffalo, they are rated 5 and 6 stars depending on what you chose. all their meat is hormone and steroid free, "fit for human consumption",no by products, no corn, wheat, soy, additives,artifical anything etc. I chose Wellness but Blue Buffalo is also great just a little more expensive but not by much. My pups have been on this canned lamb and on the Wellness supermix dry and I have to say after almost a month they are 100% better.. I will never again feed them major brand/mainstream food again. I couldnt believe purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science diet were all rated 1 star out of 6, makes you wonder huh.. It is all unhealthy crap! I also got rid of all there store bought biscuits and treats that are filled with the same crap. I purchased healthy treats for them made just like their dog food and I feel so much better and relieved to know I am doing right by my pups..

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is expensive in my opinion. I hope more people buy it, so maybe the price will go down.  But it's an investment in my health, so I don't feel too bad about the expense.  Amazon makes it quite easy by delivering it by the case.

review/summary: Excellent NATURAL zero calorie tea drink
review/text: This is my absolute favorite drink right now. It's very hard to find in stores ( I found it at Whole Foods)<br />I was on a low carb candida diet and having a hard time finding a drink that didn't taste nasty. Stevia can be a little strong in drinks. This tea uses a combitnation of erythritol ( another natural sweetener) and stevia to balance the sweetness. I prefer the peach mango over the raspberry. Both are good options if you are looking for a no calorie healthy alternative to diet drinks.

review/summary: Chalky aftertaste
review/text: I'm a really big fan of the regular Peach Steaz, but the zero calorie version has this really strange aftertaste.  It's sweetened with "natural erythritol," which isn't as bad as most sweeteners, but it does give it a really chalky taste that is almost overpowering.  It's drinkable, it's more on the good side than bad, but I'd rather just drink the regular Steaz Peach which is 5-stars for me.

review/summary: WOOHOO!  These are so great for baby AND me!
review/text: I actually usually use the Plum Organics baby food brand, b/c those have veggies in them.  But these ones are great too.  My 12 month old just sucks the food out through the top, and doesn't spill any.  He actually eats about 3 ounces of food, while walking around the house, in about 3 minutes.  Ok, not the safest while walking, but when you are rushing out the door to play, or work, and baby hasn't eaten, it saves you about 20 minutes, and he loves it. He feels like such a big boy feeding himself, and I am happy too, he's eating a healthy breakfast.  If the sold the plum organics ones on here in bulk like this I'd be all over them.<br />These ones are actually meant for any age, just like apple sauce in a pouch, so my toddler can eat them too.  Yes!!!!!

review/summary: Excellent snack at home or on the go
review/text: We are addicted to these and always have a stash in the house. This (and other flavors) have become our go-to snack. I like them because both my four year old and 16 month old can feed themselves without the mess, so it's perfect for when we are out or on travel. In addition, all this is is pureed fruit - no added sugars, no preservatives, nothing. It's a snack I am happy to give to my kids. We take them everywhere - in the car, to the beach, to the zoo, sometimes I pack them in my son's lunch for school, etc. And they're a great snack for the parents as well... We will continue to purchase these for years I am sure.

review/summary: Squeezeable Fruit
review/text: I love Revolution Foods!  What a great snack for kids.  My 15 month old daughter can suck the fruit out of the pouch with no problem, I just make sure she doesn't squeeze it then it goes all over.  The best part is the only ingredients are fruit!

review/summary: So good
review/text: I love these things.  My daughter loves them too.  So instead of giving her a juice box full of sugar, I give her one of these.  At target (which is the only place I can find them in my area) they are $4 a box but I can only find one or two boxes each time I go.  And I'd rather buy them in bulk and with free shipping you can't lose.

review/summary: Good!
review/text: I think the flavor is great and it is great for little kids...but I was dissapointed in the lack of texture.  It was a bit too much like baby food for me.  I was hoping for a good, healthy snack and while it would be perfect for me health wise, I was hoping for something a little thicker, like applesauce!  My kids are eating them up, though.
