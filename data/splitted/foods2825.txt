review/summary: The best coconut water
review/text: There are other brands of coconut water available but ZICO has the best taste by far.  I'm not sure why this is because all the other brands claim to be "pure coconut water" but they are not as refreshing as ZICO coconut water.  I wish ZICO was more readily available locally.  My BJ's club was carrying the natural flavor (which I favor) on a trial basis but now it has sold out and not available......how does that work?  They have a product which sells out because people like it and they don't reorder?????  My advice? Buy ZICO brand coconut water on the internet.

review/text: There's absolutely nothing bad to say about ZICO in the new bottle.  It's a win-win.  It's super healthy, super delicious, convenient, and portable.  And it's environmentally friendly in at least 2 ways - the bottle and cap are recyclable, and we're not paying to ship water across the ocean!!  We have got to move in this direction for the health of the planet.  YOU have got to move in this direction for the health of your bod!!

review/text: The new natural is my new favorite and I love the bottles!  I can't believe it took them so long to get it out.  I'm still a slave to the Tetra Packs and love the good, old flavors, but it's great to have options and portability.<br /><br />The flavor tastes more like what you would expect coconut water to taste like. It's a bit nuttier and very different from the Brazilian coconut.  So many choices and options!  Keep up the good work, Zico!

review/summary: I heart this stuff_and it HAS to be ZICO.
review/text: After living in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and a native of California - I've seriously become addicted to coconut water.  Hydration, Nutrition, Refreshment and Taste.<br /><br />Hydration and Nutrition - working as a dive instructor in the Gulf of Thailand, often times travelers would show up in not so fresh of a state from the night before. My go-to was always to make them drink coconut water. Natural electrolytes!<br /><br />Refreshment and Taste - not only is this stuff good for you, it tastes awesome. Feels like water and tastes like fresh sweetness but without that gross syrupy fake flavor.<br /><br />With so many brands out there trying to sell me the magic water in the bottle, it's hard to figure out which company is the real deal. I like ZICO for one main reason:<br /><br />- 100% natural COCONUT WATER.  That's it. Some other brands out there are actually "coconut juice" and contain sugar, preservatives and even stuff like sodium metabisulfite...huh? I have a bottle from another company and it's been in my fridge for like weeks.<br /><br />ZICO's ingredient: 100% coconut water. :) Nice job ZICO.<br /><br />And I like the packaging.  The blue with beach picture reminds me of far off places while sitting in my office.

review/text: I started hearing about coconut water several years ago, but it generally struck me as dirty dish water when I would try to drink it. Then Zico came along. I've been a Zico convert now for about four months, and I can literally feel the difference this product makes in my body chemistry. There are indeed other coconut water products out there that are similar, but Zico hits the sweet spot with price, size, and quality of product.

review/summary: from concentrate! tastes horrible! yuck!
review/text: I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!<br />I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see "premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors."<br />I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?<br />The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?

review/summary: Delicious, yet too high in sugar
review/text: This is probably one of the best flavored coconut waters out there.  It tastes like skinny chocolate milk.  If you are concerned about the level of sugar, though, you should stay away.  It is has 18 grams per serving whereas most plain only has about 12. Although, if you drink it before or after a grueling Bikram practice, I think you deserve a little extra sugar.

review/summary: Far from "natural"
review/text: This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.<br /><br />First off, this is "from concentrate". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.<br /><br />Second, they add "natural flavors". There is nothing "natural" about a "natural flavor". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it "natural".

review/summary: Satisfied
review/text: I guess I started drinking this water after they changed something, because I think Zico is great. A lot of the reviews on here claim they changed the formula which affected the taste, which is definitely possible, but I started drinking the water in July of 2010. I have an auto-subscription on Amazon buying two cases a month and I drink them all before my next batch arrives. I'd love to taste the old formula, one reviewer claimed Zico was putting the original Brazilian coconut water back on the market, but that was back in September. I will continue to buy the bottled version of Zico until I am convinced there is a better product. If you know of the new formula please comment on this review. I am very satisfied with the taste of "Natural" flavored Zico water. I do not care for the Pineapple or Chocolate versions. I have not tried the others.

It is from concentrate, yes...it does include coconuts from more than just Brazil, yes...it does kinda taste like milk at the bottom of your cereal bowl - Yes! I love it! I know that it tastes a little different from the Zico U get in the tetra pak, so maybe they should change the name of it - still a great beverage! I have it set to autoship monthly! Yummy...<br />I also like O.N.E. coconut water - the flavored ones are good, the plain natural flavor is still my best from them.<br />I also like Zico in Passion Fruit & I also like the natural Zico in the tetra pak.<br />No, I don't work for Zico!

review/summary: Absolutely loving this!!
review/text: I've always been a loyal ZICO coconut water fan, and so was extremely excited to hear about the new packaging...and I have to say that I was MORE than pleased! The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go.<br /><br />The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too!<br /><br />The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials.<br /><br />Two thumbs up on the new packaging and the new taste profile!! Now only if they came out with more flavors...

Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead.

review/summary: It's pretty good... for concentrate.
review/text: Ingredients say coconut water from concentrate and natural flavor, not sure why the flavor is needed, but tastes almost nutty or toasted, probably from the heat process used to concentrate the juice. I like enough to drink it, but may decide to change brands. I ordered it because it was about half as much as it was at Whole Foods Market.

review/summary: No more leg cramps on the bike!
review/text: Actually, it's my husband who uses this; he's an avid cyclist (at age 68) and subject to leg cramps during and after a tough ride.  He had tried the usual "sport drinks", but still got the cramps.  He heard about coconut water and wanted to try it, and picked up a bottle or two here and there of the various brands and liked Zico best.  I was given a coupon at another store that had it, so I ordered 2 cases.  He made short work of them (the weather was better then) and they made short work of the cramps, but I couldn't find it again at that same store.  Amazon to the rescue!<br /><br />This stuff really works for the cramp-prone, but people differ as to which one tastes best.  My husband likes this one.<br /><br />10/03/11:  Zico has recently brought out a chocolate flavor, which is so yummy even I like it.  My husband rode the last 3 days of the B.R.A.T. (Bicycle Ride Across Tennessee) and had cramps the first night, but realized that he had not kept himself well hydrated, fixed that, and completed the remaining two days without incident.  He's now 69 and rides a few thousand miles per year.

review/text: Rcv'd on 20/Nov/06 product w expiry date of 23/Jan/07. Two months is a shorter shelf life than I'd have liked. Is this the nature of the product? Or does AMZN have a slightly older stock than what would be available in retail channels like Costco? I'd appreciate if someone might please inform on the subject. ?<br /><br />.....<br />PS. Cannot really max the stars mainly because the price is to me rather high for a beverage product, albeit an exotic. And anyway too, have not acquired yet a taste for this product. Just as y'all warned. It def ain't a love-at-first-sip.

review/summary: good hydration for stomach flu
review/text: My first time trying coconut water happened when a good friend had a stomach flu and need effective hydration. I went to the local coffee shop and it was among the few drinks they had on hand, and the label stated that it was excellent as a sports drink alternative and for hydration generally. We tried it, and it not only worked, but it tasted great. Since then, I've tried the major brands, and zico is the best tasting of the lot.

review/summary: Still Amazing!!!
review/text: I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.

review/summary: Cheapest for a reason
review/text: I prefer coconut water to Gatorade or other sports drinks for re-hydration; in addition to being natural, they are packed with electrolytes and their taste is no better, no worse.<br /><br />Zico, however, is form concentrate.  Calling their product 'Pure Premium' seems very misleading when other products are actually pure and this one has been modified. If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One.

review/summary: Finally!! Zico is my Hero! =)
review/text: Finally Zico put my favorite coconut water in a resealable and recyclable bottle! And the flavors are awesome!<br /><br />If you haven't tried coconut water before start with Zico, it tastes like the real deal.<br /><br />I've been trying to cut out refined sugar but drinking water only got boring and didn't do the trick after hard workouts and runs. I did some research and learned a few of the many benefits of coconut water-- tons of electrolytes, potassium, low acidity, etc. and Zico is hands down my favorite. Its really refreshing and more hydrating than Gatorade (which my kids even my kids have abandoned for Zico!) I've tried some other brands but Zico blows them out of the water, literally!<br /><br />I've told all of my spinning students about it and they agree that Zico is the best one out there because of its great taste and now its even better because its in a bottle! We try to recycle as much as we can but Ohio doesn't have centers that can take the old packaging but luckily the new Zico bottle is made from a #2 plastic - which is the same as the milk jugs you can recycle anywhere.

review/text: I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink. There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable.<br /><br />Amazon was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it.

review/text: I love the new ZICO in the bottle!! The natural is my fave!!  It is a bit nuttier than the Tetra ZICO.  The bottle makes it so much easier to take to the gym, on my bike or throw in my backpack. Plus I love that I can reseal it and don't have to drink it all at once (although once it is opened, I have a hard time NOT finishing it!!).  My kids love the new flavors since they are sweeter and I love that they drink it since it is so much healthier for them than most other beverages on the market.  Thank you ZICO!!

review/text: Mark Rampolla introduced Zico in 2004 after discovering coconut water as a Peace Corp volunteer in Central America; it has been catching on ever since.  Why because it is great tasting; but most importantly it is great for you.  It contains more potassium than one banana and only contains 60 calories.<br /><br />Potassium is key and it has 15 times more than sports drinks;  as those of us who have problems with muscle cramping are relieved to know.  I think it is probably the  best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.<br /><br />I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors.  All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.<br /><br />I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water.  It also contains a healthy complement of phosphorous, magnesium and calcium with even a gram of protein.<br /><br />Enjoy this drink experience after exercising and you will never feel faint and/or dehydrated again.<br /><br />Bentley/2009

review/summary: I hate coconuts, but I love this!
review/text: I'm not one to write reviews, only when I love / hate the product and for one thing, I HATE coconuts. However, I first tried the passion fruit flavored Zico and thought, this doesn't taste like coconuts at all! I loved the taste and soon got addicted to how good I felt post workouts. I tried the other mango flavor, and liked it too, so thought I'd venture to the natural coconut one. To my surprise, it wasn't what I remembered coconuts tasted like, in fact, it was more refreshing than the other flavors!<br />I love the new bottle Zico has come out with, it makes drinking and cooling Zico so much easier. The Lime and Pomberry additions are amazing! The bottles make traveling with it easier, and now, I don't have to drink in one sitting.<br />Best time to drink a Zico though is after a hard night of partying. I don't know what it is, but after a night of drinking, I always reach for a Zico and the next morning, its as if nothing happened the night before. I'm a firm believer in the natural remedies of coconuts now, post workout, post drinking, post anything where you exert energy. I still won't eat a real coconut, but I will drink a Zico. I've tried the other brands out there and cannot stomach it, but for some reason, love Zico.

review/text: So the first time that I had coconut water was in college.  It all started with a cold tetra pack of vita coco and I have been hooked ever since.  Vita coco is clearly a superior product as it is 100% with no concentrates; although, Zico I would put on the same scale.  It does not taste like 100% coconut water nor does it taste like plastic.  It tastes like coconut water from concentrate and I do not mean that in  a bad way.  You just have to take risks in life, check out a case when they are on sale (around $11) and give this product a try!  It is a little different but the change is nice!

review/text: After trying Zico in a Walgreens in downtown Chicago, I've been hooked!  I love the taste of it, it is unbeatable and really quenches thirst. The other reviews I read say that it tastes plasticy, but I have never thought so.  I doesn't taste like plastic at all and it's much more convenient then the Terapack. I tried Vita Coco when I had a coconut water craving (because I couldn't find Zico) and almost puked! Vita Coco smelled like fermented lactose mixed with the scent of Original Chapstick and if someone handed it to me in a blank glass, I would have NEVER identified it as coconut water. I threw it out as soon as I got off the subway.<br /><br />Vita Coco is horrible! Zico Coconut water is AMAZING and is far better than Vito Coco!

review/summary: Weird salty/sour flavor
review/text: I love coconut juice but I don't love this. I should also mention that I love pina coladas too. Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice, I thought there would be some parallels.<br />First of all, this drink has a strange salty flavor. Secondly, it's not sweet. It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y, but the flavors just don't coordinate with each other and don't match the smell.

review/summary: This is coconut "water" not "juice".
review/text: I misread the label.  I was looking for real juice - not some water-down passion fruit flavoring.  It's like buying fruit punch when you actually want fruit juice.  And this is expensive coconut water.

review/summary: Coconut water is coconut water, chocolate is chocolate.
review/text: I have been drinking Zico coconut water for sometime. One day I saw Zico Chocolate Coconut water. So gave it a try. well, to me it was chocolate drink but my expectation of a coconut water was not there.<br /><br />I threw rest of the bottle and kept my distance from this drink.<br /><br />Agreed that Zico coconut water is not the best coconut water but it is close enough to enjoy without any other ingredient in it and definitely not chocolate.

review/summary: Price is absurd.
review/text: This is the basically the cheapest form to buy any of the three popular coconut water. I did the math and to put the cost in retrospective it comes to $10 per 2 liters of this coconut water.<br />This may not register to some with no concept of themselves being ripped off. There are other things out there that are better quality and less expensive and more specific for what you are looking for. If your look for something to quench thirst I highly recommend Metromint water. If your looking for things for your natural lifestyle then find a fruit with more umph than coconut.

review/summary: Good Drink, But Too High In Sugar And Calories.
review/text: I noticed the Zico Coconut Water at my nearby grocery store and I tried a couple varieties of it. The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Greedy Dealer Cut My Coke
review/text: So, what happens when Coca-Cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste? It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.<br /><br />Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying "I told you so" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure...

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: I come from a tropical country, Malaysia, so I know how coconut water straight from the tree tastes. I missed the taste ever since coming Stateside 6 years ago, and so I bought a 6 pack of Zico.<br /><br />I gotta say, it's the closest thing to fresh coconut water I've tasted thus far. I heard that the liter bottles are from Thailand, while their Tetra bottles are from Brazil. Glad I bought the liter ones.<br /><br />In fact, right after writing this review, I'll be buying a dozen bottles.<br /><br />As for some people's comments on packaging issues, it says on the cardboard box NOT to lift the bottles by the cap. All six of mine came in perfect shape.

review/summary: Its Made From CONCENTRATE! Boo!
review/text: I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water, having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst.

review/summary: Tasty Stuff!
review/text: A friend recently introduced me to coconut water and it was a hard sell - In general, I don't like coconut at all.  While I was skeptical, I agreed to at least give it a try.  I first tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and found that it was pretty okay, if I drank it over ice.<br /><br />Then I started reading more about the hydrating benefits of coconut water as well as the similarity to components in breast milk.  Being pregnant just this moment, I decided any boost to my eventual milk production would be welcome.  So I tried this product and liked the flavor MUCH better than plain coconut water.  I highly recommend it to anyone as a healthful beverage and particularly to those women who are, like me, "in the family way."

If I had a coconut tree in my building than I wouldn't bother, but I don't! It is the best thing after a long workout or if you have forgotten to drink enough water during the day. It really saved me when I got really dehydrated. I recommend coconut water to everyone! And the light pineapple and citrus flavor is very nice. The original flavor is good too.

review/summary: Luv it...
review/text: This is a great product.  Although I'd initially planned to buy a single box to sample the product, I realized after reading previous reviews that coconut water was probably an acquired taste, so I bought a 12-pack just to see if I'd end up liking it.  At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.  I wish it were a little cheaper (thus only 4 stars) but otherwise I like the product just the way it is and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightly flavored alternative to sodas.

review/summary: I think they've changed this formula...
review/text: So I've tried the terrible tasting version of Zico Mango that a lot of folks are describing, but I think they've changed the formula because now it is delicious. Like others, I've gotten a little addicted to coconut water, not just for when I work out, but for this incredibly hot and long summer we've had here in Texas.<br />My mother and I work out together, and I decided to buy all the Zico flavors, thinking she'd especially like the Mango (which I reeeally did NOT like). So she tasted all of them, while giving me feedback (her least favorites being the Lima Citron and Natural bc she likes sweeter drinks than I). She said the Mango tasted more like coconut, which is not at all what I recalled. I tasted it, and I've got to say- this one is now my favorite. The mango flavor is subtle, the coconut flavor more pronounced.<br />I agree with previous reviewers. The old version is almost unpalatable (sickeningly sweet and pungent), and I could barely finish the bottle (actually it was in the cardboard/ paper container).<br />For those of you who've tried and disliked the Mango flavor, I'd suggest giving it another shot in a few weeks. Hopefully the old inventory will be gone, because this new flavor is delicious. Really delicious! I've bought a a couple cases on Amazon of the Chocolate Zico, but will continue to buy the Mango from my grocer bc I know its inventory is new.<br />Order of favorites? They are:<br /><br />Mango (new formula)<br />Chocolate; Pina Tropicale; Pineapple (like equally)<br />Lima Citron<br />Pomberry<br />Natural (tastes good in smoothies, though!)<br /><br />I've tried other versions- there's one brand with vitamins and quercetin... yuck! Then another with ginseng and gingko biloba (O.N.E., berry flavor) that was pretty good, but too energy drink- like. I'll continue to try other brands but not sure I really need too :)

The smart-paper carton packaging created less bulk waste than canned drinks, and nature's own engineering packs this fruit punch with five electrolytes, the most overtly critical of which is potassium. I didn't think I would like this product but bought it because I cannot quite manage the full-time taste for spring water and herbal tea my yoga regime suggests. VERY helpful for those weaning themselves off alcohol and conventional mystery soda-pop.

review/text: Had leaking from 4 of 6 containers.  the top caps seems to be weak part that it easily breaks.. amazon did refund the leaky ones.. but I won't order these..again..  Don't want to take another chance on leaks.. although these taste better than the plastic resealable ones at 11oz.

review/summary: Bad News! FYI! The only coconut water that is MADE FROM CONCENTRATE
review/text: I've tried C2O, Vitacoco, and Naked coconut water. All of them contain one ingredient:100% natural coconut water. However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added "Natural ingredients". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have "natural flavors" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises "30 percent less sugar"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add "natural flavors". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.

review/summary: Leaky Items
review/text: There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water.  There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking.  Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in.  I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.

review/summary: Container top problems
review/text: I love the product itself, but I do not like the container at all.<br />I have a garage with a large refridgerator in it, I fill it with<br />coconut water, so while working  around the yard, I get refreshed<br />with a cold drink . I opened the last case and the top looked funny,<br />but i poured a drink and took a drink , it tasted funny , not like the<br />others.later that day got real sick. Looking at the other tops, i saw<br />they were not in tack. and poured out the products in that case, as<br />they were all alike, (I have the 6 containers still and if I could send<br />them back I would for a refund.  I would not purchase this type of container<br />again.

review/summary: Fake.
review/text: This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....<br /><br />Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified "natural flavor" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.

review/summary: Potassium Explosion!  Cholesteral Marvel!
review/text: I used to not like Coconut water.  When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.  Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.  If I could afford it, I would only need this one drink for life and I'd be happy.

review/summary: As good as the other ones that I also gave 5 stars
review/text: Zico is very good, but not better than the other ones I gave 5 stars.  I've tried 5 brands: "Zico","Real Coconut Water", "O.N.E", "Coco Libre" and "Vita Coco". 5 stars to the 4 first names and 4 stars to "Vita Coco". The first ones taste equally great, so, just compare the prices! "Vita Coco" is less sweet and doesn't taste as good; but it's usually much cheaper, and not bad at all!!!

review/summary: Mounds bar in a bottle!
review/text: Fantastic and delicious after a workout! This is probably the best electrolyte replenishing drink on the market! Coconut water is even better than intravenous fluids per some medical literature I have read.

review/summary: Chocolate coconut water scalpers
review/text: This new flavor of Zico is delicious - silky and chocolate-y without the gag-inducing traits of some of the other fruity flavors.  Great as a post-workout substitute for chocolate milk or a banana.  My little case ran out quickly as my husband discovered it and loves it, too.  However, I went to re-order the same exact item and was shocked to see that the price of a 12 pack jumped from $21.51 to $53.95!<br /><br />Come on, Amazon, really?  This is obviously a hot item at the moment, but you're letting your sellers get away with blatant thievery!  What a disappointment.
