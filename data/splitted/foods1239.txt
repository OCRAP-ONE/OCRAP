review/summary: Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.
review/text: I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried. I use it after I work out at the gym; or if I've got sore muscles from other activities such as gardening or heavy lifting. It is great for "that time of the month." It helps with cramps and mood swings. Calm comes in a few different flavors such as lemon, raspberry-lemon, and orange. I like the orange flavor the best. It's easy to use. Just mix a teaspoon or more of the powder with hot water. Then add a little cold water or cold juice and drink.  A hint: If you have trouble sleeping, try taking Calm and also take Vitamin B1 about a half hour before bed, to help with sleep. My chiropractor recommended that and it works for me. The magnesium in Calm has been formulated to absorb into the body and take effect quickly. There is a little booklet that is usually attached to the canister of Calm that gives more info on all of the benefits of magnesium in this form.

review/summary: Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure
review/text: I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss.

review/summary: A Treat on a GF Diet. But, Beware!
review/text: Although not exactly as I remember raisin bread, it's a welcome treat after so long without. It has a good texture, toasts well, but could have more cinnamon flavor. It is somewhat pricey, but I miss bread, so I splurge a little.<br /><br />Update: I need to warn consumers that, although this packaging should last until the expiration date, you must examine this bread before you use it. At $44+ you can't eat this bread too fast, even though it is light. As I got to the last three loaves, I noticed mold on most of the slices. I hoped none was tainted that was already eaten. It was well before the expiration date. I now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again. The Ener_G company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves. They asked why I didn't order from them. From now on, I think i will. It can't be any more expensive. This price is no bargain.

review/text: I feared I'd never eat raisin bread again since I'm trying very hard to be wheat free/gluten free. Although I paid way too much, $6.99 at New Seasons Market in Portland, Oregon, it was worth it. Tried it this morning, and it was like biting into my childhood of eating raisin toast. I made a piece for my husband who avoids my gluten free breads with a "No Thank You, that's for you". He requested a second piece with jelly, making mmmmm.....sounds as he chewed it up. I highly recommend this product. Amazon price is very good if you can use a case.

review/summary: I'm glad I took the risk...Melts in your mouth.
review/text: I rarely give 5-star reviews. Just look at my other entries. Buying food on Amazon is risky in my opinion - especially when it is purchased sight unseen. Let me simply say this about the private reserve roast. It was outstanding and the big hit of the Chrsitmas dinner this year. After letting it thaw for three days in the refrigerator and then setting it out on the counter for a couple hours to come up to room temperature, I set about making a simple rub of olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and minced garlic. I then put it on a hot gas grill and seared it for about 2-3 minutes on each side. It then went into a preheated oven set to 250 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. That brought the internal temperature to about 140 degrees, a perfect medium rare in the middle and medium on the ends. It literally melted in your mouth and could be cut with a fork. My dinner guests said it was literally one of the finest tasting tenderloin roasts they had ever eaten. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this from Omaha Steaks on Amazon again. It might just become a new Chrsitmas day tradition.

review/text: The old biscuits were great, I gave them to my dog for years and then Nutro changed the packaging, and kept the price the same while lowering the amount of biscuits by 50%. The new formula has 11% protein as opposed to 20% in the previous formula, they have more fat content than the old biscuits, they took out the polyphosphate which is the ingredient that reduces tartar and they are hard as a rock now. The new packaging doesn't even work right. The resealable seam ripped off like it wasn't even glued. Stay away from this product. Unless Nutro realizes its mistake and starts valuing its customers more than its bottom line, I wouldn't buy anything with their name on it.

I usually fix mine the night before which is so easy, I can do it during a commercial on TV  - use a ratio of 1 c milk, 1/4 c oats, a pinch of salt, a tablespoon of raw sugar and some dried cranberries. Bring to a slight boil while stirring, cook one minute, turn off the heat and let it cool covered for a while then put into the fridge.  Next morning, stir and then microwave until hot.  Add more milk if you like it runnier.  This is perfect every time and the flavour can't be beaten.

review/summary: Best Substitute for Wheat Spaghetti
review/text: Spaghetti was a favorite meal before needing to eat gluten free, so we have tried many gf spaghettis trying to find a good substitute, including the popular brand that begins with a T. The "T" brand was my favorite, although it was only passable, until I tried the Ener-g Rice Vermicelli. The Ener-g Vermicelli was the first gf pasta to make eating spaghetti really enjoyable again! It is now my favorite gf spaghetti as it lacks the overwhelmingly rice flavor and stickiness of many rice spaghettis. It is good enough that we even use it for meals like Shrimp Scampi with angel hair pasta, and Linguine with white clam sauce, and the meals are delicious.

review/summary: Cooks fast, tastes great - no one knows the difference
review/text: I've been using Ener-G products since I went on a gluten-free diet in the mid-90s, and every time I allow someone to talk me into trying another GF spaghetti, I go straight back to Ener-G's vermicelli.  Since it's thinner than regular spaghetti, the rice taste (or lack of taste) isn't noticeable - no one I've served this to has ever seemed to notice it isn't wheat spaghetti.  The other real plus, for me, is how quickly it cooks - 4 to 6 minutes instead of the over 15 minutes so many other GF spaghettis require.  Granted, the thicker spaghettis have their place too - in soups, where I do prefer them to the thinner vermicelli.  But for eating as spaghetti, Ener-G's vermicelli remains my first and only choice.<br /><br />Just one problem: Instructions on the last bags I received say to cook for 14 minutes.  Good grief.  These cook in about 4 minutes, and need to be placed under running water immediately or all you get is mush.  I'm not using them as much as I did - have switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> as my favorite spaghetti substitute.  They're more like linguini but hold up a bit better, and the brown rice makes me feel they're a bit healthier.

review/summary: ok but....
review/text: It's good for a GF food but as all GF foods go, you really have to watch this for the second it is done as it gets very mushy fast.  We are a family of 5 with 3 of those are under the age of 6, and we have to use 2 bags for a meal.<br /><br />Also, I have found that draining it turns it into glue.  I have to keep it in the water and drain each spoonful as I put it on the plate.

review/summary: Tastes good, but falls apart easily
review/text: My son is on a GFCF diet, but LOVES noodles.  I purchased these to use in various dishes, including spaghetti.  They are very easy to cook and work well the first day, but I have never been able to use them as leftovers.  For some reason, after being in the fridge, the noodles fall apart and look more like small pieces of rice... which defeats the purpose of buying rice noodles.  As long as you eat them right after cooking, they are fine... which isn't a big deal because they cook quickly.

I was trying to recapture my youth - my mother and I used to buy these all the time and they were wonderful, but that was about 20 to 30 years ago.  I am not sure if they changed the recipe, but these were not what I remember - the chocolate was good, but the shortcake was stale and not the same flavor or texture.  I will not order these again.  The only positive is that I received the product right on schedule.

review/summary: Excellent, authentic Japanese-style tea
review/text: This is a lovely, unsweetened, Japanese-style true green tea.  It is NOT your typical American tea with added corn syrup or sickeningly sweet artificial sweeteners, so if you are looking for a sweet tea you should skip it.  But it is a delicious, smooth, non-bitter green tea... and that is *very* hard to find outside of East Asia.<br /><br />My work takes me to Japan with some frequency, where I became a fan of conveniently bottled cool green teas.  This is the only tea I have found readily available in the U.S. that matches the quality and taste I expect in Japan. (Ito En is, after all, a Japanese company.)<br /><br />If you can't stand the oversweetened stuff that passes for bottled tea in North America and enjoy the taste of straight green tea, this product is probably a good fit for you.

It is light, smooth, refreshing and thirst quenching (like water), however, I get the health benefits of the antioxidants.  I love that it is unsweetened since the sugar and sweeteners in most teas have a horrible aftertaste or just make me more thirsty.  If you like sweet teas and/or drinks, you probably will not like this.  If you like water w/a hint of flavor you will most likely love this.

review/summary: Best Gum Ever!!!
review/text: Bottom line: buy this gum....in bulk....because you will love it!!<br /><br />I am a dedicated patron of Juicy Fruit, but saw this gum at the gas station the other day.  As with the previous reviewers, I was skepical at first, assuming that this was just a marketing ploy and that it would taste like any of the many peppermint or spearmint gums already on the market (which I don't particularly love). But the picture of the ice cream on the front of the box was compelling, so I decided to risk it.  It SERIOUSLY DOES taste like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  No kidding, it is just like eating a bowl of ice cream (I also think the flavor is somewhat reminiscent of Thin Mints).  Now, I feel like I'm eating 3 or 4 bowls of ice cream per day, for a grand total of 20 calories.  And do not just take my word for it: I recently was at a gathering of a few co-workers and all of them tried it and were quite impressed as well.  I'm sure they will be posting a review any day also.<br /><br />And now I leave a challenge for Extra: Make a French Silk Pie gum!!!!

review/text: I have been looking for mint chocolate chip gum since Bubbalicious discontinued theirs many years ago.  I even told my husband several years back to keep an eye out incase it shows up.  I loved that gum, so it was a no brainer to check out this new flavor by Extra.  Man, am I so happy this came out.  It really hits the spot and knocks the socks off bubbalicious.  The flavor is spot on, lasts a long time and the gum stays chewable/fresh in the mouth.  This is just a truly enjoyable chewing experience.  Am I crazy to right a review on gum?  Yes.  But you'll understand after you try it, especially if you have the childhood memories I do with the other brand.

review/summary: Awesome taste, very like the ice cream
review/text: I loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting. Everyone in the office eats it now. We only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks, but so far I have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor.  If you enjoy a really nice minty taste with a lot of creaminess and a nice chocolate flavor, then you will really be able to satisfy your sweet tooth with this gum. If you prefer  bright, citrus-y taste that is not too overpowering, you will the key lime flavor. The strawberry shortcake is good, but not as intense. This is my favorite of the three, with key lime a very close second.  If you are trying to lose weight, this will help for sure!

I also like that gum retains it's consistency, lasting as long as the flavor.<br /><br />I will picking up more of this great tasting gum! Note that this is sweetened with Sorbitiol which can cause gastric distress in some people, like my wife (which leaves more for me :-)<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Extra Mint Chocolate Chip Gum
review/text: This gum is great, I love it. When I was eleven years old my grandmother gave my sister and I each a package of gum. My sister was thirteen then. We took off the wrapper and the green gum taunted my taste-buds. We melted. I took out a piece and could smell it from two feet away. I have a good nose. I took off the wrapper and ever so gently put it in my mouth. I loved the taste!<br /> This gum has a green and silver package, also a silver wrapper. This gum has a very good texture; it is soft, actually chewable and delicious! As most already know this gum, as well as most gum, makes your breath smell good. Also it curves your hunger! It is also is very kid-friendly, great for the little ones.<br /> I love the flavor of this gum. Sweet mint is so delectable. Also I love this gum because it smells appetizing. I love how this gum last a long time. Another good thing about this gum is that it is sugar-free. This gum also lasts for around twenty minutes. This gum taste like ice-cream, but less cold. I love almost everything about this gum.<br />Remember how I said ALMOST, the only thing I detest is how fast the flavor runs out after twenty minutes. That is just not long enough for me. It is better than nothing. Your spit affects your outcome. I mostly love this product!<br />Kids love this, adults too! Gum chewers of all ages will love the sweetness of mint. People who seek flavor will seek this product. Mint lovers will fall in love. Ice-cream cravers who don't like the cold will crave this gum. Also this is good for women on diets.<br />I've told you about my experience with the gum.  I've also told you about who may like it. Now go out and try it for yourselves! Go on now it is time to leave the nest!

review/text: This gum is delicious and since my first pack I have been hooked.  I love the Mint Chocolate Chip after meals, and the Key Lime Pie is delectable at all other times.<br /><br />At $15/10 pack on Amazon, it's not really a deal, though, considering this is only a $1 a pack at target or mcwallymart.  Once the price of a 10-pack drops to about $10 or $11 I might consider buying it online if only out of pure laziness, but a 50% premium is not really worth it.

review/summary: "The best instant miso soup I've ever had."
review/text: Before detailing the added benefits of Miso-Cup, I offer the opinion of my wife, Yumi, a Japanese woman born and raised in Yokohama.<br /><br />"This is the best instant miso soup I've ever had," she said.<br /><br />So, we promptly placed an Amazon Subscribe & Save order for regular shipments.<br /><br />What are the added benefits I noted earlier? Edward & Sons Miso-Cup is organic, gluten free and proudly displays that it contains "NO MSG" and is "Vegan" with the big "V". Each serving has only 60 calories.<br /><br />If that isn't cool enough the company offers to replace your disposable soup cup with a reusable Miso-Cup travel mug for only $3.99 with all proceeds donated to reforestation charities. You get your good deed of the day and lunch all in one!<br /><br />Getting back to the taste - the main reason we purchased this product - the ingredients are easy to read and understand. You get freeze-dried tofu and green onions, wakame seaweed and vegetable seasonings. There are three servings in each packet.<br /><br />The Miso-Cup nicely compliments a bento lunch or an order of sushi. I keep a packet in my desk drawer with a small bowl. Preparation is easy. You squeeze out the first packet of miso and stir in eight ounces of hot water until it dissolves. Add the tofu and vegetable packet and stir again. That's it.<br /><br />Whether you used to live in Japan or just want to experience miso soup for the first time, Edward & Sons Miso-Cup is a great product - tasty, convenient and healthy. Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: FINALLY the miso soup i have been looking for
review/text: I have been on the quest for an instant miso VEGAN soup. I thought it did not exist. I have made miso soup many times from scratch but I am lazy sometimes and would like it to be quick and pre-made. I have looked high and low on amazon and all the brands included some sort of fish product. Now many packages do not right out say it includes fish, but ingredients such as bonito flakes are indeed fish. Any vegan should go get themselves a source book because some animal ingredients are not so obvious.<br /><br /> Well you can imagine how excited I was when I read the ingredients to find them ok to eat. I ordered right away. I got the package two days ago. I just tried the soup right now. I made it per the directions. I heated up 12oz of water (directions say 8oz) in my large coffee mug in the microwave for 3:30. After it was piping hot I added the first packet which has the miso in it. Stirred it around then added the second packet which has the tofu and seaweed. Give it 20 seconds to all mix together and took a sip.<br /><br /> The taste is absolutely amazing. I was not expecting it to taste so good. I highly highly recommend this soup. Plus the price is fantastic. I have it auto-shiped so I saved the extra 15%. The kicker on top of everything is that the miso is organic. I try to buy at least 70% of all my food organic. This is perfect. Vegan, Organic, Great Price. Please give this soup a try.

review/summary: The best instant miso...or was the best
review/text: I've sampled several at-home, instant miso soups.  Miso-Cup has the best taste and is a reasonable price.  It tastes like it was made from dashi after lots more preparation than water coming from your kettle over the mix to make.  Ingredients have a healthy, natural taste.  I happen to prefer it to some restaurants.  Each pouch contains 3 soup meals (sizeable serving), and there are 6 pouches in one shipment.  18 servings total.  High heat the water in your kettle first, by the way.  That way you will enjoy a better taste of the vegetable pack, which is the part you stir in last.<br /><br />Update 2/13/12: The soup has changed.  The soup at one time looked like it does on the packaging.  It now is very red and has a different taste.  Although the star rating is stuck at 5 for my review, I significantly change it because of the new taste.  3 stars.  I preferred the taste before because it was a cleaner broth with wakame, green onions, and tofu floating visibly.  This very red miso tastes much thicker than before, also less appetizing.<br /><br />Return to the winning recipe, please.  This is not the same.

review/summary: Delicious Miso soup - instantly
review/text: I've been searching for really good Miso soup for some time. There are a lot out there, but few really taste like good Miso soup. This one tastes superb. The item description says 6 packs, so I thought that meant six meals.  Actually each pack contains three meals, individually packaged. Just add hot water. So it actually is more accurately described as 3 soups per pack. Which means it would feed a family of one to three on a single pack. A lot better value than I originally thought.  Almost skipped over it, because it seem a little high priced.  Now I realize is is a great price. I'm hooked on this stuff now. Plenty of seaweed and veggies.  It is as close to good restaurant taste as I've found. All the others, save one, actually fall far short of this one. Worth your time and trouble checking it out.

review/text: I ordered this Miso-Cup based on product reviews.  While taste is a subjective thing, I'd have to go with the majority of reviewers in saying that this soup tastes very good - instant or otherwise - I'd say it's comparable to a local Japanese restaurant, which made me very happy.<br /><br />The part of this deal that makes me give it a 5 star rating... (6) packs in the box, but each pack has 3 portions, so you're truly getting 18 servings with your order!  For me, that worked out to about a dollar a serving.<br /><br />Bottom line: A great tasting Miso soup and a great deal from Amazon.

review/text: I've tried one other instant miso soup product - which disappointed me. This one, Miso-Cup Japanese Restaurant Style, delights me with every cup. I compare it to miso soup from the Edo restaurant in the city of Madison, AL, which fortunately, is close to where I live. I consider the Edo to be the best Japanese restaurant in the area and happens to be where I first found my love of miso soup. Without being able to do a side-by-taste comparison, I rate this product AS GOOD AS Edo's miso soup. It truly amazed me to find such quality in an instant soup pack.<br /><br />And I shouldn't forget to plug the reasonable Amazon price or the probiotic benefits of miso soup, both of which make each cup a little more delightful!<br /><br />Regards,<br />EdB

review/summary: flavorful and satisfying
review/text: I like miso soup both for the taste and the health benefits. "Miso-Cup" is a quick and simple way to prepare individual servings of delicious soup. You can also add more ingredients such as vegetables, grains, noodles, egg, or fish for added nutrition, and actually create a nice meal if you wish. I have been making mine with egg-dropped in and stirred, and also a sheet of toasted nori (seaweed)crumbled in it. I also have used brown rice or Soba (buckwheat) noodles. You could also try adding little bits of celery, carrots, peas or what have you. The soup by itself is a perfect appetizer or side to meal. For only 60 calories it is surprisingly filling. One caution, though, is that it is rather high in sodium. (this is actually a plus for me since I have low blood pressure).<br /><br />"Miso Cup" consists of two small pouches per serving, one with the miso paste, and the other with dehydrated tofu and vegetables. To prepare, you heat up 8 ounces of water, squeeze out the paste and mix together with the water, then add the contents of the other packet, wait a few seconds and then eat. The directions call for "hot" water, but I would like to point out that it should not be boiling or too hot because that would tend to kill off the good microorganisms (probiotics) that are in it and which aid digestion. If you can stick your finger in the water for 3-5 seconds it should be about right. (actually &lt;118 degrees). Miso is a fermented food; this miso is cultured from organic soybeans and organic rice. The miso-paste packet also has kombu seaweed extract, salt, shiitake mushroom extract, onion powder, yeast extract and a little alcohol for preservation.  The Kombu and Shiitake really adds good, authentic flavor to the miso. The other, dry packet has some little bits of freeze-dried tofu, a bit of wakame seaweed and freeze-dried green onions. These are perfect ingredients, but sort of a bare minimum amount, so it doesn't hurt to add more if you have some.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue to eat it every day.  Recommend.

review/text: After a trip to Japan, my palate has been destroyed. I cannot find good Japanese food here. However, this is made with real miso paste, which makes it better than most. I was happy with instant miso from powder, but this will no longer do. It tastes like powder, so I was looking for something more authentic. This is the closest I've come so far. I would like to add noodles to this, but it's good without.<br /><br />So what do you get? Well, you get a box with six bags of miso mixes, each containing three bags of miso paste and three bags of "vegetables". It's not a lot of them, and I wish the tofu bits had been a bit larger. But all in all I enjoy this, it's the best miso I've had outside of Japan (not counting the flight to/from).

review/text: I spent time in Hong Kong and Japan, so I ought to know reasonable miso when I taste it. While little compares with fresh restaurant miso, this is pretty close. The mix is not dry, it is a paste/liquid, and the dried vegetable/tofu packet is separate to be added after you prepare the soup base. You don't get 6 combinations, you get 18 complete combos (18 each of paste and dried vegetable/tofu) and it tastes absolutely divine. Add boiling water, stir, add vegetable packet, enjoy. Couldn't be simpler. If it's too salty for you, add more water. How hard is that? Incredible miso. Really brings back memories.

But it is healthy and vegetarian, that's the main reason I wanted to try it, and the flavor is pretty good for instant miso. I like that the vegetable packet has large pieces of sea weed plus tofu. So it is very good nutrition wise.<br /><br />My preferences might not be everyone's, though, because I actually prefer the Edward and Son's Miso-Cup Soup with Seaweed and that has an overall lower rating on Amazon. So your taste may vary, of course.

The only better was a Japanese mix that came the same way, with two pouches: a miso paste, and a packet of dried seaweed and tofu.<br /><br />Unfortunately at 1000mg of sodium per serving, this isn't the most healthy stuff. It may be organic and vegan, but that's a horrific amount of sodium.  Miso is created with salt and is naturally full of sodium, but this paste has additional salt added as well.  Yuck.<br /><br />I'm hoping their lower sodium version is just as tasty.

MSG has been used extensively in the U.S. since the 1960's ("Accent"); if MSG was toxic, wouldn't we have seen, by now, some sort of epidemic of MSG induced/related illnesses in the U.S. and Asia?  I do not advocate the use of MSG; it is used as cover for a lack of fresh onions and other aromatics, but sometimes - say - if you are traveling between solar systems in a cramped spaceship for several years or decades;  you don't have access to fresh garlic or onions, and MSG gives your dehydrated food at least some flavor, while being less likely to kill you than an astroid.<br />Meanwhile; educate yourself!<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Disgusting!
review/text: I'm not sure if the people giving this soup 5-star reviews have taste buds. I bought this soup because it stated that it was Gluten-Free and Vegan, plus it looked convenient to take with me while traveling. I was only able to stand a few bites before throwing it away. The tofu had no substance to it; it just dissolved as soon as it hit my tongue. The soup base is less than appealing and the freeze-dried vegetables never softened up.<br /><br />Save your money (and your appetite) and don't buy this product!

review/summary: Great Plant!
review/text: The Asparagus Fern is a great plant that is pretty hardy and looks really nice on a porch. It seems to grow pretty fast and has proved difficult to actually kill. If you plant it in a flower bed it can take over, but there is no rick of that if it's in a pot. I've been able to split mine in to several different pots now and they are all doing well.
