review/summary: Great Grain
review/text: My family calls me "One who eats sticks & twigs", so they'd say my tastes may not match yours.<br />That having been said, I have always liked Quinoa.  This was my first foray into the red variety & I think I'll be back.  Great flavor & cooks as directions indicate.  We cooked 2 cups the other day & I have been eating it ever since - both with just a sprinkle of Molly McButter on it & as an added ingredient to the Chicken Noodle Soups I have been consuming while getting over this cold.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002133Z56">Eden Organic Red Quinoa, Whole Grain, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)</a> has a nice taste & texture.  Two thumbs up!

review/text: I'm not sure how other people are washing this since it is so small that it passes through most colander items.<br />Taste-wise it is OK but plain-ish.  It has a nice earthy taste to it.  I like it with a fruit salsa to give more flavor.<br />I doubt I'd buy it again, but I won't let it rot on my shelves, either.  (But my wife isn't going to help me eat it.)

review/summary: Kinda like fluffy beans
review/text: I wanted to try quinoa because I heard it had more protein than staples like rice or oatmeal, but I had also heard that the taste may not be for everyone.  This brand of red quinoa tasted fine.  I cooked it in a rice cooker and it came out moist and light, almost a little fluffy, and had a strong nutty aroma but the texture is not heavy like beans.  The suggested preparation is to wash and rinse them before cooking, but I found this to be very difficult because this quinoa is so tiny and floats on water too.  I cooked it with barely a rinse and it tasted fine.

review/summary: Great Grain for Alkalin Conscious People
review/text: This is delicious when cooked with chicken broth and longer than the package said.  For people who look for delicious rice substitute for alkalin conscious, this is an answer.  Quinoa is on the alkalin producing side and helps body sustain calcium and bone density better.  (Rice and wheat are the opposite, just like soy milk and cow milk are.  These take away body's calcium.)

review/text: My daughter buys this brand locally.... The only difference is its more expensive and its boxed....Or that was what I assumed...This  product is not washed and has the husk or outer shell still on it, and you must wash and rinse it multiple times to get that outer shell off of the grain.....Consequently I have cooked it a couple of times, assuming that I had properly washed and rinsed the grain, and had bad results....Future purchases will be from local market, even though Its more expensive....At least its washed and cooks perfectly every time.....

review/text: After reading Wheat Belly I realized I wanted to diversify into other grains and consume less wheat. I have fallen absolutely in love with Red Quinoa.  Most all grains cook the same - 2 cups water for each cup of grains then cook in a rice cooker as normal.<br /><br />For those who are concerned with cost, I make a blend of red quinoa, purple rice, amaranth, millet, green split peas, yellow split peas, along with red lentils.  Now we mix this blend into our brown rice in our rice cooker.  We add in some broth or bragg liquid aminos along with herbs and seasonings for a very healthy side dish.  Enjoy!

review/summary: I liked it
review/text: Just bought my first package of these, after reading about this thing in a Joe Csatari (sp?) book on nutrition. Didn't know what to expect, but I liked it -- on several accounts. First, if the label is true, it's got superior nutritional qualities -- a very good combination of typical nutrients (oil, carbs, proteins) with "trace elements", like, for example, magnesium, which not too many foods have a lot of (yet, if we were to trust the label, a serving of quinoa has 20% of daily norm! that's a lot). Second, it's amazingly easy to prepare, faster than steel-cut oats for example. Ready in twenty minutes max. Third, the taste is agreeable, and not all that unusual: it's a lot like buckwheat, which I'm very used to. The texture is pleasant, not mushy, almost crunchy. The dark groats, after you boil them, release tiny white curlicues of some sort (the germ? really like a tiny pigtail), which gives this thing an interesting, sort of mottled, appearance. I add a tbsp of sunflower seeds and a bit of olive oil to it, and the resultant substance is quite pleasant. Of all the health foods I've tried lately this is the only one that I'd eat even if it weren't healthful. A bit pricey though ($18.89 as of 12/17/2010); these pouches are real small in reality; maybe two cups of dry groats in every one, something like that. But it's good food, I'm glad to confirm this much. I'm gonna give it a good try at least.<br /><br />02/23/2011: Bought a refill yesterday, for about ten bucks a set (that's good), fulfilled by "Amazon LLC". And what do I see here today? Now I see something called "KosherVitamins" sells it for four times that. Their vitamins may be kosher, but their prices ain't! Wait till it goes back to normal, fulfilled by our dear host here (my new order hasn't been cancelled, so they might simply be temporarily out of stock, so wait till they get more).<br /><br />06/21/2011: I'm still only half-through this previous refill: I guess I just didn't warm up to this particular thing, I'm not eating it -- or rather, I get to it only when I'm out of everything else. Combined with more than doubling of the price, this makes me doubt I will be ordering another refill. It's not bad by any means, but while I'm really looking forward to my usual oatmeal or buckwheat, this thing here is more like, well, OK, since I'm out of oats this will do. Subjective, of course.<br /><br />PS. It spoils rather fast, so don't make too much. One cup will make one pot, basically; and then refrigerate immediately. Don't add anything before storage (it may contribute to spoilage) -- whatever you like in it, add it right before serving. Like I said, I've never warmed up to it (I'm still finishing off, stop and go, that refill I was talking about above, and it's 11/30/2011 now).

review/text: I purchased this air plant terrarium as a birthday present for a friend.  She was delighted with it, as was I.  It is unique and something quite different, so it was a good surprise for her.  This plant arrived in excellent condition, along with the other items in the kit.  This is my second order for an air plant from Hinterland Trading through Amazon, and I have been highly pleased with both orders.  The neat thing is that Hinterland Trading sends care instructions with each plant, and it reads like it is the plant talking to you.  It is so cute!  Also, they send a packet of seeds with each order, which is a nice surprise.  My first order had parsley seed, and the second one had sunflower seed.  I definitely will keep this company in mind when purchasing gifts in the future, and also for my personal needs.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: High-quality salt!
review/text: I would like to start out by saying that I am picky about salt. Iodized salt has no character and kosher salt can be very overpowering. Sea salt can be a hit or miss. Some sea salts can be intensely salty while others lack any panache.<br /><br />But this salt is beautifully pink and its flavor is mild and balanced with a wonderful finish. It has the character and class expected of a salt in its category.<br /><br />Extra points for packaging..I loove the space-efficient airtight design with screw on lid. It's easy to store in my already full spice cabinet. And the price is perfect.<br /><br />Kudos for affordability, health benefits, design, ease of use, and taste!!!!!

review/summary: Don't like
review/text: I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.

review/text: I had purchased this because I had gotten hooked on Himalayan Pink Salt at the local grocery store. They offered it in small rocks in a grinder container. Seeing this online, It was much cheaper to purchase it in this size, especially since I already had a grinder.. This stuff adds great texture to a meal when you finish it with a small crust of it. The only reason I gave this particular kind 4 rather than 5 stars is that the salt is already pretty finely ground, when I thought I was getting something similar to the small rocks of salt I was getting before, and I could grind it as I wanted it. Still a good buy, though. I barely ever use regular iodized salt for anything other than pasta water any more.

review/summary: So far, it's the best salt I have found
review/text: I felt that I had to give an update reassuring people a little more about this product.  I can assure you that I have no connection or financial interest in this company or in regard to this Himalayan salt.<br /><br />The reason for my interest is that I have an autistic son, and I am very watchful for contaminants in his food. I avoid the type of sea salt from the ocean since heavy metal contamination is an problem.  So when I found this Himalayan salt, I was glad because the label states that they monitor the contents for contaminants.  And it doesn't come from the ocean, which greatly reduces the likelihood of heavy  metal contamination.<br /><br />One reviewer was quite concerned because there seemed to be some sediment left at the bottom of a glass of water when he attempted to dissolve the salt.  He felt that this sediment was dangerous and not fit for human consumption.<br /><br />So I did some research of my own.  I tried to dissolve some of the salt in a glass of water also.  I noticed that some of it did not dissolve immediately.  It took a while, but eventually all but some red powder had dissolved.  So I know that some of the salt dissolves immediately, some of it will dissolve after a lot of stirring and perhaps after it sits in the water for a couple of hours.  But the red powder did not dissolve.<br /><br />I looked up Himalayan pink salt and found out that the Bavarian consumer protection agency analyzed the composition of 15 Himalayan sea salts sold in Germany.  They found that it was composed of 10 different minerals, including, of course, sodium and chloride (98%).  It contained 2-3% polyhalite or gypsum and 10 other minerals in small amounts.<br /><br />Gypsum is a very soft sulfate material made up of calcium sulfate dihydrate.  I am assuming it is safe for consumption since it is used as a coagulant in tofu.<br /><br />Polyhalite is a hydrated sulfate of potassium, calcium and magnesium.  It's reddish color is due to various levels of iron oxide in salt deposits.<br /><br />This may seem alarming, but I did yet more research and found that insoluble minerals do not absorb and simply pass through the body. Based on that information, I am not ready to assume that this insoluble mineral is harmful.<br /><br />Himalayan pink sea salt has been harvested from the salt mines in Pakistan since the 13th century.  So they've been eating this stuff for a long time.  And if they've been consuming it for that long, and if that's the way it comes out of the ground, I think I can feel pretty good about it.<br /><br />I am not 100% confident about my conclusions, but for now, I am feeling a bit better about serving this to my children rather than serving any other salt on the market.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: A very 'salty' salt, you don't need to use as much to get the same flavor as you would with table salt. It's sodium is lower, and its trace minerals are higher and more importantly are in the appropriate proportions to actually be used by the body, so that you don't have massive salt cravings all the time. Definitely worth the switch.<br /><br />[...]

review/text: I love this packaging, it is very compact and keeps the salt dry. I filled all my shakers and grinders with this salt. The salt is fine but you still can grind it if you prefer (I like salt grinders better, it allows to control the amount of salt more easily). Just adjust the grinder screw from coarse salt to fine salt and it works perfectly. Love the taste of this salt, it is slightly lemony and very mild. Low sodium!!! This package will last probably over a year (2 pounds of it!!!). Totally will buy again.

Your skin is so soft and supple when your bath is over and you are so relaxed you can just wrap yourself in some soft pjs and drift off to sleep. Try a salt bath with this salt - not the magnesium bath salts you usually use. You will not believe the difference.

review/summary: Salty salt...
review/text: I heard that Himalayan Pink Sea Salt was spoken of highly so when I needed to buy some more salt I decided to try this.  I have always used sea salt in a salt grinder.  The main differences between regular sea salt and this product, I would say, are that this is a very finely ground product, and it seems to be the saltiest salt I have ever tried.  I definitely have to be careful and not use a lot because a little goes a long way flavor wise.  Also, even though it is a finely ground sea salt I still use it in my salt grinder and it works perfectly fine.  Overall I would say that I do like this product and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new to add a little more flavor to their food. Just remember, a little goes a long way!

review/summary: Diogenes Sleeps Deeply
review/text: When my grandson was born, Diogenes was able to retire and seek the sleep he so deserved after searching so many centuries for an honest man. My grandson speaks his mind eloquently and succintly.  Upon the arrival of my order of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNHQ34">Funfresh Foods Real Food Trading Company Himalayan Pink Sea Salt, 2-Pound</a>, I quietly served it at a family meal.  Almost instantly my grandson asked who put sand in the salt.  I smiled, chuckled and told him no one had put anything in the salt and that this was special pink salt from half way around the world.  "It has sand in it, Grandpa! I don't like it!" he replied.  Nay, nay, not so, I assured him (and everyone).  "Let me show you."<br /><br />I drew a small glass of filtered water and added a liberal amount of the pink salt.  (BTW, if you like the C.Cola bottled water, *asani, much of it comes from the same source in FL as my tap water)  So I swirled the pink salt around in the water.  Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I've been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I'll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the "salt" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.<br /><br />It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between "regular" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.<br /><br />This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?<br /><br />I'm returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!<br /><br />Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.  Nevertheless, sediment is sediment and sediment is not salt!  This is another example of when a low price is not a bargain!

review/text: I am currently deployed to Iraq and this is one of two soy milks that I see and drink on a regular basis, the other being Edensoy. This stuff has a decent flavor, but is a bit chunky when poured into the cereal bowl. I attribute this in part to it being Iraq. Who knows how long the stuff has been sitting on a pallet in the sun. It still tastes good and is great. I only gave it 4 stars because of the soy chunk issue.

review/summary: Worst soymilk ever!
review/text: I usually drink Silk soymilk and really like the taste, but it's hard to find plain soymilk in single-serving aseptic cartons. I like to put it in my hurricane box every summer so I'll have milk to put on cereal if we're out of power after a storm. I thought this Pacific soymilk would be just the thing, but unfortunately the stuff tastes like latex paint and it has no emulsifier in it, so it separates into liquid and clumps of solids at the bottom. Even after vigorous shaking, I couldn't get them to blend back together, and even if I could, I still couldn't get past the taste.

review/text: A couple of others have mentioned it already, but the "Plain" version of this product does not ship with straws.  After discussing this with customer service at Pacific Natural Foods, I found out that this is their standard procedure.  "Vanilla" and "Chocolate" both DO have straws, however, so if that is an issue you might want to consider purchasing those instead.  For what it's worth, Pacific did send me a pack of straws when I requested it at no charge, but it's certainly not something I would want to do every time.  The milk itself is fine.  No complaints other than the lack of straws for the "Plain" variation.

review/text: I was looking for an interesting alternative to wine and after reading the reviews here, I went in search of it in local supermarkets. After a little legwork, I found it. Excited to get it home, chilled, and on the table, I was ready for a good taste experience. Well. This stuff is gross, with a weird, bitter, chemical like taste that I couldn't even tolerate drinking, let alone enjoy. I had to pour it down the sink,which was very disappointing, as this stuff is not cheap, even minus shipping charges. Don't get caught up in all the "gourmet" hype, and stick to the simple pleasures ,like a good glass of iced tea or pineapple juice. I wouldn't drink this stuff if I was stranded in a desert.

review/text: My kids hate school lunch (can you blame them?). I feel good about sending them with these in their lunch boxes. Also, I like that they come in Aseptic cartons so there is no rush to use them before they expire like regular milk. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is price--they are expensive. Costco used to sell these for a lot cheaper, but now the Costco in my area no longer carries them. I'm glad Amazon has them, I just wish they weren't so expensive.

My daughter doesn't even peel off the tab, the straw goes through it pretty easily.<br /><br />Bonus: these can be kept at room temperature and do not require refrigeration until after they are opened. Usually, there isn't any left over :)

review/summary: Tellicherry peppercorns milled in my Unicorn Keytop Pepper Mill elevate pepper to a whole new level
review/text: Wow! Pepper has never tasted so good!  I didn't realize how much of a difference using freshly ground Tellicherry peppers would make in my cooking, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I season everything with salt and pepper, so it makes sense for me to buy the best quality salt and pepper I can find.  Thus far, Melina's brand Tellicherry peppercorns is the best pepper I have found.  They are not just hot, they also have a complex spice note, which you will not find in pre-ground supermarket pepper.  What I find interesting is I can see the oils on the surface of the pepper when I crack it open. It is these oils that provide those complex flavors.<br /><br />When I received 4 - 6 oz bags of peppercorns I never thought I would use them all.  Now, 6 months later, I'm getting close to re-ordering.  I am so addicted to the flavor that I'm using more pepper than ever before.<br /><br />My one concern with this product is the Country of Origin is not printed on the bags. Tellicherry pepper should come from India and I do not have proof that these were grown in India.

Maybe a unique stocking stuffer?<br />These really do add some nice subtle flavor I didn't know I was missing by using the generic peppercorns I meant to replace. I would buy these again. Fast shipping, too.<br />And hey, if you want to try just one bag, I will sell you one of mine for five bucks!

Great for breakfast with a bit of butter and a teaspoon of brown sugar, but also terrific in a hearty beef soup.

But, as you have to do with all of these products which are mostly made out of sugar, you need to be careful you don't overdo it (hard for me, I like them that much!). Amazon, though, does not have the best price that I've seen. At around $30 for 6 boxes, that equals $5 a box. I originally got these at a store for $4 a box. But it is great that Amazon has them if you do not live near a store which sells them.

By ordering them through Amazon in a larger package, they equate to about $2.00 per box - much more to our liking! They really have the best taste and texture of all of the similar snacks that we have tried.

Flavor-wise it tastes just like the Cherry Pie Lara bar plus a handful of nuts (almonds, pecans, and cashews.  For my taste, I was too sweet, which is strange considering that I was craving a sweet snack and normally sweet is just my thing.  The fat grams (12!!) are just not worth it for me.  I'd rather have a simpler nut bar...or a slice of actual Cherry Cobbler!  Hmmm. bottom line:  If you're a fan of the Cherry Pie Lara Bar and want some added nuts, this will likely be perfect for you.

review/summary: Quality Control Issues?
review/text: Like other reviewers we found this Root Beer to be a very full flavor Diet soda that exceeded expectation.  My wife even got hooked and what started as a two case a month "Subscribe & Save" habit for myself over a year ago quickly turned to a five case a month subscription.  But wait, then we started to notice that there were subtle taste differences among the received cases, noticing an intermittent lack of full flavor we had become used to among some of the cans.  Then these taste variations became umpleasant in the last two months, experiencing a few flat tasting cans, but with many more cans that bordered on a sickly sour aftertaste almost like milk turning bad.  Checking the production number on the bottom of can was of no help because for every bad tasting can there was a good one with the same lot number.  Maybe it stems from variations among Amazon storage facilities as it seems our five cases are often mailed from different locations versus only a single one.  Bottom line, although the flavor again seems consistant with our last shipment of five cases we have decided to end our Subscribe & Save for this product because of all the previous wasted discarded product.  What a shame that there appears to be a quailty control issue for such a good product, whether is it at the production facility or at the storage facility I am unsure but it needs to be corrected.

Years ago my parents used to take us to root beer stands (this was before diet sodas) like Dog 'N Suds. This comes freakishly close. My partner, who hates diet sodas, even liked it.<br /><br />This is a great summer drink, and I'm glad I found it.

review/summary: Great Ideas Whether Diabetic or Not ! ! !
review/text: I miss drinking an occasional soft drink with all the limits from my health! Now that I have found this it is a great substitute to have when I miss having a soda! Highly recommended for anyone who is watching what they eat and drink!
