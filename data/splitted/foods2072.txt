review/summary: my favorite chocolate!
review/text: While as you can see from the mixed reviews, this isn't for everyone--but I LOVE this chocolate.  It is creamy with a bolder taste than most milk chocolate.  It doesn't have the "bite" of a lot of dark chocolates or dark-milk chocolates.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving it a chance if you prefer milk chocolate to dark, but want a slightly richer, smooth flavor.

review/text: I enjoy tasting various gourmet chocolates from around the world.  This product is apparently from Spain.  This is a disgrace.  Absolute awful texture (it seemed to get worse the more I chewed it) and extremely bland flavor.  One bite and I was done.  I am not going to ingest more calories on something so terrible.

review/text: And I mainly ate the first half cause the hazelnuts were pretty good. Hated seems harsh but I couldn't bring myself to eat the whole thing which is rare for chocolate :). I think the main problem is that they use "chocolate liquor" insted of cocoa which gives it a very bland taste and texture.

review/text: I have tried the white grape peach, white grape raspberry, concord grape and fruit punch flavors of welch's fruits snacks and enjoyed them all.  I figured this flavor would be just as good.  These were really gross, like eating cheap berry lip balm.  They were very waxy, left a film in my mouth and even smelled like wax.  I advise that you try one of the above flavors if this is the first time you are considering buying Berries 'n Cherries.  The others are MUCH better in my experience.

review/summary: tiny tiny candy with a terrible shipping cost
review/text: I could not believe the shipping on this tiny candy, but thinking that they were as large or larger than the image on the screen, and since they were perfect for my event theme, I bit the bullet and ordered 8 tins.  The shipping came to almost $25.  When they arrived, the box that held these tiny tins (1 1/2 by 2 inches at most and 3/8 inch deep) was about 4x5 inches. To top it off, the only tin I've opened is short 2 candies and 2 are broken.  These are a rip off.  There should be a shipping discount for ordering multiple tins.  The candies themselves are so tiny and the taste is nothing special.... Look elsewhere if you need candy bees.

review/summary: Secret Recipe to Porto's Mojitos (n_n)
review/text: If you ever had the Mojito @ Porto's Bakery and Cafe then you might wanna know that this is the stuff they add to it. As I was waiting in line for my Mojito I looked around the shop and noticed a shelf full of Monin and wondered why they have so much bottles of Monin and what it must be. I was watching the Cafe worker muddle mint, freshly squeeze some lime juice, gave it a shot of Monin Mojito syrup, add ice, shake it up, and placed into a cup. I love Porto's Mojito and Love Mojito's in general. I haven't tried them with alcohol but it's always a refreshing drink to have on a hot summer day. I wish I could find Monin in a store but if I can't I just substitute. Below is a recipe I use to make a virgin Mojito ...<br /><br />[] 2-3 sprig of Fresh Mint *Can add more if you like*<br />[] 8oz of Lemonade<br />[] Ice<br />[] Martini Shaker *Optional*<br /><br />**Muddle AKA Mash the Mint leaves. If you don't have a Muddler anything works like the end of a wooden spoon or like me I use the end of a ice cream scoop. Pour in the Lemonade and ice into a Martini shaker. Shake vigorously. Pour into a glass and enjoy !** ~ MYTCR8TiV.com

review/text: If you are selecting among the variety of Walden Farms salad dressings, this one deserves special attention. It's probably very difficult to get good flavor when you don't use sugar, fat or significant carbohydrates. But this one works---flavorful, with a zip of heat, decent thickness.

review/summary: YOU CAN BUY SIX 12-oz Bottles at Walmart for $27.25
review/text: You buy this product for $27.25 (including tax and shipping) for SIX 12-oz bottles.  Considering that it doesn't have any Calories, doesn't have any carbs, doesn't have any sugars, doesn't have any fat... and is  gluten free(which among other gluten products = wheat], I would say this is a fairly decent product.  It is not anywhere comparable to the real thing, but when you consider the calories you save... it is quite good.  I bought mine at Walmart online, but it is also available in many Walmart stores.  I have recently started the HCG diet.  This is an iffy choice while on the 500-cal per day portion of the diet, according to the reading material I have found.  It hasn't hurt my weight loss so far.  I only use 1-2 tbsp. in any given meal.  My daughter who has tried the ranch dressing (Zero Calories) by Walden Farms says you can place it in the blender and add cilantro and it tastes remarkably like the dressing served at CAFE RIO Mexican Restaurants.

review/text: This dressing is wonderful! I've tried this one and the Bacon Ranch and they are both really great. I'm on the HCG diet, which means I can't have any dressings, condiments, etc that have calories, sugars, fats, or carbs. So to keep me on my diet so I can loose this God-awful weight without having to resort to surgery, the Walden Farms products are a lifesaver. I can't even have salsa on my salad which is what I used to do beforehand.<br />These products might not be for everyone, but when you have extremely limited choices, I definitely recommend this dressing. It even has a nice spicy kick to it. And it fulfills that desire not to eat salad dry.<br /><br />However, as others have noted, some Walden Farms products are a complete miss. The original barbeque sauce is one of those. I bought it to try to keep myself enthused about the limited food I'm allowed. It was so bad I didn't even want to eat. I guess that's one way to diet! Too bad all their products can't be as yummy as this dressing and the Bacon Ranch.

review/summary: Gluten Free, Carb free, Sugar free and tasty
review/text: This dressing has a nice consistency, tastes good and is also available in portable packets if you desire.  My wife takes this in her lunches too. You can save some money by buying this bottle and filling a small Tupperware type container to take with you. You can also modify the portion size by pouring your own.<br /><br />One of the difficult parts of dealing with Celiac disease is finding foods to safely eat while on the road. In general salads are safe (except the croutons), but we have to watch the dressings carefully. By bringing our own dressing my wife has found she can eat on the road and not get sick. While the no calorie and fat free options are appealing, the Gluten Free aspect is wonderful for those who must eat Gluten Free. When you have Celiac, it's simple to tell if a food it simply labeled as Gluten Free or if it really is! If it really is GF and free of cross contamination, my wife doesn't get sick. This dressing meets all her GF needs along with tasting good.<br /><br />In order of preference, our favorite Walden Farms flavors are:<br />Italian Salad Dressing<br />Chipotle Ranch Salad Dressing<br />Ranch Salad Dressing<br /><br />As a Calorie Free, Sugar Free, Gluten Free dressing this is a very tasty dressing.  It's amazing that these Walden Farms dressings can taste as good as they do with no calories, no sugar, no gluten, and even no fat! Not all of the dressings taste great, but this flavor is really good.  Funny story here, we actually ordered the plain Walden Farms Ranch, and due to a mistake in the listing received the Chipotle.  Turns out I like the Chipotle better than the plain!<br /><br />You might try looking for this locally too, some big box stores are starting to carry it in our area.  You can get it for much less and avoid the shipping expenses too.<br /><br />5 stars as one of my favorite GF dressings.

review/summary: Much as recalled from the past...enjoyable.
review/text: Thos above a certain age recall Bonomos Turkish Taffy and delighted in it, missed it<br />when it disappeared from the scene.  Thankfully, someone has now brought it back.<br />I purchased the candy in small bite size (something new, if I recall correctly since<br />I recall only fairly large bars from the past).  It's much as I recall from the<br />years gone by.

review/summary: Bonomo Turkish Taffy just like I remember
review/text: These bite sized pieces of Bonomo Turkish Taffy brought back memories. It's the same taffy I remember as a kid in the seventies when you'd buy it in a bar and slam it on a table to break apart. The only difference is that these pieces are softer and a bit chewier. But that was OK with me. I shared them with my daughter who became instantly addicted so I bought another for her birthday. The only negative - and this could be a big one for some people - there wasn't a single piece of chocolate in my tub......just Vanilla, Strawberry and Banana. Their chocolate line must've been down for a few days because the second batch I ordered had no chocolate either. In my case I didn't mind because the other 3 are my favorites anyway. A bit expensive at about 13 cents a piece but this tub should last you a while.

review/text: We bought this because it reminded us of our childhood years. The taste is similar to what we remembered. It does seem to be more chewy then I remember the bars of taffy to be. It was a good taste treat, but I probably would not buy it again. The cost per pound is just too high.

review/text: Yes I had the original back in the day and this tastes NOTHING like the original.  It's soft and mushy and made with artificial flavors, mono and di-glycerides, and egg albumin.  I suspect the positive reviews were placed by employees or contractors for the company that bought the brand name.  Don't bother with this dreck - you would be better off by any of the typical wax wrapped taffys from any small candy maker.

For whatever reason, I remembered Bonomo Turkish Taffy and looked it up on Amazon. Lo & Behold, there they were and I bought the assorted ones.

review/summary: Bleh--only one chocolate piece in ENTIRE bucket lol
review/text: Having not had the childhood experience of this brand<br />I had no clue what to expect-Shipping was ridiculously fast<br />(ordered Sat. received Monday) taffy is fairly soft and fresh...not<br />sure I'm crazy about the taste.  The banana usually is my favorite..but this brand has NOTHING on Laffy Taffy banana flavored which is a superior banana flavor IMO.....the one chocolate piece really didn't taste chocolate-y-more pastey....strawberry was bland...vanilla was the only one that was ok-will be putting this tub out in the office kitchen area for co-workers to pick on as I'm not taking it home- and will look around for a better tasting brand of taffy like I used to eat on the boardwalk---and by the way...what IS up with the lack of chocolate ones? I thought the reviews must be off--but noooooooooo...we only found ONE in the entire little bucket TOO FUNNY!

review/summary: Where's the Chocolate?
review/text: My favorite candy as an adolescent was every flavor of Bonomo Turkish Taffy!  I've waited literally years for it to be re-introduced.  I'm a little disappointed.  They are all close in flavor & texture but they haven't quite nailed it yet.  I thought I'd probably be placing a standing order but once was enough to capture a little nostalgia & get over it.  I will admit that I'll probably order another bucketful sometime in the future just to see if it gets better.<br /><br />This is my BIG COMPLAINT - out of 216 pieces I only got TWO CHOCOLATE ONES!  What's up with that?  216 divided by 4 = 54.  I probably wouldn't have mentioned it even if I'd only gotten 20 BUT TWO??  Did this happen at the taffy factory or does the retailer have such a chocolate fetish that he opens all the canisters in the middle of the night to replace the choclate ones with the other flavors he's been squirreling away?  And how devious to give me the two - like he's taunting me for a second time!!

review/text: I've always liked Trisquits. It goes way, way back, at least 70 years to my childhood. My mother always thought they were better for us than plain white saltine crackers. I think she was right. I like the saltyness, the flavor and the crunchy texture. Thus it was when I found some Triscuit Cracked Pepper and Olive Oil crackers (9.0-ounce box) at a nearby Fresh and Easy store. Oh, that sounded good. Well, they were! Excellent! All the good texture and flavor of the Standard Triscuit plus the bracing taste of fresh pepper with a little olive oil. Plus, they're a whole-grain product and have a lot of fiber. Good, good, good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Awesome Taste
review/text: My husband and I have raised honey bees for years, though we cannot call our honey organic because we live in an area where other farmers use chemicals which our bees may bring home to the hive unintentionally.  This honey is the most delicious honey I have ever tasted!!  We did have one time when we raised bees in Southern Illinois in a large clover field that was close to this good, maybe even as good though flavor somewhat different.  YS Royal Honey is so good it was hard to not eat too much.  We should all practice temperance in eating, even if it is something that is "good for you."  Although the price is high, consider it like gourmet candy. Because it is not heated to high temperatures in processing, it crystallizes much quicker than more refined honey products.  But, it can easily be liquefied by placing the jar in a pan of hot water (not on the stove).  If you put it in the microwave to soften it, you will kill some of the beneficial elements in the honey.  Microwave ovens are great for heating water, but must be used at low power levels for short periods of time if you want to maintain the beneficial micro-nutrients in your food!  Also, research has shown that if you use plastic containers in the microwave, chemicals are released from the plastic which are then absorbed by the food.  The chemicals accumulate in your body and can eventually lead to cancer.  Use glass or ceramic only in the microwave because they do not release any harmful chemicals when used in the microwave!!!!

review/summary: Thank God for raw honey! Processed honey should be banned!
review/text: Wanted to thank for such a great product! It's absolutely delicious! Its consistency and taste proves that it has not been processed or diluted with sugar and water. If you compare it with processed honey that is sold in stores you would actually feel there is a raw taste to this brand. Processed honey has syrup-like taste and it stays liquid for a long time. If you are looking for raw honey, you have to know that it changes its color and consistency over time.<br />I have also noticed that no matter how much you can eat it, this honey does not make your stomach upset unlike processed store brands.<br /><br />In order for honey to be beneficial it has to be raw! There is no way it can deliver all its goodness to you if it's been processed! Honey is a wonder food! It has been scientifically proven to help heal wounds as it has antibacterial properties; to help restore healthy intestinal flora as it is a prebiotic; help recover from illnesses faster; help you sleep better; restore your nervous system after stressful events (try a cup of herbal tea with raw honey after a stressful day!) and even make your skin contain moisture. Raw unprocessed honey does not make your sugar spike if you are diabetic. But it absolutely has to be raw! If you buy processed honey you just waste your money, you can as well just buy some high fructose corn syrup....<br />Thank you for selling your honey raw! I wish one day people will be educated enough to avoid processed foods.

review/summary: Better than having your own bee hive!
review/text: PURE, UNPASTEURIZED, UNFILTERED, ORGANIC, KOSHER, RAW HONEY<br />Love it, love it, love it.<br /><br />I rarely recommend buying something that's more expensive than any "regular" type, but organic is well worth it as far as I'm concerned. Any time you can afford organic I believe it's worth the extra money because it's all about your health, not just taste. Everything you eat affects your health. You either pay extra now for the good stuff, or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.<br /><br />I get raw (unheated, never heat treated) honey from a friend now and then, she has her own hives, and Y.S. Organic honey is just as good if not better. Don't tell her, but I think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher. Who knows where her bees have been. ;)<br /><br />I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate, and I'm not sure what kind of honey this is (what kind of flowers) but the flavor is just right. Not too mild, not too strong, not too sweet. I know I sound like Goldie Locks, but it's just right.<br /><br />With honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world (scientists don't know why) I like the idea of organic hives - making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey.<br /><br />One word of caution though, when you shop for this honey. If you don't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic. Y.S. Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic, and they are both raw and unpasteurized. I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles (see above). Organic is in glass jars, and more expensive. Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money. But if you don't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is "Y.S. Organic Bee Farms", and that name is on all jars, organic or not. To make sure your honey, or any food item, is truly organic, make sure it has the certified organic seal, as this product does.<br /><br />~ ~ ~<br /><br />What you should know about raw honey vs. pasteurized honey:<br /><br />Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees (naturally, that's what they do) that comes straight from the bee hive (through an extracting process in a controlled setting). Raw honey is unheated, pure, unpasteurized, and unprocessed. Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase, an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads. Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it, almost like yellow wax, when at cooler room temperatures. If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.<br /><br />Honey is an alkaline-forming food, which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits, which become alkaline in the digestive system. It doesn't ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion. When mixed with ginger and lemon juices, it also relieves nausea and supplies energy.<br /><br />Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw. You can usually tell the difference by looking at it, when it's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through, like a light colored thin syrup. This is because it has been processed and pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf, and easier to handle and package because it's not as thick as raw honey.<br /><br />Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation. It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that's why it looks "cleaner" and smoother. But, when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas, yeast and enzymes (that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system) are partially destroyed. For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people. Honey is not recommended for children under two.

review/summary: New to raw honey
review/text: I have over the past few months started to eat most if not all organic foods. I start my morning with a cup of organic Green Tea. I usually used regular honey, but after reading up on the benefits of raw honey I decided to try this brand. I must say, this is truly the best honey that I have ever had. I almost want to sit on the couch with the jar and eat it like a snack, its THAT good! I recently ran out of the honey and ordered more online. The jar arrived to my house shattered. I called the customer service on my order form. They were 100% helpful and very kind. They promptly shipped me a new jar. I must say, during my wait for the new honey to arrive I had to use the old (liquidy) honey that i had, and I hated it!!! I truly love this organic raw honey. Trust me, try it once and you'll never use anything else!!

review/text: I actually bought this honey to wash my face with because I have heard raw honey helps with acne.  My cousin washes her face with this every morning and evening and it completely cleared up her acne, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The main reason i wanted to right this review though is because i recently had to have a spot that looked like skin cancer on my back removed and the instructions to take care of it were to cleanse and put vaseline and a new bandage on it twice a day.  Ofcourse, it got infected after about a week and a half even though I was following the instructions (telling someone to put vaseline on that kind of wound to heal is dumb anyway and should not have followed that).  I'm not prone to getting infections in cuts and what not and usually heal pretty quickly so I was surprised. When I called the dermatologist they told me I had to take antibiotics. I don't feel that antibiotics are always necessary for an infection and decided to try to heal this by myself first and if absolutely necessary turn to antibiotics. I decided to put the raw honey on it after I cleansed, it actually has almost the exact same texture as vaseline and after about an hour of it being on it started to feel itchy and like it was healing.  I woke up the next morning and it already looked so much better.  I'm on day three of doing this and it looks like it is almost healed. This honey has basically healed and cured an infection which is amazing and I believe that this product actually has all the enzymes, vitamins, and antibacterial properties it says it has. I'm truly impressed!

review/text: Buy this honey ! You won't be disappointed. I like the fact that it is 100% certified organic true raw state unpasteurized and unfiltered, has a great company write-up on the label, comes in a glass jar and not a plastic jar, and it really has a wonderful smooth texture and mellow full distinct flavor, unlike other creamed honeys I have purchased in the past.  My cappuccino tastes so much better with this particular honey. The price is so affordable and much much cheaper than if I had to purchase this in a health food store.  Amazon's free super saver shipping speed is excellent. How can you go wrong.

review/text: I am so hooked on this honey!  I have a real sweet tooth and I can eat 3 tbs of this a day without feeling guilty since it is good for me!  It tastes sweet and complex...nature's candy.  I ordered 4 more after ordering the first bottle for myself.  They make great gifts especially to ladies who like to keep healthy and drink tea.  For me, I haven't had the patience to melt it in my tea but I let it melt in my mouth directly from the spoon!

review/text: This is the best honey I have ever tasted! I will never go back to supermarket brands. It is solid but easy to soften in warm water and it melts wonderfully in hot tea. I actually gave one of my 4 year olds a little on a spoon and she loved it, so its a great alternative for me to give my kids instead of candy, which they don't get much of anyway, maybe that's why she loved it!

review/summary: yummy honey
review/text: To be honest this is the first raw honey I've tried but I really liked it.  It's soft and creamy right out of the jar kind of like peanut butter, and tastes lovely.  I use it for multiple purposes.  I spread a little on toast for that sweet flavor. For heartburn I mix a tbsp into warm water mix it and stir in 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (I use braggs with the mother) then drink slowly, heartburn pretty much gone in minutes.  My favorite way to use it is as a morning cleanser on my face, 1 tsp is all it takes to get my skin feeling soft and looking good.  I.'ve heard honey can last years without going rancid but I can't vouch for it, mines almost gone :)

review/text: I was a little surprised that it is so thick, almost solid, but the taste is great and at room temp it is easy to spread. I like it in oatmeal, and am trying to cut out refined sugar so this makes it easy. It is super sweet, so I use less than I expected each time.<br /><br />Seemed expensive, but really a bargain now that I know how good it is. I will make sure I keep it on ehand from now on.

review/summary: Fantastic honey!
review/text: This was the best honey I have EVER tasted. Also, because the flavor is so strong, I don't have to use as much of it. This in combination with the large jar size means I won't need to buy honey nearly as often anymore. I was a little hesitant to pay this much for honey, but then I went grocery shopping and at the cheapest non-walmart grocery store, it was nearly $4 for a tiny 4 oz. bottle of ultrafiltered, watered-down honey (which I really think shouldn't even count as honey). So, I bought this honey instead, depending on the extremely favorable reviews it had received in the past and I'm SO happy I did. I'm planning on buying more when this jar finally runs out.

It's more solid, though still spreadable, and no where near as sweet as honey.<br /><br />Most honey has high fructose corn syrup in it which makes it too sweet.<br /><br />This is perfect...still sweet but doesn't over power the "honey taste"<br /><br />I put a tablespoon in a couple of hot green tea every morning...NOM NOM NOM!<br /><br />Try it...you'll tank me later!

review/text: This stuff is great, it taste like Candy!<br /><br />The appearance of this stuff is not good and it doesn't smell like you would expect since it is almost untouched. (expected) Per instructions on the jar you can put the jar in warm water to loosen up the Honey to a consistency of Cake Frosting which is great for spreading. I have only used this in Tea so far and it is great. Organic Green Tea with this Honey and some Lemon I picked out back! So awesome.<br /><br />I am currently looking for more ways to use this, I'm thinking of spreading this on some wholewheat pancakes or some toast; Heck a bagel sounds good too. I actually just want to put this on everything. Lol<br /><br />Side note: This comes in a Glass container. To me Organic goods don't belong in Plastic. So this is a great buy!

review/summary: BEST HONEY EVER!!!
review/text: I recently made a health conscious decision to switch from sugar (bad) in my coffee to honey (good!).  I experimented trying various types and specialty flavors.  Most of them overpowered my coffee with a strong aftertaste ...until I found this one.  My search is over.  This is by far the best.  If you're accustomed to the traditional amber colored, runny consistency - get ready, this will not resemble any honey you have ever seen before.  It is very light (off-white) in color and solidified, yet quickly dissolves in hot liquid.  It's super sweet and mild tasting, making for the perfect cup of coffee.  I will stick with this brand knowing that I am getting the healthiest and purest form of honey available.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!

review/text: I am thankful that I can get a surperb honey like YS Honey.  I will not use any other sweetener.  It is YS or nothing.  NEVER that liquidadee stuff that really isn't honey,....it's corn syrup, probably GMO.  Anyway, YS is the real thing.  I do a tablespoon YS with dried goats milk and organic coaco powder, and hot distilled water...yummy.  I am going to try adding an egg yolk and freezing to make my own gourmet ice cream.  Can you imagine, ice cream without sugar...but with healthy raw honey instead?<br /><br />With a sore throat I just take a tablespoon...it is soothing.  Yep, nothing like the real thing.

review/summary: BEST TASTING HONEY EVER
review/text: This is the best tasting honey I've ever had.  After checking prices at several local and not so local stores I also consider it a great value.  I will say though that we've started buying 2 of the smaller 22 oz. jars each order instead of 1 larger 32 oz. jar. Including the 99 cents each jar shipping, it comes out a little cheaper per oz.  Not sure why the 22 oz. jar description calls it "gel".  It's the same solid honey as you get in the 32 oz solid.<br /><br />If you're looking for really good organic natural raw honey this is the best deal around.

review/text: I must say that I am delighted with this honey.  I just opened my first jar this evening.  As I have read in some of the other reviews, yes, I enjoyed eating it out of the jar with a spoon.  What a lovely, delicate sweetness. So good to know that it is healthful for me too.  I may heat some in a dish in some warm water tomorrow, but I already know that I am very happy to have found this lovely honey.<br />I also tried some in a teaspoon with my new Bragg Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, and found it to be extremely flavorful!  I am sure I will be using that combination in many ways.

review/summary: Rich, Creamy, Delicious
review/text: For those of you unfamiliar with this kind of honey (only used to the honey that's been filtered), it's opaque for a reason. This honey will not pour at room temperature, so don't expect it to do so, but I'm glad it won't. This honey is so much better than any honey you can pour will be simply because making it pourable removes the stuff that makes it great.<br /><br />This honey is so sweet and creamy, but there's more to it than that. The flavor builds in your mouth if you try a bit of plain honey and it has subtleties not found in filtered brands (which are more along the lines of wham, bam, thank you ma'am style of sweetness). After tasting this honey and discovering its effects on recipes when compared to filtered honey, I will never buy filtered honey again.<br /><br />And this is aside from the health benefits of buying unfiltered.<br /><br />I really have not tried unfiltered honey before this, so I can't really compare it to other kinds, but this kind is absolutely, 100% delicious.<br /><br />Oh, and someone previously talked about organic honey not actually being a thing. Well, each certification company uses their own standards for certifying honey as organic. OCIA International is the one that certifies this honey and it uses the EU standard (if I'm reading their website right), which is a good standard to use. So yes, this honey is, in fact, organic.

It is perfect, not too strong but with a lot of flavor, and of course it's raw and organic which is the cherry on top!<br /><br />I was raised with honey that tasted awfully strong, and always thought I would never come to like honey... but I LOVE this one.

review/text: This stuff is GOOD, and as another reviewer said you have to be careful because it is that tasty you can overdo!<br /><br />It is REAL. (Sadly these days counterfeit honey is a rampant problem - the raw stuff is hard to counterfeit, but rest assured this is an ethical supplier.<br /><br />The health benefits of raw honey are many as it's a live food, full of enzymes, and acts as prebiotic (containing substances that contribute to a healthier gut and flora in the entire body).<br /><br />It is hard to avoid completely all the processed, 'dead' foods in the modern world, that do little more than add calories and contribute to disease, so adding things like this to our diet, can help a lot.<br /><br />I like it in tea, I put it in the cup first and then pour in the hot water and stir it.<br /><br />I especially love it in a broccoli salad I make - using chopped/grated broccoli stalks & carrots,  organic raisins or dried cherries, and Vegenaise with a tablespoon of this honey -- it is DELICIOUS and a sweet tooth satisfier!

review/summary: Nice Honey
review/text: - It has an alright taste. Reminds me of cough syrup in a very sweet and condensed form. (Keep in mind that honey made in different parts of the world tastes/looks different. This one is from Brazil & Canada)<br />- Easily opened. A bit too easily though...the plastic covering where the cap screws off wasn't even any use. I twisted the cap and the plastic covering came off with it.<br />- Big jar. Putting my entire hand around it, I can only reach halfway.<br />- Can be messy since the honey is very sticky and can also be difficult to get a full spoonful onto a piece of bread without making a mess.<br />- The "expire date" seems strange. I purchased this in mid-2012, and it says "Best by 01/15" even though natural honey shouldn't be able spoil. But I suppose it's required by U.S law. Maybe someone can clear this up?

review/text: My dad picked some of this up from a produce stand while he was out of state. I was at his house visiting, and he had me try a bit on a Ritz cracker. I wasn't so sure I wanted to try it due to the thick waxy looking appearance. It just wasn't what I knew as honey. Once I had one, I had another, and another. This stuff is amazing. I have found myself craving it, but unable to find it any local markets or stores. The waxy appearance is actually a hint at the super creamy texture, and the flavor is so yummy. I am excited to have finally found it, same brand and everything. There are so many ways I want to try this beyond smearing it on a cracker.

review/text: Love this product.  I used it during a upper respiratory infection (URI) and tea with this honey really helped me to kick it.  Obviously, I did have antibiotics to assist but the fact is the normal time for URI to clear is about 2 weeks even with antibiotics.  I kicked in one and didn't even have to worry about the chest sputum it cleared.  I do believe that the combination of meds with the natural organic raw honey helped me to recuperate much quicker than normal.<br /><br />All this aside, it is great for teas and to take alone especially if sore throat or cough.  I tastes great. Definitely recommend.

review/summary: Buying again!
review/text: Bought in Feb. used this last month, loved the product, is really raw honey and not whipped up and gel like.  This stuff is incredible and tastes wonderful.  Raw honey has so much more good stuff... and the price has even dropped from Feb!  And, it is organic... certified!  Just ordered 4 lbs again!  Thanks!

review/text: What a treat to get this in the mail this afternoon! I had to hold back from having more than a heaping tablespoon. This is some yummy honey, oh wow! Thick, velvety consistancy with a smooth, not overly sweet taste. Cannot wait to add to tea and spoon over warm bread. Very pleased- much better than the other brand I tried.
