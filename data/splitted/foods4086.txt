review/text: Huge fan of this crystal light flavor.  I usually find crystal light drink mixes to be rather concentrated, so I mix one packet with 24 oz of water and it comes out just right--not too sweet.  The color of the mixed drink is also easy on the eyes--it is a pale green color, so nothing like the bright red, blue, purple, orange colors that some of the other drink mix flavors will give you.

review/summary: Awesome Green Tea Rasberry
review/text: Crystal Light's Green Tea Rasberry is by far one of the best flavors available. If you haven't tried it, you will not know what enjoyment you are missing. You really can't stop after the first sip. If you are looking for taste first and calories amiss, then you would definitely like this one. My daughter switched from soda's to this great tasting drink, has lost weight, and won't drink anything else. Additionally, it is marketed in packets so we don't have any problems taking it wherever we go. She lives in the mountains and commutes to the valley, so this has been very economical for all of us. If this flavor is not available at your store or they run out, as in my case, don't hesitate to get your order in to Amazon. I found it so easy (this being my first time ordering from Amazon) and got immediate delivery.

review/text: The box is a little different now but the product tastes the same.  I started using these when I was in Iraq last year.  They are usually free at the chow hall and I got addicted to them.  The water there is pretty bad(i.e. tastes like soap or dirt).  I stopped drinking soda a couple of years ago and this is an amazing replacement for it.  I can drink a gallon of it a day and consume less calories then one soda.

review/summary: A drink mix more suitable to adult tastes
review/text: I used to buy Crystal Light's raspberry iced tea in On the Go packets but that product is no longer available on Amazon. The green tea version is a little harder to mix and is less sweet than the previous version but it still is a nice change from plain water.<br /><br />If you've found the regular drink mixes too sweet, I'd recommend you try these green tea blends, which are more suitable to adult tastes.<br /><br />Here's my recipe for a perfect drink: I add the drink mix packet to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVMTP8">Rubbermaid Chug Bottle</a>, an inexpensive water bottle perfect for Crystal Light and Lipton packets. Then, I add 12 oz of water and fill the rest of the bottle with crushed ice. After 30 seconds of shaking I've got an ice-cold drink.<br /><br />Bottom line: Are you tired of drinking plain water all the time? You can save money by skipping bottled teas. These drink mixes are handy at home, at the office and on the road - anywhere you want to avoid drinking your calories.<br /><br />Crystal Light On the Go, Peach Tea<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E55XNE">Crystal Light Ice Tea On-The-Go</a><br />Crystal Light Raspberry Lemonade On-The-Go<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODDU1Y">Lipton White Tea Iced Tea Mix To-Go, Raspberry</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PE4">Lipton Green Tea To Go, Mandarin and Mango</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODC3TY">Lipton Green Tea Iced Tea Mix To-Go, Citrus</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1MS">Lipton Green Tea To Go, Honey & Lemon</a><br />Crystal Light On the Go, Raspberry Ice

It causes there to be a gritty, gross texture to the meat because of the cornmeal, and you have to use a lot more of the product to get the same flavor of the original product, and that only increases the gritty texture.<br /><br />Stop using fillers in your products!

review/summary: Amazing Tea!!!
review/text: I love mint tea, but I prefer caffeine.  It was good for me to find a tea that is both, I love the rich taste and the hint of mint.  I don't normally prefer black teas, but this one is superb.  They have found just the right amount of spearmint to offset the black tea, and it makes for a lovely hand warming delight.  In reference to the people who "don't taste mint", I would assume you aren't steeping the tea for long enough before you drink it.  I steep my tea for around 6 minutes for a bold, delightful flavor.  The mint is unmistakable and lovely.

We consistently go through multiple gallons a week because the taste is so pleasant and refreshing. If you enjoy a delicious glass of iced tea with a slight mint-y bonus, I recommend this! The fact that we can get six at a time delivered for our convenience makes a sweet deal even sweeter.

review/summary: Seems to work
review/text: I have a very sensitive stomach, and drinking energy drinks and coffee or taking caffeine pills is not an option; I throw them up. So I was very excited to try this nasal spray, and disappointed with the results at first. The first couple sprays do not seem to do much, and are slightly painful. However, I have discovered that using one spray per nostril about every half hour keeps me very energized and awake, and oddly, it seems to be more effective the longer you use it (not necessarily the more sprays you use). There is no "rush" like I get from caffeine pills or energy shots, but it definately keeps me awake and alert, and tapers off instead of crashing.<br />I'm also a runner and body builder, and have not noticed any increase in "endurance & strength" as is advertised on the bottle, which is why I gave it only four stars. Not that I really care about that coming from a nasal spray, but it is on the bottle. I guess it might take more time for the "strength and endurance" gains to be noticeable, and if so I'll edit this post.<br /><br />Summary: The more you use it, the more effictive it seems to be. Will be purchasing again.

review/summary: Doesn't work Update 3-20-12
review/text: I thought this might be a good idea, after all caffeine can pass the blood/brain barrier so it makes sense for a product like this to exist. I was quite disappointed with the results of this however.<br /><br />Its easy to use, just a couple sprays in each nostril but you will get sniffles for a while after. I wouldn't mind the sniffles if it actually did anything. You're only getting 4 mg of caffeine with 2 sprays per nostril (compared to 100 mg in a cup of coffee), and it feels like it, no buzz, no wakefulness, nothing.<br /><br />I read the review for this product on caffeinefiend.<br /><br />"I gave myself 2 good sprays in each nostril and got a very refreshing peppermint scent although it did make my nose run a bit. My nasal rush lasted me about two and a half hours before fading out with no crash."<br /><br />Caffeine Fiend is the place to look for all your caffeine needs, so I trusted this review. I think the reviewer got a solid boost of placebo. I'm not even that heavy of a caffeine addict (3 cups of coffee a day for me) and I'm not even sure I can feel anything when I use this product.<br /><br />Unless you have never touched caffeine in your life I don't think you're going to get much out of this. Considering that these little bottles go for 10 bucks a pop I would recommend going somewhere else. Or at the very least if you want to try this product get the single bottle so you won't be stuck with an extra. I opted for 2 because I was so sure this would be amazing. It was an amazing waste of money.<br /><br />UPDATE 3-20-12<br />I've continued using this since I already had it. I will change my previous statement from not working at all to working a little bit. I still find it fairly unpleasant to use due to the runny nose, and sore throat I get. Some people may find more use for it than me. Just have a tissue ready when you give it a go. I still find the price ridiculous.<br /><br />Updated rating from 1 star to 3 stars.

There is a problem with the packaging as others have mentioned but since Klein's Naturals have thus far beat all other dried fruits I have tried, I just put up with the packaging issues.  The problem is really with the box they stick the tubs into. The outer box is too narrow and pushes the containers together at the rims which leads to the lids popping open and seals separating from the tubs during shipping. However, like I said I haven't found anything better or anything as reasonably priced so I don't worry about it.  The outer shrink wrap has held up on my other orders so I just reseal the lids when I remove the tubs from the weird box.  The dried cherries, apricots, cashews and blueberries are excellent too. I wasn't too fond of the peaches because they were a little tough and tart for my taste. I stash bags of these snacks in my backpack to handle untimely hunger pangs on campus without resorting to crappy convenience foods.

review/summary: Taste Good, Packing very poor.
review/text: These apple rings tasted pretty good but the packaging was not up to par.  This product is packed in plastic containers with a weak plastic seal under the green cover.  The six tubs are placed tightly in an open top box and then plastic wrapped.  Due to the tight packaging and normal shipping movement all of the containers had their air tight plastic seal broken (no product left the containers).

review/summary: Great quality organic multigrain cereal
review/text: The Country Choice brand is domestically produced and certified organic by Oregon Tilth.<br /><br />I bought the Multigrain Hot Cereal the first time by accident instead of the steel cut oats but decided to try it rather than return it and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It contains rolled whole grain rye, barley, oats, and wheat in that order.  It is a great hot breakfast on a chilly morning and a nice change from oatmeal.  I like it slightly undercooked and topped with a sliced banana and raisins with a splash of milk.<br /><br />As far as nutrition, a half cup has 5g of fiber!<br /><br />Even if you don't like oatmeal, you might want to give this a try.

review/summary: Try One Carton First - Taste "Okay" But Too Mushy For Me
review/text: This review refers to Country Choice Multi Grain Hot Cereal -<br /><br />For the last few of years I have been hooked on the Irish style Steel Cut Oats. At first I was buying the McCann's, and then I stumbled onto the Country Choice(also Irish style steel cut), which I found just as tasty and satisfying a meal but at a much better deal here. The Steel Cut Oats have a very different texture from regular oatmeal -  creamy but a little chewier feel which I really liked and also it was a meal that kept me going until lunch time without feeling hungry. The steel cut usually takes about 25-30 minutes  to prepare and I found they are well worth the wait.<br /><br />So seeing these and the reviews saying how good they were, I thought I'd add a little variety to my mornings, and reap the benefits of some other type of whole grains. The first thing I found was that these only take 5 minutes max to cook, and I had to make several attempts(even following the directions) to get it to where it wasn't either still sitting in half the water or had absorbed it all before it was actually finished cooking. So getting the ratio of cereal/water part down, I still felt these grains too mushy for me - if I used less water, they would cook too fast. They tasted okay - just okay - I thought the cereal a little on the bland side and have to add honey or something extra.With the oats I could just add some blueberries or raisins or sometimes a tiny bit of a butter substitue just to have a little variety each morning, but the truth is they (the oats) are good enough to eat without anything added at all.Also, I did not feel as satisfied with one serving of the multi-grains as I did with the oats, getting hungry a couple of hours later. So I was a little disappointed with these. I will still use these multi-grain on ocassion(they are not bad, just not as good as I thought they would be)and there is even a recipe for Applesauce Multigrain Muffins which I might try out, or use in some other baking in place of flour.<br /><br />The nutritional facts are pretty close per serving; Multi grains have 1 gr fat,Oats have 3(1 of polyunsaturted, 1 of Monosaturated); Multi- 130 calories a serving, Oats - 150; Neither have any cholesterol or sodium; oats have 1 gr of sugar,multi 0; both have 5 g's of protein; fiber - 5 Multi, 4 Oats; and of course everything comes from the oats/grains themselves, nothing is added to either. Both are orgainc.Both are very healthy foods.<br /><br />So I would suggest to try one carton from your grocery store first, before investing in a multi-package deal - which by the way is a really good deal for both compared to my local markets.<br /><br />Remember to breathe, Eat Healthy...and Enjoy.....Laurie

review/summary: More flavorful than regular oatmeal.
review/text: I recommend this to any one who is eating standard oatmeal everyday.  The texture and flavor of this rolled multi-grain "oatmeal" is so much nicer.  After a while, regular oatmeal seems to have the flavor and texture of wallpaper paste.  This stuff has a deep rich flavor, and a pleasing texture that tastes and feels like real food.  Works in oatmeal cookie recipe's too!!!<br /><br />I like mine with walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, sugar, flax seeds, and a pinch of salt.<br /><br />Another variation I made recently had chopped hazelnuts, flax seeds, sugar, and 3TBSP of non-roasted sesame seeds.  Mmmm...  Hazelnuts and sesame seeds go together very well.

review/summary: TERRIFIC multigrain for baking
review/text: Although I first purchased this cereal to use as a hot cereal, I do not care for the mushy texture of the cereal.  The taste, however, is TERRIFIC.  The cannister included a recipe for muffins made with the mix.  I tried them and they were TERRRIFIC.  I then went on to make a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies using the multigrain cereal instead of oats. They were TERRIFIC.  Moving right along through my recipe box I added some of the multigrain cereal to a pumpkin bread recipe.  Can you guess?  It was TERRIFIC.  Lasly, I may not enjoy eating this cereal solo, but I find using half steel cut oats and half multigrain cereal makes a TERRIFIC porridge.<br />In looking at others reviews I see that most people love this as a cereal.  Texture is a personal preference and I think people who enjoy creamier cereals will enjoy this as well.

review/text: I was on vacation in another state and spotted this on the shelf while shopping for some healthy snacks for a road trip. I only eat whole grains now so decided to give it a try. Well, it is an awesome alternative to even Old Fashioned oatmeal, which I love too. The texture is awesome, way chunkier than any type of oatmeal I've cooked and if it's cooked in the microwave according to directions, you don't have to stir it which preserves the chunkiness. The flavor is excellent and I love that it adds the variety of other grains to my diet.<br /><br />I like to add frozen blueberries or mixed berries right after the microwave dings. This thaws the berries and also helps to cool down the cereal so I can eat it burn free.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon, for carrying this product and offering it at such a reasonable price.

review/text: I have to admit the desire to try Q-Soda was started while traveling outside of the country where club soda often is just water with carbonation which was either to flat or void of any taste.  Q-Soda is just a very clean product and lots of carbonation that delivers a refreshing taste to a normal water break during the day.  The hint of salt is not too great just enough to add some taste and it has zero calories which is also a plus.<br /><br />Also, I have enjoyed the soda and scotch mix, the extra carbonation gives the scotch a better aroma.<br /><br />Cheers

review/summary: Amazing Taste - Lively and Refreshing
review/text: I first had Q Club Soda several months ago when I found it at my local "gourmet" grocery store.  It had been a while since I had had any club soda, probably years.  I had been thirsty all day, and I thought this would quench my thirst.  Well that it certainly did - and more; I just cannot believe how good this club soda is each time I take a drink.  I am not sure exactly what it is that makes it so good.  Maybe it is that pinch of Himalayan salt they put in each bottle, or maybe they fill each bottle with as much carbonation as it can theoretically hold.  Whatever the reason, this beverage is good - I mean really good.  It has become my beverage of choice all day long (except in the morning when I revert to coffee).  This is one smooth club soda.  It is so refreshing.<br /><br />So I got to thinking - other than the pinch of Himalayan salt, I really did not know the first thing about club soda.  Therefore, I did a little research.  Here is what I found out: Club soda goes by many names.  But mainly, it is merely carbonated water, also referred to as sparkling water or seltzer water.  However, believe me when I state that Q Club Soda is not just "merely" carbonated water.  I have been drinking a lot of club soda over the years, just by different names.  All this carbonated water is simply a concoction of carbon dioxide and water.  How simple is that.  This Q Club Soda is unique because of its maximum carbonation and that wonderful pinch of salt.  I am assuming that this Q Club Soda is so good because of the extra fizz and the salt from the region from whence the Yangtze flows.  Either way, I certainly would not want my Q Club Soda to be used for stain remover when spills occur on clothes.  That would be a waste.  I would use my Q Club Soda to relieve an upset stomach, with a touch of bitters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you try Q Club Soda, I hope you like it.

review/summary: Our Family's Favorite Salt
review/text: Do a taste test. Wet your finger and dip it in some standard table salt. Then repeat with the Himalayan Sea Salt. Notice the difference? We sure did. The Himalayan Sea Salt is not as harsh or bitting, and has a sweeter (yes sweeter) aftertaste. A little less than two years ago I started trying different artesian salts. So far, the Himalayan Salt has been my favorite. It has a mellower flavor, though it is still just as salty. There are also the studies that show it is better for you than your over processed and recently made table salt. I am not sure about that, but I know I like it. If it has trace minerals and no pollutants, so much the better.<br /><br />It costs a little more, but I think it is worth it. At least try it and see for yourself.

review/summary: Flintstones Table Salt
review/text: All kidding aside this is a wonderful salt with not quite as sharp or metallic aftertaste as most. It still contains the natural minerals and other than packaging has not gone through the usual bleaching, breakdowns, and processing most others do. I really can taste the essence and all the properties when I use it on less complex culinary preparations as in a poached egg, plain baked Idaho potato, rice, buckwheat, or roasted fowl. You get the idea. If you look carefully you will actually see tiny colored trace elements of rock or mineral. One of my favorite finishing table salts. Save the processed iodized salt with the sharp sometimes bitter aftertaste for your ice ridden sidewalks during winter or lay it down around your vegetable garden to get rid of those pesky snails! A little to pricey for brining or cooking with a lot of other components, herbs, spices, etc, etc, so I use my kosher Morton's for that and use this only for finishing flavor enhancements. Love the Amazon Prime as well as you know how expensive some of these sellers shipping and handling can get.

review/text: I went to wholefoods and saw they had a salt section with something like 20 salts or more and 20 pepper varieties. I bought about 7 of each. They don't carry either of my (now) two favorite salts. I tried all of those as well as some other brands like celtic (which tends to clump).<br /><br />NO COMPARISON.<br /><br />Himala is the creme de la creme.<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE: I sell some items on amazon and one of the items I sell is Himalyan salt but NOT this brand.  The brand I sell is WBM.  BUT, as other reviewers have mentioned, while the "Himala" brand is a little more expensive, it is the best tasting and worth the price.  I use it on all finished foods.  I have containers that I keep in every car. Our family goes through this product faster than almost any other food product.  The WBM brand is better (and more cost effective) to use IN cooking...breads, recipes, etc.  This Himala is definitely worth your consideration.  Others have mentioned the health benefits and I'm completely sold on Himalayan salt for that purpose, but mainly, my review is to point out that this stuff is WAAAAAY tasty!

review/summary: The only salt we use in our family plus health benefits
review/text: We've been using this salt in our home for about 3 months now. Let me just say I won't use any other salt ever again! I've never liked the taste of salt or used it much in cooking. This salt is completely different. The flavor is so much better and doesn't have a bite to it, it's mild. It really enhances flavors of the food you put it in. I compare the taste of table salt as black pepper and Himala Salt as white pepper when people ask about taste. It took my husband awhile to get used to the salt as far as how much to put in his food.  At first he said it took more to get his food "salted" but now since this is all we use it doesn't take as much to "salt" his food. The health benefits of this salt are: regulating the water content throughout your body, promote a healthy pH balance in your body, help with sinus health, regulation of your blood pressure(of course to much of any salt is bad for blood pressure), and helps your body detox. Himala Salt is pure, unprocessed salt with all the minerals left in. The salt can get expensive if you use lots of it. In my opnion though I can't put a price on something that is good for my health in moderation. If you want to try some before you get a 6 pack most health food stores carry Himala Salt.

review/summary: Fantastic chocolate taste, filling protein bar!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I have a monstrous sweet tooth. I'm pretty sure I've tried every protein bar out there, and this is the best one I've had by far. This bar is filling, but most protein bars are filling. What Think Thin Chocolate Fudge accomplishes is truly remarkable. The chocolate actually tastes like chocolate and not some contrived chocolate-imposter. The texture is chewy and smooth at the same time. When I eat these, I don't just feel like I'm "making do", when really, I'd rather have a cookie.

review/summary: Excellent but watch the temperature
review/text: "thinkThin Chocolate Fudge, 2.1-Ounce Bar (Pack of 10)" taste excellent so long as they are always kept at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and below 80 degrees Fahrenheit. I live in the desert southwest, so when I first ordered these from Amazon last summer, and it was well over 110 degrees Fahrenheit, what I received was a mess, so I put them in the Fridge. Went from too hot to too cold, the taste was gritty and messy as the chocolate enrobing shattered and fell off, still better than 110 degree puddles I was first presented.  Now that it's winter, and the weather is between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, every bar I have received from Amazon has been perfect. I store the bars at room temperature. The bars are smooth, moist and chewy, perfect in all the ways I expected.  I will need to order a 6 month supply before May if I want to enjoy these bars during the very hot summer months. So, for everyone who is having taste troubles with these particular bars, try to schedule a shipment when your local weather will be  above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and below 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

review/summary: Pretty good for a protein bar
review/text: For the haters...seriously?  Protein bars never taste like real brownies or candy bars, so I feel like the complainers are newbies to the protein-scene.  If you find a decent one like this, with this much protein, you go with it.<br /><br />I eat one of these every night I work (night-shift cardiac nurse).  Makes me feel full without making me tired from excess carbs. Zero sugar in these; good job.<br /><br />Incidentally, I have had several types of the Think Thin bars, and I think this one tastes the best.  Not bad for a protein bar, and even better with a big cup of coffee.  Wish the chocolate flavor was a little stronger, but not a deal breaker.  I just bought another box.

This one is the best by FAR out of all of them.  The others have gritty textures (Lemon Cream has that nasty dish soap taste) and not so good aftertastes (Creamy PB is 2nd best. The others suck!) The fudge flavor also has a fudgy texture! Totally does not taste like something meant to be a supplement/healthy! Strongly recommend!

review/summary: BEST Gluten Free & Just Protein Chocolate Bar Out There
review/text: I have recently started following a gluten-free diet for medical reasons, so this bar is amazing because it is gluten free and delicious. However, I tried almost every protein bar on the market before going gluten-free and this chocolate fudge flavor is the best. Why?<br /><br />Reason #1) Most protein bars have, well, for lack of better words, a "protein" taste and the chocolate flavor rarely resembles chocolate. However, the chocolate fudge actually tastes like chocolate. It is delicious. It is amazing. It is chewy. It is full of chocolately goodness. It is a snack I look forward to eating, not just forcing myself to eat for the protein.<br /><br />Reason #2) It has 0 grams of sugar - it is sweetened with malitol instead - a natural sweetener. This makes it healthy, diabetic friendly, as well as delicious.<br /><br />Reason #3) It has 20 grams of protein. I really dont know if I need to further elaborate here. Thats alot of protein for a small delicious bar. Its perfect for a quick snack or pre-workout boost.<br /><br />I can't say enough wonderful things about this bar.

review/text: I ordered the chocolate fudge, crunchy peanut butter, creamy peanut butter, and white chocolate. The chocolate fudge is by far my favorite, it had the consistency of a fudge brownie soft and moist with all the chocolate flavor. The peanut butter flavors were the worst as neither had any peanut taste. The crunchy peanut butter had no crunch, I looked at the bar and it had what appeared to be peanuts but evidently they were not really nuts I couldn't discern any difference in terms of initial taste between the 2 peanut butter, but the crunch did leave an after taste while the creamy did not. I just cant get over how good the texture is definite rebuy of the chocolate flavor.

They were very good in refunding my money, but that doesn't help when I need the product.<br /><br />I suggest that nobody buy these chocolate fudge bars.

I've tried other protein bars that taste sweet and more like real chocolate for example "Oh Yeah" bars (but those have more sugar).<br /><br />If you value a good tasting protein bar stay away from this one. I do like the fact that it has 0 sugar, perhaps this is why it tastes like nothing. I will give it three stars just because it has no sugar and these bars do not taste bad (taste like nothing).
