review/summary: Love the texture and the flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to "pop" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a "use by" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.

Costco really has the best price, when they are available there. Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals.

review/text: I recently discovered Popchips and their greatness. So I have been trying them out flavor by flavor. The Chili Lime has is now my favorite. It had previously been the Salt & Pepper. It is def not too spicy, so don't let that scare you. If anything the lime is the highest note of flavor. If you already like Popchips, this is a new great flavor to try. If you have never tried them, then this is a great flavor to start with.

review/summary: I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!
review/text: These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Great crispy crunch and flavor
review/text: My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

review/text: I really liked these.  Great snack for someone watching their fat and or calorie intake.  Light, crunchy and full of flavor.  They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor - Review
review/text: In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.

review/text: The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.

review/summary: Satisfies a sweet potato tooth
review/text: Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.

review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

review/text: For someone who is allergic to corn, soy and wheat the Original Pop Chips are a must have for the pantry. I can finally have nachos! I think they taste much better than the traditional "chips". My family finally tried them (most foods I can eat don't taste this good!) and now they are hooked too. These chips are like gold in our house!!

review/summary: Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips
review/text: Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/summary: Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier
review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

review/text: When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.<br /><br />I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Ahmad Flavored Tea Bags
review/text: A year ago while travelling I bought a small box of Ahmad Black Current tea bags and really liked it.  I was not able to find Ahmad tea in the town where we live but found them at Amazon.  There were several other flavors that appealed to me, Peach tea and Apricot tea, so I ordered the 3 flavors.  Since the minimum order was 6 boxes of each I surely hoped that I would like them all!  :)  Yes.  Very good tea.  I'm down to 1 box of each left so it's about time to reorder.

review/text: I bought this specifically for making iced tea and have not been disappointed.<br /><br />The only thing I find with the Ahmad varieties I've tried is that the black tea is strong and you have to be careful not to let it steep too long.  I normally do 4 minutes, but with this one, 3 is the maximum if I don't want a bitter taste.<br /><br />This is also very nice hot with milk and a little sugar. I use either raw cane or coconut sugar - both are very tasty.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: Ever since Williams-Sonoma created a tea for each season about a dozen years ago, I've been searching for a tea as good as their (now discontinued) Summer Tea, which was flavored with mango, passionfruit and had marigold petals in it.  This one is about as close as I've come...it has lots of fruity/slightly floral/peachy flavor and is excellent iced.  The price is good and it should last all summer.  My only gripe is that it's not really a green product b/c EACH teabag is individually wrapped...really not necessary.  Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that this tea is better than the plain peach tea.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I love Ahmad teas and this particular flavor is my favorite, bar none.  It is amazingly good hot or iced.  It is so soothing on a cold day with a bit of orange honey, or refreshing on a hot day by itself.  I can drink gallons of this stuff during the summer months if it weren't for the negative nocturnal effects.  The mango flavor is also great, but the Ahmad Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea is my all time favorite (right up there with the passion fruit tea from the Cheesecake factory).  Will have to try Ahmad's apricot flavor as it is also rated high.

review/text: I have been drinking Pil�o Coffe for many years now and I just love it.  I usually buy my Pil�o Coffee from Amigo Foods in Florida.  This time I decided to get it from Amazon (Sara Lee) because of the free shipping.  However, when I opened the coffee package, the aroma just was not the same.  After brewing two cups of the coffee, I knew that it is definetely not Pil�o Coffee.  I called Amazon and the service lady was very nice and refunded my money.  I do however have a question to Sara Lee for selling something that to me is fraudulent - namely, not what the product claims to be.  If I could give a lower rating thatn one star I would have.

review/summary: Medium strong, delicious Brazilian coffee
review/text: My husband and I are great appreciators of Brazilian culture, enjoying the TV Globo cable channel for several years now with its novelas and live Carnaval broadcasts.  We were delighted when Macy's had a Brazilian promotion a couple months ago, and purchased a couple bags of this Pilao coffee, which Macy's charmingly packaged in little burlap coffee sacks.  We like a medium-strong coffee, and one of our favorites is Starbucks Colombian which is less bitter than most of their varieties (to us, not everyone), and this Pilao is very similar to that but slightly stronger with no bitter aftertaste.  I agree with most reviewers in that it is too strong for all-day drinking, but for that morning eye-opener it is just about perfect, and adds a little Brazilian samba to your day!

It is a perfect blend (not too much tea, not too much peach) and not overly sweet. I am a convert!!

review/text: I bought a smaller 5 oz. can of this from my local drugstore to try. Processed meat in a can almost never tastes like the freshly prepared version, and this one is no different. The texture has changed considerably because of the canning process. The pieces are large and chunky, with the flavor and appearance very similar to canned solid white tuna. I added two photos to the product gallery to show the texture of the pieces.<br /><br />The broth is a bit on the salty side, but overall, I would buy this product again. It is good on its own or mixed with rice and beans or salad if you are short on time or cooking skills. The only thing that I would add is possibly having a pull-ring top that doesn't need a can opener to open.

Ouch.<br />My local grocery store has 16oz jars for $3.26, or $0.20/ounce.

review/summary: Good Stuff for the healthy eater but obscenely priced here
review/text: Smuckers Natural Creamy peanut butter is an excellent choice for those that refuse to consume partially and fully hydrogenated oils and fats. It's flavorful with the only drawback being the oil separation which in all fairness is a common trait of all natural peanut butters. The prices reflected on here are obscenely high as one may purchase this product at Wal-Mart for $4.98 per 26 oz. jar which would total around $10.00 for the pair listed and is less than half the cost asked by this seller.

Amazon will ship everywhere though and if this is what you want you will pay the extra money to have it. Im glad you are not docking the product based on price just remember that not everyone in the united states has a grocery store or walmart close to them.

review/summary: Great tasting and delicious!
review/text: I have been wanting to start a healthier lifestyle and was looking for a natural peanut butter without the added sugars and oils. I chose Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter because it is made with only peanuts and salt. Although, I like their creamy peanut butter, it is a little grainy or gritty. But overall, it has a delicious natural peanut butter taste and great for a healthy snack or added in smoothies.

review/summary: Thank you, Art Donovan.....
review/text: I NEVER ate SPAM until I read in Art Donovan's book "Fatso" about how he hid a case of it under his bed during basic training. The sergeant found it and asked Art what he was going to do with it. "Eat it!" said Art.  "Well, eat it you will!" said the Sarge (or something like that) and I believe he gave Art a deadline to finish that whole case of SPAM. Well, Art ate and ate and went thru that case of SPAM, and in the process of doing so, "Fried SPAM" was mentioned.<br /><br />Somehow, that whetted my appetite, and I went out and bought one TIN of SPAM -- cut a slice or two and fried it - noting that it sort of slid around in the pan on its own power -- (i.e., NO grease or shortening was needed). Eventualy I finished the tin, and felt like my innards were sliding around for a few days afterwards.<br /><br />Was the SPAM good? YES!! Was it cloying? YES!<br /><br />Would I buy it and fry it again? Maybe... in very thin slices, or maybe cook it (and drain it periodically) with pineapple -- because SPAM tastes GREAT!!!.<br /><br />Thank you SPAM, Thank you Art Donovan!

review/text: Gosh, I hate to admit it but I love this stuff. Spam is one of my guilty little pleasures in life.<br /><br />I get hungry late at night and a fried Spam sandwich absolutely hits the spot.  I like to cook it until the edges sort of curl and get just a bit brown, add horseradish and mustard and tuck-in.<br /><br />I also always carry cans of this when I am camping.  It is fast and easy to prepare and fills you up with a minimum of hassle.<br /><br />As to the ways of preparing this stuff...well, that is only limited by your imagination.  There are entire cookbooks devoted to the preparation of Spam dishes.<br /><br />Now this is not something I eat every day.  This is not something that is classified as a health food.  But I really do not care about that and I have absolutely no fear of the food police what-so-ever...hey, I buy fast food from time to time and actually eat it public without slinking home out of sight of the food critics.<br /><br />This is good stuff folks...eat it and enjoy.

review/summary: Heritage Food!
review/text: Look what I found in the new Langenscheidt French-English Dictionary!<br />SPAM: 1. an undesired, unwelcome commercial message delivered via the internet; 2. a tinned block of meat by-products, fed in America by urban liberals to their lapdogs and by conservatives to their children.<br /><br />Criminy! How spiteful can they get? SPAM used to be made exclusively at the Hormel packing plant in Austin, Minnesota, where some of my own uncles and great uncles worked. Those were good UNION jobs, though the aroma of the plant made living anywhere nearby less than idyllic. Kids I knew grew to be "above average" on a diet rich in SPAM. Most of them are still above average... in girth. The heirs of the Hormel packers, by the way, include the first "gay" American ambassador (to Luxembourg).<br /><br />Here's how to make a SPAM sandwich fit for a Congressman: First, fry a thick slab of SPAM till it's crisp on the edges. Toast two slices of soft white bread. Spread mayo on one slice and slather the other with ballpark mustard. Build the sandwich with the SPAM and a slab of Velveeta cheese. Toast the whole thing in the oven or toaster-oven, and wash it down with a 32-ounce bottle of your favorite brown diet soda.

review/summary: Great Product For a Number of Reasons
review/text: While there exists a rather negative stereotype about Spam, it is actually one of the best products you can get when it is on sale. First of all it tastes alright. I mean if you eat a hotdog once in a while or some sort of processed meat, this cannot be more harmful to you than those products. Yes, it probably contains some parts of the animal that you would not eat by itself, like cartilage. Thing is nutritionally those parts are not bad at all for you.<br /><br />Second, canned Spam will last longer than non canned meats. This is a good thing to put a bunch of boxes of spam of whatever varieties you like into your storage space just in case there is a disaster or shortage of food. You know if there is a shortage of food (which I hope never happens) that meat cost will go up first. Spam can provide a good alternative if you've stocked up on it. Third reason is that there are multiple varieties of Spam, which means if you cannot consume too much salt, you can buy low sodium spam. If you like poultry there is Turkey Spam.<br /><br />That is why I respect Spam. I personally would get it for the 2nd reason

review/summary: Guilty pleasure
review/text: Spam in a can, reviled by so many you'd think nobody ever ate it. They do though, or it wouldn't still be selling so well.<br />I love spam. Thin sliced, fried and made into a sandwich, cubed in omelets, with potatoes. It's classic saltiness is an occasional guilty pleasure for me.<br />If you haven't had it before, you open the can using the pull tab on top, and slide a butter knife around the edges to separate the meat from the can, it slides out on to your waiting cutting board. The meat (using the term loosely meaning just animal protein) is a pinkish color brick, about the shade of ham, but not quite. It's covered in a jelly like coating. Cut it thinly into slices and put it into a frying pan at medium temperature. It spits and hisses with the fat. After a minute or two, flip it over. Enjoy the scent of the Spam cooking. When it's browned on both sides, and has shrunk up a bit from the fat cooking out of it, put it between two slices of bread. Spam sandwich.<br />If you want to get fancy with it, cook up onions, peppers and thin sliced Spam, add some cheese.<br />It keeps for a very long time, so it's worth buying in bulk packages to save money.

review/text: The Spam was a bit saltier than I remembered, but overall was in good condition.  The color and texture were similar to store bought ham.  I think boiling it for a bit to leech out some of the salt will help with that.  The shipping was prompt, and compared to the local BJs, the price was roughly the same given that I used the 'subscription' feature to order.<br /><br />However, after doing a bit of reading about BPA (Bisphenol A), it seems like any canned product with BPA will have adverse health effects, and sadly Hormel spam is no exception.  I'll happily eat the remainder, but be wary of feeding too much of it to young children.

It's so easy to prepare.  It can be eaten right out of the can, but I usually fry it up.  Cut thin and fried to a crisp is best, but thicker and just warmed up is good, also.  I like bringing it along on my camping trips.  That way, I can have meat that isn't jerky and I don't have to worry about keeping it cold.  My son even loves it, and believe me, he is the world's pickiest eater.  So glad I saw that Spam truck.

review/summary: Back to the future with Spam
review/text: When I was growing up, we ate a fair amount of Spam.  Every so often, I revisit those days, by purchasing some Spam and trying to enjoy it. And I think of the old Monty Python segment focusing on Spam. . . .<br /><br />It's not so easy for me to enjoy! Plain Spam, even cooked, doesn't do it for me.  I start out with good intentions of eating it as part of a meal and normally throw quite a bit of it out. So, this time around, I tried something different--a fried Spam sandwich.<br /><br />I cut up and fried some shallots, slathered a couple pieces of bread with Dijon mustard and catsup, and melted some American cheese over the Spam.  And it worked! This time, I successfully fixed something that didn't feature the Spam taste.  The result was an enjoyable sandwich.<br /><br />So, instead of throwing out all the Spam (as has happened in the past), I'm going to use my imagination this time in preparing this for a meal. In the past, this would have rated 1 to 2 stars; this time around, I'll give it three.

review/summary: Can't get enough...it is becoming a problem
review/text: Hi,<br /><br />My name is Henry, and I'm a SPAM-oholic. It first started when I was a small child. My father was the typical hoarder type. What better to hoard than some type of meatish product that doesn't have to be refrigerated? The answer: nothing. Nothing is better than SPAM! I used to sneak out to the cellar and take cans and cans of SPAM back to my room. I just couldn't get enough of the stuff. When I was 11 year old, my dad died of a SPAM related heart attack. In his will and as his only child, he left me with most of his inheritance. I was unaware of his addiction to SPAM. He had several storage units full of SPAM. These units were causing him to go bankrupt, but now that is my problem. I decided I was going to give it away, but I couldn't simply give away such a tasty treat. As I contemplated what to do with literally a ton of SPAM, I opened up a can and ate. I continued eating and eating until I could eat no more. I don't know what it was....maybe some combination of depression from losing my Dad, Post Traumatic Stress from back in Nam that just won't go away, and the fear of Bane find my secret stash of SPAM and using it to gain infinite power. Whatever it was, it cause me to be addicted. I began to eat SPAM for every meal: breakfast, 2nd breakfast, elevensies, brunch, lunch, afternoon tea, supper, dinner, and of course the coveted after midnight meals that occur at 1,2,3, and 5 in the morning. I love SPAM and am addicted.

review/text: I didn't know Amazon was selling food. You can even get it delivered to your front door. Well, at least if you live in the 48 contiguous states (whatever that means). Personally, I preferred the Soviet queuing system, I mean it built character, but I suppose American capitalism does have its seductive charm.
