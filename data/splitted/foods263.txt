review/summary: Tully's Italian Roast K Cups
review/text: Do Not purchase these! 90% of the cups burst spilling grounds into the mug. I called the Company directly they really had no cares. They told me to contact Amazon to send them back. Amazon does not accept food product returns. Amazon was great enough to refund this portion of my order. I will not buy these ever again. I sent Tully's an email expressing my displeasure and I have not heard back from them. Lousy customer service!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: Excellent coffee, bad k-cups
review/text: The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.  However, we have an explosion with about every other k-cup.  The foil seal on the top breaks and coffee and grounds spew out the top.  Wouldn't be surprised if shipping in the summer heat weakened the adhesive that seals the foil.  I'd buy it again because I like the coffee so much, but be prepared to clean up messes if you get a batch of k-cups like we did.

review/summary: Good Morning Cup
review/text: Love my Keurig Coffee Maker for convenience, but hard pressed to find a K-Cup that is strong enough for my first morning cup without a bitter taste.  Tully's Italian does the job.  I drink my coffee black and like a rich coffee taste, Tully's Italian does the job. Shipment arrived promptly in good condition, although the packing box was damaged, torn and crushed.  A book was packed on the bottom without padding and was badly bruised and rumpled, but the coffee came through okay.  I complained to Amazon but never heard back from them with a sorry or offer to replace the book even though I explained it had been purchased for a gift and was now unfit to use as such.  I explained it was a poor job of packaging a soft cover book, since there was no padding or buffer under or around the book and it was jammed into the bottom of the box -- Amazon never responds to complaints about damaged goods.

review/summary: WOW! I can taste the difference
review/text: First of all- I am not a sophisticated coffee connoisseur.<br /><br />I actually think that McDonald's coffee is far more drinkable than Starbuck's burnt rubbish.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as K-Cups, I used to buy "Timothys" and it met my needs.<br /><br />But when I tried Tully's Italian blend for first time today, wow!!- this is very appealing and is so easy to drink. Just the right strength and kick.<br /><br />I noticed that the lids on the k-cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit - clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.<br /><br />I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much - but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.<br /><br />I do not know if the "bulge" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K-cups for a long time.

review/text: I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the "best" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Tully's.....the best!
review/text: I have been drinking tully's for a while now and I have finally taken the time to type a review. If you are looking for a strong, yet smooth and refined coffee this is it! It is not bitter nor does it leave an after-taste. I have turned so many of my friends and family on to it, that they only drink this brand themselves; many of them switching over to a Keurig just for it. I am an extreme coffee drinker and have experienced the bitter and waterty varieties of coffee, so I know bad coffee when I taste it. Tully's is my favorite coffee and is absolutely the best I have tried and the only kind I will buy.

review/text: If you enjoy smooth, strong, DELICIOUSNESS, please please please don't waste your time with other Keurig K-cups. I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7-11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain). This coffee has a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness and none of the bitterness going down. I could not recommend it more. This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM.

review/text: I am a very picky coffee drinker.  I don't know or follow what critics may view as the best coffee, only my own taste buds.  There is just something great about the aroma and taste of this Italian Roast. As mush as I didn't want to give any of mine away, I wanted others to try it and hear if they agree and THEY DID. I had everyone asking where I bought it so they could get their own.  Now I am out and need to buy more.  I thought it would be no big deal b/c I have more of another brand to drink, but it's just not the same, coffee in the morning can make your day and if it's not the right one....well, you know. I will continue to buy Tully's Italian Roast and so will my friends and family whom have tried it.

review/text: The arrival of a K-cup coffee maker in our home has been somewhat controversial because we didn't brew a truly great cup of coffee for several weeks after we got it. We kept working through samples of different flavors, and finally found this.  To be honest, I still don't think it's truly great -- not as good as what we were able to make before w/a conventional drip coffee maker or French Press -- but it's pretty darn good.  But measured against the rest of the field, it's the best we've tried, thus the high rating.

review/summary: Great coffee BAD containers!
review/text: We loved this coffee. The "K" containers they come in are AWFUL! Out of 14 boxes we have used 21 cups have leaked and spoiled the brewed coffee. Tullys did send us a  box to replace the cups from our 1st order of 4 boxes from Amazon. 3 of those containers leaked. We tried 2 local food stores for 6 boxes at various times and the cups in those leaked also.We have stopped using Tullys, we are sad. :(<br /><br />(the foil lids become detached from the container causing coffee grinds and water to leak out and into the coffee cup)

review/summary: Albacore shouldn't smell this fishy
review/text: Good quality canned albacore tuna has very little fishy taste or smell.  Sadly, Chicken of the Sea is not a good quality albacore tuna.<br /><br />These days, I buy albacore because "regular" canned tuna smells so strong,it makes me want to gag. (Think cheap cat food.)  It tastes too fishy, and is filled with less than desirable pieces. (Skin, etc.) Albacore contains "cleaner" meat chunks and I rarely ever see any bad bits in the can. It's paler in color and has a much more desirable flavor.<br /><br />Growing up, my Mom always bought "regular" tuna, (as opposed to albacore) and I never remember it smelling as strong as "regular" tuna does now. I've tried many different brands, and I've finally realized that I have to move to the pricier albacore for a better "tuna" experience.<br /><br />This Chicken of the Sea Albacore is very watery, (more to drain off) and the consistency in the can is "loose." (As opposed to "chunky") It seems more processed than other brands. It has a stronger odor and taste than I prefer, and this will keep me from buying it again.

review/text: These olives were introduced to me by a food freak; nothing but the best for his family.  When I tried one, I immediately went online to try to find them.  Fortunately, Amazon handled them.  I knew they were coming in large cans so I had 3 one pint caning jars on hand; just scoop out the olives into the jars and keep in refrigerator until you need the next can.  These olives are a different universe from premium stuffed olives in supermarkets.  You will never know what a really superb Martini is without them.

review/summary: Lifesavers without the holes, and more flavors.
review/text: First came across Charms when my parents received one of those boxes of 1950's candies as a gift, most of which was nearly inedible, but Charms was one of the few things I tried which actually tasted good.  Essentially Charms is just like a Lifesaver (maybe they came before?) only better.  Instead of a circle with a hole in the middle they are squares with little indention's (they kind of look like Halls cough drops) so you get more candy for your buck.  They also have more flavors, off the top of my head in addition to the typical flavors there's green apple, orange, and strawberry (maybe a few more different ones). And the 3rd best thing, they're individually wrapped, which makes it easier to carry a few around in your pocket and insure they don't get dirty.  Really not sure why these things haven't aren't more popular, much better than Lifesavers in terms of pocket candy.

review/summary: A necessary bland accompaniment
review/text: My favorite cracker to serve with a fine cheese like Brie is table water crackers, particularly by Carr. The long box is filled with a single round of packaged crackers. Each cracker has a taste that is bland and subtly crisp.<br /><br />Carr's also offers a variety of its water crackers: bite sized, with cracked pepper (another favorite), golden, a mixed assortment, and, of course, wheat.<br /><br />So in review: a plate of water crackers, Brie slices, grapes (red or green), and a bottle of merlot. I love a red wine with my cheese and crackers. Sometimes a loaf of fresh French bread is great to smear a nicely mellowed brie over it, bite by bite.

For instance, I've used spelt and whole wheat flour (separately) to make pancakes from scratch and spelt won by far! It gives a whole different taste to pancakes compared with white flour but with spelt, a much healthier choice.

review/summary: Finally - a sweeter I am comfortable with!
review/text: I use this mainly for sweetning my tea.<br />Was concerned about sugar, afraid of saccharine, stevia could get bitter and had its own set of warnings.<br />Raw honey was certainly more natural, but still high glycemic.<br /><br />I was so relieved when I discovered organic Agave Nectar.<br />Very low glycemic, and sweeter than sugar or honey, so used less.<br />How deceived I felt when I started reading about *why* it was low glycemic.<br />It is really just light high fructose corn syrup! (HFCS also is low glysemic).<br />The problem with AN and HFCS is it rushes right to your liver and gets processed there!  Intakes "may indirectly harm the liver by increasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and elevated blood levels of triglyceride fat, all of which in turn increase the risk of liver disease." [...]<br />So the search was on to once again find something that could sweeten up my tea and not harm me!<br />This Palm Sugar is perfect! One tsp has only 10 calories and 2.5 gm carbs, yet has a glycemic index of only 35- about the same as the now-dreaded AN, and much lower than regular sugar or honey. Also, palm sugar has a good amount of nutrients and minerals in it. While I certainly do not consider it a health food I am pleased to know that instead of impacting harm it could be doing a little good!<br /><br />Be careful of what brand you buy.<br />I heard that some american companies are mixing it with cane sugar; other brands have more calories than this organic one from Navitas.<br /><br />The taste? Perfect! Has a slight light-brown sugar flavor. Definitely does not over-power but rather enhances the drink.<br />I have not cooked with it mainly because I have not yet cooked any sweets since this arrived. Would I? Hard to say. I would love to, but I think of it as special, and not sure if I would want to waste it by having it lost in a cookie. But then that subtle flavor...I'm thinking it would be awesome in biscotti!

review/summary: Nothing Like the Cans-Don't Waste Your Time
review/text: I purchased a couple of these for a luau because I was expecting something close to what we get in the cans in Hawaii.  After opening the packet, they smelled really close and this is where the goodness ended.  After adding the water, I took a sip and it was some of the worst stuff that I had ever tasted.  All it really ended up being was colored sugar water and did not taste anything remotely close to the drink in the can.  If you are looking for Hawaiian Sun products, skip this one and go with the cans.  Save yourself the embarrassment of making this for a party and having to take it away.  If I could give this product negative stars, I would.

review/text: There is no other brand that offers a vegan organic pet product like this. I am very happy with it. I feed my dogs organic raw food, but when I ran out of ingredients or while travellin I open a can and give it to them. The food is very dry and I usually have to mix a bit of water so my dogs don't have a hard time swallowing. They absolutely love the food. I have a peace of mind that I'm giving them the best I can find.

review/text: I opened a can and it smelled like cigarettes which I was informed was bad bacteria.  I reported this to Amazon whom I got it from and they sent me another 6 pack for replacement BUT it also smelled badly...At this point I gave up trying. I am all for organic but this stuff was poor in my opinion.  Allot of it seemed like hard rice and it smelled like cigarettes and bad bacteria.  I wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: GREAT delicious chocolate peanut butter
review/text: I love this peanut butter.  I am someone who has to eat peanut butter everyday.  Eating regular peanut butter in this manner will make me fatter than I want to be so this is a great substitute.  It has the taste of reese's peanut butter cups.  If you want it sweeter add a natural sugar substitute.  If you want a peanut butter drink just make it extra watery or mix it with milk.  I could live on this stuff.  I only wish it came in a better container as the bag makes it hard to not get it everywhere.  I will be dumping it into a glass jar soon as I ordered 4 bags.  It makes it easier to scoop from a hard container.  I have tried the non chocolate version of this but will only eat it when I run out of the chocolate as I have a major sweet tooth.

review/summary: A Chocolate Lover's Dream
review/text: This is the second time I've ordered this chocolate peanut butter, but I liked it so much that I ordered it in the 4 pack package.  I like it better than the regular version, probably because I am a chocoholic rather than a peanut butter enthusiast.  I especially like the fact that a two tablespoon portion of this chocolatey spread only has a one point value on Weight Watchers, not only making it a great snack but also a low point one.  I love putting it on a rice cake, either plain or with a tiny bit of preserves, or just eating it off the spoon!  I love this stuff!

review/text: It has the best taste I use in smoothies with my protein shakes or plain I use it twice a day, you can use just in milk with ice cubes blend in blender better than a malt but you can use in many other things too. I'm so glad I found it a friend gave me my first package I like the chocolate one better but for those who don't like chocolate they have it without. Wish I'd of known about this sooner. Hope to keep ordering it here, don't ever stop carrying it.

review/summary: Makes my cats CRAZY
review/text: Not all cats are lactose intolerant and my kitties have gotten real cream now and again as a treat.  I thought I would give this stuff a try just out of curiosity.  I was not prepared for the reaction.  Both my cats turn into meowing, begging lunatics as soon as they see the box.  They both recognize the box when I pull it out of my grocery bag.  It is absolutely insane.  My local Petco has stopped carrying this, which is very sad because shipping these little suckers is expensive.  Amazon... please start carrying this stuff!!  Until then I will have to pay for the outrageous shipping because there might be a cat mutiny at my house if I run out!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Petco is obviously stocking this stuff again!  Yay!

review/text: My cat gets some every morning for breakfast.  He only gets about 4 tablespoons in a little bowl, but asks for it if I don't put it down in a timely manner.<br />It's great if your cat likes milk or cream products because it won't upset their gastrointestinal track and satisfies their craving and/or need.<br />The price is right and I always keep some on hand.

review/summary: My cat loves it! Good alternatives for cats that hate water, and to keep them hydrated!
review/text: I've been to hell and back with a cat that hates drinking water. In the beginning my cat liked tap water, then only drank bottled water, and now refuses to drink it at all. I thought about investing in a cat water fountain but didn't want to spend the money on the fountain or the replacement filters. I read online that many cats enjoy cat-sip and thought I'd give it a try...my cat went to it as soon as he saw me pouring the cat-sip out of the paper pouch and started drinking right away...he's drinking it right now as I'm writing this review! My cat hasn't been drinking water for about a week. I switched him over to wet foods but didn't think that was enough, and this is perfect to keep his eyes and heart healthy, plus keep him hydrated!

review/summary: Dogs really do love it too!
review/text: Both of my dogs are in love with this product. They get so happy when I give it to them and drink it all up right away. Two of my cats enjoy it quite a bit, but my third cat wouldn't even try it. She sniffed it and walked away. I would definitely recommend this product as so many people feed their cats real milk, which is terrible for them. Cats are lactose intolerant! Feeding cats regular milk can (and usually will) cause loose bowels and real stomach discomfort. This stuff has lactose enzymes in it to help them digest it. Also, it often goes on sale at PetSmart for .99 cents or $1.19. Even at full price it's still relatively inexpensive. The only real negative comment I have is that if you don't use it within a few days of opening it, the spout gets all crusty and the milk at the bottom of the carton gets thick. It may still be fine to feed this to them in that condition, but I am paranoid and often end up throwing out half the carton because I don't use it quickly enough.The ingredients are awesome, actual real low-fat milk plus a digestive enzyme plus added taurine (an essential nutrient for cats).<br /><br />PS- MUCH better than the Whiskas CatMilk. (That stuff is watered down and loaded with a bunch of random, non-natural ingredients)

review/summary: Picky Cat Adores CatSip
review/text: Bought CatSip years ago as a treat for our picky cat.  Unfortunately for us, she loves it!<br /><br />This product causes no digestive issues for our cat.  The color of the milk is a definite off-white / light tan, so don't be alarmed if trying it for the first time.  Although the box is small (juice box size), each one lasts us a week or so.  Refrigerate after opening (refrigeration is not required prior to opening).<br /><br />It is difficult to find.  Petsmart is the only local store that sells it.  I really wish Amazon would stock this instead of the one in the purple box.  We tried the other brand once when we couldn't find CatSip -- she wouldn't touch the stuff; just kept walking around, crying for the CatSip.  In a pinch, we also tried a tiny bit of real milk once but she really didn't want any part of that either.
