review/summary: Happy Tot Squeeze Pouch: Apple & Butternut Squash
review/text: YUMMM! We found another yummy flavor from Happy Family Brands!  So my daughter whose three eats these like they are a smoothie and with them being so easy to put in your bag or her backpack, it's such a reassurance that she's enjoying a healthy snack even away from home and at school.  Withh their easy twist top, even if she doesn't finish the whole thing, it is a nice feature you can put the cap back on for later; though it is so rare that she doesn't finish it all up.<br /><br />This may be one of her new favorite flavors, she really likes seeing what is in her pouch each time and asks for this flavor a lot.  I think the size is great for a toddler, so glad they combine fruit AND a veggie; plus being organic, I'm a happy mom :)

review/text: I cannot say enough about these Happytot pouches!! My toddler loves them! I have to remind my daughter (who is in elementary school) that these are for her brother and I have other snacks for her! I love that it contains the salba. Anyway that I can get the Omega 3's in my picky toddler's diet I am all for it. I am also very happy anytime I can find healthy foods that are gluten/dairy free. I have actually tasted these myself and I think they are great too! When I compare the ingredients to other organic pouches they are by far the healthier choice.

review/text: I have recently started working out again and the happy tots are an easy way for me to get a healthy snack in on the way back to the office.  I don't miss lunch and the taste is delicious! The butternut squash makes it super creamy, but the sweetness of the apple sauce helps it go down smoothly -- I love this flavor.

review/summary: Versatile Pouch
review/text: All Mom's know how convenient these pouches are for snacking on-the-go and to encourage self-feeding. I also pack it in lunch bags. NO JAR, SO NICE! However, I also use it as a spread with cheese on a sandwich. It's a great way to hide the veggies for my younger son who is so picky about veggies. Another reason why I love Happy Tots is because they sweeten up the veggies with a fruit. This definitely appeals more to my younger son more than the pure vegetable pouches.

review/summary: Veggies on the go!
review/text: Organic green beans, pear, and peas, in a portable bpa free pouch? Yes please! Best idea ever. To be honest, I do not like green beans, therefore don't cook them at home. My kids do love peas though. So, when I saw this, I thought we would try it, since that's the only way my kids will get green beans from me. And to our surprise, this is really good. I love the fact that HappyFamily adds organic vegetables to their food, and not just fruit, like other companies. Also, I love how they add the super grain SALBA (from the white chia seed) to some of their foods. This is a great way to give my kids the protein, fiber, and omega 3's they need. Plus one of my kids is gluten free, and SALBA is a GF grain she can eat. Great job HappyFamily.

review/summary: Love The Flavor Combo
review/text: I love this baby pouch.  I feel like some of the baby food flavors aren't very creative.  I love to cook and plan on having my kids eat what I make for them each night instead of cooking them their own 'dinners'.  Having unique flavor combo's like Banana, Peach and Mango, helps my baby to develop his taste buds.  You don't see Mango everyday in baby foods.  I use it all the time in smoothies and as snacks for my toddler.  Sometimes I don't have the time to cut up fruit, sit him in the highchair and then clean up the inevitable mess that follows.  Giving him one of these pouches, I know he is getting all the goodness of organic fruits and veggies.  We kept them in our freezer this summer and used them as a treat in the afternoons.  Just let it defrost for about 10-15 minutes and it becomes easier to get out of the pouch, but is still icy and cold.

review/text: What can I say... most portable baby food, with a resealable screw top. Tasty organic fruits I trust and great nutrition in a pouch. My daughter has been loving these since she was 8 months old (she'll be two in two weeks). It travels very well and doesn't take much space in the diaper bag. If she doesn't finish it (which is extremely rare), I can always put the cap on and refrigerate for later.

review/summary: Fabulous product!
review/text: My son is 16 months and loves this product! It's so difficult to get him to eat fruits and vegetables by themselves, but in this little pouch, which has both, he will eat it every time hands down. He loves it! And I have not found another company out there that can give your child what this one does - antioxidants, omega 3s, fiber, protein and Salba, this awesome super grain. Not to mention it's all organic. This particular one is a favorite of ours because of the cinnamon. Philip loves the taste of cinnamon. As a first time mom, it's great to know that I have an option out there for a tasty snack to give my son that is super healthy for him. Not to mention this on-the-go type pouch is really convenient. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Gotta Love These Pouches
review/text: I started purchasing these for my daughter when she was about 9 months old.  We started with the Happy Baby pouches and she has been a fan ever since.  I'm a fan because these pouches allow her to self-feed without a lot of mess.  This is especially great when in the car.  I love the combos of the pouches too.  I even tried a few of them myself and they don't taste too bad!  Since my daughter's gotten older, I have started to be a little adventurous and add these pouches to things like pancakes and oatmeal in the morning!  She's getting an intake of fruits and veggies without even knowing!

review/text: Everyone in our household likes these Apple Squash Happy Tots. My son takes them in his lunchbox, my husband sucks them down on his way out the door and I use them as a baking substitute all the time! (you can omit veg oil and use equal amount of this). They are a miracle moistener for the muffins. We all enjoy the fruit/veggie combination and think the flavor is so fresh. The added Salba is such a great bonus, especially when we are on-the-go, which these are PERFECT for!

review/text: My 2-yr-old son has been eating HappyFamily products consistently for over 6 months now and this packet is one of his favorites by far. I'm so glad we can throw these in the car for last-minute snacks (my son has thankfully never seen a drive-thru thanks to HappyFamily packets). I appreciate that there are vegetables (sweet potato & carrot) in these while he loves the taste of the apple. I especially like the twist of adding cinnamon, probably why it's one of his favorites. He now knows how to squeeze every last drop out of these and often asks for more. They're also great for putting in his pack for school for an optional snack (because not all schools can afford 100% organic foods). Not to mention they have BPA free packaging and no GMOs. These also diminish the need to make and package your own food (I'm so over those days). Genius!

My baby was 9 months at the time and she easily held and fed herself.  From then on my daughter and I were hooked! I was loving the convenience and easy portability that young babies can eat these straight from the pouch.  I love that its organic and the packaging is free of everything harmful.  I now buy multiple flavors in bulk from amazon! So happy to have tried this food. A++

review/summary: Good for baby and easy for you!
review/text: Anything that is portable and easy is a great thing for a parent.  My son will happily eat these pouches over 'real' food even though he is way past the age of needing pureed food.  These come in real handy when you don't want to give a messy snack that is unhealthy as well.<br />The only downside, TSA is VERY inconsistent with the baby food allowance.  Sometimes we have been allowed through with these with no problems.  Other days (more often than not) we have either had to have each opened and tested or agree to the full body search (no thanks with a wily toddler).

review/summary: Great for kids, perfect for travel, what's not to like?
review/text: This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.

This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website. [...] Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. [...]. In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.

Since they're so use to eating indian food and never really had packaged baby food, I was scared to try this on them at first. Surprisingly they really liked it. I usually give this to them with whole wheat crackers or a granola to last them over till their next meal. My brother and sister in law are happy that I'm not giving them junk food!

review/summary: Gorgeous finishing salt
review/text: I have a small collection of finishing salts that I use for different things. This one is my favorite for things like salad and desserts. It's gorgeous with large crystal shapes that are very thin, some are just flakes, but other pieces are like shallow hollow pyramids. The flavor is mild and they have a nice snap which adds a textural interest to chocolates and candies.<br /><br />For more robust flavors, I prefer stronger flavored salts like smoked or Peruvian pink salts.

And they obviously went into the box dented as the box was in perfect condition and the type of dents could not possibly have happened in the box.  If the good price is a dented can price, it should be advertised as such so that we customers can decide if we want to buy dented cans.  Giving 4 stars because the beans are good.  Would give 5 if the cans were good too.

Every shipment to date has had dented cans - severely in some cases rendering product not edible per standards....this case of carrots had a can 'in the center' before they wrap to to send to Amazon warehouse. This can severely dented....BUT no marks on the wrapper - suggesting they re-wrapped before sealing to your warehouse for sale to Amazon customers ........<br />*****************<br /><br />Drain/heat/season and serve as side dish with 'microwave' scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Spray microwave-safe 2 cup dish/ scramble 2 eggs with water - NOT milk - milk toughens!<br /><br />Nuke on high one minute / spoon cooked outside edge to center allowing the uncooked to spread around the edges of the dish - 30-45 seconds more -let stand 2-3 seconds.  If dish shallow - flip out for a 'fried egg' sandwich<br /><br />Add to stews/vegetable tomato soups etc.

review/text: I purchase a lot of goods from Amazon, including bulk groceries. The beans are a fine product, but the cans are another story. Out of 2 cases, I was only able to save 5 cans. The rest were horribly dented or caved in and went in the trash, as no one else wanted them. I do not eat food from dented cans due to the failure of lining or seal. Yes, a couple cans dented at the seal, actually leaked, meaning bacteria and contagions could also get in. Unfortunately, the cans were packaged in this horrible condition from the factory. Shame on Libby's for poor quality control. I will not buy cans online anymore.

Each bowl of noodles come with 3 packs that include vegetables, seasoning, and some oily stuff referred to as "soup booster" after-the-fact. You don't need to use the soup booster. It'd probably just be better to do without and add some salt. Many times I pick healthy meals, but I just needed something cheap this go-round. They were good though and served their purpose.

They have a cookie like biscuit similiar to a twix - but not shortbread - they are chocolate and then a light filling - like chocolate - mint - or carmel. My friend says they have a honey one as well! Mmmmmm!! They eat them with tea - I just eat them!! I went through all my packs already and want to order some!!! It's a MUST TRY ITEM! Start out with the original - but if you LOVE Mint - try to get the mint ones. Yum! Buy a variety and impress your guests :) Please amazon - SELL TIM TAMS!!! It's worth paying the international shippping fee! These biscuit cookies are made by Arnott's.

ICV D-47 strain was selected from 450 isolates collected between 1986 and 1990.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The ICV D-47 is a low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at the end of fermentation. This strain tolerates fermentation temperatures ranging from 15� to 20�C (59� to 68�F) and enhances mouthfeel due to complex carbohydrates. Malolactic fermentation proceeds well in wine made with ICV D-47.<br /><br />Recommended for making wines from white varieties such as Chardonnay and ros&eacute; wines. An excellent choice for producing mead, however be sure to supplement with yeast nutrients, especially usable nitrogen.<br /><br />An excellent choice for dry whites, blush wines and residual sugar wines.

review/text: I find Simply Organic spices to be a good value but I do not like this nutmeg.  It is very fresh but the more I use it the more I keep ending up with bitter food.  I thought that I was adding too much mace so I deleted the mace all together.  That did not get rid of the bitter taste. So I tasted the nutmeg and found it to be very bitter.  Then, to make sure, I have made things leaving out the nutmeg and then with it again and have confirmed that it is this nutmeg that is the problem.<br /><br />Watkins nutmeg is so sweet and so much better. In fact I have never had bitter nutmeg before.  I'll have to throw out the rest.  So disappointing.

This would be a great size to feed a crowd for a party but it was also easy to transfer the contents to some smaller ziplock bags and freeze the rest for another day.<br /><br />--------------------<br />{If you noted a prior review here, there may have been some confusion between two products by the same company: this is not Peshwari "Tikka Masala Simmer Sauce" that has double cream in the first five ingredients, usually found in a 14oz bottle.}

review/text: I am so horribly disappointed.<br /><br />I am a self-confessed Chicken Tikka Masala addict. I LOVE the stuff. I buy it at my local grocery store for $5.99 per 14 ounce jar. I buy the jars four at a time, because I actually get rather frantic if I run out.<br /><br />Saute up some chicken, add some almonds, steam some rice, and add the creamy sauce. Yum!<br /><br />This container? Is NOT the same thing. It's sharp and overly spicy, and it doesn't have a lick of the creamy tomato taste I have grown to love.<br /><br />And worst of all? They added BELL PEPPERS to it. WTF? Where are my onions and creamy sauce? This is NOT the sauce that was advertised!

review/summary: The BEST licorice in the whole world!
review/text: RJ's licorice is, without a doubt, the BEST licorice around, and I've tried them all. The individual pieces are weighty and substantial in the hand. The stuff is tender to the feel, with just the right amount of give between the fingers to let you know what you are in for when you take that first bite. And boy, is it good! The flavor blooms on the tongue, whether you chew or just roll it around, but the texture begs to be bitten. The taste is full, along with the aroma, and remains robust to the very end. I never tire of eating this stuff. I only stop because I think I probably should, and look forward to getting into the bag the next day, or at the least, a few hours later...I got a bag of RJ's that was so soft and tender that I downed all but a very few pieces in the first sitting, not too much to say that I was wild with delight over the experience. I went back to the market to buy some more. Over a few days the licorice loses just a touch of the original softness, but this doesn't detract from the flavor or the enjoyable bite. I store it in a plastic bag. And last, but certainly not the least important issue about RJ's- the ingredients are ALL natural-nothing artificial about this stuff, and no corn syrup-just the best of the best. Whoever worked this recipe out deserves every penny they can make off the stuff. Thank you to RJ's for bringing it to the world!

review/summary: absolutely delicious--- and potentially dangerous too
review/text: I was enjoying some of this yummy licorice just now while at the computer, my first experience with RJ's. I became curious about the medicinal applications of licorice and searched "licorice health". I was stunned to find that licorice root and extract are implicated in a number of potentially serious health problems: hypertension, potassium depletion, heart and kidney failure, fluid retention and swelling of the face and limbs, hormonal imbalance, and muscle destruction leading to pain and weakness. Licorice can reduce thyroid gland activity and lower basal metabolic rate. Pregnant women should avoid licorice because of danger to the fetus. From the "People's Pharmacy" web site:<br /><br />"It appears that individuals vary considerably in their susceptibility to adverse reactions from licorice. Some people experience negative symptoms within days, while others may ingest excessive licorice in candy, chewing gum, chewing tobacco, or herbal medicine for months or even years before they realize that they are suffering damaging effects. Women appear to be somewhat more susceptible than men, and oral contraceptives may increase this sensitivity.<br /><br />Paralysis of the legs (and in one case, of all of the limbs) has been reported. A sixty-four-year-old man developed pulmonary edema, signaled by fatigue and trouble breathing, after eating four packages of black Twizzlers licorice candy in three days. This case demonstrates how quickly a serious reaction can arise."<br /><br />Interestingly, most licorice candy sold in the US is made with anise, not licorice flavoring. RJ's however is made from licorice extract... tasty but not worth the risk to me personally as one with a family history of circulatory disorders. Be aware.

My all-time favorite remains Molinari Sopressata, but the fennel renders this a close second - both five stars compared to the majority of spam that passes for salami in the U.S.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend them because 1) they don't last long and 2) they are quite expensive for a dog treat that lasts a few minutes.

review/summary: My Dog Can't Get Enough for Whatever Reason.... Almost like Rawhides!
review/text: I have a very picky rottweiler mix who is not very food motivated and does not like a lot of "hard" chews that would last her a whiile. (Even the chews she loves she usually gives up on after 20 minutes or so, so there's no such thing as giving her something that lasts hours, unfortunately) I originally purchased these at the store one day as I had long ago realized that the only way to find out if she likes something was to try it. I actually didn't think she'd like them, and intially I don't remember her liking them as much as she does now. I would simply rotate them into the schedule (I usually leave her with one "chew" when I leave the house even though she never touches it when I get back)<br /><br />I'm not sure when she started really going nuts for them, but suddenly she absolutely can't get enough of them! I'm giving her almost one a day now and she's still going crazy for them. She has a thing with "licking" (licking the carpet, the couch, etc) if she's bored and giving her these completely distracts her from doing it. Perhaps that's why she likes them so much - she likes to lick them before she actually eats them.<br /><br />It actually reminds me of how my now-deceased (and food crazy!) boxer mix would treat regular rawhides - she would lick and chew them until they were soft and chewy and then ALL the dogs would try to get their paws on it! My dog loves to chew it down until it gets mouth sized and then she will chomp on it until she swallows it.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs - but these work well for my dog and are pretty cheap. They probably wouldn't work well for very aggressive chewers but for a soft-mouthed dog like my own they aren't very messy and can still keep her occupied for about half an hour or so. (which is the most I can get from anything whatsoever) She does have a tendency to leave little stubs of it lying around when she can't finish it, but sometimes if I pick them up and give them to her when I run out she'll be satisfied with it. Also, and this is gross to admit, but I kind of like the way it makes her breath smell after she's been chewing on it. (It doesn't have a strong smell that I can sense until she's actually chewing on it.)<br /><br />I can actually (for once) actually find them cheaper at the store than on Amazon.

review/summary: Not For My Dog
review/text: I have a Lhasa Apso puppy that weighs 6 pounds, so not a huge dog. It took her ten minutes to devour this treat, so it's pretty expensive for a snack. Furthermore, it made her vomit several times afterwards. I'm sorry I didn't do the research beforehand, but apparently vets do not recommend these pork products as they often cause dogs upset stomachs. In fairness to the seller, the product was shipped free and had a VERY rapid delivery rate. But I would not order another.

No onion or garlic taste in these, just very bean-y. I prefer this over the Frito brand refried beans.

So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) "steep" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea. I am very pleased with the professionalism of the seller  and I will be giving them the full rating.

review/summary: Great in the tall can, horrible in these small ones--edited review: don't buy these cans, get 17.5 oz ones!
review/text: Please see update at the end of this review. For fairness sake, I'm leaving original review I did when I tried the 17.5 oz cans intact. But the smaller cans do not contain the same quality product. Whether bad batch (one time) or just bad distributor/supplier for small cans (ongoing), I'd beware. Now, the original review, then the updates:<br /><br />This is far and away my fave coconut water now that I'm self-exiled from the horror that is new Zico (they ruined a terrific product by making it from concentrate).<br /><br />Note that this comes in cans, not tetra paks, and the cans are BPA-free. These are recyclable (well, as long as your area accepts cans.) Note as well that Amy & Brian's coconut waters are flash-pasteurized (like ONE and Zico and others). Unless you wanna risk crazy bacteria, coconut water must have some sort of pasteurization.<br /><br />I've been sampling various amazon-available coconut waters looking for my new staple. History:  I was a loyal Zico subscriber/drinker for a couple years. They changed. It's awful. I canceled my subscription. I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco and Harvest Bay. But all those are fine depending on your own taste preferences. Previously, I had also tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling "coconut water taste tests" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention.<br /><br />This one is now my new fave. I have subscribed to the A&B pulp free in both can sizes.<br /><br />Second fave based on flavor alone (not processing, container, etc) is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E. VitaCoco is good for those who prefer less sweetness, more of a slightly sourness. Something out there for everyone, right?<br /><br />I can say this to coconut water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. But do try this one if you enjoy a bit more sweetness. So good. But if you hate any sort of higher sense of sweetness in your beverages, this isn't for you. I'd recommend ONE or Vitacoco for you, or maybe Harvest Bay.<br /><br />What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named:<br /><br />Big can option or small can option: 17.5 ounces vs this one that's 10 ouncnes. I buy both now, cause some days I want the bigger can to take with me to Pilates.<br /><br />Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D Because another reviewer called it "unnaturally sweet", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />8 oz = 76 calories<br />This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR.<br /><br />I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks.<br /><br />I love, love that amazon offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Amazon, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!<br /><br />Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts:<br /><br />Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360<br />Magnesium: whole can: 31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4<br /><br />I confirmed that A&B is "flash pasteurized", and got email from them to prove it,  which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google "Crossfit Adventure" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise. Not A&B.<br /><br />They use Thai coconuts. :)<br /><br />Addendum: For carb watchers--  The carb count for A&B is roughly twice that of others. I used the brands I had at hand at home (and a calculator) to save you time making comparisons. The number stands for carbs per ounce:<br /><br />Amy & Brian:  2.375<br />Nature Factor Organic: 1.6<br />O.N.E.: 1.33<br />New Zico (from concentrate): 1.07<br /><br />I think Old Zico was more like ONE in terms of carbs per ounce.<br /><br />I wonder if the selection of coconuts can give higher sodium (see new Zico's much higher sodium count), then can the selection also be chosen to have higher carbs/more sweetness?<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />UPDATE: WHOA! Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's "jiggered" for consistency.)  I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. HTH.<br /><br />Update July 12, 2010: Okay, I couldn't resist the sale this month that gives me A&B for half off, so I ordered the large/tall can in the pulp version. FANTASTIC. It seems that every case I've gotten in the Tall cans is great. All the cases in the small cans are horrible. So, take my advice: skip these 10 oz cans and get the tall version of A&B, either with or without pulp. Delicious. A&B needs to research why those small cans are so bad versus the tasty and coconutty tall ones.

review/summary: This does not taste like coconut water
review/text: Having grown up in the Caribbean drinking coconut water from the source hundreds of times I can tell you unequivocally that this does not at all taste like coconut water. I got this today because earthfare was out of the brand I got last time, which was O.N.E. That tasted more like pure coconut water. This has a really odd taste to me and not in a good way. If the taste is so different, you have to wonder if the nutritional content is also not the same.<br /><br />On a side note, the O.N.E. brand coconut water was all gone but this brand was on the same shelf at earthfare right next to it fully stocked, so interpret that however you will.

review/summary: Something is very wrong with these smaller cans...
review/text: I'm actually a big fan of the 17.5 ounce Amy & Brian coconut juices.  I was ecstatic when I found them cheaper here on Amazon (shipped, no less!) than from my local Whole Foods.  I ordered a case of both the 17.5 ounce cans and these 10 ounce cans (which I've never seen before), thinking they'd be the same, except in a better size for a single serving.<br /><br />But nope!<br /><br />They are either produced by a difference producer for the same brand or I got a bad batch (although from reading other reviews, I doubt this is the case as there seems to multiple reports of this) -- it has this weird burnt, cotton candy flavor to the water.  It definitely does NOT taste like the clean, sweet flavor of coconut in the bigger cans.<br /><br />I would avoid these!

review/summary: A Bit Sweet And Rich, Unlike Other Coconut Waters.
review/text: Lately, I've been trying a few different brands of coconut water drinks which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I find them quite refreshing and I like the high potassium content to balance the sodium in my diet. Well, tonight there was a new bran and it came in six packs of 10-ounce cans: Amy & Brian Coconut Juice. Hmmm, the others are listed as coconut water. Well, I had to try it. the can says all natural and lists young coconut water as the only ingredient. Strangely enough, the ingredients don't list the potassium content, a usual bragging matter for coconut drinks. Well, this coconut juice tastes somewhat sweet and a bit rich. In a slight way, it's almost a bit candy-like. It's a good juice, but I don't like it as well as several of the other lighter brands which I would regard as more refreshing. Probably, I won't be buying a second six pack. Some people may prefer the taste, so don't let my taste deter you.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: There is no such thing as coconut juice, but this is great.
review/text: There is no such thing as coconut juice. When a coconut is opened, inside one finds a liquid, that liquid is called coconut water. When coconut water is mixed with the meat of the coconut the result is coconut milk; there is no such thing as coconut juice. That said, I like this coconut juice. We have a box of Amy & Brian's Coconut Juice delivered by Amazon monthly ala their monthly delivery service wherein money is saved for using the service (assuming a box is ordered every month anyway).<br />So before ordering Amy & Brian's Coconut Juice by the box I did some research. I found that this coconut juice is one of the few on the market that does not add sugar. By taste tests I found that this coconut juice seems to be of the highest quality available (afaik). The ingredient list is simple: "Young coconut juice". Some coconut juices have a watery taste, yet Amy & Brian's has a body to it you can taste, it can be described as a sort of caramelized, natural body. I like it chilled, my step-brother likes it warm. My Mom has expressed many times how refreshing it is. I like the 10 ounce size of the can. We have had a case of this product delivered monthly for about 6 months now.

review/summary: liquid cotton candy
review/text: I ended up buying this because Zico is now from concentrate (yuck) and based on reviews and comments from others who stopped buying Zico. Not sure what the others were drinking but it couldn't possibly be what I got. Amy and Brian's tastes like cotton candy. I love Thai coconuts even more than South American coconuts - in fact I go to Chinatown every chance I get to stock up on young coconuts just for the coconut water. This tastes NOTHING LIKE a real Thai coconut. I wouldn't even use this to make a smoothie. I guess it's back to Vita Coco until there's a good product on the market again. Or I suppose I could get a second fridge just to keep filled with green coconuts. Now I need to figure out what to do with the other 23 cans of this stuff.

review/summary: Unnaturally sweet; twice as much carbs than others
review/text: I found this to be unnaturally sweet. (I have tried many different coconut waters; both packaged and fresh from the coconut.) The product lists far more carbs than any other packaged coconut water I have tried. Given these two things, I'm thinking it's likely this product is boiled, or otherwise condensed.  This may be good for those weaning off sugary beverages, but if you are looking for a coconut water that tastes like fresh from the coconut, this is not it.

The natural coconut flavor is definitely lacking compared to the other brands that I've tried.  I also did a comparable taste test with the bigger 17.5 oz cans that I got at Whole Foods, and this is definitely not the same thing. I wasted my money on this one! After shipping costs, it's not worth the trouble to return this.

review/text: How did Amy and Brian mess up an amazing product like their 17oz cans by putting them in 10oz ones?  Save your money and either buy the 17oz cans or a different product.  The coconut water in the 10oz cans taste sugary, almost syrupy.  Nothing like the 17oz cans of which I'm a huge fan.  I still have a few cans left of the 10oz and find myself adding tap water to dilute the sweetness of this product.
