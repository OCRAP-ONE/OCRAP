review/summary: Great coffee BAD containers!
review/text: We loved this coffee. The "K" containers they come in are AWFUL! Out of 14 boxes we have used 21 cups have leaked and spoiled the brewed coffee. Tullys did send us a  box to replace the cups from our 1st order of 4 boxes from Amazon. 3 of those containers leaked. We tried 2 local food stores for 6 boxes at various times and the cups in those leaked also.We have stopped using Tullys, we are sad. :(<br /><br />(the foil lids become detached from the container causing coffee grinds and water to leak out and into the coffee cup)

review/text: I bought this a few years back and loved that the product was originally from Holland and was full of chocolatey goodness and also came in a cute package. I just found it again at my local supermarket and looked at the ingredients. Unfortunately they have replaced the tasty all natural chocolate sprinkles with your run of the mill ordinary sprinkles. Now it's really waxy. Nothing special worth going out of your way for...the container remains the same...which is pretty adorable still. But going to look for real dutch sprinkles now...

review/text: I think its sad when I read reviews and they give a product a bad rating because they don't like Maple flavor. Hopefully, you won't buy a Maple flavored product and give it a bad review because it said it was Maple flavored and it was. What a shame.<br />There is an extreme Maple flavor to this sauce but that is OK with me because I love the contrasting sweet Maple flavor combined with the smokey taste that comes with BBQ food. I found this BBQ sauce to be thin but that is just fine because I don't like thick BBQ sauces anyway. I am happy with the flavor and consistency but I do find the price to be very high but that comes with the territory when dealing with Natural/Xylitol products. Maybe as more people branch out to Xylitol they will drive the pricce down to reasonable levels. If it weren't for the price I would use this BBQ sauce all the time!

review/text: I am on a low-sugar diet for weight loss and wanted to try this xylitol sweetened bbq sauce.  I didn't go for the honey mustard flavor because my husband hates mustard.  He said he could live with this one.  I am having a problem with it solely for the maple taste.  I don't care for it and will only have it in pancake syrup.  We don't taste the xylitol but it is on the thin side.  BBQ sauce is extremely hard to replicate naturally.  I looked at 'every' other sugar-free brand and they are 'all' sweetened with Splenda which is a shame.  So I am now ordering the honey mustard flavor to see if "I" like that one.  I am a honey mustand dressing fan.  I'm crossing my fingers.

review/text: Saw an advertisement for Choffey and was very interested.  On Amazon.com I found Crio Bru.  I first tried the Cavalla -- it was wonderful. I drink my hot tea black, so for my brewed hot chocolate I add just a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.  Makes it just right for me.  This time I purchased all three varieties.  Each taste slightly different.  I'm hooked.

review/text: I use it for photography (dying liquids to photograph water crowns and dripping it in a tank of water to photograph it) and it serves its purpose. It is vibrant, the colors aren't weird, and it comes in a nice eyedropper thing. I don't really know much about food coloring but, like i said, it works well.

review/text: This delicious chocolate/peanut better Dove candy is by far the best sugar free chocolate I have ever had, and I have had lots.  The best way to eat these chocolates is to let them melt you mouth...savoring that incredible creaminess.  These chocolates could lead to serious addition problems.  Amazing.  Puts all the other famous sugar-free chocolate makers to shame.  Give your self a treat and buy a bag of these chocolates.  You deserve it.

review/summary: Awfully expensive for just being plain ol' fortified cereal
review/text: For example, if you want something that will keep an older baby quiet on a plane ride, or a cute little finger food that travels well in the diaper bag and is already bite-size and tastes good and so on, I give these a 5.  If you want what the packaging is trying to sell -"super" foods, "eat your colors", "made from real organic fruits and veggies", "vibrantly colored fruits and veggies hold many beneficial vitamins and minerals.  Serving your baby a rainbow of colors will not only help develop a healthy taste for a variety of flavors, but will also provide a wide range of nutrients" -then I'd have to give it a 1.  This is, despite their efforts to dress it up, just 1.5 ounces of fortified cereal.  That's it.  Every type -no matter what the combination of fruit and vegetables- has the exact same proportions of the exact same vitamins, even though they try to make it look like the purples are good for vitamin C and the oranges for vitamin A and the greens for calcium.  Whatever was good in the organic veggies and fruits got taken out and forgotten somewhere; the only purpose the 'superfoods' serve in these concoctions is to be a colorful dust sprinkled on the outside of each piece (seriously).  So like I said, if you're just looking for a good portable snack, these will work great.  If you are trying to feed your baby vibrant colors so they can get those benefits extolled on the package, it looks like for now actual food is still your only option.

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: We tried the purple, green, and red puffs, and we liked them all.  They smell great and are quite tasty.  My son eats a serving in just a few minutes.  They aren't as sweet/sugary as other brands of puffs we've tried, which is a good thing.  They're organic so you don't have to worry about any pesticides in the grains, fruits or veggies used to make them.  Do I think they're worth $5/container?  Definitely not.  I got them on sale.  I'd buy a few containers for $3 each every month.  The bad thing about these is that once the container is opened, you want to use them in a week because they get stale that fast.<br /><br />Unlike previous commenters, I didn't have a problem with the purple powder (which isn't just natural food coloring, it's dried and powdered blueberries and purple sweet potatoes) making a mess.  You put your kid in a high chair with a tray and a pocket bib on, and let him eat.  Then you wipe his hands and face before you let him get down and walk around. Voila! no mess!

review/text: With its great crunch, flavor, and nutritional values, this cereal is truly a staple in our home and has been for years. We use the variety without the raisins, because they tend to dry out a little much in Kellogg's processing. We just add fresh raisins. Best of all, we previously had to go out of our way to find the raisin-free variety. Now we don't even have to go out, because Amazon delivers a five-pack right to our door on the schedule we choose -- and for a good price. A great partnership -- Kelloggs and Amazon!!!

review/text: I first fell in love with this cereal when I was travelling and tried it at a hotel breakfast bar.  The taste is so good just as cereal or with yogurt.  My local Kroger store used to have it on their shelves a couple of years ago.  I was totally bummed that they discontinued it.  On a whim, I googled the cereal name and found it on Amazon.<br /><br />I thought it would be weird to buy cereal on the Internet, but it has totally worked out.  Once I'm about done with the last of the 5 boxes, here comes the next shipment of cereal.  Even my finicky teenagers love this cereal!<br /><br />I highly recommend this cereal and the subscription service.  If you have too much cereal, you can just pause the delivery.  Greatness!

review/text: I whipped up a box of Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate brownie mix yesterday and was very pleased.<br /><br />I substituted the half cup oil with half cup unsweetened applesauce.  The brownies turned out a little fluffy, but they tasted great.  Not overly moist, but certainly not dry.<br /><br />There's plenty of chocolate taste in them, and they're nicely sweet.  There are large dark chocolate chips throughout the mix, though personally I'd like more (but I'm a chocolate nut).  I like that this mix has no high fructose corn syrup or invert sugar, two ingredients we avoid because they're bad for the body.<br /><br />I baked my brownies in a 9"x13" metal cake pan.  I coated it with a thin layer of shortening first, and the brownies come right out with perfect ease.  It took 35 minutes in this pan size, which wasn't labeled on the directions.<br /><br />Highly recommended brownie mix.

review/summary: Fudgy, clean tasting (no acrid chemical aftertaste) and very easy to make but too sweet
review/text: I followed the recipe on the box, substituting nonfat greek yogurt for the water and the brownies came out dense, fudgey, rich and normal tasting.  There was no unpleasant result. I found it too sweet but not as acrid as the standard brands.  It was on sale for two dollars a box at my local supermarket because I think my neighborhood passes over this product thinking it might be too new and fancy (and therefore untried and untested) compared to the standards - DH and BC. The recipe is the same procedure for making baking soda based quickbreads such as bananas.  This brownie mix contains sodium bicarbonate aka baking soda and no baking powder.  I added some inexpensive French brandy because the best brownie I ever had (not too sweet) contained Bailey's Irish Cream.  It's all Western Europe to me.  This was not a regrettable purchase for me but it was too sweet and the chips in the mix were unnecessary.  I should have added more cake flour and yogurt to lower the sweetness according the the High Altitude adjustment on the box.

review/summary: The BEST Kombu for Umami
review/text: I have to admit I'm a bit of a seaweed snob.  I grew up eating seaweed so I'm not a stranger to it.  I've been on a health food kick lately and started to cook a lot of miso soups, legumes, etc.  Kombu is the quintessential ingredient for majority of the dishes I cook.  It lends that famous savoriness (umami) that only comes w/ Excellent quality harvested seaweed from Japan (see, I told you...snob) ;-p.<br /><br />When I first started back to cooking macrobiotic and raw food meals I purchased Kombu and Wakame from a lot of different vendors (coops, organic markets, asian groceries, online vendors, etc).  As I started cooking with all the different brands of seaweeds, I noticed there's a distinct difference in taste between the brands.  I have to say - Eden has one of the BEST seaweeds out there (texture, taste, no additives, clean).<br /><br />Everything I cook has that hearty savoriness with the Eden brand.  With other brands - the seaweed texture, color, and/or taste is subpar compared to Eden.  I don't know what it is but when I cook w/ the other seaweeds - seriously - it just tastes as if something is "missing".<br /><br />Since noticing the taste difference I wanted to know why Eden had one of the Best seaweeds...  I went to Eden's website and read all the stories and research that go behind their products.  I'm very impressed by their dedication in bringing Quality, Healthy, and Clean food to us!  I'm now a Huge fan of Eden!<br /><br />Since I grew up eating a lot of seaweeds - I know what good quality tasting seaweed is... and I have to say - Eden has one of the best out there!  You have to try it!

review/text: Eden Foods is a great company if you ever research up on them.  They take care to ensure that the products they sell are pure and clean.  This is the only brand of Khombu, seaweed, and nori that I use, and it comes from Japan, not China.  These strips are great for adding into soups for extra flavor...the umami like the previous poster said.  I would not trust the other brand of seaweed I see at the coops...the Emerald one, because it comes from China, and there is hardly any oversight over there.  Eden Foods also makes a good gomasio blend if you ever have a chance to buy it.

review/summary: Quality Kombu that Makes Delicious Dishes -- High in Iodine and No Fishy Taste
review/text: I've used Eden Foods Kombu for years to make Japanese soup stock for Miso Soup and as a natural flavor additive to any dish. It's very shelf stable and keeps for years, if you just want to have some in the pantry. I used it recently to flavor the stock for my standby Portuguese kale soup, with no fishy flavor at all unlike you get with nori -- my soup was delicious as ever.<br /><br />With the concerns about getting iodine in your diet naturally, I used this kombu to cook rice and make a meat chili with canned kidney beans and diced tomatoes. Adds more flavor to anything boiled (it does contain a natural MSG from the sea) and sea minerals like potassium and calcium to your food besides the big iodine boost -- I completely recommend it.

review/summary: No fishy here! :)
review/text: As a vegetarian who loves Japanese food, I'm often stuck in a difficult position - even supposedly 'vegetarian' sea vegetables taste more fishy than I'm comfortable with (aesthetically).  Eden's kombu is just fabulous pure unami, though:  deep, complex, almost vaguely smoky, in a word - awesome, with absolutely no 'fishiness' whatsoever.  Obviously, this is very high-quality kelp/kombu.  I also have to express total mystification at the review that mentioned the 'green slime' - my kombu is nicely dry and chewy and just ready for munching, tossing in a vegetarian dashi, etc.  Yum!!!

review/summary: Not So Impressed
review/text: I had been using Eden Kombu for years and always had good results. But the last time I bought some it was very different, and not in a good way. Within just a few minutes of coming into contact with water it oozed a green, gloopy slime. Edens Kombu had never done this before so I threw it out and started over with a fresh batch, same results, green slime. I had contacted Eden about it to see if there was something different about the product but never got a reply that explained in any way what could be the cause of this problem. So.....Eden! See Ya! I think they just dissmissed me as a quack or something but I,m quite serious, this stuff was NASTY.<br /><br />There is better quality Kombu out there than Edens, you just gotta look for it.

review/text: Being a diabetic for 29 years, I have tasted virtually every sugar free candy on the market. These are wonderful -- hard to tell from the real thing. No more watching my friends indulge without being able to join in! Use with caution, however -- excess consumption (like eating half the box during a really good movie -- not hard to do) will make you rather ill. On the whole, though, these are great.

review/summary: Amazing, Amazing Tea!!!!
review/text: I am truly amazed!!!! A friend of mine told me about this tea. Yesterday I was feeling like crap and my tummy was also bloated and I couldn't button my jeans. My tummy is so bloated I actually look pregnant when I get my period.<br /><br />I drank 2 cups of the tea with 2 tea bags. My period came on today and I woke up this morning with no cramps and a flat tummy. When I get my period I am bedridden the first day with a heating pad on my tummy. I usually have such terrible cramps for the first day and sometimes the 2nd day that make me cry from the pain. My day consists of diarrhea, nausea, and throwing up. I also have a bloated tummy, swollen legs, and ankles during my period. I didn't even know my ankles and legs were even swollen until the doctor told me and tried to give me a prescription for water pills.<br /><br />All of my adult life, I have had to miss 1 day out of every month from work because of my period and miss out on being able to attend a lot of other events. Thanks to my friend and Triple Leaf Sugar Balance Tea, I will be able to go out the house today and to an event tonight that I thought I would have to miss because of my period.

review/summary: It definitely does something
review/text: I bought this because i have PCOS and i could use something to help keep the sugar under control. Also I just got off the pill and i'm trying to get pregnant. The reason i got off the pill was to regulate my period. now that i'm not on the pill i need help getting back to a regular cycle.<br /><br />i noticed i'm getting ovulation symptoms but i'm not sure if its the tea or just nature. one thing i really noticed though is that both times i drank this tea i got sleepy and fell asleep right after. and slept great. it was like what happens when i eat too much sugar and go into a food coma. has anyone else had this effect? my husband thinks maybe its lowering my blood sugar and making me sleepy. i have no idea. i'm a little worried that maybe it might not be good for me if its making me sleepy. the sleep is amazing though. has anyone had this experience?<br /><br />the taste is definitely not for everyone. its very strong smelling and tastes kind of like grass. i got used to it pretty quick though. it really makes you feel like you're drinking something good for you. it helps to add some splenda or stevia.<br /><br />i'm trying to do some research to see if anyone else had this effect and if its something thats not good for me. i like that its doing something, thats pretty great. just need to find out if its safe for me.  if i knew that i would give it 5 stars. but this tea definitely does something.

review/text: I just reviewed the white wine mustard and the same review is also completely fitting for the whole grain mustard as well. As I said in the last one, I was fortunate to be able to attend the 30th annual Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, CO and was also fortunate enough to find two guys that were representing Ameline mustard. They had samples of the white wine mustard and the whole grain mustard to taste with crackers or salami. The falvor of this whole grain mustard is unparalleled compared to what you normally find in your grocery store and after being given a sample of this product I don't think I'll ever go back to what you can find in your average grocery store after having such a high quality product! I know it is hard to purchase a food item without tasting it first, but I'll tell you first hand that I truly enjoyed this whole grain mustard and would strongly recommend it to anyone who loves a high quality mustard as well! ENJOY ... and thank you Ameline for the sample jar I was given at the classic!

review/summary: Fantastic mustard
review/text: It's hard to go wrong with any Fischer & Wieser product, including this scrumptious mustard.  I am sort of a mustard and sauce gourmet.  So I look for and try a lot of different mustards and sauces.  In my opinion, Fischer & Wieser make the most consistently superior mustards and sauces than any other company I am aware of.  Not only are they all really yummy - they are also creative, so you get new taste treats with each one.  For example, who else offers a Papaya Lime Serrano Sauce? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B6CYMA">Papaya Lime Serrano Sauce</a><br /><br />That's my overall big thumbs up rating for all Fischer & Wiesner products, but now on to this specific mustard product.  There are some equally good mustards, but none that I would consider better than this one, especially in its special niche - a smokey mustard.  Not too strong, just the right amount of smoke flavor without overpowering the mustard.  After all, why eat mustard if the real taste of mustard is so disguised you can barely taste it.<br /><br />They also offer another mustard that is just as good, but for different purposes since it's a sweet and sour mustard.  It has to be good to win first prize at the Napa Valley Mustard Festival. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B68E92">Sweet, Sour and Smokey Mustard Sauce</a><br /><br />I recommend getting one of each, so you'll be covered for a wider range of mustard recipes.  In fact, I just ordered two more bottles of each today, to make sure I don't run out.

review/text: This is a superior form of hard candy which I usually find in 5 pound bags.  There are approximately 450 pieces in that size bag, i.e., 90 pieces per pound.  It tends to be in the range of nickle candy (penny candy being an item of the dim past).  This may seem like a lot of candy, but it is good Halloween candy and also good candy jar candy.  Some businesses keep a bowl full at their reception desk, and some people use it to fill candy jars.

review/summary: Perfect alternative to regular powdered coffee creamer
review/text: My husband and I are big fans of powdered coffee creamer and we use a LOT. After realizing that the regular stuff is chock-full of partially hydrogenated oil (and also flammable, apparently) I started looking for an alternative. Nature's First is good stuff. Since there is no corn syrup solids it lacks the subtle sweetness of the regular non-dairy powdered creamer, but if you use sugar you probably won't notice anyway. If you're a fan of powdered coffee creamer and you're looking for a healthier (or at least a non-hydrogenated) way to lighten your java, I highly recommend this stuff.

review/summary: Disappointing 'milker'
review/text: We have switched to organic, natural foods and have tried to eliminate hydrogenated oils from our diet - that meant finding a replacement for Creamora. I was excited to find this product. Sadly the taste does not live up to the name. Instead of Creamer it should be called Milker. There is no creamy taste, frankly it is the equivalent of adding non-fat dry milk to your morning coffee. True, no hydrogenated oils, but also no cream, so what is the point? They need to do a version that is not non-fat, using real cream. Oh well, live and learn. I'm still using it by mixing it with Creamora until I can find a true replacement. Will not be a repurchase.

review/text: Save your money. Might as well buy Carnation's instant milk because that is all that this product is. It is very misleading, suggesting a substitute for creamer but being no more than powdered, non-fat milk in a convenient shaker dispenser. Hat's off to the seller, as thy have simply repackaged dried milk and sold it as creamer. Oh, well, I fell for it. But you shouldn't. Save your money and buy real creamer, and just go very lightly; the taste will be than worth it. I have bombarded by coffee with this worthless powder, and still find it undrinkable.

review/text: I started writing reviews because reading silly people's reviews is frustrating.<br /><br />It specifically says that it is instant dry milk. It lists the ingredients. How is "milker" a negative.<br /><br />I actually can't believe people want their coffee to be "creamy". This product is perfect for me. All I wanted was a little milk for my coffee at work and was tired of having to keep a small milk bottle in the shared fridge and having to bring a new one every week. This stays in my drawer and is easy to use.<br /><br />If you want you coffee to be "creamy", you obviously don't like coffee. Just go get a coffee flavored ice cream or smoothie or something. And you obviously don't care about your health, so just go get the fake hydrogenated oil artificial creamer powder like everyone else gets.
