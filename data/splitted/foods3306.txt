review/summary: Delightful, refreshing flavored tea
review/text: This is easily one of the most delightful flavored teas I've ever had. It's exceptionally clean - no strange flavors or nuances - and fruity without at all being too much so. I enjoy it both in the morning and in the afternoon. Twinings has done a really fine job of blending the four red fruits (cherry, raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant) into a mix where none dominates but all contribute to the final taste. Highly recommended.

review/text: Four red fruits tea adds a wonderful berry flavor to our iced tea.  I get a gallon of warm water from the tap, put in 2 family sized decaf tea bags, plus a 4 Red Fruits, 2 Peach, & a Blackberry.  Stick it in the fridge and a few hours later -- Yummy tea!!!

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I did not actually buy this tea from amazon, but I had to write about my love for it somewhere!  This is my new favorite morning tea.  The smell is simply DIVINE.  The berry does come through in taste, and the scent while putting the tea mug to your lips enhances the experience.  I try to steep it for about 5~7 minutes for a 16oz mug... although when I forget to take the teabag out, it really does not seem to get bitter at all (as many black teas do).  I drink it without sugar or milk (milk will negate the antioxidants in tea!) and it is neither bitter nor sweet.  The best way to get great flavor with black teas is to use BOILING water, not just hot.  Caffeine content is about what black tea should be: a little less than half a cup of coffee-- enough that I can drink 3 or 4 cups and not feel my eye twitching at the end of the day.  Really, I have quite a few kinds of tea in my cupboard and none of them match this one!  After trying this tea, I went back and bought three more boxes.  Will probably use amazon to order it in bulk sometime soon.  Enjoy!!!

review/summary: Not actually for use in espresso machines
review/text: Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.

review/summary: You say tomato, I say amazing
review/text: What Hope said, lol. This sauce is amazing, the 16-oz size is perfect, and it's great for so many recipes or just plain with some nice pasta. Heck, I think I could eat it as a soup, it's that good. The no-sugar added feature and the lower sodium content was what first drew me to purchase. But it's the fresh, uncomplicated, and absolutely delicious taste that will keep me buying for as long as they make it.<br /><br />Packaging is extremely protective - even UPS couldn't manage to break these in transit!<br /><br />Update: I joked in my original review that I could probably eat this as a soup. Well, I tried it and it was delicious. I was making grilled cheese sandwiches and had no tomato soup on hand (and I love tomato soup with my grilled cheese!). So I dumped a jar of this into a saucepan, heating it while stirring in milk until it was the desired consistency and color. I didn't measure, but I'd guess I used a little over a cup of milk to 16 oz of the sauce. I then used an immersion blender to smooth it out, since the sauce is a little chunkier than tomato soup would ordinarily be (this additional step was more just to fool my family). Anyway, I've made this soup at least twice more since and everyone just loves it. Given how tasty and how much healthier this is, I'll never do canned tomato soup again.

review/summary: My dog loves it! A great help for taking her meds!
review/text: Shetland sheepdogs (shelties) and a few other breeds (Poms, Shnauzers) can be genetically inclined to gall bladder rupture due to gall bladder mucocele.  This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate surgery.  The condition appears suddenly with almost no symptoms other than the vomiting of water.  It is a medical emergency.<br /><br />This terrible ordeal happened to my beloved older sheltie this past April 2012, and, praise God -- who loves us all and all His creation -- she was saved by emergency surgery and a long recovery protocol.<br /><br />Now she must eat low-fat food with a non-prescription-veterinarian-ordered vitamin (a pill) to support the liver.  I buy the pill at 1-800-PetMeds because it isn't available easily at Amazon.com.<br /><br />She loves Natural Balance Original Reduced Calorie Formula Canned Food, which I use to induce her to accept the pill.  She now has a mission every morning:  to take the pill so that she can eat the canned food.  The small can is affordable and practical.<br /><br />I mash up just a bit (half-a-teaspoon-or-less) of the Natural Balance Canned Food and add 1/4 cup or so of water to make a "stew."  I give her the pill followed by the watered-down Natural Balance "stew" so that the pill won't stick in her throat. (She is supposed to have an empty stomach. The pill is taken with just a tiny bit of watery "stew" so that the pill will slide down her throat.)<br /><br />At the end of an hour, she can have the rest of the Natural Balance without diluting it, and she shares it with my younger sheltie so that she doesn't eat too much fat.  Sometimes we stretch the canned food for two days -- sometimes, not.<br /><br />Both of them LOVE this canned dog food.  The younger sheltie's main diet is the dry version of this canned formula; the older sheltie eats a dry Blue Buffalo that has even less fat.<br /><br />Whereas I used to have a terrible struggle to get the older sheltie to accept the pill, she now nudges my arm or hand (just did so, as a matter-of-fact) every morning so that she can take her pill, then her "stew," and, later, the rest of the can of  Natural Balance.<br /><br />I was so relieved when it turned-out that she likes this product.  She previously had refused to eat other canned, low-fat brands.  The pill-in-the-morning-procedure had been a time-consuming "battle" with the pill flung everywhere; now she swallows the pill immediately to get her Natural Balance morning treat.<br /><br />It's fun.  I give praise to God.

Since so little of the sauce is required to dynamically alter the dish you are preparing, this is a tremendous deal.  I must warn you:  TOO MUCH INSANITY SAUCE WILL BURN YOU.

review/summary: Insane in the Membrane
review/text: After I began using and going through Sriracha (and various other supermarket hot sauces) like ketchup, I decided step up the heat and try Dave's Insanity Sauce. I first tried it on a slider sized sandwich- one drop with the mayo. First impression? Taste was good, and it was pretty spicy. So I decided to test the hot sauce (and my limits) to three drops total. Mmmm! This is good! And it tasted awesome, but I paid for it afterwards. My tongue was on fire for about 10 minutes after finishing the sandwich. So the taste tricked me in to using more and more, and then the heat bit me. It wasn't unbearable, but made me uncomfortable. Definitely worth it and can't wait to try more of it.<br /><br />Doing some research, it looks like its rated at 180,000 Scoville Units. Their hottest sauce, Dave's Insanity Jolokia Private Reserve, is rated at 700,000. Sriracha is about 2,400, and Tabasco sauce measures 2,500-5,000 SHU.<br /><br />Quick shipping and processing from vendor, "Miss Fit."

review/summary: I expected more of this sauce
review/text: Let me get this out of the way right now: most of the reviews on Dave's Insanity Sauce exaggerate the greatness of this product. It's hot, but there's not much else good about it. With a few drops on a plate of food, I can get my eyes watering. I was under the impression that this sauce was so hot that you shouldn't even use it on a single serving of food (based on Amazon reviews). But that's only if you're using it on dry meals. If it's blended into a sauce or condiment, it's watered down nicely and palatable. In terms of flavor, this sauce has a plastic-y taste to it. That's the best way I can describe it, and it seems to be a common problem in sauces which use hot pepper extract. I was under the impression that it was flavorless, but no, it actually tastes sorta bad. Because of this, a good use of Dave's Insanity might be to heat up a lesser sauce which happens to taste good. In terms of heat, there are definitely hotter sauces out there. But that doesn't mean this sauce is a pushover. If you dab a little too much, you'll find yourself running to the fridge for milk. One problem with using Dave's Insanity on single food servings is I find that I can never get just one drop. Inevitably, when I pour a drop out, a bit gets on the side of the bottle and I have to swipe it off with my thumb and spread it onto my meal as best I can, then lick the rest off so that it doesn't go to waste. This is a problem because that small amount of sauce is enough to leave my tongue with a light burning sensation, while my nose is on the verge of running (though, this varies depending on how much I can water down the sauce in my serving). That might just be because I exclusively use this on single servings of food (I'm not a cook). Ideally, for me, I just want a bit of a kick, and did it ever give my food a kick. I can handle a few drops of it if I need to, but I prefer not to leave myself tearing after every meal. Overall, it's not bad. This sauce garners a lowly three out of five due to its unique flavor. It's plenty hot, so had it tasted better, it would have gotten a higher score. If you're a huge fan of saucy meals and looking to use this on single food servings, you may want to consider picking this up. If you prefer sauces with rich flavor, look into something without hot pepper extract. Alternatively, if you're looking to use this as a cooking additive, you'll probably want something hotter unless you're a spice novice.

review/text: "Dave's Insanity Sauce" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings (for most people), this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes. There are hotter sauces available, but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat.<br /><br />There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: When they say this is the hottest hot sauce in the universe, I believe it.  I taste-tested this hot sauce when I was in the French Quarter.  There was a selection of hot sauces you could sample.  You were given popcorn to sample the hot sauce with.  I took a piece of popcorn and dipped it, ever so lightly, into the Dave's Insanity Sauce.  Then I popped the piece of popcorn in my mouth and...OH...MY...GOD...it felt like a choo-choo train drove out of each of my ears simultaneously.  I thought I was going to drop to the floor. Once I recovered (slightly), I searched desperately for something to drink.  I bought some Powerade and it helped, as long as I held the Powerade in my mouth; once I swallowed the burning pain started again in my mouth.  It took drinking a glass of milk and a margarita or 2 in order for me to feel remotely "sane" again.  If this is the experience you are looking for you've come to the right place.  PROCEED WITH CAUTION, indeed.

This is a complete fallacy.<br /><br />Now I understand some people take to spice a little differently than others, but this hot sauce is on the tame side compared to others.  First time I opened the bottle, I accidentally dropped about a tablespoon and a half of this sauce into a crock pot stew I was making.  After it was done, it was hot, but not incredibly hot.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the flavor is great on this sauce, which is why its getting 3 stars, but when you call your sauce "Insanity Sauce," you would expect something a little hotter than this.  Don't purchase this if you want something really hot or you will be mildly disappointed.

Literally to say it far and away was the hottest thing I have ever eaten not to mention the hell it wreaked on my digestive system, Every bite it got hotter and hotter. I thought it had a not so great flavor, but then again it got hot so quick it was hard to enjoy any "flavor". Worse than biting into a habenero. Like fire that feels like hotter than possible to imagine and it is very persistent and a long lasting burn. Pretty senseless to make a sauce so hot you need to use this much caution to use it.<br /><br />I think it is more of a novelty item, something along the lines of college guys daring each other to try it is what comes to mind. If you really enjoy abusing yourself with hot pepper extract or you simply can handle ANYTHING and say NOTHING is hot enough for me, then this might be for you. If you can honeslty say you like the burn off this my hat is off to you because you are one tough person. I actually like to be able to put a little sauce on my food and add flavor AND heat not just insanely stupid balls of neverending raging fire. I will pass on this and stick to the varieties of tabasco I love.

review/summary: dangerous
review/text: Years ago, when I had what seemed like an eternal cold, I read that if one takes hot sauce, it helps clear out the bronchial tubes.  I got a bottle of Dave's Insanity Sauce from a health food store (?!), brought it home and took about half a teaspoon of it with some salad.  About 15 minutes later, I was writhing in agony on the bathroom floor and semi-conscious.  My husband called an ambulance, and the last thing I remembered was a medic saying, "I can't get a pulse."<br />My husband took the jar of sauce along to the hospital -- the ER doctor said to me later, "My brother eats this stuff, but they make him sign for it when he buys it."  I thought he was kidding, but he assured me he wasn't kidding.<br />There were no permanent after-effects.  My husband said it was the first time he'd ever seen me take anything without reading the label first -- turns out the label said to put only a few drops on the food -- and I took half a teaspoon.  Live and learn.  (Oh, yes, BTW, it did cure the cold.)<br />Years later, an M.D. friend told me that once, in a foreign country, he was eating some food with hot sauce on it and he passed out, falling face forward onto his plate.<br />Hot sauce can be dangerous stuff.  Use with extremely high care.

review/text: We have used Heinz sloppy joe mix for years.  AM so dispointed why they ever took it off the shelves.  have looked in every store and nobody carries it now.  Was suprised to see it online. and it has a great date on it too (which really dont mean much with canned foods) as it will last forever.  Came in great shape.  Got two cases of it.  Now were are just praying that they dont take Heinz catshup off the shelf.  I mean same principle.

review/summary: Interestingly Addicting...and peanut free!
review/text: I bought these on a whim.  I enjoy flax, use it in all my baking from breads to cookies.  I usually laugh when I read reviews about products and folks note how "addicting" the item is.  Ha ha jokes on me!  It is SO true with these.  They are not very sweet at all.  The flavor is very mild and subtle.  My kids like them for one piece.  I on the other hand, devoured the whole bag within a day!  I found myself just eating them for no reason than they tasted great.  They do taste flaxy there is no doubt about it.  I got this flavor thinking the kids would enjoy the sweetness, but I also want to try the BBQ one as well.  I put the other bags on a box and put them in the garage, too much of a good thing is just plain too much!  Will enjoy eating them again and again!  Plus, I confirmed with the manufacturer they have no peanuts in their plants so these as safe for people with peanut allergies!!!

review/text: These are really nice to have on hand when you do not feel like dehydrating your own flax crackers. They have a nice cinnamon taste to them and pair well with nut butters. They do break easily, but hey they are flax crackers, so that is to be expected - so be careful spreading items on these crackers. Another plus is that they are considered raw, processed at low heat and organic as well.<br /><br />If you are into Raw food, and looking for a quick snack-type food, these flax crackers are great to have on hand. The only issue is that alot of the crackers were broken up in the bag, but maybe that happened during shipping.<br /><br />Overall, I would purchase them again.

review/summary: AN EXCELLENT TEA...I AM GLAD I FOUND THIS STUFF HERE AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES NOW.
review/text: For some reason, known only to the powers that make such decisions, this bland, Twinings Prince of Wales Tea is not longer readily found on supermarket shelves.  You can still find it in variety packs, but It has been sometime since I have been able to find a whole box of the stuff.  That is a pity, but as I am what you might call a "tea hoarder," I had two boxes in my stash and was rationing it slow out.  You can imagine my delight when I found you could purchase this product through Amazon!<br /><br />Prince of Wales tea has a nice robust taste but no bitterness.  It is one of the few teas I can (if I so desire) drink without adding some sort of sweetener.  It never use mild or cream as my wife does, so for me that is a nice factor.  I simply like the flavor of this tea.<br /><br />Twinings has been around (It is based in England) for a bit over 200 years now and there is a reason for this...they provide a fine quality product.  We are constantly trying new teas as we locate them, but it seems that over the years we keep coming back to this brand.  Now as has been noted by another reviewer here, this stuff is NOT packaged in England; it is packaged and distributed here in America.  This does not magically change the flavor of the tea though.  Tea is tea is tea.  Tea is NOT grown in England, so to say that tea that is packaged in England is better than that packaged in America is simply codwollop!  Yes, you might get "stale" tea here, but I doubt it. If you keep your tea under proper storage conditions, i.e. out of the light, no moisture and away from heat, it will last quite some time...I can assure you that the producers do this simply because they want to sell you the best tasting product possible. We in this country may not be as adept to brewing tea as our English brothers, but I doubt it.  No, the difference in the taste is more than likely all in the drinkers head.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have and the biggest problem I have noted in our country when it comes to drinking tea made using tea bags is that we seem to be a very, very impatient people.  We simply do not, generally speaking of course, do not let it steep long enough.  A tea such as the one being reviewed here needs to steep no less that three minutes; preferably at least four.  I find myself getting in a bit of a hurry at times and end up drinking very weak and rather tasteless tea simply because I did not wait long enough.<br /><br />Note:  Cost wise, this is on the rather high end for tea bag tea...in my opinion it is quite worth it though.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of my babbling...this is a good tea.  Is it the only tea I drink or ever will drink?  Of course not.  3/4s of the fun of being a tea drinker is continuing throughout life trying different blends and brands.  I will say though that I most certainly have not grown tired of this stuff...yet.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: My very favorite tea
review/text: I discovered this tea by accident while shopping at an import food store, which has since gone out of business. This is a dark leaf tea with a smooth medium flavor. I am never able to find this tea in grocery stores as they seem to only carry the Breakfast tea and Earl Grey, which are good teas, but too weak in flavor for me.  My shipment was fast and securely packaged.

review/summary: Nice mild tea for non-tea drinkers
review/text: About three years ago I was diagnosed with two bleeding ulcers (which fortunately healed quite quickly once I stopped taking all NSAIDs and took the heavy-duty prescription antacid drugs morning and night).  The gastroenterologist did NOT tell me to quit drinking coffee, but although I had been a coffee drinker since high school, all the coffees suddenly seemed much too acid; I HAD been drinking regular coffee until about 3 p.m., then decaf after dinner - but even the decaf just seemed "too much."  However, in the morning especially, I did crave a bit of a caffeine jolt, and I was definitely accustomed to a HOT drink at breakfast.  My parents and my husband were always at least occasional tea drinkers, so we had the major brands of American grocery store tea around the house - I found them all unpalatable, and usually did not even finish the mug after I fixed some.  Then I started trying the "fancier" teas, starting with "assortment" packs.  My husband had warned me that there was SOMETHING in the Earl Grey teas that made them taste really odd - well, that something turned out to be bergamot, and I did not care for it either.  So, at least I had eliminated all types of Earl Grey tea...  Fortunately it did not take me too long to stumble across the Twinings Prince of Wales tea, and it was like Goldilocks and the porridge - just right.  With coffee I always drank it black, but with tea I do use about a teaspoon and half of honey.  As far as I can tell, the Prince of Wales does not come in a decaf version, so in the evening I drink chamomile tea (and that varies a lot from brand to brand!).  Unfortunately the Prince of Wales tea is only available at one grocery store near me, and sometimes they are all sold out.  So, I finally realized that I should sign up for the Amazon "subscribe & save" for this tea.  The tea bags come wrapped in foil packets (as I think all Twinings tea bags do), so it's easy to take them along when traveling, or just to carry one in a purse or wallet.

review/summary: The Prince of Wales couldn't get enough
review/text: TWININGS PRINCE OF WALES tea was originally blended for HRH Prince Edward the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII then the Duke of York). It is described as a pure black Chinese tea from Yunnan Province and other southern areas of China.<br /><br />In other words, it approximates green tea. While it is a bit weak for me, I think most tea drinkers will absolutely love this quality tea still enjoyed by the royal family. I myself drink it only occasionally, if brewed together with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5GI">Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or the spectacular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MOWL8M">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a> (see my reviews for these).<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named "FLOW-THROUGH") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Either way, this is one of those teas that is a must for your tea shelf at home.

review/summary: "Mild" Doesn't Mean Flavorless or Unenjoyable!
review/text: This Twinings tea formulation results in what might at first seem self-contradictory: a mild, but flavorful, black tea. Many tea lovers like a strong, black tea, and I, too, enjoy these. But sometimes you want something that's not so powerful, perhaps after you've already had a number of cups, or perhaps late in the afternoon or in the evening. This Twinings blend fits the bill perfectly. It is smooth, almost silky to the taste, with a mild black tea flavor that also has a hint of aroma. It's really a welcome addition to any tea-lover's tea set, and when you also consider the more than reasonable price, it's easily a home run.<br /><br />Like most Twinings teas, the bags are individually wrapped to keep freshness using a sealed, moisture resistant paper. The box I just picked up has a freshness code two years from now, so that should more than suffice for most uses, and you don't have to worry about going through an entire box soon after you purchase it because you are worried about the teas going stale.<br /><br />An easy five-star recommendation for flavor, mildness, packaging, and price.

review/summary: Like cheetos for babies
review/text: My baby is almost 8 months old and she's showing an interest for finger foods. She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands. I try everything my baby eats and when I first tasted these, they reminded me of Cheetos. The cheddar flavor is very evident. Some pieces are small -- some even too short for her to hold -- looks like sizes vary slightly. She hasn't had any choking issues with these since they melt in your mouth fairly quickly. Sodium value is also fairly decent. I have noticed though that if opened (with lid on) for more than 1 week, it starts to become less crunchy and more on the chewy side.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 35, Serving Size 18 pieces, Servings per container 6, Sodium 50mg<br />% Daily Value for infants 0-1:<br />Protein 0%, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 10%, Vitamin E 20%, Zinc 15%

review/summary: very hard
review/text: These will be great for my daughter when she's over a year old or so, but at 11 months, she is not quite ready for something this large and crunchy.  They don't dissolve easily like the Gerber lil crunchies or puffs and I had to dig a whole wagon wheel out of her mouth so she wouldn't choke because she put the whole thing in there and it just sat there without dissolving, even using her teeth and gums to try to mash them.  They are about the size of a quarter so I tried cutting them up into cheerio size pieces but they still just sit on her tongue and don't dissolve and she has a hard time swallowing even the smaller pieces.  I bought a bunch in bulk so I will save them for when she's a little older.  I just wanted other parents to be careful what ages these wagon wheels are fed to.

review/text: I like the veggie dip and the garden tomato flavors best but I think my little one would eat any of them.  He loved the puffs and now the crunchies.  They are a perfect size for getting him to feed himself but they can get messy.  Even when they get stale, he loves them.  It's a good snack for him and definitely a little overpriced, but Amazon has them cheaper than any store in my area. And I'm as a first time mom, I'm a sucker for any baby related foods that seem healthier than what my nephews are eating.

review/summary: Son's favorite snack!
review/text: I started him off on the Puffs, since I was a little afraid of the Crunchies because they looked so big. But he actually has a lot easier time with these. They seem to dissolve a little better than the Puffs, and since they are bigger he can manipulate them better. He either holds them while he noms on one end (they dissolve fast), or he's able to push it around in his mouth well enough that he doesn't gag. The Puffs tend to go to the back of his tongue and he often coughs and gags on them. They are nutritious, and there may be better snacks out there but for right now these are awesome.

review/summary: Fantastic for little fingers
review/text: We attribute our son's new-found interest in eating finger foods to these little cheese sticks.  He first discovered them on a visit to grandma's.  They're perfect - long enough that he can hold them in his hand and still bite off the ends, and he appears to think they're quite delicious.  He's start being interested in other finger foods now that he has mastered these, but they are by far his favorites.  Would definitely recommend!

ALL my kids want to eat them from the 13 y.o. down to the toddler, but we try to save them for travel or a special snack because they cost so much per pound!<br />They do taste very good. They are more spicy (not hot, just spice) than I had anticipated, but my toddler likes that. If yours doesn't like spice or you don't want them to eat a snack with a higher salt content (for toddlers) I'd skip buying this.<br />I did buy these earlier, but then waited to feed my son until he was old enough to handle the spice.

Sometimes when my daughter is in a fussy mood and wont eat anything else, I put some of these in front of her and while she's concentrating on feeding herself, I sneak in a few spoonfuls of food. Very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend.

review/summary: Great Puff alternative to the "Fruity-yogurt" kinds
review/text: Our daughter loves these!  She had a lot of trouble transitioning to solid foods, and we had to take her to a specialist. The specialist mentioned that if your child has trouble with solids and with chewing motions... you should use foods that are longer and thinner to encourage chewing on the sides of the mouth. These were perfect.  THey can be easily cut into rounds using a serated knife, and to encourage chewing, they are long enough for you to hold them to the one side of the mouth.<br /><br />Also, since our daughter loved puffs of all kinds... we wanted to at least introduce a variety of flavors. The garden tomato ones were a hit right from the get go and we continue to use them in "mixes" with other easy to pick up foods (goldfish, veggie crisps, etc.)<br /><br />Would recommend, will buy again!

These snacks are hard for ME to chew and actually cut the roof of my husbands mouth when he tried them. At first we thought it was just a bad canister, but when we opened the next canister... same issue.<br /><br />IF your child is to the point where they can chew these... they certainly are not in a stage where they need puffs anymore!<br /><br />Would not recommend.

review/text: My daughter loves these!  I used to be so super worried about her choking on anything; I even used to cut those Gerber star puffs in half.  Then one day she just chewed it up.  So I then tried the Gerber crunchies and she loves those too.  The cheese are her favorite, but she doesn't like the cinnamon maple ones.  Then I tried the Gerber Wheels and she loves them.  She holds them with one hand and then bits a piece off and chews it.  They are harder than the rest of the snacks but they still dissolve.  She did stick the whole thing in her mouth one time and I told her no, and out it came.  She hasn't stuck the whole thing back in her mouth since.  I would defiantly recommend these, just watch your child while she is eating them.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: I bought these for myself when I was pregnant because I wanted a low sodium snack. I love all of the Lil' Crunchies, but the Veggie Dip flavor is the best. It is mild but addicting. My son is now 9 months old, so when he's ready to try them, I'll have to buy enough for both of us ;)

review/summary: Good but messy
review/text: My son loves these, but like any cheese puff-type thing, they leave crumbs and such everywhere.  My brother has banned these for his daughter, because the resulting poop is quite terrible.

review/summary: My little one loves these!
review/text: My daughter loves these snacks!  I love them because they are so easy to take on little trips, and they don't mash into her clothes like other snacks.  (They do leave crumbs, but are easy to wipe off.)  Amazon has a much better deal on these than what I can find in the stores, plus free shipping with prime!

review/summary: Great snacks! My toddlers fav
review/text: These have been my son's favorite snacks since I had first bought them almost 1 year ago. They're great for tiny fingers and for little ones learning to self feed. They fit perfectly into a diaper bag/purse so you can have one on you at all times. They're great with little one's meals or just a simple snack. The ONLY downfall is that they're a bit messy. After eating them I always have to find that I'm cleaning my son's hands of crumbs, but that's with everything. HIGHLY recommended.

review/summary: Better buy a few extra cans...
review/text: My child, in a word, literally inhales these things! They smell & taste great and i would expect them to have a higher sugar content but they're actually a pretty good snack alternative, esp in comparison with fish crackers, cheetos, etc... You may find yourself sneaking a few :)

review/summary: My toddler LOVES these!  I wish they made these for adults as well.
review/text: These may not be the #1 healthiest snack for toddlers, but they are very good.  The flavor is perfect.  It's not too strong, nor too bland.  They have a touch of salt, but it's not nearly as salty as many alternatives.  They are just the right size for little hands.  They're crunchy, yet dissolve easily.  In fact, these were my toddler's first finger food.  I often like to go with store brands to save money, but I've found that the taste of these is quite superior.<br /><br />As my toddler is getting older, I'm not buying these as often as I used to since they are expensive.  However, when she was still in the early stages of eating table foods, these were awesome.  I'm actually a little bummed that I'm not going to be getting them all that often anymore.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: My toddler loves these and she has since she first tried them. She would eat an entire can in one sitting if I would let her. They are also great for teething, which is not something I anticipated. They are not the healthiest snack out there but they work great at pacifying an angry toddler stuck in her car seat.

review/text: I bought these for my son after trying the cheese flavor.  He liked the cheese flavor so much I thought these would have to be good as well.  I wasn't disappointed.  The veggie dip is quite tasty.  My son loves them, and gets really excited when he sees the canister!  The only problem is they are SO good that my 7 year old is constantly sneaking them!

review/text: We have 4 kids, ages 11 months, twins 3 1/2 years and 10 and ALL of them LOVE these.  They are always munching on these and especially the Cheddar ones.  They actually prefer these to other chips which is awesome since they're way healthier.

review/summary: My son LOVES crunchies!
review/text: I bought these for my son to try, and he absolutely loves them! He's also tried the maple flavored crunchies, but prefers the veggie dip. His breath smells a little like garlic after he eats, them, but I'm not a vampire, so I don't mind. Ha ha! I call them baby cheetos, although they are very soft for toddlers learning to self-feed. I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save program to get a pack of 6 of these every 2 months. I love the program and hope they keep adding more items to it. It's an easy way to keep those constantly used items in the house. I know as he gets older, we'll stop the subscribe and save, but for now, he loves them and eats them like crazy so I'm glad I don't have to worry about running out!
