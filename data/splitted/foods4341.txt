review/summary: One of the best tasting bars out there!
review/text: This bar is tasty, filling and good for you.  I love them and have one for breakfast every morning with a cup of brewed chai with almond milk.<br /><br />I am looking to eat free of wheat/gluten/yeast and this bar fits the bill.  Only 9 grams of sugar (compared to the 15 - 30 grams that other bars contain), plus 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein.  The ingredients are organic and the hint of spice is very nice.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

review/summary: Bumble Bars - Original with Hazelnut
review/text: My son's best friend has food alergies and stays away from gluten, aspertame, food coloring etc.  Even though my son does not have the same alergies, we try to eat along the same lines because it's healthy and my son likes to eat what his friend eats.<br /><br />The Bumble Bars are good.  I love the chewiness, I love the seeds and nuts.  The touch of honey is great.  And Lord knows active 11 year olds need all the wholesome energy they can get.  The sugar content is low and the fiber content is high.  It is just hard for me to save them for the boys!!!<br /><br />On a truly aestetic note.  The packaging is nostalgic.  I love that!

review/summary: great power bar alternative- and gluten free
review/text: We have tried a variety of granola, power bars and others - and this is the best that we have found - good source of energy, all natural, tastes great (we have tried all the flavors and the original is our favorite - followed by chocolate cherry)  And the other good thing is that they don't have all the sodium and sugar that most other bars will weigh you down with.  Great for a snack and the gym or at work.

I would compare to rice crispy bars (but healthy) in texture.  Not like most other granola type snack bars.  But this is what makes it so good and unique.<br /><br />They hold me over when I'm hungry and need to stay at the computer.  I highly recommend!

review/text: I purchased a sample pack of Bumble Bars after trying them from a local store, so I've tasted pretty much every flavor and I have to say that the "Lushus Lemon" is definitely my favorite! It isn't really sour, but more of a sweet lemon taste - its soo good. Plus its made of completely natural, gluten-free and organic ingredients, so you can feel good about eating them (no, I do not work for BumbleBar - this is a REAL customer review!!). Just thought I'd share my new found love with everyone - you have to try it!

On the label it says they only use organic ingredients, and all of them are gluten free.<br />It's a great deal to get 15 in a box from Amazon, especially when you subscribe. Almond and chocolate are my favorite.

review/text: Bumble bars are gluten free, and made with all organic ingredients.  They are mainly formed of sesame and flax seeds,  with a few peanuts as well as brown rice syrup,evaporated cane juice, and a few other items.  The 1.6 ounce bar makes a good sized snack for an adult, and is big enough for two young children to share.  The flavor is of sesame and sweetness that is similar to honey.  The bars are solid and do not crumble, but they do bend and can be snapped in two easily.

This makes her feel like she is getting a "treat" but it is more of a "health" food.  I really love the cherry chocolate and the chocolate crisp!!!  Oh, and I almost forgot the lemon Bumble Bars are yummy too!

review/text: Okay. I have eaten other progresso soups that I have been extremely underwhelmed with in the past but this has to be the worst (and it was all I brought for lunch)! It looks nothing like it does on the front of the can. The actual soup is dark green and looks like it's been pulled directly from a swamp. There are limp little hunks of spinach floating around in it and some weird, see-through pieces of celery. I have never eaten lentils before and I found the taste and consistency of the actual lentils wasn't that bad but they were ruined by the green bog water they were hiding in. Even if you can get over the sight and smell of this soup, the taste leaves much to be desired. You have been warned. Time to go raid the vending machine so I can get this taste out of my mouth.

review/summary: New Orleans Jambalaya Soup + added ingredients
review/text: I just made a soup using this mix.  It's one of the best soups I've ever made and it made a ton of soup.  I boiled down a turkey carcass left from Christmas and picked off the meat (not all that much).  I let the stock cool (about a gallon), skimmed off the fat and added the recommended can of diced tomatoes, some cut up celery, cut up carrots, a few pealed pearl onions and a little ham chopped up from the butt end plus the end of the ham bone.  I also added four small red-skin potatoes cut into chunks.  I boiled all this stuff with the soup mix for 25 minutes and added about a cup of chopped cilantro.  You might need to add some salt depending on your additions, but really nothing else.  It has a little spiciness as is.<br /><br />Really, I think you could add just about any vegetables and chopped meat and this would be an excellent soup.  And, when made with left-overs, it cost next to nothing.

The sauce is more tomatoey and they are great for Beans on Toast (A staple for any University Student.)The price seems a little high, but I am guessing thats because they are imported.  Definitely worth trying.

review/text: A good solid taste of strong British Tea, the secret is to warm the teapot first with a sluicing through of boiled water.<br /><br />When you make the tea, one bag for every two people is required and stir the brew and let it stand or "mash" for 2-3mins before pouring. NEVER, NEVER, EVER make it directly in a cup or mug. If you are not following these simple guidelines then you really are wasting your time and money.

I have been drinking tea my entire life and consider myself fairly schooled on teas. This is simply the best English Breakfast tea I have ever tasted! There is no bitter aftertaste and it is in no way a weak tea. My mother in law is currently in England and is bringing me back more of this lovely tea. It is great to know that when I run out again I can order it straight from my favorite online store, Amazon!

I've mostly stuck with the British Isles with the English, Irish and Scottish Breakfast teas. Can't say I hugely prefer one over the other; they all give just the right taste and kick for the morning. I like the big 2-cup bags too. I just make an oversize cup of tea for myself and it lasts a bit longer.

This tea is so rich.  I know it is sacrilege to say this, but in the interest of cost savings, I sometimes reuse teabags.  Taylors of Harrogate is the only brand where you can get two good cups of tea from one teabag.  It is simply lovely.

They are supposedly easily digested...so better than rawhide. It took him hours to really get a dent in them too. It comes with quite a few decent sized ears. They are also made in the USA so I heard that is safer for pet products.

review/summary: This tastes....familiar
review/text: I got a couple of these jelly-filled pods in a variety pack from a third party vendor.  My first impression was, quite simply, how could this possibly be good?  Boy was I in for a shock.<br /><br />The fact that I'm giving a five-star review on a coffee pod should speak volumes.  I like my coffee freshly roasted and ground, but when some flavors are added to coffee, the experience takes on an entirely different level.  I had no idea that the flavor of jelly could be infused with the flavor of coffee to create such a blissful experience.  Let's just say that it's a good thing that my variety pack only came with two pods of this flavor.  Otherwise, I might have drunk the whole package in a single day.<br /><br />The flavor and the aroma are somehow familiar, but I can't quite place them.  What I do know is that they both just simply put a smile on my face.  I would gladly go the rest of my life drinking no other coffee but this.  That's how much I like it.<br /><br />And the other thing I think needs to be pointed out is the fact that when I use Senseo pods, I have to use two pods on the single cup setting to get a decently strong result.  With the Donut Shop coffees, I can use a single pod on the single cup setting to get a decently strong result.

review/summary: Full of Flavor, Perfect Texture, Nice and Juicy!
review/text: I am so in love with Albanese Gummi Candy.  The consistency is not too soft and not too hard.  It is definitely a little softer than Haribo, but is much, much juicier and has more flavor.  It is not as soft as a Fruit Slice by any means.  There is a good chew to this gummi and the flavor releases as you chew.  I do like Haribo, but, sometimes it feels like chewing and sweet rubber; you will not have that feeling with the Albanese brand.  The Blue Raspberry flavor is very strong and just sweet enough.  I've always loved Blue candy and especially the Blue Raspberry flavor, maybe because it turns your tongue blue.  These gummies will turn your tongue blue, but it won't turn your lips blue, like blue gum that you get out of the vending machine, darn it!  Hehehehe.  Ah, the things we carry over from our childhood.<br /><br />So, if you are a gummi bear lover and a blue raspberry lover, get this candy.  The price is phenomenal.  You get two bags of five pounds each for a total of ten pounds!  That's a lot of candy.  I always have candy out in pretty clear containers at my home so that my friends will feel comfortable taking what they want.  They all seem to gravitate to the Albanese Gummi Bears.  I seem to love most of the flavors.<br /><br />The gummi bears are really cute too!  They were shipped in perfect condition and there was no melting and I am in Florida.  They were a bit warm, but they quickly come to room temperature and are perfect.<br /><br />These would be cute for a blue themed party, wedding treats and a candy bar too. This is a candy everyone can enjoy, young and old!

As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/summary: Salmon Stuffed with Spinach and Cheese
review/text: I was at first skeptical about how this would taste.  I took it out of the box and it was so small.  I said to myself, I am going to need 2 of these to fill me up...was I wrong.<br /><br />I popped it in the microwave and found, not only was it delicious but very filling also.  Would highly recommend especially if you are dieting and doing portion control.<br /><br />Can't wait to try out their other selections.

review/summary: Tasty but don't cook in micro
review/text: I really enjoyed my first dish of the salmon. I baked it slowly in the oven and it was quite good. Tonight I cooked it in the microwave, for the least amount of time recommended and it tasted like a leather boot. So, for me, I'm sticking with the regular oven. I'm going to try some of Oven Poppers' other items, too.

review/summary: OVEN POPPERS SALMON
review/text: These are really tasty stuffed salmon.  There are 2 in a box, which costs a little under $7.00. Takes about 5 minutes to heat in the micro. The cheese and spinach filling is very flavorful. I eat 2 a week for the Omega-3 benefits, but they are delicious as well. The one problem I have is when cooking in the microwave I've tried different timing but the bottom is crusty.  Even so I love 'em!

review/summary: great but oil bottom of fish
review/text: I love these. I used to get them at BJ's in a four pack but they stopped carrying them. They used to be $14/box. I couldn't find them anywhere so I got them here, misunderstanding just how few I was getting. While I love the product (be sure to really oil the bottom of the fish before cooking in micro for 5 mins.), they're too expensive on Amazon. I found them here in NJ in Stop 'N Shop for between $6 and $7 for a two-pack. So now I can eat them without going broke. By the way, these are great for diabetics or anyone looking to watch their carb intake.

review/summary: I was fooled by this Company's Omission
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H44STI">S-Adenosyl-100 (SAMe) for Small Dogs and Cats by Vitality Systems</a>I order this product for my dog.  My vet wants me to give one pill per day for his aging liver.  When I ordered this product, I assumed it would be 60 pills for the price since I paid approximately the same amount for 60 pills eight times before.  My big mistake was ordering the Vitality Systems company selling the product on Amazon.  I guess I inadvertently switched vendors on this order without realizing this.<br /><br />When I received the order it was 30 pills for over $22.00.  I ordered from the wrong company who cleverly omitted the total number of pills in their description.  (I would also hide this vital info. if my intention was to fool (really cheat) customers!)<br /><br />I know that often Amazon is not very good with providing vital information on products and I often have to go to other websites to find out more about the products I am shopping for. (A good number of times they  lost my business when other websites selling the same product had a similar price with less postage costs.)<br /><br />There should not be certain companies who omit things that other companies selling the same product state up front.  Amazon needs to have more uniformity in displaying the products they handle and/or sell.

review/summary: So handy!
review/text: After diapers & wipes, these are the most important thing in my diaper bag! I'm breastfeeding my son, but we supplement with this formula so my husband can feed the baby (I don't always have enough pumped for a bottle) and for convenience. It is very helpful to have a bottle handy when I'm waiting at the register at the supermarket and the baby is crying to be fed. I love these little, ready-made bottles because they are the perfect size and there is no mixing needed - just shake, open, screw on a nipple, and feed the baby.<br /><br />These don't come with nipples, but you can use regular bottle nipples or get disposable nipples separately. You can buy about 50 disposable Similac nipples from the Abbott store online or use Enfamil disposable nipples (I've used these - they fit fine), which they sell on Amazon.com in packs of 10 or 25.<br /><br />I have two nipples in a ziplock bag and 4 bottles in my diaper bag at all times. There are cheaper feeding options, but for convenience I can't recommend these enough!

review/summary: Perfect for breast feeding mothers!
review/text: These bottles helped tremendously in adjusting to daycare for a pumping mother.  My daycare used these bottles at the end of the day when baby was hungry and there was no breast milk left.  I call them a jumper bottle--they satisfied her hunger until I could pick her up and nurse her and 2ozs wouldn't significantly reduce my production. They are ready to use - which allows them to be stored at daycare per state daycare guidelines--I simply provide a bag of ready to attach nipples.  Priced exactly like local but no sales tax to pay and delivered to my door!

review/summary: A must have for the first few weeks!
review/text: These bottles are the same product used in the hospital. I found them to be invaluable during the first few weeks when newborns are eating constantly. Its a great way to avoid constant bottle washing when you are so tired. I don't heat the formula so that saves even more time. Later, these bottles are great for the diaper bag and any use away from home. Nipples are not included but I found them to be much cheaper at my postpartum clinic than they are online.

review/text: This product is awesome. The only problem is that I would not have them shipped in the summer!  They can only take temperatures of 100 degrees or more for 24 hours. If it is 85 or 90 degrees the formula could be exposed to 100 degree temperatures which would spoil the formula.  Just be careful

review/summary: Very convenient; great supplemental feeding
review/text: The summary: my daughter likes the taste, the small size minimizes waste and makes it easy to travel with, but it's relatively expensive compared with powders and larger bottles.<br />The 2oz bottles are a perfect amount for a supplement.  You can easily use more bottles, but the 2oz amount helps minimize waste.  This is an expensive way to buy formula if you are feeding formula exclusively, but it's great if you just need it for traveling or to 'top up' your baby when he/she doesn't get enough from breastfeeding.  In theory, you can add a nipple and ring and feed your baby directly from the bottle, but I tend to use baby bottles that help reduce the amount your baby swallows (I use Born Free, because it is also BPA-free).<br />Also, the small bottles fit easily in the side of a diaper bag (most bags will hold 2 in a side pocket). My daughter seems to like the taste.  She is primarily breastfed and has no problem getting breastmilk sometimes and this formula sometimes.<br />I do notice that it tends to stain my daughters clothing, but I don't know if that's unique to this brand or common to all formulas.

review/summary: Awesome and convenient product
review/text: Similac is a well known product and I was given this to feed my baby in the the hospital. This particular size and amount is great. These boxes come with eight 2 oz bottles and one re-useable nipple and ring. It is the perfect amount to start a newborn off with when supplementing. I have had a breast reduction and I am supplementing with some formula as my milk amount fluctuates. Although I agree with others reviewers that it is a huge amount of plastic bottles to throw away, it is very convenient for on the go and supplementing in general. eventually will also move up to the 8 oz bottles and larger as my baby grows. shipped on time and well packaged.

review/summary: Exactly what we ordered and needed
review/text: We used these in the hospital and several staff members "hooked us up" before we came home so we had some for a little while. They were perfect for feeding our son when we first brought him home because he was taking less than 2 ounces at first. They're great for the middle of the night feedings as well b/c they don't need to be heated up. You just pop the nipple on and it's ready. The box only comes with one nipple...that's the only drawback. However, we bought the Enfamil nipples to go with them on the recommendation of some other reviewers and they worked perfectly.

review/text: My baby is 2 weeks old. I'm breastfeeding, but he gets fussy waiting for the milk to "let down". My doctor recommended I try a ready-to-go formula like this one that required no additional effort on my end. When he's fussy but needs to eat, this is quick. It also smells more like breastmilk than other formulas. I packed a few in my diaper bag. We go through 1-2 of these a day. (He's drinking breast milk otherwise).

review/summary: difficult baby feeding made easy
review/text: I love the little Similac bottles for many reasons. The first one is because even when I was breastfeeding I still used them, especially in the middle of the night. This way my husband could have his turn feeding the baby too and I had my turn for sleep. But the less work in the middle of the night the better. All you have to do is open it and put a nipple on it. We are all for the least amount of work between 12 and 6 am. Secondly when we are out somewhere and need to give the baby a bottle its is ready and handy. I don't have to worry about finding water measuring formula ect. And lastly because when you have a baby sitter (even baby sitters like grandma's ) you don't have to worry about them remembering how many scoops of formula with how many ounces of water. Even though my baby drinks 4 oz I just give her 2 bottles. They are handy to carry around and it is just one less thing to worry about when you are out and about. They are kind of expensive but if you break it down and join the amazon mom club it is less than $1 a bottle and piece of mind and convenience are totally worth it.

review/summary: Fantastic for when you bring home newborn baby
review/text: I ordered 2 cases in a few weeks before baby was born (also I did it early for free shipping since the case is heavy) I LOVE having these around for the late night/3am feedings for baby.  Also, a hint for the nipples on these bottles-They do not sell the similiac nipples BUT the enfamil disposable nipples fit PERFECT, and they sell those on amazon as well.  Along with these small bottles being awesome for the night feedings, they are great to throw in your diaper bag to take anywhere.  Another hint, I asked the hospital nurse for extras to take home and then I had 2 cases of the 2 oz at home and I will tell you, the first 2 weeks home has been a breeze with feeding!  Good luck and I hope this helps

review/text: This is the same formula that the hospital provided after our daughter was born. We did not nurse so we continued to use these for two weeks until they became too small for our daughter as she is up to 3 + ounces per feeding after two weeks. The only negative is that each box of 8 only comes with one nipple. She does have some re flux and gas however I can not say it is because of the formula make up.

review/text: We received a few of these at the hospital when our son was born. They were great to just throw in the diaper bag to have on hand when out and about. I had to take a last minute trip by airplane and decided that these would be easier than powered formula during travel. Purchased these on Amazon with Prime delivery for a decent price. They worked great for the airplane as I didn't have to mess with making bottles when my little guy decided he was hungry NOW. I just wish they would make a 4 oz size as the 2 oz is now too small, but the 8 oz is too big. I'd rather use a few of the smaller size right now than risk wasting part of the 8 oz bottle.

Small nipples, so they fit the newborn mouths well, and no mixing during that overwhelming time when they are first born.  Save the nipples and rings so you can use them on new bottles, and recycle the empty bottles.  Also good for diaper bags for when the babies are small (and don't need large amounts yet).

I found that the Gerber essentials bottles nipples and rings will fit these nursette bottles wonderfully!!!  A 3 pack of those bottles only costs a little over 3 bucks at the big box store.  I purchased 9 of them to make sure I had nipples on hand to use just for these nursette bottles.  The formula works fine for my baby and these bottles are just so handy. No mixing, or cleaning bottles.  I'd highly recommend them.  Another point is that these come in an 8 pack and Enfamil's version only has 6 in a box and are a buck or 2 more expensive.

I'm using it to supplement my breastfeeding and for the times when I'm either too sore to feed or just too tired at night. These 2 ounce bottles are perfect for quick painless feeding in the wee hours of the night. It comes with a single reusable nipple per box.  This is a staple in our nursery for rush feedings.<br /><br />I should point out that this has milk + soy as well as iron supplements.
