review/summary: Nightmare
review/text: I love to read reviews but seldom write one. But this product really leaves me no choice. Well, I tend to stay away from the notorious GV products which are widely present in Walmart. But I still buy their green tea product from time to time because it is cheaper than other major brands like Lipton. As expected, the taste is so-so. But, well, acceptable (reluctantly). You know what, after drinking this Bigelow thing, I start to like the GV green tea. Enough said. One more thing, if anyone can tell me what the hell is that smell from the packaging. I really appreciate it.

review/summary: deceptive labeling
review/text: I just bought Bigelow Green Tea and would advise anyone purchasing this product to read the country of origin which is "Product of China".  The write up says that the product is blended and distributed in the USA, but that in itself is deceptive if the originating country is not listed.  Food products according to the Food and Drug administration aren't required to actually list where a product comes from.

review/summary: A different variant of the same spice by MDH
review/text: Usually, I love MDH spices. I think they make better spices than anybody else on the market. So, naturally, I bought this Pack of 10 Jal Jeera Masala without having a second thought hoping it would be the same, if not better, than the one I already used to own (which was also actually made by the same company, MDH). Bad decision.<br /><br />This version of their Jal Jeera masala , for the worse, tastes quite different. It has a more bitter taste, and a stronger odor. The ingredients are the same in both packages, so I believe the percentages of the contents must be off.<br /><br />Since no images were available when I bought this pack, I have uploaded the picture of the product you will be getting. Compare that with the one that I actually like which is this one:<br />[...]

review/summary: Fantastic Fresh Dill Weed
review/text: This dill weed came in a heat sealed metallic plastic bag. When I cut it open and took a whiff, the aroma was heavenly. Wow. I poured it out into several plastic spice containers to find that it has a deep green color, is fresh, not old or faded in color or aroma. There were no cut up stems or filler of any kind.<br /><br />I use dill weed in so many things, from baking to cooking to popcorn topping. This dill is, hands down, the best I've ever purchased. It's even better than when I've bought dill weed fresh at the store and dried it myself. The flavor is bold and rich and delicious.<br /><br />This 16 oz bag is a fraction of the cost that I'd pay at the grocery store, where a 2 oz bottle is $5.99. This is an economical way to buy dill weed.<br /><br />Excellent quality. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out.

review/summary: Very fresh, very strong, a bit much
review/text: After wasting a lot of money on tiny supermarket dill weed containers, I opted to try for a higher volume. Too high, I think. This 16-oz bag looks like it fell from the set of a cop drama. Even after I refilled my smaller dispensers and used over an ounce on a salmon recipe, I still had enough left to fill a tupperware container I ordinarily use to hold a week of spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />It's wonderful stuff this dill weed, fresh and pungent, cleanly cut and intensely green, but I was informed by more cooking-savvy relatives that I could have bought an arbitrary weight of any spice from smaller local chains and farmers markets. So, while this product is exactly as described and a great deal, I'm not likely to buy it again. Not for a year or two, anyway.

review/text: The dill itself is very good, fresh, green and pure. Already minced to tiny pieces powder like level. I just transferred some of it to a large spice shaker. 16 oz is a huge quantity..... will have to find people to share it with otherwise 16 oz will last a very long time.<br />I folded the original bag to take the air out and resealed it with a tape and then placed it in a zip bag. Hope it will last fresh for a long time. Compare to $4-5 for small containers at supermarkets or Sam's club it is a super cheap price and you can use the Amazon free shipping. Wish they would ship it in a few smaller packages instad of one large one to keep it fresher for the long run.

review/text: This dill weed has a pleasant fresh scent compared to what I had bought at the store. Changed my mind about using this spice since in the past, store types seemed pungent. A pound is a lot of dill weed because it's dried, so someone with less storage might consider a smaller amount. I put the extra in a storage wire jar.

That way it keeps it wonderful scent and flavor, and it doesn't pick up any plastic or metallic traces.<br /><br />I also make sure to label it clearly with the best by date so I don't have to open it up and expose it to the air too much.<br /><br />Keep them in a dark area of the cupboard if you use clear glass.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more of these in the future!!

review/summary: Camp Dog Cajun Seasoning is now a staple in my pantry
review/text: And I have a friend in Baton Rouge to blame, actually make that thank.  She was the first one to send me some and since then I have been ordering it myself.<br /><br />I have tried both of the blends offered by Camp Dog; Original and the Non-Typical Milder Blend sold here and while they are both good, I have to say I prefer the original because of the heat. I have been using this on just about everything; steaks, chicken, fish and my favorite - pork chops or tenderloin. A very easy recipe to make that gets rave reviews in my house is to sprinkle the seasoning generously on the chops and grill in a pan. Once they are about 5 minutes from being done add 2 Tb of honey & 1 Tb of butter.  It makes a sweet, but spicy glaze on the chops.  You can also mix up a Tb of brown sugar, dijon mustard and water, then cook using the same instructions for a different flavor.<br /><br />Two of their other products I can also recommend are the Fish Fry and Hush Puppy Mix.  Both are easy to make and just as delicious!

review/summary: Surprising Nutrition Numbers
review/text: I had my first ramen noodles when I was about 12.  A family from down south moved close by and I became friends with their son.  One night I had dinner with them and unknowingly was eating ramen noodles (we called them worms).  They were the super cheap kind you'd find in most American stores.  That night was also the first (and only) time I'd eaten ribs, which was a traumatic experience (I hated bones in my food).  I didn't really eat ramen much until late high school and college years after that.  I still only knew this as worm noodles until I started buying my own food.  That's when I learned what ramen really was.  I really enjoyed the stuff Campbell's or whoever had with the line of baked ramen.  I ate that stuff like crazy.  Today, I'm a vegetarian so much of the ramen in stores is not for me.  I used to buy the mushroom kind just for the noodles and instead of using the sodium packet I'd put a little butter and dash of salt and pepper.  But I haven't really done that since the baked ramen was discontinued.  The other day I decided to search Amazon for vegetarian ramen and discovered this stuff from Koyo.  I wasn't familiar with the company but the reviews were decent.  I especially liked the part of being vegetarian friendly.  So I bought a case and was eager for its arrival.  The first thing I noticed was the nutritional label.  There was only 193 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 0.5 gram saturated fat in a brick of noodles.  I was surprised because I was expecting something like 6 to 8 grams of fat like the stuff on most supermarket shelves.  I also noticed it said it was a product of China but then realize I was eating ramen after all.  That's like not buying Mandarin orange because they're from China.  I had my first bowl of it which I used half of a packet of flavoring with.  It was very good and I was happy.  I've since been altering between the half of a seasoning packet (which is loaded with sodium just like the cheap ramen) or the butter/salt/pepper mix.  I prefer the latter but the former is no doubt good too.  I wasn't half way through that first box of Koyo ramen before I had three more cases on the way.  Now my cabinets are stocked full of Koyo ramen.

review/summary: plain ramen
review/text: If you're looking for a healthier substitute for Top or Maruchan, this might not be for you.  This noodle is a bit plain by comparison.  But it doesn't taste too bad.  Although, I think I may have used a little too much water (didn't measure, I always just eyeball it when cooking ramen).  But, it also doesn't make you feel bad afterwards.  Not sure if the "organic" thing is just a gimmick.  But I'd like to believe it's made of better stuff than your average ramen.  After shipping, each pack is relatively expensive.  Not sure if we'll try it again.  We can probably find other asian noodles with similar health content for about the same price but this is the first "ramen" I've found of this kind (other "healthier" noodles that I've had that comes with soup like this tends to be thicker more like "udon").  After my son and I (both pretty much ramen addicts) go through the whole pack, I might update this review.<br /><br />Each package seems small to me (again, compared with Top or Maruchan).  But after cooking it, there seems to be about the same amount of noodle.  Maybe they were able to get more air/water out of it...??<br /><br />UPDATE: I tried following the directions more closely and then customize from there.  Using the right amount of water helps a lot with taste of the broth (of course).  The directions say to cook for 4 minutes.  I find that makes the noodles too soft and mushy.  I like them at 3 minutes so that they're more firm.  Yellow egg noodles fans should understand.  My son who is a very picky eater likes it -- so far so good.  But I probably won't buy these again unless he asks for them (and maybe try a different kind).  The cost (after shipping) is a bit too much IMHO.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: We tried it with some cut up fish cakes ([...]).  They helped make the noodles better.

review/text: If you have lived in Mainland China, you would know that it's almost impossible to get clean food, let alone organic and/or all-natural food.  How this maker can ensure that is beyond me.  But let's give them the benefit of doubt for now, shall we?  The noodle pack size is way too light/small.  It's like 1/2 the portion of regular instant noodle.  The noodles tastes quite chemical-free to my sensitive tongue, that's good.  Aftertaste was minimal, that's good.  Soup base pack is a lil' on the salty side, noodles didn't absorb the flavor too well.  At this time, I may not re-order...

review/summary: so happy I discovered these
review/text: Ramen has always been a guilty comfort food for me, because of the MSG and fat.  So I am so glad I discovered these noodles!  You can definitely tell the difference in flavor without the chemical flavor enhancers but I doctor my ramen up so in the end it doesn't matter.  Here is how I make mine:<br /><br />3 or 4 brown (or you could use white) mushrooms diced small<br />1/4 cup chopped red or brown onion<br />1 cup bock choy chopped<br />splash of soy sauce<br />lots of siracha<br />flavor pack from Ramen package<br />fyi I don't actually measure, I just kinda do it by eye and I don't think it matters if these amounts are exact<br /><br />I cook all of these together, then add the ramen, then throw in an egg and let it hardboil in the broth, and voila. DO NOT OVERCOOK (like for more than 15 minutes) or noodles will by kinda gross. I do think you need to add something to this ramen otherwise it is a tad bland.  Bottom line if you are willing to work with these they are delicious and especially nice if you have a cold or an upset stomach.  Enjoy!

Extra money is well spent in packaging as each tea bag is individually wrapped in airtight foil pouches virtually guaranteeing the freshest possible brew one can get. By definition, many grocery item preferences are going to be subjective as individuals tastes differ. Popular consumer magazines may rate a given coffee or tea as a best buy or as the best in its class but there will be many people who think the alleged "best" is far from their favorite.<br /><br />One thing I think you can count on with Bigelow, and this differs from what one other reviewer said. That thing is consistency in flavor and strength. Over the years I've found Bigelow to have this consistency giving me, the consumer of always knowing that I'm going to get what I expect. I do not find it to be bitter at all, though with the competitor "Twinings" I do. I also like many of their other flavors, Orange Spice, Earl Grey, Constant Comment and their Organic Green decaf, though completely different than any black tea I find to be of high an consistent quality. I really like having their packaging and think it reflects a higher degree of quality than is to be found in boxes of tea bags that come packaged loose and must be put into zip lock bags to try to preserve freshness. Having to put tea bags in a zip lock bag to keep them fresh is inherently inferior to bags that are packaged such as these. As with many things, one may pay a little more for a product but in the case of tea, in this case I think the few extra pennies do provide the consumer with a value added product.

review/summary: Basic black tea
review/text: This tea is a pretty basic black tea. There are no exotic flavorings added, just tea. It has a decent amount of strength; it's full-bodied but not overwhelming. I'm quite satisfied when I have a cup of this tea. I generally prefer to drink flavored teas, but for a basic black tea this variety is quite good.

review/summary: Good Tea, Good Taste, Good Times
review/text: So . . . Amazon requested a review.  :)  Ok, it is a tasty tea, fragrant straight out of the packet.  An aspect of Bigelow tea that I appreciate is that each bag comes in an airtight packet to seal in freshness and fragrance.  Protects the tea from moisture, contamination, bugs, etc. as well, so you can take these anywhere you go (e.g. work, vacation, picnic).  Most importantly, the taste is pleasing.  Steep this tea a good 6 minutes and you get a stronger version of the tea, not an acidic or bitter version like most other teas.  The flavor is not bland, but never anything near spiced.  It is a solid, pleasant tea that hovers between the mildness of English Breakfast and the more exotic tinge of Darjeeling.  Good stuff for any time of the day.

review/summary: Was: Oddly weak flavor  Now: Much Improved
review/text: Update:  03/24/2011  The flavor seems stronger and better preserved now.  Can't remember if they<br />had foil lining before, but they do now, and it's sealed well.  Smells crisp and strong. Still runs<br />away a bit, but much improved.  Their Darjeeling gets whoppingly potent on a long brew now, if you<br />want more flavor. Or is it their buying?  Anyway, I noticed it's better.<br /><br />"Teatime" tea is usually robust in flavor.  "English", these days, usually means a very rich, fresh tea, Like "London Cuppa", "Yorkshire Gold", "New English Teas", or others. The Bigelow was surprisingly weak, even when I doubled down.  Bentley's is similarly faded, although a bit more potent.  This tea will not stand up to a dash of milk, more like breakfast tea than teatime tea.  There is a very fine flavor there, especially the fresh-straw aftertaste, but it's a bit weak compared to the teas in today's Brit. flavor race.  I had to pounce on the cup before the flavor volatilized the second time.  Then again, you may want a tea like that of 20 years ago.  If so, this is light but pleasant....like "Constant Comment" without the spicing.  It just was a bit lightweight for me.  As happened with chocolates, tea has gotten stronger and better among the fanatics.  Hopefully, they can find a way to capture more of the new flavor.  The quantity in the bag seems generous enough to do the job.

review/text: My 12 year old cat had ear mites in her left ear and I was recommended to pick this up. I cleaned her ears with a cotton ball first, and then applied a few drops. The mites were gone in one week! I noticed no side effects whatsoever.<br /><br />I was somewhat hesitant about the "Sentry" brand, but my vet confirmed that the medication in this was okay. I also find it odd that this brand has such negative reviews but is still operating and being sold in stores such as Petco and Petsmart. I will remain hesitant about this brand, but this product worked great for me. I would recommend it.

review/summary: Works well, cats hate it though
review/text: I bought this because my cats had picked up ear mites. This product worked very well for clearing the ear mites up. I don't think the directions mention this, but before you use it, you should clean your cat's ears thoroughly to get the gunk out (use a q-tip and go down only as far as you can see, no deeper). I used this product, as recommended, twice a day. After about 6 doses (3 days) the cats had stopped scratching their ears and I continued using it for another 2 days (10 doses in total) to make sure they were gone completely. It's been a week now and they're mite free (no scratching, no ear gunk).

review/summary: Aye, Carumba! I Love Espresso!
review/text: I've been an espresso freak since I first tried one after viewing The Godfather Part II (Don Fanucci downs it in one gulp while talking to the young Vito Coreleone). I used to go to Starbucks every morning, but I eventually decided to buy my own machine (Espressione Cafe Retro)and brew my own. I gravited to pods because they were so much easier and less messy than ground coffee. I buy the Sampler Packs from Podmerchant exclusively, but not because I am attempting through scientific research to find the "best" brand. There is no BEST brand. Sometimes I want something light and tangy, so I'll reach for an Attibassi Nicaragua. Maybe a rich, heavy blast after a big meal? Gotta be a Lucaffe Mr. Exclusive. Early afternoon is the perfect time for a Cafe Mako Napoletano. I like the variety, I like the colorful packaging, I like to be surprised and not know what's coming next! Espresso is a treat, a pure delight, something to be savored. Who wants to savor the same thing over and over? Give me variety, or give me death!

Some are better than others, but trying them out will keep you from later ordering 100 of something you don't like.<br /><br />The order was processed quickly and they were delivered no problem via UPS.  There were also a couple of "freebie" pods and a coupon as a thank you for the order which I thought was a nice touch.

review/text: At first glance, it seems like 60 cents per pod is really rather expensive.  Starbucks charges $0.42/pod in boxes of 12.  Other merchants like Podhead charge anywhere from $0.42 and up plus shipping.  This sampler contains some exclusive pods that retail for much more making this a decent deal afterall.  However, don't be fooled into thinking you'll really want to drink $2.00 pods on a daily basis. [...] and they have free shipping on $75 or more orders.  Most are less than $0.50/pod if you buy a quantity worthy of a casual espresso drinker.

review/text: The best sampling of pods I've run across.  Price works out to be about 58.3 cents per pod.  What's really nice is that I didn't know that you could get single-origin pods, and at least two of the brands in this sampler offer them, so it's great to taste the differences in the single-origin coffees as well as the differences in roasts between manufacturers.  Find what you like, and then you can get larger quantities of the pods you really like.  No joke about taking notes, either.  It helps to keep track of which ones you like and dislike...  There is definitely variation in the flow through the different pod brands too- so find what works well with your machine too.

review/text: Got this sample box as a gift with my new espresso machine and I have tried about 4 of the pods. Some are expired which things happen I understand so eh. However the four kinds I have tried which were not expired have been just awful. I haven't been able to finish a single cup I have even resorted to ripping the pods out and trying to add and tamp it myself to see if that would help. I think the espresso that we get in this sample pack is just nasty stuff. Also I did not get all the brands pictured. Basically I don't think the price was worth what I got for the money that was spent I felt really bad telling the person who bought this for me they wasted their money :|<br /><br />Update -  yes already, I was going through my box of pods trying to sort expired from not and what I drank already and didn't like to toss away when I ran across three packages that were coffee pods not espresso pods. So I don't know what to do with those perhaps they might work! But I do not have a coffee maching that takes pods I have a espresso machine. I did come across a white package of espresso that I did enjoy and wanted to leave a review on that brand; however, I don't even see the brand on their picture here so I guess there is no point to that.

review/summary: Delicious Espresso, Great Company!
review/text: I ordered a decaf sampler, but a super sampler was sent to me in error.  I called up Pod Merchant and they very amiably said they would send me a decaf sampler at no charge because of their mistake.  I received the next package in three days, with plenty of time before Christmas.  I was very happy with Pod Merchant's customer service and the espresso is amazing!

review/summary: Great way to try different espressos
review/text: I am relatively new to the home brewed espresso machines.  After some trial and error I have found ground (no I don't grind my own, yet) espresso that I really like.  I have been buying the Illy pods at the local Bed Bath & Beyond, with the 20% coupons they are a great deal.<br />I happened across this E.S.E. pod assortment while I was looking at new espresso machines. (I wound up buying a Breville) I really love all the varieties.  It seemed, when I was trying the different brands each one was better than the previous.  I think that my favorite in this assortment are the Lucafe pods.  The artwork on the pack is very 20's and the espresso is outstanding.  All the pods were fresh, they have dates stamped on the package. I have ordered multiple times since my first purchase and have signed up for the PodMerchant newsletter, which includes a discount code.<br />This assortment is all blended coffee, that is, mostly Arabica with some Robusta.  I didn't know what that meant, either, but do now.  PodMerchant also offers assortments of 100% Arabica, and even Lucafe assortments (just bought one - I was not disappointed)<br />If you've never used the pod adapter that came with your machine, time to order this variety pack and find that pods can be better than ground!  And less time to coffee!

review/text: I really like this sampler collection and would have gtiven it 5 stars but for the fact that I liked the same vendor's "blend" sampler even better.<br /><br />This one is almost TOO much of a good thing.  I can't keep straight which ones I like and which ones I don't like (very few).  It will also take me a while to go through all of them.<br /><br />If you have multiple espresso drinkers in your house, this one may be for you.  If you are the only one drinking it, I'd opt for the smaller blend sampler and keep things a little fresher.  Just my opinion.  All are of good quality.  No compliants at all.

Each time I made an espresso I marked the empty POD envelopes A, B or C to remember which ones I liked best.  I recently got a Francis X1 and this sampler pack has helped me enjoy my new espresso machine.

review/summary: Nice collection except for one lemon
review/text: It was going great (really great) until we hit the first Hausbrandt pod. Watery, light and tasteless. All the Hausbrandt pods are the same. I wish PodMerchant would take this out of the collection.<br /><br />The rest of the collection is fantastic. If you are looking to sample a variety of coffee flavors before deciding to mass order the ones you like, this sampler collection is ideal. We have no favorite brands, just what suits us best for the occasion. In general, the darker wrappers seem to be the richer, heavier flavors and the lighter wrappers were lighter. That said, there are many exceptions to the rule. We liked to be surprised.<br /><br />Highly recommend this collection, but only if PodMerchant will be kind enough to remove the HausBrandts. Atleast 10 pods were of this brand.

review/summary: Beware - these do not fit regular pod machines
review/text: I own a Senseo coffee machine, and another brand machine which I keep at work.  Both use standard size coffee pods, quite successfully, and brew a rich cup of coffee.  I bought this espresso pod sampler and found that espresso pods do not conform to the size used by regular pod machines.  This is just a polite warning not to waste your money if your machine is not designed for espresso.

review/summary: Not great
review/text: Although I normally grind up beans and make espresso, I bought some of these pods for when I'm in a rush to get out of the door.  I have used Illy espresso pods before with great results, but these pods were a huge dissapointment.  I tried six pods out of the bag when I first got the pod pack(since there is a random mix of all different types).  Each cup was really poor.  The pods themselves are packed very loosley, so that the espresso ends up super weak and tastes like a bad bitter cup of coffee.  When I saw these I thought "What a deal!"  You are much better off spending the extra money for the Illy, or grinding up your own beans.

The consistency of the pods is so much greater than grounds (especially with low-end consumer grinders and espresso machines) and the speed and convenience make it a no-brainer. Using pods and a sampler pack like this is like trying a different coffee shop every day.

I'll be sticking with the Espressione brand for my next purchase since the flavor and result is more consistent.

review/summary: Good Ingredients & The Dogs Love Them
review/text: I have respect for the Wellness brand and have previously bought my dogs other Wellness treats.  These WellBars are marketed as "bite size."  My corgis love them!  And, they can certainly eat them in one bite.  But, for a medium dog, I consider these larger than bite size.  Luckily, the bars are easily broken in two to provide a smaller snack.  (Weight maintenance is a high priority with my chow hounds.)<br /><br />Each bar has 24 calories.  The first few ingredients are:  ground barley, cane molasses, ground brown rice, whitefish, and sweet potatoes.  There's no wheat, corn, soy, artificial preservatives/color/flavor.<br /><br />This is a big box of treats.  I do wish that the bag was resealable, but that's a quibble.

review/summary: Bad for teeth
review/text: Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>

review/summary: Good...but stinky...in the end.
review/text: My dog, of course, adores these - anything with cheese is his favorite.  However, they gave him considerable amounts of gas.  We will, however, try other Wellness treats to see if they work better.

review/summary: SMELLS GOOD even I want to eat it
review/text: This smells so good . Doesnt' smell like cardboard boxes. Comes in thick plastic bag to prevent puncture and letting the freshness go out.  There's no sealable zipper or anything so I have to use a clothing pin.<br /><br />My dog eats it when she wants to.  I leave it next to her bed she won't touch it sometimes. But sometimes she does eat it up.  She should eat it up fast or else it will become stale.<br /><br />Smells fruity and a hint of gingersnap cookies.  I gave it to another dog and he ate it like there was no tomorrow.  I gave my dog a wellness lamb jerky .. she ate it like crazy. I gave the other dog lamb jerky... he ate it like crazy.<br /><br />My conclusion is that not all dogs like fruity gingersnap cookies. Still have 60% left.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very good but I should stick to a guarantee treat....the lamb or any line meat jerky offered by Wellness.<br /><br />Not sure if I can eat it . lol

review/summary: happy dogs!
review/text: I have been giving Wellness treats to my dogs for awhile.  They really like them and I think Wellness puts out a good product.  When I get the box out at night, they run to their crates and wait for their late night snack. No command necessary!
