review/summary: 5 STARS FOR CRYSTAL PEPSI!
review/text: Don't let the 1 star review fool you guys, the 1 star reviewer even mentioned how he hated Crystal Pepsi to begin with, so his opinion shouldn't matter. You're all here because you've been TRYING to find Crystal Pepsi once again since you had it last back in the early 90s, so this is exactly what you've been looking for.<br /><br />Granted, the name is, well, terrible...so, maybe if and when this soda becomes super popular, the name might change. Until then, deal with Racist Crystal Pepsi and be brought back to your nostalgic memories!

review/summary: I heart the 90's
review/text: This tastes just like Crystal Pepsi. I've been ordering this from another online store for a while now (since I've become addicted again) and now that Amazon has it in stock again, It's the best price around if you can't visit Real Soda in California directly. It's really hard to describe the flavor. Some say flat? I'd say lower carbonation. It's sweet (real sugar used) and has a cola aftertaste. That first sip makes it seem almost citrus in flavor, but once into half a bottle, that subsides.

review/summary: Not bad once you give it a chance
review/text: First off don't be put off by the name as so many people are. It is a joke. I never had Crystal Pepsi back when it was out, but my friends and I wanted to give this a shot. My advice to those who are trying it for the first time is save your judgment until you have a couple of them. It has a lime bite to it your first sip of it, and unless you've had Crystal Pepsi before, it will taste like no soda you've ever tried. However by the time you get to the end of your first or second bottle you'll really take a liking to the taste. My only regret is that it is so hard to find!

review/summary: great cola.... joke done in bad taste
review/text: The name of the cola is designed to make light of the events of the germans during world war 2 and while I agree that we need tackle those events differently than the way we are now the name of this soda is just a joke done in poor taste. Now from the stand point of a person who has never tried crystal pepsi in his life I can tell you that this drink is a smooth drink, its a very hard flavor to describe and the smell does not do it justice. From the smell of it, it smells like a cleaner and when you drink it lime/lemon flavor is so minute as with the pepsi taste that you really can't tell what the flavor is, it's also not highly carbonated it has just enough to enhance the lemon/lime taste. The best way I think I can describe the flavor is if you took a gallon of lemon seltzer water added a cup of lime juice and and a cup of pepsi, then shook the bottle once and chilled it and then added 4 table spoons of sugar you would get a taste somewhat similar. Truthfully it's a drink you have to try for yourself so i'd wait till amazon gets more in and order one case, just beware that it does sell out pretty quickly and seems to be a limited time type of thing.

review/summary: Maybe I got a bad batch, but this is terrible.
review/text: I've seen reviews where people compare it to Crystal Pepsi. In that it has a recognizable taste of Pepsi.<br /><br />I don't get that at all. Every bottle I try and have friends try, it tastes like how toilet cleaner smells. It seriously tastes like "green" scented cleaning chemicals. I really hope I got a bad batch. For about $2 a bottle, this was absolutely terrible. I wish I could get a refund, or a reshipment if this is not what its supposed to taste like.

review/text: Exactly how I always pictured Bertie Bott's beans would be. I have the generation before these and they've been spot on since movie 1 (GOD, the HORSERADISH flavor was AWFUL. UGH.). The generation before these has a single flavor that literally made me retch. The fish flavored jelly beans are SO AWFUL that you will gag.<br /><br />You will.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, only have a few really awful ones. Avoid vomit if you can, because that's probably what you'll be doing next.<br /><br />whoever makes these is awesome.

review/summary: The flavours are not lies!
review/text: These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

review/text: I was really excited to find Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans because my kids would love them.  It was a 2-pack, and for $9 I figured that the boxes would be pretty big.  Boy was I wrong.  The boxes are the size of small raisin boxes, and they aren't even filled very full.  I was very disappointed and feel ripped off.  Breaking the cost down, each jelly bean costs about 25 cents, and these are small candies - the size of jelly bellys.  Don't waste your money unless you have a lot to waste...

During a Harry Potter themed birthday, we had an "every flavoured bean tasting" The dirt and grass were pretty realistic, but the vomit was a bit coconutty in taste. (Hmmm. Makes me wonder.) Anyway, they were not all meant to be delecious, yet some were (think, Tutti-Fruity) I would def give them a go again should we have the urge.

review/text: Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!

Most people I offered them to seemed put off by the possibility of getting a bad flavor jelly bean, but eventually curiosity got the better of them and they couldn't resist trying one.<br /><br />I had the displeasure of getting "earthworm" and "earwax" myself. Yes, they tasted absolutely horrible. But that's the point! It's fun to try the jelly beans out to see if they really are as disgusting as you might imagine.<br /><br />There are some good flavors in there too, but most of them are gross and fun. :p<br /><br />It's a great conversation starter. It's fun to see who is risk-averse and who will try anything.

review/text: I ordered these to have at my son's Harry Potter birthday party.  The kids had fun eating them and trying to guess what "nasty" flavor each one was.  However, the two boxes are extremely small and I would not pay the almost $9 +shipping for them again.  If I had known how small the boxes were (I honestly did not check size before purchasing-lesson learned!) I would not have bought them.  I had to be very skimpy with the kids on how many they could try so that each child got to eat a couple-and we only had 10 kids there!  Fun, but pricey!

review/text: Buyers beware that this sale is for 1 box of 5 cookies NOT five, 5-Count Boxes as what seems to be advertised here. I thought I was buying "in bulk" - five, 5-piece boxes - at what is competitive, albeit slightly more expensive than several retailers that sell the same cookies; the few cents more was not an issue since free delivery is a plus. Surprisingly, I received one box of 5 cookies for the outrageous price of $18.85. Hopefully, the Amazon webmaster will correct the description so that the next buyer knows exactly what he/she is paying for - 1 box of cookies.  The Amazon rep was very helpful in rectifying situation which was the only saving grace here.  I'd be happy to buy again in the future and give 4 stars if this does indeed become a five, 5-count box offer.

review/text: My son is very finicky when it comes to snacks or food in general and we were struggling with finding easy things he could have as an on-the-go snack, while at a friends house one day she gave him one of these.  And he loved it! He loves just about anything that has yogurt or bananas in it, this fulfilled both of those tastes. Grammy Sammy's are the perfect size toddler snack, soft on the outside not very crumbly, not really sticky... individually wrapped and highly portable.  We were buying at Babies R' Us, until I discovered them on Amazon...and it works out to be more cost effective which is great! For picky toddler snacks we've had the greatest luck with these, Toddler Mum Mums, and Happy Melts.

review/summary: Did not get to experience this wonderful stuff until a trip to Scotland
review/text: I spent two months in Scotland back in 2005 and that's where I got my first taste of Coleman's. (as well as single-malt Scotch)  Now I keep several bottles in the house (mustard and single-malt Scotch!).  I'm sure I was served the mustard prepped from a tin as it was VERY strong compared to the mustard in the bottles.  I was having lunch in the bar of my hotel when they asked if I wanted some to go with my sausage - which I slathered on like regular mustard. I was not suspecting how hot it was as I'd never had English mustard, however I have tried Chinese Hot Mustard, but this was way tastier and I became a fan as soon as I recovered from the shock and after my eyes stopped watering!<br /><br /> I just haven't gotten around to trying it from the tin, but next trip to the grocery store, I will. Didn't think there was any difference until I read another Amazon review...

review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/text: I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10.

review/summary: pretty good, could be better
review/text: Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.

review/text: The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!

review/text: WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.

review/summary: Salty and vinegary!!!
review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

review/text: OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

review/summary: Not quite the best...
review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.
