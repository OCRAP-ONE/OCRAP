review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I originally got these because I have blood sugar drops occasionally and didn't really want to junky hard candy. Normally, I don't care for candy at all, but it's a little difficult to carry a slice of fruit or a juice box around my purse for emergencies. A couple of these gives me enough of a spike to get where I'm going and eat safely... and, they're actually really good!<br /><br />They put more than just the four listed flavors into my bag. I got some ginger candies and plain honey candies as well as the honey-lemon, pomegranate, cherry, and apple. I LOVE the apple - it's not sour at all and has a very natural flavor. All the flavors are juicy and delicious.<br /><br />These are definitely worth the money if enjoy candies and you're trying to go the all-natural route.

review/summary: Hard to find, worth the money!
review/text: This is hands down the best dog food we have ever found.  I have 2 Boston Terriers who, putting it mildly, have issues.  One throws up when given anything out of the ordinary, the other has skin problems and allergies.  Normally we find a dry food that may work for one and not the other.  At the end of the firt bag of Nutrisca, both dogs were remarkably improved.  There were no digestive issues, both had stopped the constant need for scratching, both had regrown the missing fur in hot spot areas, both were energetic, happy, and healthy.<br />There was a time when we were unable to find Nutrisca and so tried other foods that came very highly recommended by our local hippie doggie boutique, but where one dog might do well, the other suffered (not to mention the huge price difference).

review/summary: Good product
review/text: This is one of the few grain free brands that actually put weight on my very active dog so for that reason it gets 4 stars. Kibble size is on the smaller side, uniform color and size. Smell is unremarkeable. Dog had no problem eating it and stool was firm. He is a Collie and his coat color, texture and volume were all good. The only issue I have, as with most grain free foods, is cost. I had never heard of this food before until surfing through Amazon and I like it better than the Nature's Variety Instinct I was feeding before. Too bad this wasn't available through local vendors.

review/text: I never got the wow factor with the dog food tht I was expecting. Currently my lab and border collie are on Nutro sensative stomach. I fine it is just as good if not better than Nutrisca. For the price Nutro is slightly cheaper but is much easier to find. My local pet supply carries Nutro. I haven't yet found a local supplier for Nutrisca. Didn't see any sort of improvement with the food and it didn't seem like the dogs were all that interested in it. They ate it but it sat around alot longer before they dove in.

review/summary: Another Die Hard Johnny's Fan!
review/text: I first purchased this at Costco many years ago (sadly, Costco no longer carries it but luckily I can still buy it online). At that time, I could not have imagined that it would become my "go-to" spice for EVERYTHING - and I mean everything.<br /><br />I use Johnny's Garlic Spread of course on bread to make great garlic bread with pastas. Also, use it on buttered bread to make incredible Grilled Cheese sandwiches. Chicken, shrimp, in salads. Johnny's is there. One of the BEST things to make with it, however, are baked french fries! So easy and soooo good (and healthy!). Here's how:<br /><br />1) Slice up a fresh potato into thin strips. Leave the skin on for extra deliciousness.<br />2) Place potato strips into a gallon size zip storage bag. Add olive oil and Johnny's seasoning. Shake well to coat.<br />3) Dump seasoned fries onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake @ 400 degrees for 17-20 minutes. Flip fries and bake the other side for another 17-20.<br /><br />Enjoy some of the most amazing baked french fries ever!:-)

review/text: Oh my goodness.. This is indeed the best garlic seasoning made.  I too first became familiar with it via Costco and they no longer carry it at my store.<br />Costco keeps products on the shelves by demographics & by your buying choices.  There is a "feedback" box near the door going out.  Place a request for them to bring it back!  It works with some products.<br /><br />I used it in everything where there is a need for a garlic & parmesan combination.  Often times to make garlic bread, I just spread some butter on the bread & sprinkle the Johnny's on it.. no need to muss up a bowl to mix.<br />I sprinkle it on top of just about anything & everything & I love using it in the last minute when cooking shrimp.<br />Yummm... My mouth is watering.  :D

review/summary: Bait & switch! Not the real thing if from The Spice Lab!
review/text: Das Salt fleur de sel is the best of those I've tried. Awesome as finishing salt and a touch on chocolate ice cream can't be beat.<br /><br />Update 5/10/2011:  Amazon will not let me delete the review I wrote in 2010 (it keeps the date) and start over, so all I can do is give this added information.  Since my first purchase, I've tried a few other brands of fleur de sel de Guerande.  Das Salt is the best.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salt sold by Spice Lab is NOT Das Salt even though he uses a Das image and description & says it is by Das Salt. Seriously, if it ships from The Spice Lab it is NOT Das Salt. What you will get from The Spice Lab is repackaged salt in an unsealed container and a lot of trust-me-trust-me-trust-me crap about how honest the seller is -- from him, of course. No real surprise the seller misrepresents the product -- would you buy it if he advertised it as it is: repackaged salt, who knows how, from who knows where?<br /><br />This section is product reviews, not seller reviews, so buyer beware.  My first review was for Das Salt fleur de sel, not the stuff you will get from The Spice Lab, but you'd never know it.  I guess because Mr. Spice Lab says he is selling Das Salt, the reviews still apply but as noted, he is NOT selling Das Salt.  Some of the reviews here were written for the real deal and not for that you will get from Spice Lab.<br /><br />Update 5/19/2011.  After multiple complaints, it must be that Amazon made Spice Lab take down their falsely advertised product because Amazon is back to selling Das Salt from Das.  The reviews follow the product, not the seller.  I will leave this post as negative in case dear Brett from Spice Lab tries his trickery again. My praise for Das Salt is HIGH.  My low rating is for FAKE Das salt sold by Spice Lab.

review/text: I am new to the world of gourmet salts--and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago!  The granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel--but that is where the similiarities end.  The salt dissolves instantly on the tongue; it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste.  The jar suggests it be used  on grilled fish and salads, but I would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also.

Of course, I only added a little bit of salt after I had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish.  Can you imagine my surprise when I tasted the fish, only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth.  I must say that I'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore.  Now I understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts...

If you ask me, that's the only Salt you need in your pantry, this is the real thing! Harvested by hand in Guerande, France and dried under the sun, a little crystal on your tongue is like breathing the fresh marine air of Brittany.

review/text: This pertains to the Das Salt with the white and blue labeling. If you've never tried it, you won't believe how different it is from what you think of as 'salt.' ...it's not salty, not in the stringent, NaCl kind of way. Instead, it just adds flavor, lots and lots of little tiny bits of flavor, none of which stand out enough to be identifiable (at least, not yet to me), but all of which are certainly detectable as a difference over whatever you were used to it tasting like before. (and if you've eaten KCl and are thinking of that - bah, rinse your mouth). Whisk with oil and vinegar for salads; sprinkle it on fresh veggies; we even put a pinch in watermelon puree for smoothies. For things that are supposed to be a little bit salty, try 50/50 this and your kosher salt; maybe after a quick pass with a pestle. It's called salt, but is a totally different ingredient than the other stuff. My new go-to housewarming and 'what to give when I have no idea' present.

review/summary: Surprisingly flavorful
review/text: I debated buying this, as it's rather expensive. I'm glad I got it. Just a pinch on top of a finished dish (such as fish or steak) really brings out the flavor of both the salt and the dish, and it looks elegant as well. It's more effective than a similar amount of table salt, and has a great deal more depth of flavor. And since you need so little, it'll last much longer than the small container would make you think.

review/text: I bought this because I'm making Fleur de Sel Caramels and it arrived early and in perfect condition. It tastes so light and wonderful, the texture is fine and light as well. Unlike regular salt it's mild and I don't think I'll use regular salt again unless I absolutely have to lol. It's awesome I'm completely impressed.

review/summary: The Best fixin's for Chili!
review/text: I bought this when I lived in California.  You have to look in the taco seasoning aisle for a little brown paper bag, usually on the top shelf if they have it.  Here in Washington you can't find it.  When making chili, I add the meat and beans, and this kit does the rest, down to the Masa to make it thicker.  It contains cayenne pepper, I add the whole packet.  It is hot, but not hot enough to make run for a glass of water, it is perfect.  I know Carroll Shelby started this company and sold it after several years, but they kept the same stuff and it is great!

I would have been better off buying a different brand of pre-made ravioli that I can cook by boiling it in water.

review/text: I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

review/summary: Easy to make & tasty
review/text: This mildly spicy baby corn and spring onion soup is a pleasant change from bland canned soups.  The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The flavor of ginger is discernible.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I make it mostly as directed but substitute about 4 oz. of milk for some of the water and add a few leftover or frozen vegetables to the pot.<br /><br />Ingredients:  baby corn, edible starch, milk, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, spring onion, salt, onion, butter, sugar, ginger, garlic, cumin, and malic acid.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains milk and butter.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup.  Note that the nutrition information is for 5 servings per container, which would be a little over half a cup per serving which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 40<br />Calories from fat 10<br />Total fat 1g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol less than 0mg (!)<br />Sodium 850mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars less than 1g<br />Protein less than 1g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains over 4g of sodium.

review/text: Honestly, they do.  At least if they want to make my family super happy.  (Even my dog won't eat them.)<br /><br />But now for the POSITIVE.  These bags are 1 oz which means that they are perfect for kids and adults who have a problem with portion control.  In our house the rule is you get 1 bag... and that's it.  And the fact that there are 22 bags means that there's an assortment for lunchboxes, or for kids who can't agree on whether they like Doritos or chips better.<br /><br />As for price, the current offering is ridiculous and I'm going to ignore it and pretend that they don't really want to go to the storeroom to sell any.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy...A great snack option
review/text: If one of your New Year's resolutions is to snack more intelligently (without giving up the taste of a great snack), then Eden Organic's Dry Roasted Spicy Pumpkin Seeds are an option that's worth trying.<br /><br />I find their non-spicy pumpkin seeds to be a little bland, but these have just the right mix of cayenne pepper, garlic, and tamari soy sauce.  Relatively low in sodium, they are rich in protein and fiber, and pumpkin seeds are naturally high in nutrients such as manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, tryptophan, and zinc.<br /><br />Amazon's case price means I save almost $2.00 a bag over my local health food store, but the most important element to consider is that this is a great snack!

review/text: I like to snack on pumpkin seeds because they pack in a lot of nutrients, but I have never been a big fan of the taste. That doesn't matter a bit with these seeds. The spice is what you notice with these pumpkin seeds: the "hot" is pretty darn hot ... not to make you run for a glass of water, but hot enough that you'll want a long drink when you're done. The bags aren't huge, so 15 of them is not a forever supply. I go through 1 or 2 per week eating the "recommended" serving size pretty much daily. Good product. Good price. And organic to boot.

review/text: ... with an equal amount of plain toasted pumpkin seeds. I love the flavor of these, but eaten "straight up", they are too hot for me. My easy solution is to buy plain toasted pumpkin seeds at the local bulk store and mix them half & half with these spicy ones to dial the heat down a notch. It not only stretches the flavor, but it stretches my dollar. Pumpkin seeds are such a healthful snack and full of protein. I will continue to buy this brand because the seeds are a good quality and have never been stale.

review/text: These seeds pretty much taste like dirt with cayenne pepper and soy sauce.  Every handful you pop in your mouth has a few 'bad seeds' that make the decent ones taste bad too.  I bought a case of these and can't even make it through the 1st bag.  I was hoping for a taste similar to a davids pumpkin seed without all the shells and salt but add some spicy flavor. These are tiny little seeds that are mushy.  The spicy flavor gets very tired quickly, and the overall taste is not good.  I hate to write a bad review, but I wish I read one before buying.

review/text: Not to be a negative review, but adding some information I learned on this product that I feel should be on the product description for buyers. The information on the package states that the fries should not be given to small dogs. Well, we have a 10# Maltese small dog. Seller was very quick to respond to my question on this, saying that the product is like jerky and should be cut into smaller bits for small dogs. Well, I tried to cut it into smaller pieces, but it is tough stuff. Also, the product is from China. Not a surprise as lots of stuff from China. Other sweet potato fries at local store are from China also. And they say sweet potato jerky on package. I elected to ask Amazon for a refund and they were very prompt to issue a refund. I will go back to my local store and buy the treats I had purchased; the sweet potato fries were soft and moist and no problem for our small dog. These would probably work fine with a larger dog and be no problem for dog to eat.

review/summary: Not what I need, I don't think?
review/text: I got these for one particular cookie recipe. Previously, I was buying a package of Andes mints, and chopping all of them into little pieces. I realized later that my previous method would probably have cost less than having these baking chips mailed to my house. Far more convenient, but they are $4.50 a pack.

review/summary: Great organic cereal with no added junk! Guten free!
review/text: I love products with very few ingredients, and Barbara's Brown Rice Crisps contain: Organic whole grain brown rice, Organic fruit juice concentrate, and sea salt, that's all!  No preservatives, gluten free, Dairy free, Vegetarian, no artificial anything, and it tastes great!  The light sweetness of the organic fruit juice isn't quite enough for me, so I drizzle a tiny amount of agave nectar over it.  This cereal is yummy with soy milk or rice milk if you are staying away from dairy.  There seems to be a few overbaked "crips" in most boxes, but for a cereal that is minimally processed it really doesn't bother me.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think this cereal is way overpriced!  It is costly in stores and here on amazon.  I mean come on, we know what's in it, how could it cost so much!  I still highly recommend this product, if you want a healthy cereal with no bad stuff in it, and you have lots of money!

review/summary: The best rice cereal
review/text: I have been using Barbara's Brown Rice Crisps cereal for over 10 years.  It has simple and pure ingredients.  I have food allergies, so that is important to me.  This cereal makes a good breading substitute for baking if you are avoiding wheat and corn (like myself)- I use a rolling pin to crush the crispy cereal.

review/summary: Gluten-free, almost allergen-free, rice 'krispies'-type cereal
review/text: After reading the bad review, I had to add my 2 cents. There's only 2 rice 'krispies'-type cereals on the market that my kids can eat (well, 3 if you count the no-salt version by Erewhon) - Barbara's and Erewhon's. Erewhon's is slightly better because it's sweetened w/rice syrup instead of concentrated fruit juice (read on to see why). We, unfortunately, have severe food allergies. I can't even eat the Barbara's version - it's sweetened with some fruit juices that I'm allergic to. (Well, I can, but I'm not supposed to.) Anyway, for rice 'krispies' that my kids can eat without breaking out or getting stomach troubles, this is great. Price at the supermarket - not so great. Hence, I purchase from Amazon (yeah!). Great with rice milk, or, for milk-like consistency, try coconut milk - very healthy & milk-like. I'm pleased that it's only a little sweet. I don't want my kids all sugar-hyped, or, in my & my daughter's case, cane-sugar-allergic-reaction hyped! If you're used to a natural, non-sweetened diet (i.e. no sugar-coated cereals, sweetened chocolate products, or sweetened yogurt, super con'c juice, or sweet colas, etc.), then it tastes just fine. If you're on a high-sugar diet like the rest of America, yeah, it's not gonna taste sweet. Try adding liquid Stevia (the powder doesn't dissolve well in cold foods/drinks), because if you use sugar, you're gonna need SEVERAL more grams of sugar per serving to get it where you want it. [And try cutting back on that sugar, too!] Also, you'll note that it has no added vitamins or minerals - another plus if you're avoiding corn - several vitamin additives are derived from corn and can cause reactions in sensitive people. Truth be told, this is a processed breakfast cereal, so it's still not the healthiest thing to eat, especially everyday. But, when you're short on time, or the kids want a treat for breakfast, this is great. I can add fruit to it (freeze-dried or fresh) and the kids love it, and they'll at least get a serving or two of fruit with it, and some healthy fats if I use the coconut milk. And try the peanut butter rice 'krispy treat' recipe on the back - it's good. Use sunbutter (sunflower butter) if you're allergic to peanuts.

review/summary: easiest way to stop your dogs bad morning breath
review/text: i love my dog, but she often gets a bad case of "doggie breath". since i am not the type with the patience to grab a toothbrush and toothpast and brush her teeth after each meal, i was very happy to find breath busters. they are such a simple idea,a nice little bone-shaped crunchy treat that my dog loves.they are made with parsley and eucalyptus oil,both well know for getting rid of bad breath,and the crunchy-ness of them helps keep my dogs teeth clean.<br />  we have made it a ritual each morning to give her one as soon as she gets up(which works very well at getting rid of her morning breath),and she sits and begs for it,thinking that it is just a great tasting treat. we also give her one after each meal, or any time during the day that her breath starts to get a little rank.<br />  the package says that you can give a medium size dog up to three a day, and a large dog, such as our german shepard,up to five a day. but we have found that we hardly ever have to give her more than three a day.<br />  we have been using breath busters for over three years now, and have never had any problems with them. they do not upset her stomach, or give her diarrhea.<br /> so, if you would like your dog to have fresher breath, and want to do it the easy way, give breath busters a try.

review/summary: Pedigree Breathbuster Snack Food for Small Dogs
review/text: For some reason my wife (who does most of the shopping) told me it is becoming harder and harder to find Pedigree Breathbusters at our local grocery store et al. stores that sell pet foods. When she could find Breathbusters, the store only had about one or two bags. Our two dogs love these treats and turn their noses up at most other dog treats.<br /><br />Because we both do much shopping at Amazon, we decided to buy Pedigree Breathbusters through same. We bought two 8-pack boxes of the 17.6 ounce size. Both boxes arrived at my front door by the USPS in good order and within the time frame advertised. We have no complaints; Our dogs are satisfied, and we are too. We will reorder from Amazon again once our supply gets low.

To make a long story short; my dog is happy, I'm thrilled that I saved some money and I recieved a quality product.  I would use this vendor again.
