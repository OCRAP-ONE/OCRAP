review/summary: Great gluten free pasta
review/text: This pasta pleasantly surprised me how much better it is compared to rice pasta. It holds up the best to get an al dente texture to it and doesn't get the heaviness that some rice pasta's get. I ordered this on Amazon too because I found it was significantly cheaper than in the store. I've served this to friends who do not eat gluten-free and they didn't know the difference in the pasta with sauce on it.

review/summary: tasty gf pasta
review/text: We have tried a number of gf pastas and this is by far the tastiest- it can be a little tricky to cook- can stick together or get gluey- but has the best flavor of all the gf pastas we have tried and probably the best texture. Also it has a higher nutritional value than the pure corn or rice pastas as the quinoa adds a little protein. takes an alfredo sause really nicely.

review/summary: good pasta
review/text: the texture and taste is okay... but i still like trader joe's brown rice pasta best as it holds up in texture a lot more and tastes good. there's a very fine line between al dente and soggy in a lot of gf pasta. although this product did not get soggy, it seemed to stick together a lot more even with oil in the water. also looked more delicate than TJ pasta... this seemed to require more supervision/watching.

review/summary: Amazing pasta!
review/text: I originally read about the Ancient Harvest corn/quinoa pastas on a celiac forum.  They were absolutely correct - it is the closest to wheat pasta that you can get.  Much better flavor than rice pastas. My family willingly eats this brand of pasta, because they say it tastes so close to wheat that they don't care about a slight difference.

review/summary: Tasty and Al Dente
review/text: This is by far my favorite gluten free pasta. I love that it doesn't have any added soy. For people with Celiac Disease or food allergies, or who just want a tasty healthy hearty pasta, it is great to keep on hand for a quick meal. That said, in order to get good results, I have found that doing the following turns out a bowl of steaming, piping hot protein packed goodness:<br /><br />1) Use a large enough pot (for the whole box use a 4.5 quart dutch oven) so that the pasta has room to move<br />2) Drizzle a little oil before it starts to boil, this prevents sticking<br />3) Once it begins boiling, add a bit of salt to the water, then add the pasta, stir it immediately.<br />4) Set a timer, with GF foods you don't have as much latitude to walk away from cooking food and just eyeball it.<br />5) Keep Stirring, At six minutes pull out a string and bite it when it cools, I usually find it is not uniformly cooked to my liking at this point and cook it a minute longer.<br />6) When it is cooked to your preferred texture, pull it right away and drain it-DO NOT RINSE!<br />7) Mix it in with butter, olive oil, sauce, whatever and stir so that it does not congeal together. I would be careful if you put it back into a hot pot to do so, when you heat it too much is when it can turn mushy and gluey.<br />8) Fill your belly with the gluten free love, ahhh-a hug from the inside.<br /><br />This stuff is so great that even if I learned I could eat regular pasta again I would not go back. But-as one other reviewer posted you do have to be careful with portion size if you are watching your waistline-its so delicious you really could eat a whole box in one sitting if famished.

They are healthier for you than whole wheat pasta and definitely taste better, regardless of being gluten-free!

review/summary: Watch portion size
review/text: I'm a big guy trying to get smaller, so when my wife cooked me a box of this for my dinner, I was really happy because it had such a good taste and was healthy for me. The only problem was that I ate the whole box--nearly 800 calories!!! It was just one plate full too; the linguine is thin. And with added tofu and pasta sauce, I probably tipped 1000 calories on the meal. I had to spend 2 hours on the treadmill out of guilt; plus I had a lot of energy, and 2 hours working out seemed like nothing with these healthy complex carbs in my body. Great food, but watch how much you eat.

review/summary: best yet!
review/text: My husband is a celiac, while I am not.  I refuse to cook separate meals for just the two of us.  We've tried a variety of GF pastas...but Quinoa is the best by far.  It's consistency / color & flavor are as close to wheat pasta as we have found.  And with the push to go "whole grain"...it's been an easy switch.  Since I usually by this product by the case, I often will give friends a box to try for themselves.  I highly recommend this pasta line of products; you don't have to be a celiac to enjoy it!

review/text: The ad for this non returnable item is so misleading.  There is no mention of corn flour being the main ingredient.  I wanted a product made out of  quinoa, not corn.  The price was high enough that I assumed it was  quinoa-based.  Corn flour is the first ingredient and it is possible that there is very little quinoa in it as they don't even list the percentage.  This is very deceptive and I feel cheated.

I have tried a multitude of products, all of which she has rejected and refused.  This treat she will eat almost daily.  It may not be vitamin packed but it makes her chew.<br />It is hard to find in stores, which is a shame.  I would recommend this to others.  It is made in PA with all US sourced ingredients.  This is essential for me to feel safe to feed my precious Holly.

review/summary: Calories are the divine punishment for tastiness!
review/text: And Heaven knows that Caramello bars are absolutely divine!<br /><br />When you open a Caramello bar for the first time, you might think, "what's the big deal?"  It smells and looks like a normal-ish Hershey bar, which is as good as all Hershey bars, but why are these people so obsessed?  If it's a warm day, the bar will have cracked open, and you will already know -  but for the sake of this review, it's a normal day, the bar is in one piece, and you haven't discovered the incredible surprise that makes a Caramello the sinful and delicious treat that it is.<br /><br />Break the bar open and pull the two pieces apart.  There it is -- a ribbon of soft, delicious, tasty caramel, just waiting for you to pounce.  And you had better pounce quickly, because this stuff recognizes new/expensive/dry clean only clothing and  will pounce on you if it has to wait.  But the pounce and slurp are so worth it -- completely delicious, and when you take a bite of that chocolate shell, you know what's for lunch in Heaven.<br /><br />But there has always been a snake in the Garden of Eden, and the name of this snake is Calories.  Specifically, 540 calories for the 4 oz bar I'm reviewing.  200 of those calories are fat, which makes this food a true splurge.  You can't even fake that it's providing superior nutrition for all those calories, because the only good stuff in appreciable quantities is the 8% calcium the bar provides.  A single Viactiv chew Viactiv Soft Calcium Chews, 500+D+K, Milk Chocolate, 90-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) provides 500 mg of calcium, half of your daily requirement, at a measly 20 calories.<br /><br />On those days when you can afford a treat, or those other days when you must have a treat and the heck with the diet - this is one heck of a splurge.  It's incredibly delicious, chewy, slurpy and crunchy all in one treat, and you can lick your fingers afterward.  If you do it right, it's more than a snack, a Caramello bar is an experience.

review/summary: Kinder Chocolate
review/text: While visiting Europe in April 2012, I came across Kinder Chocolate and absolutely loved it.  I thought it was the richest, creamiest chocolate I'd ever tasted. On the box, it read "less cocoa and more milk," which was great for me since I don't care for dark chocolate.  Once I'd eaten all the candy I brought home from Europe, I searched the Internet to see if I could have more boxes sent to me.  I was able to find the product on Amazon, and was pleased with how quickly it was mailed to me.  I was afraid that it would not taste the same, but I was pleasantly surprised when it did.  Overall, I was very happy with my purchase, and look forward to placing my next order since it was also a hit with all of my friends and family.

review/text: I have to say that dairy products usually give me bad breakouts and irritate my skin. This product does not. I wonder if that has something to do with the crazy stuff that we do to our farm animals as opposed to wherever in the world these people get their dairy products from. However I cannot read the label so I'm not exactly sure what is in this. Overall I would choose this over any other chocolate that I can find in the United States, not sure why it just tastes better! It's worth going out of your way for. I used to find this in international districts in San Francisco and was happy to find it available here in Amazon because I can't find it anywhere near where I live now.

review/text: This is great stuff !  I once found a jar of this at Sam's Club. I used it and loved the flavor and accent it gave to steak. But I never found it again accept in the grinder style which I don't like because you the grinding mechanism always seems to fail halfway throuhg the jar and is wasted. I wanted the "shake on" bottle. This to me is less work than grinder as I can control the quantity much better. This stuff beats Montreal Steak seasoning hands-down (my opinion only of course)

review/summary: Creamy bread without commercial yeast, but read on for "sour"
review/text: If you follow the supplied directions, you'll get an active sourdough starter within days; however, keep in mind that not all sourdough is sour, so you'll have to take some extra steps to get the San Francisco tang.  I bought this culture to add to my existing sourdough starter (which IS sour) to make the flavor more complex but ended up instead keeping two separate starters, simply because this one is so good.  Newcomers to sourdough may be disappointed with the taste until they learn the proper techniques to achieve the type of bread flavor they want.<br /><br />To begin, "sourdough" refers not to the taste, but to the method, which uses wild yeast and bacteria to create a sponge to be used in place of commercial yeast.  This culture will do exactly that.  In three days, I had such an active starter that my bread rose quickly, even in a winter-temperature house.  The bread was creamy, with an excellent crumb, although, because the starter was brand new, it tasted like white bread with a little character, something I expected but which may surprise beginners.  This was my first test of the starter to make sure it worked properly.  And it did.  Perfectly.  If you are buying this starter as a natural leavening agent and not as a sour bread maker, then skip to the last two paragraphs of this review.<br /><br />Most people who consider buying this culture will want their bread to taste sour, as it does in San Francisco.  They are not looking for a yeast substitute.  If this describes you, read on.<br /><br />San Francisco sourdough bread, with its distinctive tang, requires certain steps to enhance yeast- and bacteria-based fermentation. Here are my tips for creating a more "sour" taste using this culture:  1. When keeping the starter at room temperature, feed it less frequently once it has become established.  The instructions suggest feeding once every 12 hours (two feedings a day), but I find that once every 24 hours creates a more sour tasting starter.  2. Leaving the starter in the refrigerator for a week, unfed, and then pulling it back out for one feeding, then a sponge feeding 24 hours later, improves the sourness.  3. The instructions tell you to throw out all but 1/4 cup between feedings or to use 1/4 cup from your refrigerated starter.  I keep/use at least one cup, sometimes two, and give it the same amount of "food" -- 1/2 cup water and slightly less than 1 cup flour.  Just make sure that the final sponge is rising correctly before you use it. Once you get to know your starter, you'll know how much food and time it needs to fully activate.  4. Allow the shaped loaves to rise in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24 hours to allow for more fermentation.  As the yeast and bacteria consume the available nutrients, the dough will get sticky from the alcohol by-products, so don't expect to handle it again.  5. If you are using a bread machine to knead the dough, use the French bread setting since that will lengthen the kneading/rising time, OR, if you are kneading by hand or mixer, complete two full risings.  6. Hot sourdough always tastes less sour than it will at room temperature.  Yes, it's difficult not to cut into the loaf right away, but try to let it cool to warm before serving.  If you always eat the bread hot out of the oven, without having leftovers, then you'll never taste the full tang.  7. If you only care about the tang and not about the rising power, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155832156X">The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook</a>.  Hensperger provides several recipes for starters and bread that are much cheaper than buying this culture.  The recipes use a combination of starter and commercial yeast, but they yield a nice sour bread.<br /><br />The key to sour bread is fermentation, so anything you can do to promote it will enhance the tang.  This includes stirring any hooch, or alcohol, back into the starter.<br /><br />Other tips for this culture:  never use chlorinated water and never store in a metal container.  I don't even use metal utensils, although this is probably overkill.  Supposedly, metal can both inhibit growth and discolor the starter.  Since sourdough starters improve over time, you can expect the flavor to improve with every passing week, provided that you care for it.  If you follow the instructions, you will have a thick starter, not as thick as a dough starter but not as liquid as a batter type.  Of course, you can make this into either type with different flour/water ratios.<br /><br />This starter arrives in dried, powdered form in a small packet.  It comes with can't-fail directions for reactivating and maintaining the starter.  You will need non-chlorinated water, unbleached flour, and a glass or plastic container that holds at least four cups.  (I use a glass Pyrex measuring cup so I can tell exactly how much starter I have.)  Plan on at least five days between first feeding and first loaf because you will need a highly active starter to properly leaven the bread.  You can revert to the 24-hour feedings once the starter rises substantially in the container.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I recently read that the lactobacillus part of the starter is what gives sourdough its tang.  The wild yeast gives the bread its rise and spring.  Lactobacilli thrive in colder temperatures (under 50 degrees F), so refrigeration may be essential to getting that sour taste, either during storage or rising. (Think of the average temperature of San Francisco!)  If you are using the starter for the first time or without storing it in the refrigerator, I highly recommend that you refrigerate the formed loaves overnight, then bring them up to room temperature for an hour or so before baking.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/summary: WOW,  Better Sour Dough Bread Than We Can Buy
review/text: This company really sends out a great sour dough starter and instructions.  I recommend you also buy the Sour Dough Starter Kit that comes with the wide mouth jar and recipe book.  We followed their instruction exactly and the bread turned out better than any Sour Dough that we can purchase from a store, really nice and chewy, and is incredible when toasted.  They show you how to make it extra sour by "feeding" it with more flour and water over time.  We used pure filtered water and King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour in our recipe, my wife and I really got excited about how great it tasted.  We let it rise 2 times, and did an extra rise overnight.  The dough was so bouncy that I am going to try and make pizza dough next.  I tried other sour dough companies on Amazon, but this one is the best.  As a native San Franciscan I appreciate great sour bread, and this is the greatest.  Just be sure to give it extra "feedings" in order to get that extra sour taste. Making this type of bread takes TLC, but the time you put into it will pay big dividends.  It is going to be fun trying their other starters, such as the Alaskan and Italian starters.  We are into Whole Foods and like to cook things ourselves so we know what is in the product.  The recipe we used had flour, starter, water, honey, milk, and salt, that's it hard to believe it made such wonderful bread.

review/summary: Real Sour Dough!
review/text: As promised, a very flavorful authentic bay area sourdough starter.  As with all sourdoughs, it is pretty slow rising and requires some fore planning if you want it for a specific meal, but well worth the effort.  We activated the culture then split it and froze a part of it, eventually we suspect that the local yeast and bacteria will contaminate this non native (to our area) culture and it will become diluted, so we'll be able to restart it and restore the flavor.

review/summary: Just Too Easy!
review/text: This sourdough starter is probably the best thing I've ever ordered on the internet.  I'm not a novice baker, but had thought that sourdough would be too long, too messy, and end up like my first sourdough loaf (when I made my own starter), hard as stone and sour as vinegar.  What a surprise!  I followed the very clear and well-written instructions and voila!  Two loaves of incredible bread.  We love it!  Now we don't buy bread at the grocery any more.  At $5.00 a loaf, for the healthy nutty kind, it's far below the quality of what I can now make in my own kitchen, and I know exactly what goes into it.<br />  I have discovered that the kind of flour does make a difference.  The first dozen or so loaves I made were a mix of King Arthur whole wheat and Gold Medal white.  Then I bought a bag of King Arthur unbleached white whole wheat flour and found that the dough did not behave or rise nearly as well as with all whole wheat or a mix with regular white flour. I can't find any of the more exotic flours in our town but plan to order some to experiment with.  My variation on the basic recipe was to add chopped nuts, raisins, cinnamon and sugar.  These ingredients did better when I kneaded them in, rather than add them during the sponge stage.<br />  Do try this starter.  It's really spunky stuff, and so much fun to work with!

review/summary: Another DOA
review/text: I followed the activation instructions precisely, even to the point of using a high-precision digital thermometer to insure the correct temps for the distilled water and the fermentation. After 24 hours of "fermentation" the flour had settled to the bottom of the container and a clear liquid had risen to the top. The reviews seem to indicate that this product is a hit-or-miss proposition...it either works fine or it's DOA. It's somewhat pricey to find out which one you'll get by having to buy it first.

review/summary: Worked great for me
review/text: After reading some of the reviews for San Francisco Sourdough Starter, I was concerned about receiving a dud. I'm happy to report that this starter worked well.<br /><br />The instruction sheet inside the box tells how to activate, and care for, our little yeast and bacteria friends. Both volumetric and gravimetric advice are included, along with three recipes. The sourdough pancake recipe is a great way to consume "waste" generated during the activation process.<br /><br />Regarding pancakes, I've always favored maple syrup, or brown sugar and butter. However, fruit syrups seem most agreeable with sourdough. A friend had given a bottle of homemade chokecherry syrup, and it was delicious paired with the sourdough pancakes. Give fruit-based toppings a try on sourdough pancakes, even if you ordinarily would not.<br /><br />As a novice, I found the activation process to be labor intensive. The instructions recommend feeding and changing the culture every 24 to 12 hours. My kitchen is normally too cool for optimal yeast activity. Even so, after three days, it became clear that the culture really needed to be fed and changed every 6 to 8 hours. This gets old, fast. And it is a scheduling problem if you have a job/life outside the kitchen. The activation protocol called to mind the kind of attention normally required for children or pets. For all the trouble, I began to feel as though I should name the culture, set an extra place at the dining table, and include photos in the family Christmas newsletter.<br /><br />Before starting your culture, choose fermentation vessels suitable for dishwasher use. I failed to do so, and found myself scrubbing doughy jars twice, or thrice, daily. Fortunately, this hassle only lasts a few days.<br /><br />Once the culture is teeming with life, it can be stored in the refrigerator and fed infrequently. The instructions suggest you may be able to feed it as little as once a week. This schedule is easier to manage than the activation schedule. Overall, I complied with the culture activation protocol very poorly, yet the culture survived and produced a good sour flavor. About the only thing I did right was consistently use warm, filtered water during feeding. Use a thermometer to verify that the water temperature complies with the instructions.<br /><br />Despite assurances and pro-active marketing from the local government, tap water here seems inimical even to humans. In practice, I know of no person who regularly drinks the water straight from the tap. And I wouldn't feed it to a culture and expect anything to survive. Think carefully about the sanitizers that may have been added to your tap water, and consider filtering, or purifying, the water before feeding it to your culture. My household water filtration system was offline for routine sanitation/maintenance. The culture and I, we survived on water filtered through one of the inexpensive pitcher types commonly available from supermarkets. This may be an option if you don't normally filter your water, but wish to err on the side of caution.<br /><br />The instructions advise that this live culture is not as productive as commercial active dry yeast strains. The rise time for this sourdough culture may be longer. The productive temperature range may be lower or narrower? I sometimes make lemon cinnamon rolls, and reckoned that sour lemon might be even better. I used only sourdough pre-ferment. Indeed, the cinnamon rolls did not rise as much, or as quickly, as with a proven recipe employing active dry yeast. Perhaps more pre-ferment would have solved the problem, or perhaps it will be necessary (in some recipes) to use a combination of pre-ferment and active dry yeast. If this proves necessary, I don't consider it a problem.<br /><br />The degree of sourness from this starter has been good. I'm happy with the product; and relieved that the culture survived my poor parenting!

review/summary: Works great!  Some things to consider:
review/text: Lovely starter, works well.  Mine started to become active by the second day, as it was fairly warm over the weekend.  Some have had some issues waiting for their starter to start, as well as make the soured flavor they are looking for from a product such as this.  I've been making artisan breads for many years now (with a recent accidental contamination of my SF starter, thus the purchase).<br /><br />First: let's look at getting the starter to work.  Your packet actually contains two important ingredients: the yeast culture, and the bacteria culture.  These two items are symbiotic when it comes to bread baking, and activate at different times.  FIRST, the bacteria will wake.  This will NOT cause the bubbling right away that many will expect to see.  The bacteria need time to culture the mix and lower the pH.  This can take anywhere from 2 to 6 days depending on a number of factors.  Once the pH is lowered, the yeast will start to go to work.  If you don't get activity right away, don't worry.<br /><br />WATER: should be de-chlorinated (don't use denatured, there are necessary minerals removed).  No filter at the house?  No worries.  Simply boil several cups of water (this will release the chlorine gas) and store for start-up usage (this won't be as much of a factor later unless your water is heavily chlorinated).  Water should be room temperature, not hot or cold.  Keep it around 70-85 degrees when you add it.  The warmer the water, the faster the bacteria work, unless it becomes too hot, in which case it will die.  The culture will prefer to be in the dark, and in a room temp environment.  I add 1/4 flour and 1/4 water at activation and every 12 hours after for two days or until I start to see vigorous bubbling, whichever comes first.  Once this happens, I reduce the sourdough to 1/4 cup, and add 1/4 each flour and water at 12 hour intervals (or more, if I need it for dough).  Keep working it and, should you have no activity after 7 days, contact the company for a replacement.  (Dead cultures do rarely occur, but more often it is a chlorine or temp/time issue).<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE ON FLAVOR: Using wild yeast is great, but don't we all look for that great sour taste to our bread?  What will affect this and give you that wonderful flavor is proper FERMENTATION.  Remember the above-mentioned bacteria?  It's the acid produced by the bacteria, and not the yeast, that gives that sour flavor.  This a sourdough bread should be made by adding fresh flour and water with a small portion of starter, and allowed to ferment overnight before completing the process (more kneading, shaping, rising, etc).  The longer between mixing and the final baking, the deeper the flavor.  Also, the greatest depth comes from using the smallest amount of starter needed (to keep the acids fresh and not broken down with age).  Starter should be 'fed' at room temp before using.  Finally, sourdough works much slower than commercial yeast, and will need more time to rise.  Once can, however, add some commercial yeast in the final, post-fermentation mixing, to speed up rise time (make sure you get a nice long ferment beforehand to maximize flavor).  This is know in the industry as 'spiking the dough'.<br /><br />Happy baking!

review/summary: Works Great, takes  time
review/text: Been using this starter for a year now, and it's become like an old friend. A few quirks, with a little personality, but a reliable producer of bread every week for my family. Once established, you can refrigerate it, and as long as I make bread once a week, I NEVER feed it. It gets "fed" when I mix up a sponge, and I take off a cup of the sponge, add a 1/2 cup of flour and cup of water and mix it up, and keep the fed starter in the fridge till next week. If you want more sour bread, keep the sponge cool, and let it double over 8-12 hours. Even more sourness will develop if you "proof" the loaves at room or lower temperature, doubling over 2-4 hours. Make sure you use high-gluten "bread" flour, if you don't you can add "vital wheat gluten" to the dough (try 4-6 tsp. per loaf) to make up for it. I make everything from regular white sourdough to rye to whole wheat with added flaxseed and oat bran or cracked wheat. When adding wheat flour, you definitely want to add extra gluten to get a nice springy loaf.

review/text: I received my sourdough starter a few months ago but circumstances kept me from starting the culture. I read the directions and went on the Cultures for Health website to watch the video on reactivating a sourdough starter before I began my venture. All of the directions indicated that it would take several days to start the culture for several reasons, house temperature being a big factor. My house is a cool 68 degrees. My starter was in a live active foamy state in three days. I baked three loaves of bread and there was sourness to the taste of the bread but is was a subtle tang without being overpowering. My husband thought the flavor was great although he would like a more sour flavor. I loved the taste because it wasn't too sour tasting. I am very satisfied with my starter culture and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in sourdough bread.

I used the same water that I use for my baby's milk which is filtered, boiled, and cooled to RT.  The room temperature stayed between 72-74F whole time.  I trust other reviewers here must have different results.  However, if someone like me cannot have positive result with this kit, who enjoy cooking very much and baking occasionally, I don't think this kit is for everyone out there who wants to try baking sourdough bread for the first time.  I know usual experts in many artisan skills tend to skip some minuscule steps that they take for granted in their instructions, which might be the reason.  Or, it may have been really DOA.  In either case, I can't recommend this to a beginner in baking.

review/summary: Works fast!
review/text: After ordering this starter about a month ago, I was able to get it very active within 3 days. The instructions are easy to follow. I devided my starter fairly quickly into 3 experiments. One part is in the fridge, I feed it weekly, works great. One part got left inside the oven with the light on for a consistent source of warmth, the other part sits on my counter. The temp in my house is between 65 and 70 degrees. The starter on the counter top is working the fastest, after I feed it it bubbles well within 3 hours. After forming my loaves it takes them 2-3 hours to proof or rise to the desired volume. The taste is great... So far I am only making white sourdough bread, in order to perfect my loaves. I also bake about every other day, because I want my starter to gain more character and sourness. I give a lot of loaves to friends, and they love them!<br />Before I bought this starter I had tried a different brand which I had bought in a grocery store. That one did not work out at all, it actually stank. So I am very happy this brand worked out so well!<br />A great many books have been written on sourdough. Yes, its science, but if you follow just a few basic rules this type of baking is cheap and easy. Don't hesitate to try this starter, I don't think you will have any regrets!

review/summary: Easy.  Good flavor.
review/text: The starter was very easy to revive.  I made a home for it in a 1.5 liter glass jar with a latching lid that I purchased at Home Goods for four bucks.<br /><br />My family loved the bread I baked using this starter, King Arthur unbleached all purpose flour and the simple sourdough recipe that was included with the starter.  This was my first sourdough bread baking experience and it was a good one.  My wife called the sourdough bread I baked "delicious" and actually ate it.

review/summary: No Sour Taste at All
review/text: Before trying this product, I tried making a native starter, just picking up whatever yeast was flying around in the air in Austin, Texas. That worked from a functional point of view, but had no sour flavor.<br /><br />In the process, I got myself a nice glass jar (formerly a Clausen pickle jar) punched holes in the lid. I made sure to use wooden utensils when mixing. I went to the baby aisle of the grocery store and got a bottle of distilled water to make sure there would be no chlorine present.<br /><br />Everything worked as described all over the place...very active starter...somewhat slow rising...pretty good bread texture...just no sour flavor.<br /><br />So I purchased this product.<br /><br />I followed the instructions carefully, feeding every 12 hours, using a glass container, stirring with wooden chopsticks and using distilled water.  It took three days to activate and another day or two to get very reliable...and at that point it was....indistinguishable from the local starter. No sour aroma or flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />In other words, a packet containing 1/2 tsp of ordinary flour would have worked equally well.

Or to keep as a backup .<br /><br /> This starter rose well for me. I have not had to use any other leavening agents with it and have omitted them when using this starter even for recipes that call for additional leavening agents. I simply just gave it a little more time to rise and it worked perfectly

review/summary: High maintenance but pleasantly surprised
review/text: I bought this starter-starter 16 months ago and forgot about it. I started the starter about eight months ago.  I followed the directions pretty faithfully.  It didn't seem really active and I never used it.  I've stored in in the refrigerator since then.  I try to feed it every two weeks but sometimes it stretches in to a month.  If it goes past two weeks, a lot of "hooch" collects on the top.  I just pour it off, throw away half of the mix and add 1/4 cup of flour, 2 oz. of filtered water, mix it up and let it stand covered overnight before returning it to  the refrigerator the next morning. It is obviously "active".<br />I actually started using it about four months ago, making Schlotzky buns; supplementing with a little yeast.  It works fine.<br />Then I used it in no-knead bread, again supplementing it with a little yeast. It made fine bread, but not sour, at all.<br />Finally, I went all in and made no-knead using the starter as the only leavening.  It made a wonderful loaf.  It is very  flavorful and truly "sour" tasting. It rivals the sourdoughs of SF and I lived there for 12 years.<br /><br />The recipe involves activating some starter over night, making the dough and letting it rise over night. Refrigerating it 1-3 days to autolyze, then making the loaf, letting it rise another 3 hours and finally bake.<br /><br />As you can see, this recipe requires really thinking ahead if you don't make it every day.<br /><br />For me, it wasn't a quick and easy path to authentic SF sourdough, but in the end it turned out to be just what I was hoping for.

review/summary: Slow Going...
review/text: I have been nurturing this starter for several weeks.  The second week I divided the activated culture into three separate containers, I used unbleached flour, whole wheat flour and a combo of unbleached and wheat.  The combo won the bubble contest.  I used some of the starter for making waffles and the flavor was unremarkable.  I had previously used a starter made with commercial yeast but wanted to try something new. I wish now I had not dumped it down the drain.  This starter is not at all sour but that could be because it is a new culture and because I have not used it for baking a slow-rise bread.  Time will tell.

review/text: I love authentic sourdough bread.  It's rare when I get the great stuff, since I live in the Midwest.  When I found this product I thought it might be the perfect substitute.  I've purchased this product twice now, and both times it failed to activate.  I've used homemade sourdough starters and other purchased starters all successfully, never had any fail on me.  This one wouldn't work for me at all.  I bought it a second time, thinking perhaps something ruined it in handling at some point or just in case I happened to do something wrong.  No luck either time.  Needless to say, I won't be trying it again.

review/summary: PROBLEMS WITH CARTON
review/text: I buy these in the store sometimes but always have to carefully check the carton top and bottom first because there is no protective bag for the candy inside. If the bottom flaps are not tightly aligned and sealed, small insects can get in. Likewise for the top sides which are lightly glued together and also cannot be resealed once the cartotn is opened. Also air easily gets in so it doesn't stay fresh as long as it should. The candy is much better protected by the small bag packaging it also comes in. Those bags should be used to protect the larger sized items as well, either within the carton or similar to what is done with large size bags of M&Ms. Or another alternative would be to use cartons like those used for milk and juice, which are sealed tightly on the bottom and the top is tightly closed. The candy itself is quite tasty but I must rate this only 3 stars because of the carton.

review/summary: Healthy treat for sensitive tummies
review/text: Lamb is great for sensitive stomachs and this one is no exception. I was a little hesitant because they list more ingredients than just lamb but the other ingredients seem to actually help digestion and I have been very pleased. About halfway through my 2nd 1 pound bag and will buy again. The pieces are not really "jerky" like in look, texture or smell. They are obviously ground and then pressed into small 2 inch x 1/2 inch size that breaks apart very easily by hand into training treat size. The texture is not greasy and the smell is not offensive at all.<br />My Great Dane likes these very much although not as much as the real meaty jerky like products (but more than the hard cookie like products). You get a lot in the 1 lb bag - many of the pieces have already broken apart into smaller pieces and crumbs but it didnt really bother me. Even having a Great Dane the small pieces are fine for treating and training and general "good boy" momments. At the end of the bag I just take the crumbs and dump them over one of his meals for a nice topper.

review/text: You know what they say about first impressions.  This basket was our initial  experience with Flying Noodle and what a great first impression it made!  The presentation is lovely - goodies arrived in a handsome wicker basket secured with a leather turn knob.  The basket is roomy, 12" by 14" and approximately five inches deep.  Obviously, we'll find many uses for it after we've enjoyed what's inside.<br /><br /> Speaking of its contents - our basket held three pastas - Tomato Serpentini, Tri-Color Rotini, and Napoli.  We found this to be a taste tempting collection, offering three quite different dishes.  While all of the pastas are delicious, the Tomato Serpentini is especially fine - robust, hearty, rich in flavor, reminding us of homemade pasta we enjoyed in Italy.<br /><br /> The sauces included were Original Pasta Sauce ( wonderful with or without the addition of mushrooms or meat) and Vodka Pink Peppercorn Sauce (also mighty tasty).  Plus, there was a jar of Garden Vegetable Presto-Presto.<br /><br /> We were more than happy with our introduction to Flying Noodle, and look forward to trying more of their products.<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Best PB Ever!
review/text: I became addicted to this stuff shortly after my first child was born.  Between nursing and not sleeping, I ate A LOT of peanut butter sandwiches in those months.  I have tried almost every 'natural' brand out there - I won't eat anything hydrogenated or containing HFCS.  Trader Joe's flax PB is pretty good. But then I discovered this stuff and have not switched back.  Perfect crunch and just the right amount of sweetness to make it yummy, but not what I would call sweet (and I don't like overly sweet things as a rule).  The only minor downer is that the jars from Amazon arrive with the PB separated a bit.  This is no big deal for Natural PB veterans, but it something that you don't find when you buy this in the store.  You have to assiduously stir it up or you'll get to the end of the jar with something closer to modeling clay.

I have always been partial to a peanut butter that is made of nothing but ground, roasted peanuts. And when this pack of Peanut Butter & Co. Crunch Time PB arrived, I was bummed to see that in addition to ground peanuts, it had cane juice, palm oil, and salt. But then I took a bite and WOW!! It was smooth with the right amount of crunchiness, just the right balance of sweet & salty, and super tasty. I was in PB heaven! These guys figured out a great recipe of natural ingredients to make the perfect peanut butter. In fact, I have some pure peanut PB left and it isn't as appealing.<br /><br />I make dark chocolate peanut butter cups and this PB will be delish in my homemade treats! I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Best PB Ever! And Some Info About Palm *Fruit* Oil...
review/text: Wow!!! I am so happy I found this peanut butter. I grew up on Skippy and Jif (mostly Skippy) and have been trying different "natural" and organic peanut butters for a few years now because of the hydrogenated oils, etc., in all of the standard commercial products. But nothing has ever come close to the flavor and texture that I like & remember...until PB & Co.! I love that this has just a touch of sweetness as well as salt--I know we supposedly need to limit sodium consumption (though I expect the "latest wisdom" on that to change at some point, just like it seems almost all other nutritional advice has over the years), but most foods need at least a bit of salt to enhance flavor, and I've really missed that in other brands. They just taste too darn bland. Anyway...this pb is absolutely PERFECT! It hits all the right notes of peanutty, sweet, and salty goodness, it's packed with chunks of crunchy nuts, and it's spreadable on fruit, celery, crackers, etc., without the sloppy goopiness and oily separation of most of the naturals/organics out there--another HUGE plus in my book. I would give this many, many more stars if I could! I have found the peanut butter I will buy for the rest of my life!<br /><br />BTW, PB & Co.'s Dark Chocolate Dreams is also to die for--I mostly eat that a spoonful of that as a simple dessert or use it in sauces/baking, etc. IF you haven't had it yet, try it--you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Also, after reading the comments in some other reviews about palm oil, I felt I had to include the following (which comes from [...], as well as the comments further below from PB & Co.'s web site, to set the record straight, as there is a lot of misunderstanding out there about palm *fruit* oil (vs. palm *kernel* oil, which is what is used in most commercial products). Similar info is available from several other reliable sources on the web.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  The only oil that contains significant levels of all four types of tocotrienols is palm fruit oil.<br /><br />  Although tocopherols are generally sufficient for meeting minimum vitamin E levels and maintaining an average level of good health, there is far<br />  more to be gained from getting the full range of both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Rice bran oil, wheat germ, barley, oats, coconut oil and palm<br />  kernel oil all contain one or more types of tocotrienols as well; however, none besides palm fruit oil contain all four types. Palm fruit oil is<br />  composed of 30 percent tocopherols and 70 percent tocotrienols.<br /><br />  Tocotrienols are roughly 50 times more potent than tocopherols when it comes to antioxidant power. Recent studies have shown that tocotrienols<br />  distribute themselves more evenly than tocopherols do in the fatty layers of cell membranes. They are effective at preventing and treating serious<br />  degenerative diseases like cancer, stroke-induced injuries, diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. In one study, tocotrienols increased<br />  the lifespan of laboratory rats by 20 percent. Aside from preventing and treating these serious illnesses, palm oil improves blood circulation and<br />  prevents clotting, boosts immunity, improves general nutrient absorption, supports healthy lung and liver function, strengthens bones and teeth,<br />  reinforces eye health and supports brain function. Studies have shown that virgin red palm oil is the variety that offers the most medicinal<br />  benefit, but all varieties seem to be beneficial.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />From PB & Co.'s web site:<br /><br />  - I see that "palm fruit oil" is listed as one of the ingredients in your flavored peanut butters. What is it and why do you use it?<br />  Palm fruit oil is a non-hydrogenated, healthy alternative for creating natural peanut butter with less oil separation. It has been used in<br />  culinary applications since the beginning of recorded history. It is grown in tropical regions and is widely used as a culinary oil in many<br />  countries.<br /><br />  - I always thought palm oil was bad for you -- is your peanut butter still healthy?<br />  Our palm fruit oil contains no trans fats. Trans fats have come under scrutiny by the FDA as a link to major diseases including heart disease<br />  and cancer.<br />  Palm Fruit Oil is often confused with Palm Kernel Oil. Palm kernel oil is derived from palm kernels and contains 82% saturated fat.<br />  Palm Fruit Oil comes from the fruit of the palm and has a nutritionally balanced profile of approximately 50% saturated and 50% unsaturated fat.<br />  When safely processed using traditional methods, palm oil promotes health by providing important lipid antioxidants and fatty acids. A high<br />  percentage of the saturated fats in palm oil are supple long-chain fats, excellent sources of energy. In contrast, hydrogenated fats result from<br />  converting supple long-chain fats into still "plastic-like" short-chain fats, producing desirable texture in foods but highly undesirable results<br />  from a health standpoint.<br /><br />  - I've been hearing a lot about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia to create palm plantations, and that the indigenous orangutan population<br />  is in danger. Where does your palm fruit oil come from?<br />  The palm fruit oil that is used in Peanut Butter & Co. products comes from Malaysia. Sustainability is a primary concern to our supplier,<br />  who is in fact one of the founding members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The RSPO is comprised of governments, palm growers,<br />  palm oil users, and non-governmental organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund. Its goal is the preservation of the natural environment in a<br />  sustainable way that also permits reasonable growth of palm oil plantations that support local populations. For more information about the RSPO<br />  please visit their website [...].<br />  Peanut Butter & Co. is also a member of Green Palm, which offers a certificate trading program designed to tackle environmental and social<br />  problems created by the production of palm oil. Under this program, we are able to reward palm oil producers by paying them for an equivalent<br />  amount of palm oil that they have produced sustainably and responsibly.

review/text: I have bought Peanut Butter & Co from Amazon, In bulk, twice now. I have only bought the Crunch Time. Haven't tried their other varieties yet. But I certainly will try some of the others. I like my peanut butter a little looser than this brand so I keep a bottle of peanut oil in the frig. I add about a teaspoon of oil and a sprinkle of salt to the jar when I open a new one. I have a large deep bowl in which to stir it. Then I spoon it back into the jar and enjoy.

review/summary: yummy, crunchy, fresh taste!
review/text: Another Amazonian recommended this brand to me, so I ordered it.  It is Really Good peanut butter, lots of crunchy peanut chunks, and not too much salt or sweetener. Also, no aerobic strenuous hand churning the oils/solids!  I also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045TLSA8">Jif Natural Crunchy Peanut Butter Spread, 18-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, but it is impossible to buy locally, and the price here on Ammy has shot up to a ridiculous level.<br /><br />My next venture into peanut butter exploration will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3E32">Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, The Heat is On, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>, which sounds amazing. Good company, excellent product.<br /><br />Oh, and I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3E3M">Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate Dreams, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>, which was smoooooth and yummy, too. Much much better than Nutella.<br /><br />So, if you like natural peanut taste and lots of crunchy bits, you'll probably like this brand.  Remember, peanut butter is one of the basic food groups, along with chocolate, BACON, and ice cream.  :D

review/summary: A must for crunchy peanut butter fans, and even good for those who aren't
review/text: We've been using Skippy Natural, but the price more than doubled so I looked to see if there was a more affordable option. I found this. My husband really likes the crunchy peanut butter, but I prefer mine to be creamy. He was out of his kind, so that's what I ordered. I've never heard of this brand before, but I liked that it didn't have the hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup and was all natural. It's even certified vegan (not that I am one, but it's the first peanut butter I've seen that had that boast).<br /><br />Being that it sounded so healthy, I was really afraid of what the flavor was going to be. So before I could expect to send it with my unsuspecting husband, I figured I better try it first. I wasn't looking forward to it, but I braved it anyway. It was good! I'd choose it over the Skippy Natural Crunchy anytime. It wasn't hard to spread, it wasn't all dried out and hard to swallow. It was creamy, despite all the peanuts in it, and the flavor was great. It's really good on celery and apples too. I'd definitely buy it again, and have no problem now switching out my husband's Skippy for this--I may even get into it occasionally!

review/text: I always thought Jif Creamy Peanut Butter was great but after trying the Crunch Time, I'm no longer a Jif fan.  I'm on my second six pack of Crunch Time.  It is the best PB I ever ate.  The strange thing is, I can't put my finger on exactly what makes it so much better than any other PB I've tried including Smucker's Natural and Smucker's Organic.  Give it a try!

review/text: We purchased both the smooth and crunch and while we all like the smooth and think its wonderful, crunchy is by far in my opinion the best.  There are lots of bite size peanuts mixed into the spread and it gives this peanut butter a very nice added touch to the already great smooth peanut butter mix.  PB & Co. have become the peanut butter of choice in my house.

I will never buy any of the national brands again.  And, yes, it is full of chunks of peanuts.  This stuff will make great peanut  butter cookies, PBJ sandwiches, on my morning toast for breakfast, etc.

It has tons of peanuts, which I love.  I have not found it to be a pasty mess at all as one reviewer noted.  It is relatively easy to spread & does not have to go in the fridge.  It is the only peanut butter I can eat that doesn't make me sleepy.  Go figure.  Plus, the price is great.  I will buy it again in this 6 pack!

review/summary: Peanut Butter Is One of The Food Groups, Right?
review/text: At the risk of sounding silly, a day without this product is like a day without sunshine.....it is THAT good!  I love to eat this peanut butter with apples, bananas, celery, and yes, also just by itself with a spoon!  I have a gluten intolerance, so I eat very few grain products anyway, but who cares - this stuff is the best on its own.  I do prefer the crunchy, as the texture lends itself to a snack more than the creamy.  The flavor is the best I've tried out of any brand out there.  Perfect combination of salt/sweet, and I LOVE the ingredient list!  As someone who reads every label and is very conscientious of the food that goes in my body, I couldn't ask for anything else from this company.  I would love to try the dark chocolate/peanut butter combination, but I'm afraid it will be my downfall!  As a 40 year old woman, I'm not willing to say adios to my girlish figure!

review/text: If I had one food left in the world, it would be peanut butter and this is some sort of concoction that is, to my mind, oops, no tongue, simply terrible.<br />I ordered the six jars hoping that it would taste something like Smuckers, which is the pinnacle of peanut butters but OMG, for those who love it, great, but whatever stuff they put in it, it tastes like flavored glue.  Like the old song, 'Searchin every day' for a better peanut butter than this....Amazon's Smucker's prices are beyond outrageous.
