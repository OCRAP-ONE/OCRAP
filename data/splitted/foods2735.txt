review/summary: Nips Sugar Fee Coffee Candy
review/text: These candies are the BEST!  I love buying them from Amazon.  Wal-Mart use to carry them, but you never knew if they were going to have them in stock.  Then I saw them on Amazon, and with the subscription service, they are cheaper than Wal-Mart, you get them delivered to your door, no shipping charges and you don't run out.  Great price, WONDERFUL Candy, delivered to your door, no extra cost to you...what else can you ask for.<br /><br />Great value!!!!

review/summary: You won't believe they're sugar-free!
review/text: Really delicious! Start out firm and become chewy (careful if you have loose bridge-work!)and are a great treat if you are trying to avoid sugar/carbs and like the taste of coffee candy. Remember that these are sweetened with "sugar-alcohol" which has a laxative effect if you really overdo it, but a few over the course of the day really satisfies the sweet tooth without all the carbs of regular candy. I think they're great!

review/summary: Great tasting candy
review/text: I love eating these candies.  The only reason that I am not giving them a 5th star is that they are very attached to the wrapper.  I can be a bit of a sticky business to get them from the bag onto the tongue, but the taste is worth it. And 10 calories per pop is not too much given their rich flavor and sweetness.

review/summary: Not Ordering Again
review/text: Although these candies are delicious, I am experiencing the same thing as some of the other reviewers. It's a melted, sticky clump of goo. I am having to throw away about half of the candy simply because it is all melted together.<br /><br />Of the candies that are as a single piece, they are melted. The wrapper is very difficult to get off of the candy as it is often melted into the candy. The thin plastic wrapper tears and sticks to the candy. Whenever I eat one of these, I go ahead and eat two simply because I'm going to have to wash my hands after removing the sticky candy from the sticky wrapper and putting the candy in my mouth.<br /><br />With the amount of product I've had to throw away, any savings I've earned by buying in bulk from Amazon has been lost. This is one product I will buy locally from now on where I can inspect each package of candies prior to purchase.<br /><br />It may be that the Amazon warehouse is too hot to store these or they are melting during transport. The candy appears to have a very low melting point so it might be wise to store any that haven't already melted in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Sorry Amazon.

review/summary: Too Sticky to Unwrap
review/text: I have been purchasing Sugar-free Nips for a very long time.  Often, one or two of the candies will have melted into the wrapper, making it very difficult to undo the wrapping.  However, this time almost ALL of the candies were in that condition.  I do not think I will be purchasing Nips for a while.

review/summary: Didn't work out for me as a work snack
review/text: It's not that these taste bad or anything; I think they taste as good as the regular Nips I used to get years ago. But I like to keep things in my desk to hold me through to lunch or dinner, and I'm trying to stay with things that are low in calories, won't promote cavities, and won't look unprofessional while I'm eating them. The problem with these are the packaging, the size, and the stickiness. You have to untwist and peel the wrapper off a very sticky piece of candy, which means you have to wash your hands afterward. Being fairly large and chewy, they're hard to have in your mouth without it being noticeable.<br /><br />A better choice for me has turned out to be: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AVV0O">Werther's Caramel Coffee Sugar Free Hard Candies, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> They are small, hard, smooth, easy to unwrap and have a nice coffee flavor. When I run out of my current supply of sugar free hard candies (I stocked up on Cremesavers when I heard they were discontinued), I'll be signing up for the Werther's on Subscribe and Save. Sorry, Nips.

review/summary: tasty treat....but not Carb Free....
review/text: I think this is a wonderfully tasty treat, but it's not carb free.<br /><br />These sugar free products are often made with sugar alcohols (hydrongenized form of sugar) and they still have carbs, so if diabetic (as I am), remember to count at least half the carbs noted on package into your calculations.  Some diets say that you don't have to count sugar alcohols.....but if you are diabetic, you do need to count them as they do contribute to blood sugar rise.  It got 4 stars because I feel a little decieved when says sugar free, one expects to be carb free too.  Very tasty though

review/text: I had been drinking a Supermarket brand of orange juice (with all the pulp) in a carton every morning for the obvious benefits.  But this product is organic and comes in glass bottles.  The differences in taste and quality are dramatic.  Disabled and not anxious to drive more than I have to, this is a Godsend.  Delivered right to my door and put in my lap in my power chair.  Can't ask for more than that!  The extreme convenience and difference in quality is well worth the difference in price.

It is easy to put a scoop of powder with milk, soy milk, rice milk (Rice Dream) or juice and blend it into a nutritious shake. Lately I blend a scoop into fresh fruit and orange juice.<br /><br />Frankly, if I had to choose between a milk shake and a Soy Protein shake, I'd choose GeniSoy. Not only because I have seen the great results of taking soy powder, but also because I just feel healthier and this product is not overly sweet.

I decided to buy this product because I loved the taste so much.  I use 3 scoops as per the directions on the canister along with 8oz of vanilla soy milk and 8oz of ice.  The added texture of the ice gives it a more shake like consistency.  I do not get hungry in between meals when I have this for breakfast; it is a great weight-loss/weight maintenance product.

review/text: FYI: The "Natural flavors" claimed on the container appear to be "dust" and "all-purpose flour," and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never "mix" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk.

I, my husband and some friends really enjoyed the pretzels we found at a store that no longer carries them so I went the Beigel cite but could not purchase through the cite. I tried to make contact with the co. but no one ever responded.  So I came to Amazon and received the case quickly.  What a diappointment, they're very stale with no freshness date to be found.  I want to know how to get a refund OR fresh pretzels.  We really do like the fresh product and don't mind paying for good food. Is this possible, to get fresh pretzels?

I also have a younger sister, so I'm very particular on which snacks I purchase. I will be buying this again :)

review/summary: The best white mocha hot chocolate
review/text: This has to be the best white mocha out there.  I use more than what's recommended because I like my chocolate sweeter and creamier.  If you use the recommended amount it tends to be a bit on the weak side.

review/summary: mmm soo good!!!
review/text: I literally just got the product and had to write this review. I recently discovered the starbucks white mocha, and more recently the peppermint white mocha. I did a little research and found this product. I wasn't sure if it'd be quite the same, but $5 for one cup of coffee was getting a little ridiculous. I'm about half way done of my first drink and i am sooo happy!!! I mixed one of those instant coffee packets from starbucks with SKIM milk and three tablespoons of this mix and shook it all together. I was soo surprised at how great it tastes!! It's creamy just like the white mocha, but using fat free milk! I'm sure any instant coffee will do, i tend to drink iced drinks so i didnt heat the milk up and it mixed really well. My next step will be to buy peppermint extract so i can perfect the starbucks peppermint white mocha. If you're a starbucks lover like i am, i highly HIGHLY recommend this. And of course if you didnt want a coffee drink, you can make it as the hot chocolate! Def. recommend!!!!!!

review/summary: Good taste
review/text: originally, i was looking for a "true" white hot chocolate. I'm pregnant, so i'm craving different things all the time. This actually came in yesterday evening and I couldn't wait to try it. I put a little in my coffee this morning, to see if i could replicate a starbucks-ish drink...I had seen where others had said something about the taste being similar...and let me tell you what....it is AWESOME! the only thing i did not care for was the small packaging...i thought i was getting a bigger product, but that in fact is my fault because i did not pay attention to the ounces in the description. anywho, I would recommend this item to anyone...it's a great product and a great economical solution to a $5-$7 cup of coffee from starbucks.

review/text: I got this for my sister-in-law for Christmas in 2011 because she said that she had tried some white chocolate cocoas and really liked one type but couldn't find it any longer. I know Ghirardelli is a good brand for chocolate as it's the type I always get when I make chocolate chip cookies, so I went out on a limb and bought this. I've since been told that it was awesome and she loved it. X3<br /><br />So, even though I've never had it, I recommend it on behalf of my sister-in-law.

review/text: This is honey that any beekeeper would prize. Its rich, deep, complex layering of taste and unique to Tasmania wild flower(Eucryphia Lucida)aroma make this the perfect honey for that big flaky butter croissant or thick slice of brioche toast - even just a crusty roll and butter works well with it. It has the serious flavor that many honey's lack today and will hold its own with any import from Greece or France. On thick Greek Yogurt its a unique treat. I thought it was a great buy compared to those 8 Oz jars of specialty honeys selling for much more than the price of this 500 gram (1.25 lbs) jar. Definitley an "in the know" product at a bargain price.

They were quite good with good flavor. Now I have tried the Peppermint Tea, which is caffeine free.  In fact, the ingredients consist of only peppermint leaves.<br /><br />Each tea bag comes in an individual packet, which preserves its freshness.  The tea brews quickly into a nice dark color.  The tea has a pleasant peppermint aroma. The taste is clear strong peppermint.  This tea is as good as other peppermint teas that I have tried.  It will go well for occasions when caffeine is not desired, in the evening, for instance. I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Refreshing Summer Tea - Think Iced!
review/text: Higgins & Burke Peppermint tea is all pure, premium peppermint leaves and is caffeine free. Brewed just as you would any other tea bag tea, its refreshingly cool flavor is ideal for iced tea on a hot summer afternoon. Because peppermint leaves are naturally sweet, much less sugar will be required to make a pitcher of southern-style "sweet tea". Each box contains 20 tea bags; you'll only need 3-4 tea bags per pitcher of iced tea. I like to add a squeeze of fresh lemon to mine. You'll love it hot as well with a splash of milk.<br /><br />Peppermint is a well-known upset stomach soother and natural antispasmodic, so if you suffer from acid reflux or chronic heartburn, this tea is for you! Brewed and diluted, it can also be used as a suburn soothing body spray or added to a tepid bath to ease pain. Cool the spent tea bags and place over closed eyes to reduce puffiness or irritation from summertime allergies.

For those reasons, it also makes terrific iced tea.<br /><br />I like my mint tea to taste like mint leaves---not toothpaste. This one definitely hits the spot, and I will certainly buy it again.

review/summary: Nice smooth all-peppermint tea
review/text: A pleasingly smooth all-peppermint tea, it steeps to a nice, tannic-looking color.<br /><br />A single bag steeped for 5+ minutes works fine for my large 16oz mugs, and leaving the bag longer doesn't hurt the flavor.  It's drinkable cold, but better hot.  Steeping time is usually based on a smaller 6-10oz mug, so the low end of the 3-5 minute recommendation would likely be too weak for me.<br /><br />It's rare that I'm in the mood for a non-caffeinated tea-- I usually want the health benefits, or the caffeine, or the flavor of "real" tea (usually green, sometimes black or white).  But for those times (particularly in cold winter months when I want hot bevs all the time) or for my more caffeine-sensitive guests, I like to keep mint herbal tea.  The smooth but distinct peppermint flavor of this tea makes it a good choice.

review/summary: It's really hard to screw up peppermint...
review/text: First off, let me say that I am a very experienced tea drinker.  I make my own tea blends out of loose leaf teas/herbs and because of this I don't often buy boxed teas anymore.  When I saw this available in Vine though, I figured, why not get some?  You can never really have too much tea!  Plus, plain peppermint is so basic there's no way it could be bad - I mean, it's really hard to screw up peppermint, right?<br /><br />Well...  Yes and no.  This peppermint tea is okay, I suppose, but I've had better.  That's weird, as I honestly don't know how you can screw up peppermint.  The menthol bite is still there (a little), but it just has a blandness to it, and also a bit of an odd aftertaste, almost like it's blended with black tea (even though it isn't according to the ingredients).  Maybe the tea is a bit old, and that's what's causing it.  I don't know, maybe I've been spoiled by the awesomeness of loose leaf tea.  All that being said, this tea is still okay, and if I didn't buy loose leaf tea, I'd be fine with it.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this tea?  Well, yes, it's fine.  If you aren't the sort who already has a ton of loose leaf tea on hand and just wants some easy individually bagged tea to make a quick cup, I'd say this is a fine enough peppermint tea.  If you do want to make your own loose leaf tea blends, I'd recommend picking up some peppermint AND spearmint, as I feel like they are both tastier blended together in tea.  If not, then this is a good enough choice for peppermint tea!

This product is very finely balanced to not leave any aftertaste and although I initially though it was a little weak, I've warmed to its more delicate flavor. The tea bags are individually wrapped and like most other herbal teas you can use the bags twice without any noticeable weakening of the drink. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other flavors.

This is really nice tea, and for those of us who try to limit our coffee consumption, Higgins and Burke Peppermint makes a good substitute, because somehow the peppermint taste and aroma makes it stimulating, despite it being caffeine-free and relaxing.<br /><br />The 20 teabags are individually wrapped bags in a box with a tear-out window at the bottom, in order to extract one bag at a time. The bags are filled with "premium peppermint leaves" from Oregon, "regarded as the best in the world." Get out you bone china tea cups, and enjoy.

review/summary: Better Than Celestial Seasonings By A Mile!
review/text: I have been a Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea drinker for years, and I was curious to see how the offering from Higgins & Burke would compare.  Cutting to the chase, I've been drinking the wrong tea all these years.  I make my tea in a large cup using two bags, and the Higgins & Burke has a crisper and cleaner taste than the Celestial Seasonings.  I expect that part of this has to do with how the two are packaged.  The Higgins & Burke are individually wrapped where the Celestial Seasonings have all 20 tea bags in a, well, common fold down bag.  This lets in unnecessary air for tea bags 2 through 20.  I think this is great, and I like to wind down in the evenings with peppermint tea.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes peppermint tea.

review/summary: Wonderful Tea
review/text: I love tea, and this peppermint tea is no exception.  It has a wonderful peppermint flavor.  Not only do I drink tea as is, I also use it in certain recipes.  I can always find a way to use this tea.  It is caffiene-free.<br /><br />I'm sure there are different ways to do it, but I "brew" mine in the freezer.  I put a tea bag in a bottle of water, and put it in the freezer for a quick chill.  There are certain foods that, for me, require tea rather than any other beverage.<br /><br />Wonderful pepperment tea.  Highly recommended if you love tea and peppermint.

review/text: Not a fan of Herbal Tea but after sipping this I might change my mind!<br /><br />This is nice stuff. The strong peppermint taste complements the strong but not unpleasant menthol smell.  I prefer caffeine in my tea but when I don't want a buzz this will serve very well.<br /><br />I'm impressed.  Give it a shot.<br /><br />------------ Later --------<br /><br />With all that menthol, it's good if you have a cold and are congested.  Like drinking a cough drop.

review/summary: Very good tea
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, but not mint very often.  Mint tea is thought to be relaxing and calming, and I did find this to be such.  I generally think of all mint teas to be the same, since they usually contain only one ingredient, mint of some sort, although of varying "dustiness".<br /><br />This Higgins & Burke peppermint tea exceeded my expectations.  It has great flavor and is very minty/mentholy (invigorating and refreshing, as well as soothing).  This reflects on the high quality peppermint used.  The individual teabag packaging also keeps the product fresh, so it will taste great even if it has been in the cupboard awhile.  I did need to be careful not to overbrew it.  While this peppermint tea will not replace my daily tea selection, it is a nice change.

review/text: These tea bags are the perfect blend of mint to provide a refreshing drink either hot or cold.  In summer we drink a lot of cold tea but in winter I love to sit down with a steaming cup of tea and mint is my favorite flavor.  When I have a cold, it is a great "feel good" drink, as the peppermint helps to clear the sinuses.<br /><br />The packaging here is a good combination.  Each bag is individually wrapped to retain freshness.  The box allows you to cut out a small panel and then sit it in the cupboard and dispenses a bag at a time through the open panel.

review/summary: Five Stars for Being 100% Peppermint Tea
review/text: I received this tea free for review from the Amazon Vine program.  I have a large collection of various teas and herbal teas at home as well as a large collection of herbal home remedy books.  One thing that bugs me about many other teas is that they are often blends of many different ingredients of unknown proportions.  So if a herbal remedy for indigestion calls for peppermint tea, with some other brands of tea you never know exactly how much peppermint you are really getting.  I liked the fact that this tea has a single ingredient listed - premium peppermint leaves.<br /><br />The tea itself has a pleasant minty aroma and tastes like peppermint tea is supposed to taste.  It has a bit of a minty zing compared to some of the other teas I have had in the past - perhaps because it has more actual peppermint than some of my other teas.  The bags are individually sealed.  The only downside I found for this tea is that I could not find an expiration date on the package or the bag casings. If you are only an occasional herbal tea drinker, you might want to mark the box with the date you bought it so you have an idea of when its shelf life is nearing the end.

review/text: This is a very nice tea. The tea bag smells nice when you take it out of the packet. It makes an unusually dark broth for a mint tea, so that you may almost feel it has caffeine, which it doesn't. The taste is deep and rich. It is a relaxing drink, and I also found that it helped settle my stomach after a large dinner. This definitely is a tea I would drink regularly.

review/text: The Higgins & Burke Herbal Tea has a lovely peppermint flavor that isn't too tangy. I love honey and milk with my tea, which didn't seem to go well with the peppermint in my humble opinion. However, without the honey it was just the right taste. The no-caffeine is a plus so you can drink it in the evening. I don't like having an anxious, jittery feeling before bedtime that I often get with caffeine. I also like the packaging. We have a lot of moisture in our area so packaging is very important, even if an item will only be on the shelf for a short time.

I enjoy drinking hot tea and try to make an effort to drink more of it.  This tea is very nice way to end a long day.  The peppermint flavor is very bold but smooth.  I only add a little bit of honey to this tea and I am good to go.<br /><br />I will stress again, that if you are not a fan of peppermint do not purchase this item.  Since the peppermint flavor is so bold.  Despite the fact that I like this item, it is not a tea I would drink everyday.  As for tea connoisseurs, I believe that they should give this tea a taste.

review/text: I had been making my own peppermint tea from the chocolate peppermint in my herb garden, but it was too sharp-flavored for my tastes. I wanted to benefit from peppermint's property of calming the gastrointestinal system (less bloating and gas). So I tried this Higgins & Burke peppermint through Amazon Vine. Pros: rich, mellow flavor with no sharpness, very well-packaged to prevent deterioration, no residue in cup after brewing. Cons: some may find the flavor a touch bland because of the lack of sharpness. The tea is "made with pure premium Oregon peppermint, regarded as the best in the world." I think they're right about that. Great as a bedtime beverage because it is soothing and has (naturally) no caffeine.

When I run out I will buy it because I like it so much much better than Celestial Seasoning's Mint.

I was afraid there would be too sharp of a peppermint bite to this tea, but it is not sharp at all. It has all the cooling and soothing properties of peppermint but such a clean, fresh, smooth taste that I did a double check to see if there was spearmint in it - there isn't. This tea is pure peppermint leaves. There is no afterbite or lingering taste, just the sensation of a cool, clean palate. I drink it both hot and cold with sweetner. What a treat! This is my new favorite tea.

review/summary: Delicious tea, full, but refined taste-good cold or hot
review/text: I really enjoy peppermint tea. It is often hard to find quality tea bags with this flavor. A lot of times the tea leaves are in such small particles that they somehow leak into the tea water itself, making the tea gritty. With this brand however, this doesn't seem to be the case. When opening the wrapper of the tea bag an amazing smell immediately emanates, a smell that does not dissipate once the tea is brewed. The ingredients listed are : premium peppermint leaves, and it is very apparent when you taste it. We've had other brands, and this tea seems more rich, refined and smooth, without being overpowering. We've enjoyed it hot and cold in a pitcher, and both choices were delicious. The container also doubles as a dispenser-you can turn the box vertically and tear off a little area on the bottom, so you don't have bags sliding around in other containers. Excellent, excellent tea-can't wait to enjoy again. We will be looking for 'Higgins and Burke' in stores, without a doubt.

The ingredients are simple -- only peppermint, and no caffeine to keep me up at night.

review/text: I like to have peppermint tea around for those times when my stomach is giving me trouble. I find this tea to be excellent in both quality and taste.<br /><br />The tea is very simple: 100% peppermint leaves. The box says to brew for 3-5 minutes, and it did achieve a good flavor at that point. However, one measure I have of the quality of a tea is if I can leave the tea bag in while I drink, and have the tea remain tasty. This tea tastes great and does not turn bitter at all, even at the bottom with that bag in place the whole time. The bags are individually sealed, which is good for preserving the flavor. For those interested, the tea is blended and packaged in Canada, and the box is 100% recycled.<br /><br />Summary: A great choice for pure peppermint flavor. Highly recommended.

I have tried increasing my steeping time and all I get is more of the blandish flavor, that strong mint kick I like from my peppermint teas never comes out.<br /><br />Now I realize that this may just be a problem for me and I like unusually strong tea, but I don't think so.  Most teas I get at cafes and what not are strong enough for me, but like I said this tea just doesn't do it for me.  It is also possible that like others I may have gotten a batch a weak leaves?  Who knows?<br /><br />Overall the teas is plenty drinkable and I will probably finish the box, but I don't think I will be buying getting this brand again.  If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer.

review/summary: Higgins & Burke Peppermint Tea
review/text: I very much enjoy drinking peppermint tea, I have two or three cups every evening. Of all the peppermint teas out there, I much prefer the ones that are nothing but peppermint leaves, with nothing else mixed in. Higgins & Burke is one of those teas that use only peppermint leaves. My normal brand is different from Higgins & Burke, as I figured all teas made with nothing but peppermint leaves would pretty much be the same. To an extent that is true, but only if you kill your tea with sweeteners or other things that alter the flavor of the tea. Drinking the tea plain, there is a subtle, yet noteworthy difference in favor of the Higgens & Burke tea. Something about it feels just a little fresher, a little smoother, a little more fullness in the flavor. I was pleasantly surprised by this, since I was expecting no difference at all when compared to my usual brand. I'm making the switch to Higgens & Burke.

review/summary: good tea, a little weak though
review/text: I like this tea and like mint teas but this one really needs to be a little stronger. It is better with 2 tea bags but then that makes the cost even higher. I like herbal and natural teas, this is good if you like your tea a little weak, it really is a good product just expect to use more than one bag if you want a stronger taste.

review/summary: Fine, but not quite as tasty as Stash
review/text: I drink peppermint tea pretty regularly, and rely on the Stash (available in 100-count boxes here on Amazon for 5 cents a bag cheaper). This tea was quite good, though not quite as sharp as the Stash tea. If you like it more plain, this may be your best bet, but otherwise, I'm planning to just stick with the Stash.

review/summary: Excellent, hot or iced
review/text: There is some variation between peppermint teas. My wife is more of the peppermint tea lover than I am, and there was even one occasion where she tossed a box in the garbage after trying a single bag. (Fortunately, tea isn't all that expensive!)<br /><br />We both tried the HIGGINS & BURKE HERBAL PEPPERMINT tea and were pleasantly surprised by its clean, "mintiness." I poured mine over a tall glass of ice, and it did not get all watered down as a result.<br /><br />I don't know that it'll convert me into a huge peppermint tea fan (my wife will be more than happy to finish the box!), but this is really good stuff!<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin

review/summary: I'm a coffee drinker - and I really like this peppermint tea.
review/text: My hot beverage of choice will always be coffee, but Higgens & Burke Peppermint Herbal Tea has satisfied that hot beverage urge as well when coffee is not available. The peppermint flavor is surprisingly good. Its minty/menthol effect is clean and soothing.<br /><br />I enjoy the different ways I can enjoy my H&B peppermint tea, depending on my mood. I've enjoyed my tea lightly sweetened with either Splenda or honey, some times with or without cream, alone or with toast (whoa, so good with toast!). I've not been disappointed by this tea yet.<br /><br />I'm not a tea connoisseur, but I do like this tea a lot. I appreciate that it is made with 100% "premium" peppermint leaves and that it is caffeine-free.  As I read the benefits of drinking peppermint tea has, I do believe I will stick to Higgins & Burke's peppermint tea on a regular basis.

review/summary: This brand is a new Favorite!
review/text: I don't drink a lot of herbal tea except for "peppermint flavor", as I have a sensitive stomach an peppermint tea has always seemed to sooth my upset stomach. The problem is that although I've tried different brands, I've found that some are just too strong, leaving me with heartburn in addition to a not so perfect tummy.<br /><br />This brand (HIGGINS AND BURKE) seems to be the perfect choice for me:<br /><br />1) not as strong as some other peppermint teas<br />2) extremely pleasant taste<br />3) no heartburn or belching after effect<br /><br />Would definitely recomment this one.

review/summary: mmmmmmminty.....
review/text: I have tried the Higgins & Burke brand of green tea and earl gray and have enjoyed both, so was anxious to try the peppermint tea.  Again, high quality, well structured tea.  Delicious peppermint flavor, strong on the mint and delicious both with sugar and without.  I've found with the three teas I have tried that the quality is uniformly excellent no matter what type of tea I was trying and I would definitely buy all of the flavors that I have tried so far.  I would say the peppermint is probably my favorite so far as it would be refreshing as both hot tea and ice tea as well.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and a good quality tea.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: This is probably the best tea I've ever had.  I was so pleasantly surprised at the peppermint taste.  Most peppermint teas just taste like mint.  This one is a definite peppermint taste.  Quite a difference.<br /><br />I like a little stronger tea and this was exactly that.  I put one tea bag in a cup of water in the microwave for two minutes.  Then let it rest for three minutes.  I like mine sweetened.  So, I added stevia as a sweetener.  It was perfect!  The best I've ever had.  I could even re-use the tea bag for a second cup.  It wasn't quite as strong but was still very good.<br /><br />Definitely on my list to buy.  Excellent!  I think I'll go have some now!!
