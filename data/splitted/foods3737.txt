review/text: It's goes on really easy, and only requires a thin layer so it will last a while. Stings at first, but then feels great and your skin will glow. And as the previous reviewer said, it smells great!

review/summary: quality product
review/text: This product is amazing. It works great, smells great, is all organic and is about 4x cheaper than any other enzyme peel on the market (because it is half the price and twice the size). You can also get it almost anywhere. It made a huge difference on my skin and I would recommend it to anyone who has acne or a dull, bumpy complexion. The one down side is that it stings quite a bit, but it's supposed to do that. And afterward it feels great.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I'm really happy I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing. At first I didn't think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way. My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it. I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face. It's not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer. It even helped diminish my pimples.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.  It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn't cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I've never been disappointed.  If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.

review/summary: Mild but effective!
review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/text: When I bought this I was really going out on a limb. I like to read reviews for all skin care product before purchasing. This cleanser has a surprisingly cooling effect on the skin. Reminds me of a mixture between Noxzema's foaming face wash that was discontinued and the Clean & Clear Morning Burst (which dries my face out beyond belief). I love the smell, and it cleans my Mac foundation off way better than Cetaphil. Great product!

review/summary: Fantastic exfoliator
review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

review/summary: Love the smell, how it feels, skin looks refreshed after!
review/text: I am usually critical of skin care product that doesn't come from a dermatologist's office.  Mainly because those products and brands can have more active ingredients than store product getting better results.  This stuff is so great! I love the smell, it feels really cool and refreshing on my skin (almost like aloe), and my skin really does look shinier and refreshed after I use it.  Also, it only has to stay on for 5 minutes so it's something I can do more often than masks that require 20-30 minutes.

review/text: Love this facial cleanser.  My skin tends to be oily and flaky.  I'm no longer shiny, and I've had no break outs at all since I started using it.  It takes off all my makeup without leaving my skin feeling tight and dry.  Even my skin tone is more even.  My face hasn't looked this good since my pre-teen days.  Love it.  I'm never using anything else again.

review/summary: Overpowering Smell
review/text: This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent.

review/summary: Amazing product for what you pay for it.....
review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

review/text: SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a 'slippery' greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!

review/summary: Burns Sensitive Skin
review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for something more natural for my sensitive skin.  Says its "gentle for all skin types" but it's not.  Literally 2 seconds after I put the first dab on my face it started burning. I could see my skin turning red and getting a rash under it.  I had to wash it off immediately.  The spot that had it does feel softer than the rest of my face, but the burning and rash is SO not worth it.  My second complaint is that it's a gel mask versus a clay mask.  I should have read the ingredients better for that one though.

review/summary: My best beauty secret!
review/text: I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician's Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven't tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day & apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn't too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people's needs, opinions, & skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, & isn't full of harsh chemicals, fillers, & other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.

review/summary: Effective skin tightening face mask
review/text: I've been using this face mask for years. It is much cheaper buying it online than at your local drugstore. I use it about twice a week on my entire face, but almost daily just under my eyes. I apply it there when I wake up, pre-shower. It does a nice job of tightening the baggy skin under my eyes. It's not surgery so the effect doesn't last forever but it does help. I've had no adverse reactions from using Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme facial mask.

review/summary: Oily dilemma...
review/text: I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: Long lasting lip balm
review/text: I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.<br />Seriously, in my pockets always are my wallet, keys and lip balm.  I've worked outdoors for years and depend upon it's protection from the elements.  Blistex is fine, but I wanted something more organic, Burts Bees is great, but I don't like their tube as much 'cause sometimes I keep this in my bra (when I don't have pockets)and it's scratchy and the peppermint is annoying at times.  (I have yet to try the others)<br />But this Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It last for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there's still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn't better than what you're using.

review/summary: I always come back to this product
review/text: I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I've tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for 'troubled' skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn't make my break-outs worse at all. It's oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn't feel slick, and it's nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don't use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.

review/text: Received within just a few days... Works really well! I live in Hawaii, but was unable to find it in a store in our town. I was so happy to be able to order it online, and not have to drive an hour+ to get it. Works well to minimize pores, blemishes, and leaves skin looking refreshed.

review/text: I like how mild this is.  It works and is much less expensive than most products that work.  I wash my face, apply this for five minutes and it leaves my face so soft and clean.  After removing, I then put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V0YL4U">Swisa Beauty Anti-Aging Cream, 1.01 -Ounce</a> on my face.  My face is soft and smooth and my skin looks younger.

review/summary: Deep Cleansing Fruity Face Scrub
review/text: Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First
review/text: I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.

review/summary: Great Moisturizer, Overpowered by Scent
review/text: This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.

review/summary: WOW
review/text: I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!

review/text: I originally tried this product because the "oil-free" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.<br />  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!

review/summary: Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
review/text: I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

review/text: Feels great on my skin. The only thing about it that bothers me at all is the smell. It's not a bad smell and it's not that strong but I'm pretty sensitive to scents. It probably wouldn't bother most people at all but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  I only mention it because I suffer from migraines and scents can be a trigger for me. The product works wonderful for my skin and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.

review/summary: Alba face cream
review/text: I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.

Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one!

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective. Oh, and before I forget, my face did look a little brighter after I used the scrub. It isn't allthat bad, but it's just not what I was looking for in a scrub.

I love sunflowers seeds to begin with and use them often in salads and just as a snack as is but the added toasted grains make this an even healthier snack that tastes fantastic.

I thought it was against the law to sell something for 3 times over the plainly marked price.  My understanding was that I would receive 3 packs per box with 3 boxes to be shipped.  That would have been 9 bags.  With the $5.00 shipping, I paid $11.80 for each bag of Cheetos.  This vendor is patently dishonest and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon ever again.  I received this box while my husband was in the hospital finding out he had cancer.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box yesterday and found I had been royally cheated.  Amazon, you need to ban this vendor forever.

review/summary: not worth it :(
review/text: I recently purchased two boxes of twinkies from American to be sent to Australia.<br />Firstly they did not arrive within the time frame that was given to me (6 days after maximum date), even though I paid for express post.  I was also not informed that they would be out of date by the time they would arrive here in Australia.  When I opened them they had sweated inside the bag so they were soggy.  Unfortunately it was a complete waste of money, never again!!

review/summary: My daughter loves the peach ones, perfect for starter snacks!
review/text: I got these on sale at the grocery store when my daughter just started self feeding snacks.  She only loves the peach flavored ones.  These are pefect because they just melt in her mouth, so no worries about choking.  They also slightly stick to her fingers so it's real easy for her to put them in her mouth without falling off.  These are perfect for starter snacks.  I looked online for a cheaper price because the grocery stores would sell these for around $3 or more.  I found them here on Amazon for a great price.  Then add the subscibe and save for 15% off plus use GERBR434 for an additional 15% off (exp 06/30/11).  I got them for $1.84 a piece!  We are stocked up!

review/summary: My daughter loves them
review/text: My daughter eats these by the handful. She would eat the whole bag if I let her. My only word of caution is to supervise while your child eats these. My daughter only has her two bottom from teeth, not a alot for chewing so she really has to suck on them until they dissolve. She has choked on them a few times, they start to get sticky and cling to the back of her tongue. A little scary but nothing major.

review/summary: When nothing else works, these do the trick
review/text: Our 10 month old daughter loves these peach snacks.  They are basically freeze dried yogurt which melts in your (or your little ones) mouth.  We've tasted them, and while not gourmet, they're pretty good for the type of snack they are.  They taste a little bit like some of the novelty astronaut food they use to market (the freeze dried part), but still have full flavor.  We save them as a bit of a treat, or to calm our daughter when she's being particularly picky at the time (when the normal foods / milk don't work).  These always seem to do the trick, and result in an "Mmmm" and a calm baby.  Especially helpful on long road trips.<br /><br />Plus, they have a small set of normal ingredients, and it doesn't require a Ph.D. to pronounce them all.

review/summary: Kinda chalky, Go with Happy Melts
review/text: I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.50 and the competitor, Happy Melts Yogurt Melts, on sale for $5. I have to say, go with the Happy Melts version. The Gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the Happy Melts version and are actually kind of chalky and bland. Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good. I think the way they melt in your mouth is quite similar to astronaut ice cream.

review/text: These gluten-free "graham" crackers are very tasty.  They actually taste very close to real graham crackers.  The only thing I didn't like is that most of them were broken upon arrival, and the breaks weren't at the perforations.  It is hard to make a S'more with irregular pieces of cracker.

There were plenty of crackers in the box. I'm looking forward to bringing them on my next camping trip for smores.

Can't wait to get more so I can try the crust, smores....if I can refrain from eating them all again! You won't be disappointed! Feels a bit like cheating if you're a celiac, IMHO.

review/summary: Broken Crackers
review/text: It is difficult to understand why a company would ship such a fragile product without buffering both the top and bottom of the box to protect the crackers. They padded the top, but not the bottom. Hence the crakers were are all broken into pieces, as if they were dropped from the third story of a building window. Someone in shipping, is not thinking. Both my husband and I are celiacs and enjoy this product. Broken into bitty pieces however,does not work for us, or the extended celiac family that wanted to make somemores one night. Many of the cracker pieces were too small to fit a marshmallow! How much does it cost to add a heavy paper buffer for the other side of the box? No much. Think of the happy customers!

review/summary: Wonderful graham style crackers!
review/text: I have Celiac Disease, so I hadn't had graham crackers in years. After enviously drooling over my kid's enjoying their grahams, I decided I needed to find a substitute that I could enjoy. When I found and ordered these, I prepared myself for the fact that since graham flour is made of pure gluten I might be disappointed in anything graham style.<br /><br />Boy was I surprised! These are not what I would call a substitute for traditional graham crackers, but a reinvention of the graham all-together! They're great! From first look, I was a bit weary, because they do look a bit like a dog biscuit, but I was immediately and delightfully surprised to see they taste nothing like dog biscuits. These are so amazingly delicious. They're crunchy, and have a delicate graham taste. I will definitely be ordering them again and again.<br /><br />If you've been missing graham crackers because of gluten sensitivity issues, allergies, celiac disease, etc., you NEED to try these. You will not be disappointed.

review/text: These work great with s'mores - I was so shocked. They are a little thicker and not as cloyingly sweet as non gluten free grahams, but I found that refreshing. Because they are thicker, they stand up to smushing the marshmallow and chocolate in between each cracker better than regular grahams, which can fall apart. I'd highly recommend!

review/text: I bought these for my husband who is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic. Although they are not sugar free, they have a low enough level of sugar that my husband can eat them.<br /><br />He really likes them and really enjoyed having them as an option.  He said they don't taste exactly like glutenated graham crackers, but are good on their own.  He really enjoyed making smores with them.  We used the marshmallow creme by Bountiful Harvest and dark chocolate by YC Chocolate - both gluten and dairy free.<br /><br />For the person who asked what ingredients are in these crackers:<br /><br />Casein free. Dairy free. Lactose free. Peanut free. Nut free. Tree nut free. Gluten free has never tasted so good. Produced in a dedicated gluten free, wheat free, dairy free, peanut free and tree nut free facility.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Pea Starch, Non Hydrogenated Shortening (Palm Fruit and/or Canola), Potato Starch, Brown Rice Flour, Brown Sugar, Sweet Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Water, Rice Bran, Sugar, Blackstrap Molasses, Honey, Glucose, Salt, Sodium Bicarbonate, Pea Protein, Vanilla, Sodium Carboxy Methylcellulose, Pea Fibre, Guar Gum, Inulin, Soy Lecithin, Mono Calcium Phosphate.<br /><br />Warnings<br />Allergy Alert: May contain traces of eggs.

review/text: I'm sorry - I'm a food snob with allergies.  Just because I don't spit it out of my mouth before I'm finished chewing does not mean it tastes good and it certainly doesn't make it a graham cracker.  There is very little in texture of flavor that is at all reminiscent of the childhood favorite.  Even the color is more akin to corrugated cardboard.  Sadly, that's a pretty accurate description of the overall effect.  They are edible in small quantities when burried under a quantity of home made frosting.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

It's not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.

review/summary: Mild but effective!
review/text: I don't know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It's very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it's not stripping my own natural oils.<br /><br />The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!<br /><br />I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don't want to touch my face anymore!

review/text: I bought this because exfoliants with small granules were too rough on my dry skin. I got a professional facial to help with my dry skin and they recommended a fruit enzyme peel that will dissolve dry skin without being so rough. Of course they wanted me to purchase an incredibly expensive product, but I decided to do some looking on my own. I settled on this product and have been very pleased. I can use it daily without it being too harsh on my skin and it dissolves all flaky, dry skin on my face. Even using it daily or every other day, the product has lasted a while (bought it in mid-August and still going here at Thanksgiving). It smells pleasant and feels soothing on my skin. Also, I think that Amazon had this listed as a liquid, but in reality it's a thick gel.

Mainly because those products and brands can have more active ingredients than store product getting better results.  This stuff is so great! I love the smell, it feels really cool and refreshing on my skin (almost like aloe), and my skin really does look shinier and refreshed after I use it.  Also, it only has to stay on for 5 minutes so it's something I can do more often than masks that require 20-30 minutes.

review/summary: Amazing product for what you pay for it.....
review/text: I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even.

review/summary: It smells great!! It's very mild though so if you have a lot of acne or scarring you may want something else.
review/text: I use this product when I want to relax because it smells great but I won't buy it again because it is too mild for my liking.
