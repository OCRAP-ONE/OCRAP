review/summary: Amazing Bread!
review/text: The breads from Anna are a saving grace for all people who want to eat healthy or/and have special dietary needs.<br />My husband was diagnosed with with Celiac a few years ago, and this is truly the best brand out there. When we have friends come over or bring sandwiches for a picnic nobody notices that the bread is gluten free. Just the opposite: They start baking this bread too, just because of the good taste and the healthy ingredients.<br />We always have a selection of the different bread mixes at home. My husband goes gaga for the chicken pot pie recipe from Anna made with her pie crust, so much that it became a running joke with our friends.

review/summary: Maltodextrin???Since When?  Ugh
review/text: I love all the gummy's this company makes because they aren't loaded with sugar and preservatives.  Whole foods used to sell them locally then stopped.  Now I know why.  Ordered the 12 pack of Currant Sun hats (the best flavor they make) and was surprised to see they now contain maltodextrin.  Very dissapointing.  :(<br />On the brighter side, they came fresh and moist.

review/text: Pill Pockets make all the difference in the world when it comes to caring for our aging dog. Old age brings with it a variety of ailments that require medication.  Some she likes and some she doesn't.  Pill pockets turn an unpleasant task into an enjoyable moment that our dog looks forward to. More than happy to spend about twenty cents to enjoy those moments with her.

review/text: We have been using Pill Pockets for about 5 years, for Cocker Spaniel that must take seizure medication.  He has never refused to take it.  It is a little treat I always put on top of his food, and even if he doesn't eat his food for some reason, he always eats the Pill Pocket.  Also, I have paid $11-13 EACH bag for all those years at a popular pet store.  To pay $20 for FOUR bags (same weight, same product), is like a huge sale for me.  Very happy with purchase and deal!

review/summary: A great and easy way to get your dog to take pills.
review/text: I have to say that I think these things are disgusting. They smell awful, and the pill pocket has the consistency of play-doh. That being said, my dog thinks they are wonderful and starts to salivate as soon as I pick up the bag. I think the smell of whatever this stuff is made out of masks the scent of the pill. My dog happily swallows it whole.<br /><br />The pill pockets are pre-shaped into forms that you can just pop a pill into and pinch closed. I buy the big ones because you can break them into smaller pieces, and since they are like play-doh, you can form them into balls around the pill you sneak inside of them. I can break one of these large sized pockets into thirds or fourths and form them around my dog's thyroid pill. That way instead of one bag of thirty lasting a month, it lasts three to four months - so it isn't very expensive and it makes giving my dog a pill fun and rewarding instead of the struggle it used to be. The thyroid pill is pretty small. Larger pills take a larger piece of the pill pocket. For a short time I had to give my dog capsules, and even with capsules, I could break these in half and each one was good for two capsules. (much easier than opening the capsule into canned dog food - which is MUCH more expensive than these pill pockets)<br />I have to say that I have seen these for $10 to $13 a bag at local pet stores - online here at Amazon is a bargain at less than $6 per bag.

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I have an elderly dog who gets several meds each day, and these make life so much easier!  They are expensive, but I've discoverd that, depending on the size of the pill(s), you can gently split the pill pocket in half and just mold it around the pill(s).  The beef seem to work better than the chicken for this.  Either way, this is a great product, and this is the best price I've found.

review/summary: Makes Pill-Time for Fido (or in my case, Frodo) a Treat, not a Terror!
review/text: Pill Pockets are wonderful! I can not say enough good things about this product! I have a 2 year old terrier mix, Frodo, who has skin allergies. He has to take pills daily, and with Pill Pockets, he actually looks forward to pill time! They are simply a soft flavored (I have only purchased the Beef) treat with an opening in the center to put one or two pills inside, and then pinch closed. The beef remind me of a softer, rounder tootsie roll. Frodo loves them so much, he once got one off the counter before I got the pill inside! Frodo weighs 60 pounds and I buy the large size. I also have an older Lab mix dog, Casey, who occassionally needs medication. He weighs almost 100 lbs, and he loves the pill pockets as much as Frodo.

review/text: I love, love, love these potato chips and they taste just like regular potato chips with less than half the calories and no fat.  I eat them all of the time and had no GI problems-but I'm used to them.  I get GI problems when I eat too much fat, so I think it's whatever your body is used too.  Highly recommend them to anyone who wants to cut back on potato chips, but can't.  Try this tasty no fat alternative and you'll be surprised!!!!

review/text: I love these things, I have not had the reaction others have had, in fact I have no reaction to olestra/olean at all, compared to other items on the market like 'fiber one' bars and chicory root extract which I cannot handle.<br /><br />They taste just like the original with half the calories, I find myself eating a whole stack along with a sandwich on my diet because they are just so good and only 420 calories per can, easily can fit into a diet program with exercise.  I otherwise never eat potato chips because of the fat content, and will not suffer through eating 'baked' chips. I wish more products came with olean in them, I'd be on cloud nine. Snyders of hanover honey mustard/onion pretzels would be high on my list, as would 'sun dried tomato and basil' wheat thins.

review/summary: Olestra = Ouch! Going back to regular Pringles.
review/text: These Pringles taste great. I bought 3 tubes of the from the grocery store yesterday and snacked on some of them last night after getting home. That's the only reason I didn't give them 1 star.<br /><br />I recently tried these out by eating 3 or 4 of these chips at someones house. I felt fine and was and thinking that the Olestra didn't bother me at all, so I decided the whole evil Olestra thing was totally blown out of proportion and wanted to get some. I came home from shopping and made myself a light dinner of chicken and rice. Then, while watching a movie, I ate about 1/3 of the container of chips.<br /><br />The next morning, about an hour after waking up, my stomach started hurting like CRAZY. The abdominal pain was so bad it nearly brought me to tears. I can snack all day on a bag of Dorito's and not bat an eye, but a bowl of Pringles with Olestra brought me to my knees! The pain did not stop for HOURS. It lasted from about 10am until 3pm.<br /><br />Even after the pain subsided, my insides felt sore, as if I was punched in the stomach over and over. I wish so much these didn't cause such a bad reaction. They would be my new favorite chips! But I'll stick with the regular Pringles and take the fat over that pain again any day.<br /><br />I'm not saying everyone will have the same experience as I have had. But I would HIGHLY suggest snacking on these on a day when you do not need to be at work or kids be at school afterwards.

review/text: I HAVE NEVER MET A POTATO CHIP I DIDN'T LIKE.  I HAVE NEVER MET A<br />POTATO CHIP I haven't eaten...except, perhaps, at parties, where I<br />had to restrain myself from eating all the potato chips laid out,<br />lest I leave a bad impression with host, hostess, and fellow guests!<br /><br />Yes, I must admit it.  Potato chips, (along with Three Musketteers<br />Bars -- also reviewed by me for Amazon), are my very, VERY favourite<br />snack....and have been, since childhood! Being a "P.C.A." (potato-<br />chip affictionado), has it's down-side...but it also has it's re-<br />wards. For instance, though I have never smoked, and never been a<br />drug-addict, I feel I can more easily understand the agony of<br />oeople trying to "kick" these habits go through, which also gives<br />me empathy for problems of all other people, all over the world,<br />as well!  (Should a group be formed, called "Potato Chip Addicts<br />For Better World Understanding"?  Hmmm......perhaps not.  Then<br />again.......)<br /><br />Of course, the most obvious disadvantage to eating potato-chips<br />is that doing so tends put pounds on the eater of those potato<br />chips.  So -- many manufacturers have come up with "Light", or<br />"Reduced Calorie" potato chips.  As are the potato chips being<br />reviewed here: PRINGLES LIGHT SOUR CREAM AND ONION Potato Chips.<br /><br />O.K. -- they taste GREAT!  And, although the side of the<br />package, (printed in both English and Spanish), lists the sodium<br />content as 190 mgs per serving, (which seems a lot, though right<br />now I have no other type of potato chip package to which to<br />compare it), the salt flavour -- though very prominent, (and<br />delicious!), was not as over-whelming as in other potato chips I<br />have had.  Thus, the thirst brought on by many other potato chips<br />I have eaten was not as strong. The sour cream and onions in<br />these potato chips took over much of the flavour-enhancement,<br />so, I guess, an overwhelming amount of salt was not necessary.<br />This, as Martha Stewart might say, is definitely a "good thing".<br />Because, quenching one's thirst, brought on by eating, (other)<br />too-salty potato chips usually only makes room for MORE potato<br />chips in one's appetite.  So, you might think that these, some-<br />what less salty potato chips would be easier to stop eating than<br />other potato chips.  Well -- in my case at least -- you would be<br />wrong.  Because -- with OR without a drink in between bites --<br />they just taste so darn good!<br /><br />Why then, do I give these potato chips -- which are fat-free,<br />contain 50% fewer calories than regular potato chips....and which<br />do taste S O good -- only three stars?  Sadly, because of several<br />of the ingredients listed on the container.  (Had I been able to<br />read these ahead of time, on Amazon, I might have gotten another<br />type and/or flavour, of potato chip.)<br /><br />The full ingredient list for these pototo chips is as follows:<br /><br />Dried Potatos<br />Olestra, (Olean Brand)<br />Modified Cornstarch<br />Maltodextrin and Rice Flour,<br /><br />Contains 2% or less of<br />Non-fat milk<br />Buttermilk *<br />Sour Cream Solids * *Cultured cream, non-fat milk)<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Whey<br />Dextrose<br />Monosodium Glutinate<br />Citric Acid<br />Lactic Acid<br />Natural and Artificial Flavours<br />Disodium Guanylate<br />Disodium Insinate<br />Polyglycerol Esters *<br />Mono- and DiGlycerides *<br />Alpha Topcopheral Acetate (Vitamin E)<br />Topcopherals (To Protect Flavour)<br />Vitamin A Palmitate **<br />Vitamin K **<br />And<br />Vitamin D **<br />....................CONTAINS MILK INGREDIENTS.................<br />* Adds a trivial amount of fat  ** Dietarily Insignificant<br /><br />What, you may ask, are so many vitamins doing in a package of potato<br />chips?  The answer is that, to make these chips less caloric, (70 calories per ounce), the fairly-new, artifical fat, OLESTRA, is used.<br />Olestra, (here with the "Olean" brand name), caused a bit of controversy a few years back when it was first discovered.  As I remember it, Olestrra<br />takes fat out of the body, all right -- but if any other food is eaten with it, the VITAMINS in the food, (either treated with, or eaten with, foods made with Olestra), are also flushed out of the body, before they can give any nutrition!  So, the FDA has, to the best of my recollection, mandated that vitamins, (mostly artifical, synthetic vitamins) must be added to foods made with Olestra.  And ONLY snack foods, such as these potato chips, can use Olestra at all.<br /><br />MOST of the other ingredients above, are also nothing to smile about: "disodium guanylate"?  "disodium inosinate"?  The late consumer<br />reporter, BETTY FURNESS, once advised her viewers, "If you can't pronounce it, don't eat it!"  This is good advice!  Sadly, however, other ingredients like "monosodium glutamate", and "mono- and diglycerides", have become SO common in packaged foods today, that most people CAN pronounce these words. Without, however, knowing what they actually mean....<br /><br />Upon first looking at the ingredients, I THOUGHT they also contained<br />"Cottonseed oil".  Re-reading them, for this review, I am happy to report that Cottonseed Oil is NOT present here.  (With "Olestra" as an oil, I guess Cottonseed oil wasn't necessaru.)  In passing, however, I would like to mention something I read in the excellent consumer book, "The Supermarket Handbook" -- published in the '70s or '80s.  This book, by Nikki and David Goldbeck, is truly "an oldie but a goodie"....and is must reading for people who want to be aware of what they eat, even in the 21st century!  In it, the Goldbecks state that: "Cottonseed Oil is not fit for Human Consumption."  Why?  Because cottonseed oil comes, obviously, from the cotton plant.  And -- since cotton is usually used for clothes, and not for food, (except for the oil), THE COTTON PLANT CAN BE SPRAYED WITH ALL SORTS OF PESTISIDES NOT ALLOWED TO BE SPRAYED ON PLANTS USED FOR FOOD!  I'm really glad that PRINGLES LIGHT SOUR CREAM AND ONION Potato chips do NOT contain cottonseed oil, (as first I thought they did)....but, looking at the facts that stack up against the frying medium that IS used in these potato chips, (Olestra / Olean), one wonders if the manufacturers have just substituted one bad ingredient for another....<br /><br />PRINGLES does make some very, very good potato chips.  The original has the OU of the (Jewish) Orthodox Union, certifying that they are Kosher -- as, also, do several other PRINGLES potato chips, if I remember correctly.  BUT ALL OF THESE ARE TNE REGULAR, FULL-FAT VERSIONS.  Any potato chip will make you fat, if eaten to excess....but why lose your vitamins at the same time?  (Strange things also seem to happen, when one ingests Olean, to the digestive tract...)  For my money, (and life!),  I think I'll stick to BAKED Potato Chips, and, perhaps, even the regular versions, from time to time, (to save money), of any Potato chips, from now on.<br /><br />I did, in fact, call up PRINGLES, and mentioned that I'd like to see them make the Baked potato chips I had seen other manufacturers.  The gentleman who took my call said he would pass my suggestion on to marketing.<br /><br />Here's hoping!!!!

review/text: Healthy, Natural, Organic, Low-fat and it tastes good? One might find one or two of these qualities in a product and then find themselves willing to sacrifice good taste for a healthy choice, or low-fat for an organic and delicious meal. However with Amy's Minestrone Soup, one need not sacrifice any of these. In fact to describe the home-cooked flavor and the hearty filling ingredients of this delicacy is a task best left suited to the taste buds. It's simply unfortunate that they are unable to talk!<br />Not only is this can of soup akin to a home cooked meal, it is also easy to prepare (only minutes in a microwave or stove-top), and perfect for quick lunches or for a last minute dinner. Of course it could also be passed off as if the preparer had labored hours in the kitchen, preparing the pasta, slicing the vegetables and carefully adding the spices to prepare a soup worthy enough to be called Mom's.<br />Finally, it is very low in fat (only 3 grams a can!) and has lots of fiber and a minimal calorie count. So one can slim out, eat well and know they are eating only the best organic food items!

review/summary: A bit bland for a carnivore
review/text: I just ordered the 12 pack of Amy's Minestrone Soup untasted, and I have to admit that I found it a bit bland for my taste. I love Amy's refried beans and chili, but I found this soup to be a bit tasteless. I had to add pepper and shaved parmigiano cheese to jazz it up a bit. That said, I'm a happy carnivore so my expectations for a vegetarian, organic soup was perhaps a bit too high. It was fine for everyday, but not  particularly interesting soup.

review/summary: Great Tasting Pasta - Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)! It is important to test your blood sugar to be sure you react the same way.<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: "5g of digestible carbs" is not factual
review/text: I purchased this to have pasta after being on a ketonic diet for the last month after seeing all five star reviews on a product claiming to have "only 5g of digestible carbs" per serving. I made a box of the pasta and separated it into 8 servings (so less than the suggested serving size). After eating the pasta I started to feel like I just ate a bowl of sugar. I tested myself a few times over the rest of the day (without having eaten anything else) and this pasta skyrocketed my glycemic index and knocked me out of ketosis for the first time in the last month of eating all my carbs from vegetables and nuts.<br /><br />My mistake wasn't googling this product before buying a six-pack, if I had, I would have found the useful information on: [...]- The point of my review is that buyer beware, this product may not work for you.

review/summary: Actually tastes pretty good with some tweaking
review/text: Both my husband and I love Indian food and though I enjoy cooking from scratch, there are times when my busy schedule gets in the way of cooking an entire Indian meal from scratch. A friend recommended the Patak sauces and I have tried a couple of them. This Tikka Masala sauce is quite good, BUT there is some tweaking involved. Like another reviewer mentioned, there is a strong vinegary taste and too much of a tomato taste to the sauce by itself. However, a couple of tweaks by way of adding extra ingredients will improve this taste.<br /><br />I added a couple of tablespoonfuls of yoghurt to the mix as it is simmering, and either a tablespoonful of ghee (clarified butter) or butter/margarine will also enhance the flavor and minimize the strong vinegary taste. Also, the spice factor is described as medium on the label, but both my husband and I found it to be quite mild (this is subjective and will vary from one taste bud to another). I added some chili powder and that added some extra kick and spiciness to the dish.<br /><br />This sauce can be used with chicken or shrimp, and also veggies such as green peas, potatoes, mushrooms etc. I serve it with raita (I use yoghurt,cucumber and tomatoes) and naan/chapati/rice. It tastes yummy and makes for a quick fix Indian meal without too much fuss!

review/summary: Good. Hotter than I thought it would be. Slight canned tomato edge to it
review/text: I like this sauce.  It goes well with shrimp, chicken, green peas, potatoes, cauliflower and probably a lot of other things including chick peas.  However, it was spicier than I thought it would be.  Not a bad thing but, I bought this at a retail location and didn't notice the "medium" rating on it so I actually thought it wouldn't have any kick to it at all.  I'd describe it as medium to medium plus kind of heat.  I can feel the burn on my tongue and palate and it actually made my nose run a little bit.<br /><br />Also, there seemed to be a slight edge to the taste.  I liken it to the taste you find in canned tomatoes.  In another review somebody described this sauce as "pure vinegar" and while I certainly don't think it's that bad, my guess is that they're referring to this same overtones.  Also, you'll see other reviewers mention that they'd add coconut milk, yogurt and butter to this sauce and I think that any or all of these things would be a good way to take the edge off a little bit.<br /><br />All in all it's pretty okay and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other Palak sauces.<br /><br />Edited to note that I added about a tablespoon of butter to my final serving of this (about 1/4 of the bottle) and it really went a long way to improving the sauce.  It took away some of the bite as well as smoothed out the heat.  I definitely think that's the way to go and makes this a solid 4-stars.  Just my opinion of course, YMMV.

review/text: We used to live in London and obviously were spoiled by the quality of Indian food over there. We currently live in Chicago and surprisingly, there is an abundant of choice. I bought this after trying Tasty Bite Tikka Masala (which was horrible). It's just OK.<br /><br />It's missing the coconut milk sweetness to balance out the cloves, but gets the job done. If you're a veteran of the 'commercial' Indian dishes (I've been told masala dishes don't actually exist in India, but these were created to westernize a lot of delicacies), give it a try.<br /><br />If you're new to the genre, go to a restaurant, as I would not want this to be your first taste.

review/summary: So Good
review/text: My husband is from Bangladesh, so we eat curries and masalas quiet often. This sauce does require some tweaking, but it is good. We add milk, cliantro, and some Chicken Tikka packaged spice that we buy at our Indian grocery store. Now, our Tikka Masala that we make from scratch is better, but for a quick dinner, this is so good. We eat it with Pilau/Rice and Naan. Also with Riata (a yogurt, cucumber, tomato dressing of sorts). But we love this stuff!

review/summary: Deliciously Authentic...with a few changes
review/text: Often times I try these pre-made mixes only to be sorely disappointed and come to the realization that I must go to an Indian restaurant in order to dine properly. Not this time. To be sure there were some changes that I had to make. I used about a 1 1/2lbs -2lbs cubed chicken breast which I seasoned with sea salt, fresh black pepper, ground coriander and cumin. I let it sit out for probably an 1-2 hours. I followed the directions for cooking but I also added 1 personal serving size plain yogurt, 2 tblsp. butter, 3-4 minced garlic cloves, 1 inch of ginger quartered, and 2 tblsp. canola oil to the sauce. I let all of this simmer (low) for about 1 1/2 hours while stirring occasionally. I also added more coriander, cumin, and sea salt to the sauce while cooking for taste. I promise you this tastes just like it came from an Indian restaurant but you must be willing to tweak it in an order to get it there.

review/text: I bought this out of curiosity. I always make tikka masala from scratch, but I don't have much time to do that at the moment. I cooked the chicken in butter and poured this over the chicken to heat up, and I thought it was pretty good for out of the jar. I got my tikka masala fix. This does have more of a tomato flavor than I'm use to. I prefer a balance between cream and tomatoes; however, it was still good and a "new" flavor for me. I will definitely pick up another jar and maybe try the other flavors as well.

When I opened the jar, it smelled pretty good so I was hoping it would taste the same.  I was really disappointed when I took the first bite and all I could taste was an overpowering vinegar flavor.  I asked my boyfriend what he though and he said maybe it was the chicken.  After reading a couple of these reviews I am relieved to discover we weren't eating rotten chicken, just disgusting sauce.

Unlike some other bottled sauces Ive tried, this one does not have an overwhelming clove taste.  The seasonings were quite balanced.<br /><br />I marinated chicken thighs (cheaper and more flavor), with greek yogurt and a couple tablespoons of this sauce overnight.  I baked the thighs for about 20mins on a cookiesheet, cut the chicken up roughly and put it into simmering sauce for another 10mins with some colliflower.  I enjoyed it. I only wish I had some Naan and Bastima rice which I couldnt find at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Delicious Indian food at home with very little effort
review/text: I love Indian food and when I discovered Patak's cooking sauces it allowed me have delicious Indian food at home with very little effort.  Tikka sauce is a deep colored red sauce which is a puree of tomatoes, coconut cream, and various spices. I am am able to get 3 or 4 dinners out of one jar container.<br /><br />I use the sauce as a base and add the following ingredients: coconut milk, cilantro, and garlic.<br />I typically make either chicken or lamb cut up in small pieces.  I also often add vegetable into the same pan, potatoes and onions work very well.  Sometimes I also like adding broccoli, cauliflower or chickpeas for variety.<br /><br />The best price for this sauce I found in a local Indian store.  They have a very large variety of Patak's sauces: different flavors and different hotness. I usually buy a large variety and store unopened jars in the basement. They keeps very well for a long time.<br /><br />I have tried a variety of Indian cooking sauces and Patak's is my favorite.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Very decent - surprised me!
review/text: My daughter and I are very spoiled -- we lived in a heavily Indian area before and the food we were able to get was amazing! So when we switched coasts we found ourselves without our Chicken Tikka Masala we thought we'd at least try this jar -- see if it would tide us over.<br /><br />Surprisingly it is quite tasty! It does, as others have mentioned, have a strong tomato/vinegar type taste -- heavy on the sour -- but we didn't mind. True it didn't taste like our favorite (4 stars is the max we'd give it) but it will do for us - and the plus is its quick and easy to use!<br /><br />We found this very mild -- and I think next time I'm going to add some red pepper and use the other suggestions (thanks amazon reviewers!) like yogurt and butter to enhance the flavor. Overall for the price ( I got it local) it's a great deal. Make sure you get real basmati rice to cook though -- it really compliments the flavor of the masala. I am looking forward to trying other Patak's sauce products!

If your dog is persistent, the filling inside won't last for long...but you can always buy more filling, (from Red Barn), to replace it. We don't bother, because once the paste is gone, our dogs still enjoy the bone, all on it's own. They'll play-fight over the bones, & quietly chew on them for hours at a time. I honestly don't know of any other chew-toy that would last like this one does! With our dogs working on these bones every day, they are still intact after a month! And since it's a real bone, it would also make a great outdoors toy. The 6 inch is a good size for a medium to large breed, & I highly recommend it for all medium to large breed dog owners!

review/summary: Keeping Restless Jaws busy and out of Trouble
review/text: Years ago, when I used to keep only German Shepards (to me, the smartest of dogs)I always had rawhide bones and chews around for them and they really liked it.<br /><br />I bought a dog who requires less activity because I have time restraints, now I can no longer can go for two or three lengthy, vigorous walks a day as I used to do. Since that time I've learned from my veterinarian that rawhide bones contain bacteria which can be harmful for dogs.<br /><br />I was told that the healthiest chews are real and sterile bones. My dog goes crazy for these.They have peanut butter inside. Once he's gotten all the peanut butter filling out,I just replace it.<br /><br />Also good to know is that rather than throwing these bones away, I can just sterilize them by imersing them in a pot of boiling water.That saves money.<br /><br />They help clean tartar off the teeth and a a really good buy.

review/text: These are great to top cinnamon rolls or add crunch to baked goodies. They are not bad in waffles but they are not the larger Belgian pearls. Don't be confused, the difference is only size, the Swedish is smaller pearls than the large Belgian pearls used in the classic waffles. The Swedish peals are also delicious in waffles, just does not give that big crunch!

review/text: Okay so this is pretty good coffee. I was not a coffee drinker until a few years ago when I started this job that requires me to pour over numbers and reports all day. Even though I started to drink it I had the following problems:<br />1)If I got 1 cup I could never finish it because it would become bitter and make my tummy hurt (so wasteful)<br /><br />2)If I did have occasion to finish 1 cup and go back for another I would break out into little caffeine-induced hives all over my face (totally messing up my sexy)<br /><br />3)If I drank coffee after 1 pm EVER I would have such trouble relaxing enough to go to sleep (can you say mild insomnia)<br /><br />So a friend who sells the stuff introduces me to it and I am skeptical as all get out because he is a health nut and you KNOW how they can be (no offense to any health conscious zealots reading this).<br /><br />But OMG I promise this stuff is like liquid gold. Its smooth, doesn't taste bitter, doesn't make my stomach hurt, doesn't break me out and I just really really like it. I just ordered some more today, which is worth the "I told you so" I am going to get from my friend.

review/summary: you CAN drink coffee again: diabetes, cancer, fibromyalgia, hypertension...
review/text: I've been drinking this brand [OG] for over 12 months now, and believe that Organo Gold coffee is different from alot of the 'healthy' coffee brands and 'regular' brands out there. "OG" as I like to call it, is 100% Arabica [low acidity] and has only 9mg of caffeine per cup, as opposed to the 134mg in 'regular' coffee. At first I was worried that I'd get headaches and / or some other type of 'withdrawal' symptoms from the decreased amount of caffeine, but the Ganoderma in this coffee more than compensates for that. It naturally invigorates a body, and overall, one should feel very calm. Most people mention to me that this coffee tastes 'very good' and 'smooth'. Most comment on the noticeable energy and stamina that day after just one cup. Some have lost weight and most experience detoxification within one week. If you have health issues or ailments, you may want to search-engine 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease' you can think of, to find out more. You will find many brands of 'healthy coffee' out there-in my opinion this one tastes really good. But I highly recommend you taste the product and see what it can do for YOU. Every 'body' is different.  I'm just one person, but for me, this brand has positively affected my: blood pressure, sugar cravings, mood, flexibility, migraines/headaches, skin, allergies [prone to sinus allergies]. I am happy to report that I have NEVER encountered: jitters, crash, burning stomach, nor nausea with this coffee (as was the case with my previous habit of 3 to 4 cups a day of 'regular' coffee). Go to pubmed, answers, reishi to learn even more about Ganoderma.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CGJAIM">Healthy Gourmet Coffee OrGano Gold Ganoderma</a>.  If black is not your style, there is a creamer & sugared "Latte", a dark chocolate added "Mocha" and [perfect for ADD sufferers and all children] "Hot Chocolate". If you thought green tea couldn't get any healthier, check out the nutrition information on the "Green Tea" (one tea bag makes up to 5 cups). As you can tell, I REALLY love this brand. Don't get me started on how my skin's appearance has improved from the G3 soap use...

review/text: The coffee is great I've been drinking it for over six months now and ordering it off Amazon for the last four months. However I was truly dissapointed with the shipping charges from this supplier, Shelly's Boutique.  I order two boxes of the coffee and a sample pack of the other Organo coffee flavors and tea.  All three items were ordered from the same supplier. All three were shipped in the SAME US Post Offices flat rate shipping container. It delivered in less than a week from the date that I ordered.  The Rip Off - I was charged three times for shipping!! Once for each item in the flat rate shipping envelope! Considering I've ordered two boxes at time from other suppliers who've shipped both in the same package and only charged me once for shipping, I will not be ordering from this supplier again even if they offer my coffee at a lower price. The 4 stars is for the coffee not the supplier.

I also purchase the black version over the latte & mocha latte versions b/c I often use soy creamer and prefer to be able to choose how much creamer & sugar is added.

review/summary: Not purely gandoderma
review/text: I was recommended this product by a friend who tooted gandoderma to be great for anxiety and insomnia.  I have so far tried one packet per day for exactly a week now.  Here are some things I noticed in myself:<br /><br />1. suppressed appetite.  Sweet things taste sweeter and it takes a smaller amount to leave me satiated.  I'd end up waiting until the effects of the coffee had gone away at night to get the rest of my food intake!<br /><br />2. sore muscles in the morning. (not sure why that is)<br /><br />3. Irritability.  (this was the pushing factor to make me stop drinking the product.)<br /><br />Keep in mind that I am a slender female who is not a regular coffee drinker.  I could just be sensitive to the product or have experienced atypical side effects.  However, a simple gander at the ingredient list states that this product is not pure gandoderma at all.  The order of ingredients are as follows: coffee, organic gandoderma extract.  Consumers should be aware of this fact before purchasing.<br /><br />So basically, there is more coffee in the product than the gandoderma. What's more is that this product does contain caffeine.  So if you are purchasing this for anxiolytic or somnelescent purposes, it may be counter-productive.

I also had the worst headache of my life while consuming this coffee. I consider myself a healthy young man, I workout 4 times a week, run and live a pretty athletic lifestyle. This product literally had me down for the count from my normal activities for about one week. Before taking this product please consult your physician and discuss the potential side effects as it relates to your current health. While reviewing any changes to my diet or reactions to any medications, the only change was adding this product to my diet. Once I eliminated this coffee from my diet, the headaches and dizziness subsided. However, the product still remains in your system for quite some time as I still experience slight bouts of dizziness during the first few minutes of my day.

review/summary: Good product but not the best and cheapest
review/text: A neighbor introduced me to this black coffee and the herb within, and I will be forever thankful to her. After reading these reviews, I was hesitant to even try it for a week because of the very few negative reactions noted here. When I finally dove in and made my first cup of "ganoderma coffee", my first impression was that it was the blandest coffee that I had ever tasted. Then the initial jolt kicked in as if I had downed a few shots of espresso. That wore off after an hour and then the ganoderma kicked in about two hours later. (Your system may not react the same!). The ganoderma kept me going all day and completely obliterated my appetite for food and even alcohol, which is a very good thing for me.<br /><br />Then I started wondering about the content of this product and started doing research. My initial guess was that this was mostly cheap robusta coffee with a high caffeine content and very little of the ganoderma. (It turns out that this assumption was wrong and there was very little coffee in this). One reason for the loss of one star in my rating is that the company does not post percentages of each ingredient. However, they seem to be the only one of the products that I tried that states that it is a product of Malaysia. It is well known that growing this mushroom in the tropics of southeast Asia produces the highest content of the active ingredient, which is an enzyme that breaks down dead wood (and junk in your arteries and veins).<br /><br />My neighbor also told me that hot water was needed to activate the ingredient, hence the coffee. Undaunted, I still went on a search to find capsules that were affordable and rated well. I visited two local health food stores and bought two different brands of 100-capsule bottles at a substantial savings below the suggested retail price of Organo Gold's capsules. One bottle scored an absolute zero, while the other bottle scored a bulls eye. I won't tell you the brands, because I spent a lot of time and some money to find this out myself. With the brand that scored the goose egg, I also dissolved the capsules into 8 ounces of hot water and still got no effect. As for the good brand, dissolving them in hot water only made them get to work faster. However, this good brand did not make me quite as hyper as this Organo Gold Black Coffee, so I still tend to believe that the Malysian grown reishi mushroom produces the highest concentration of the active ingredient. Other companies have figured out a way to grow them in laboratories, with mixed results. There are too many claims from each company claiming that their product is best, so the only way to find out is try with their cheapest version first and find out for yourself. A high cost does NOT mean that it is the best!<br /><br />So, if you hate the taste of coffee and like the jolt without the bad side effects of caffeine, then this product is for you. However, the taste of good ganoderma would actually be well suited to green tea, which this company also sells. As for me, I love the taste of good coffee made from fresh ground dark roast Central American Arabica beans, and I actually hate the jolt from cheaper robusta coffees. Since I also found cheaper ganoderma capsules, I have absolutely no use for this product. Since I am not 100% sold on this product, I certainly don't wish to spend all of my free time marketing this product. Those that wish to give it a shot, I wish you the best of luck.

review/summary: Oh so virital flavorings
review/text: We love flavored coffees but the price is just to high so I bought orange flavor, hazelnut flavor, cherry flavor, caramel flavor, and chocolate flavor powers, to make my own and they work very well. we can flavor by the cup or the pot and we are very happy with them.<br /><br />With some experimentation we fond all but the chocolate dissolve in cold. So we can and do use it in ice coffee, and we can now make our own flavored water with out having to pay the overly high price.

review/summary: Perfect with or without Meat ...
review/text: I have made the Mrs. Wages Spaghetti Sauce (now called Pasta Sauce) in two ways. The first one is the way the package requires - and it makes a very nice sauce. Both my husband and I like it better than most of the ones available in the store.<br /><br />The second time I made it, I added ground beef and used the pressure cooking method instead of the water bath. It made a wonderful treat to just be able to open a jar, heat it, and pour it over my spaghetti. It is always recommended that you cook low-acid items or meat products that have been canned for ten minutes - which is just the perfect amount of time for me to cook the spaghetti.<br /><br />I can the mixture of meat and sauce in larger jars (quarts), but make the sauce itself in pint-size jars, since I am normally making only 2 servings.<br /><br />***Note - before making the adjustments to the recipe, I went to my extension office and spoke with someone with professional experience, since canning is a precise balance of acid and cooking time to ensure safety.<br /><br />I especially appreciate the Mrs. Wages recipes because she gives directions for both fresh tomatoes and canned options. Also, while the recipe calls for sugar, it is always an option to substitute Splenda for those who are diabetic.

review/text: This is the best tasting Pasta/Spaghetti sauce I have ever made.  Used home grown tomatoes, and the flavor is just GREAT.  Seasoning and Texture once mix was added is perfect.  Most red sauces hurt my stomach, but this one doesn't.  Will definitely continue using for future cannings.

review/summary: Great, easy mix
review/text: I used the mix to make sauce to freeze (with fresh tomatoes). I was very impressed with the results. Because I freezed it I added several pounds of ground beef to the finished product before putting it in the containers. I plan on making it a second time, this time using canned tomatoes and maybe some vegetables (again I will be freezing so I am not concerned about the acidity).

review/summary: These chips are outstanding!
review/text: Congrats to Frito-Lay for creating healthier alternatives to their traditional potato chips! These chips are naturally made (no trans-fatty oils) and lower in fat than regular Ruffles. Best part is I can't tell any difference taste-wise! If you're looking for healthier chips, this is a great place to start!

review/text: I recently decided to give up soda because of the high-fructose corn syrup. Problem is, I don't like water. When I found this Honest Tea Half & Half (organic tea with lemonade), I knew my problem was solved! It's refreshing. It's natural. It's not too sweet. And only 100 calories in a decent-sized bottle! I'm going to order it by the case from now on.
