review/summary: Bought it for him, want it for me.
review/text: Bought this for the fiancee's birthday. He popped 2 of the bags when I wasn't home. Each time I came home the house smelled so good I asked him to let me try the last bag with him. I couldn't get enough and ate half the bag, and wanted more. Strangely it did smell burnt when I was present for the 3rd popping. But it sure didn't taste burnt. And it sure didn't taste like Bacos. I can't eat those so I was not interested in trying this product until I learned how great it smelled: very un-Baco-ish.  The taste was as others have described... maybe not exactly bacon, but smokey and meaty.  We were both definitely satisfied and want more. My only complaint is I can't buy it at the grocery store!

review/text: I found this popcorn the other day in Ross' Dept. store.  It was such a different item that I had to try it.  I'm glad I bought it.  I would definitely buy it again.  Beats plain old popcorn.  They had a couple more boxes on the shelf.  I'm going back and hoping nobody else bought them.<br /><br />PS - I went to the company website and they have LOTS AND LOTS of bacon flavored items you can buy.  What's better than getting the bacon flavor without having to eat the bacon and all that fat??  I have just stumbled on a great place to buy Christmas gift.  My family is from South Carolina and they just looove bacon.  This will be so much better for them.

review/summary: I was scared
review/text: At first I was terrified of this product when I opened the first package, I thought it smelled disturbingly like Beggin' Strips before it was cooked.  But I went ahead an microwaved for about 3 minutes, preheating a cup of water first like that package suggests and I must say I was not disappointed.  My dad liked extra crispy (burnt) bacon when I was growing up and coming out of the microwave it made the kitchen smell like Sunday mornings from my childhood.  I would say the flavor balance was perfect.<br /><br />If I am eating bacon popcorn I just wouldn't expect it to taste like I was eating a freshly cooked piece of bacon, I think that is kind of shooting for the stars.  However, I did get a pleasant experience, it did not taste like BAC~Os or smell like dog treats once it was cooked.  I would probably buy it again.

review/summary: Worst popcorn I have ever eaten
review/text: I ordered two types of popcorn at one time. One, J&D's BaconPop, the other Fireworks Red River Valley.<br /><br />J&D's BaconPop has to be the worst bag popcorn I have ever tasted. I can even eat burnt popcorn but I cannot eat this stuff. Only half of each bag pops and the bacon stuff burns. It gives off a bad smell and the taste is even worse. It is like burnt salt. I tried cooking at lesser times without improved results. I even tried scraping the popcorn out of the bag and popping it on the stovetop but the results did not improve much. I thought it would be difficult to screw up popcorn but these guys did a great job of making popcorn inedible. No bacon flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />J&D's BaconPop gets one star. One star is far too generous.<br /><br />Red River Valley by Fireworks gets 5 stars. The best popcorn I have ever eaten.<br /><br />=====<br />7/14<br />=====<br /><br />I gave this popcorn to a lady friend with two kids. They all love it. They ate every bit of it in less than one month. She now buys the popcorn at Kroger.

review/summary: I love this stuff
review/text: I've been getting this stuff for about a year. Although it isn't really a super-authentic bacon flavor, I think it tastes great.<br /><br />I see that some of the reviewers have said that it doesn't have much flavor, and I suspect they just got an unlucky bag. Every once in a while I'll make one that seems a bit light on flavoring and/or the flavoring doesn't seem evenly spread throughout the bag. For the most part, though, I have no complaints about that. (For reference, I almost always salt my French fries from fast-food places -- I'm not someone who is used to bland foods.)<br /><br />The only thing I don't love about this popcorn is that it doesn't smell too great while popping. In fact, the aroma was so unpleasant that I almost didn't eat any the first time I made it. (I'm glad I tried it, though!) I don't really understand how it can smell so weird and taste so great, but it does the same thing every time.<br /><br />On an unrelated note, this company also makes a bacon-cheddar popcorn, and I find that much less flavorful. The one that's straight bacon flavor is much better.

review/summary: Okay overall, very strong non-bacon flavor.
review/text: I received a box of this as a gift from my girlfriend, and almost immediately tried it out. As some other reviews stated, it doesn't actually taste like bacon. Imitation bacon bits, maybe. Certainly has a smoky flavor. My biggest problem was that the flavor was VERY strong. Between my girlfriend and I, we ate maybe half of the bag. It would definitely be suitable for a party, maybe. If the taste is similar to the bacon salt by this company, you'd be better off buying unflavored popcorn and adding just a bit of that to the popcorn.

review/summary: Ballyhoo in a Box... Yuck
review/text: Compared to good microwave popcorn, J&Ds BaconPop is frightfully overpriced for unpleasant popcorn.  Wow!  Did I just describe microwave popcorn as unpleasant?  The box advertises bacon, and the popcorn smells like bacon... about the first minute into popping... until a strange smell brings a big WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT? straight into your kitchen.  I'll stick with ActII or Pop Secret... and save my money and my nose.  J&Ds BaconPop tastes like basic, lightly-salted popcorn... and is somewhat dry to boot.  Additionally... THE SMELL towards the end of popping (no I did not burn it)... and the freaky black residue left on one side of the bag (no, I did not burn it) add odor and visual features to movie-and-popcorn night that I can do without.  My teenagers ate only about half of the popcorn and returned the rest to the kitchen with a "fun try Mom, but don't buy this anymore, OK?"

For a more bacon-like experience, drizzle 1/3 stick of melted butter over it . . . and don't forget to take your cholesterol meds!

It's not that bacon and popcorn wouldn't be good together, just that this really doesn't taste like bacon. More like some nasty mystery meat ground into a powder. Cool idea, but this bacon pop doesn't sizzle.

The other night I had a major snack attack and grabbed a bag.  I popped mine on the stove (no microwave) but the end result should have been the same as nuking it.  My popcorn cooked well, no duds.  None.  And the flavor was a great smokey bacony treat! The popcorn was crispy, and not overly greasy. My house smelled like bacon for hours!  This is not the kind of popcorn you can eat every day, unlikely.... but for a decadent treat I call this stuff tops!

review/summary: This is so good it should be illegal
review/text: This is popcorn is INSANELY tasty, and from the heavenly smell wafting from the microwave and the positively hedonistic name- it really scratches both the bacon AND popcorn itch. It tastes much better than you might imagine, and if you're a bacon lover - this corn is for you!<br /><br />Bacon-Pop cooking smells exactly like microwaving a big platter of real bacon and the taste is great, not too salty, not artificially "bacon-y" - it's just exactly the right combination of tastes. As a vegan, I miss the taste of bacon and this delicious, mildly buttery, absolutely realistically flavoured popcorn is ludicrously good.  That's right - it's vegan and vegetarian suitable! No it's not low fat, nor does it qualify as "healthy" but for a product called "BACON POPCORN" it (amazingly) isn't the worst offender on the microwave popcorn health scale with only 8 grams of fat per serving, no cholesterol, no gluten and no diacetyl.

review/text: I first had these in England and have been wanting to eat them again.  They came well packaged; each individual package was wrapped in bubble wrap.  However, the first few cookies in the first pack (I've only eaten the one pack so far) were a bit broken and crumbly, but the rest in the package were fine.  The cookie is not overly sweet, and the sweet taste mostly comes from the chocolate coating on the top.  While they are not the most delicious cookie made, they are quite good and bring back fond memories.

review/summary: Thank goodness for Amazon.com! Thank you for bringing me a taste of England!
review/text: These were "introduced" to me by a British facebook friend. Once I tasted them, I was hooked. They aren't as sweet as the cookies we have in the US, which is what I like about them. They are a bit reminiscent of our graham crackers, but less sweet and a bit coarser texture. McVities HobNobs are delicious also. Once the package is opened, I can't seem to resist just one more of either of these wonderful "biscuits". I have tea and bikkies often now and think of my friends across the globe, in the UK, Norway, Australia, Japan and beyond. I would love to see these here in America, but I'm afraid our taste for sweeter sweets would not make them a huge seller. If United Biscuit company wants to bring their expertise here, I'll be first in line at the grocery for them. Thank you Amazon!<br /><br />RATHER DISAPPOINTING PROBLEM: My Chocolate Digestives arrived on a hot day and the chocolate had melted. It fused all of the cookies together so that they were impossible to separate without reducing them to crumbs.<br /><br />The second order I made sure was brought in right away. These were even more stuck together and the chocolate had oozed out and was lost on the inside of the wrapper. In this condition, I couldn't share them as I'd hoped. THESE SHOULD BE STORED AND SHIPPED IN A REFRIDGERATED CONTAINER!!

review/summary: Normally tasty, but melted and ruined in shipping
review/text: These cookies (Sorry McVities- they're cookies to me!) are uniquely tasty. They have a light malty flavor, are crisp but not normally crumbly (see below), with a thin chocolate topping that brings everything together for a satisfying flavor that is not too sweet or rich. Only a couple takes the edge off until dinner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, what is described above is not what gets delivered to your door. The sellers take no pains to safeguard product quality, so during shipping, the cookies are exposed to heat which melts the chocolate topping, causing it to become a mortar, cementing each cookie together into a single cylinder.<br /><br />A steak knife cannot cleanly separate the layers of this cookie tower. No matter the implement, any attempt to get a single cookie results in a mushroom cloud of crumbs on your clothes and surroundings.  The trick then is to find chunks big enough to eat while cleaning up and keeping the dog away because the crumbs contain chocolate. Once a stack of 4 cookies detached so I tried to eat them hamburger style. -Uggg. Nothing good about that.<br /><br />An especially desperate or industrious person could remelt the cookies, painstakingly separate each one, re-smooth the chocolate topping, then allow them to cool before eating.  That's a lot of work for a cookie, and it's an expensive cookie at that.<br /><br />Seriously guys - Is there truly no way to ship these cookies without allowing them to spoil?

review/summary: Not to my taste
review/text: I've been making curries for decades, in the UK and here in the USA but can't be bothered with using individual spices, so I have always used commercially available curry powder.  I've always thought Sun Brand Madras Curry Powder was good - the closest I'd found in the USA to the better powders available in the UK but due to a mix-up on ordering and wanting to see if I could get a powder with a little more "heat" in it, I tried this Roland Hot Madras Curry Powder.<br /><br />It says it's a Product of India but to me this is NOT curry powder!  It doesn't look, smell or taste like curry - it's light brown greyish with a hint of green, doesn't have that characteristic aromatic scent of curry and it most resembles, in appearance and smell, what I once bought as Garam Masala (Rajah brand).  The overriding flavor in a cooked dish is of cloves and cinnamon.  Note that cinnamon is not listed in the ingredients but cassia is, though it's near the end of the list, as is cloves; possibly the ingredients are not listed in descending order of amount.  The other possibilities are that the main spices are of low quality or have gone stale - wouldn't be the first time, if anyone knows the Vencatachellum-Sharwoods saga, which, from what I gather, may have undergone a further, more recent degradation.  The containers are made of reinforced cardboard with a silvery inner lining and have a ring-pull aluminum seal top and bright steel bottom - no "Best By" date code so hard to tell if the product could have gone stale in storage.<br /><br />For those interested in salt content, it's listed fifth in the list of ingredients but there's no "Nutrition Facts" panel so no way to know estimated amount per serving.  There is no mustard, anise or ginger mentioned and interestingly, the recipe for a shrimp dish on the container mentions using fresh ginger.  The rest of the ingredients look about right for a "curry powder" so I'm left wondering why I'm disappointed and what to do with those 12 cans - maybe I can blend with something to make it palatable to me.  Meanwhile I'll be ordering some more Sun Brand and hoping quality hasn't deteriorated there.

review/summary: Yummy but expensive for what you get
review/text: I once had someone ship me some oreos covered in chocolate like this before, and those ones were heavenly. I got these ones because of that memory although I had no idea if it's the same company. I don't know if my tastes have changed, but these weren't as good as those ones were. The package was also smaller (thinner) than I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />HOWEVER, they were still pretty tasty and the decorations were adorable (although all the cookies did not have a decoration on them as shown in the picture. I think 4 of the 7 did, and the other 3 just had sprinkles--the good kind that don't leave a bad aftertaste).<br /><br />I'm only giving it 3 stars because I've had better and the price seemed a little steep for what you got, but these were still very good and overall not a bad deal.

review/summary: Why Did You Change, Purina??
review/text: What if you don't want a variety pack? What if your cat just wants to eat one flavor? I had a subscription to the Friskies Fine Cuts Ocean Whitefish, and every month I would get two trays of just that flavor, and all was well in catland. Amazon was the only place I could find it because the pet stores stopped selling the individual pouches. You had to buy a box of 12 with four packets of 3 different flavors. So my cat had to deal with 4 yums, 4 mehs, and 4 yuck nos. I was so happy when I found I could get just the one flavor she liked regularly delivered by Amazon.<br /><br />Then they stopped the subscription because Purina is messing with the recipe. They now call the same food Gravy Sensations, and it's only sold in mixed flavor boxes. You are messing with me, Purina.

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: This is my favorite chole spice mix.  I follow the pressure cooker instructions on the package which are somewhat different than the instructions on other brands.  Most brands suggest cooking the chickpeas separately and then adding them to the tomato/spice mixture.  With this, the instructions tell you to add the tomato/spice mixture to the pressure cooker along with the uncooked soaked chickpeas and pressure cook them together.  My experience is that the final result is much, much more flavorful and the chickpeas have a nicer consistency to them.  I have tried several different brands of Indian spice mixes available at my local Indian grocery store and I consistently find the MDH brand mixes to be my favorites.

review/text: I've been a consumer of the mini-wheats products for many years though I've also bought the malt-o-meal variety of this and it's excellent too. But this product brought me back because you can't find this flavor among the other brands. An excellent flavor it is too, with just enough blueberry sweetness without being over powering. The portions of mini-wheat are also very nice as you can fit two or three on a spoon without it over flowing. Enjoy with a cold bowl of milk and you've got a nice start to your day or a tasty snack before bed time.

review/summary: Delicious tea worth the infusion
review/text: I often make tea using fresh ginger, but for those days when I have no ginger on hand, this is absolutely the best, most flavorful and refreshing tea. It is great iced with a spritz of seltzer and slice of lime, but I usually drink it hot. Ginger is great for a variety of ailments from nausea to motion sickness, but I love the flavor and zing of this tea even when I'm feeling great.  I tend to not use water that is at a full boil, but rather let it sit for a minute before creating the infusion.  I also do not squeeze the teabag as many do because I find that it may be a little more bitter than I prefer.  If you can't make tea from fresh ginger, this is the next best thing.

Tangy peachy with a slow heat.  Hot but didn't strike me as anywhere near the Insanity Sauce.  If you are into hot sauces this is a good one to try as it is unlike the rest of the herd.  I've got to play with this one more to see what I can match up the flavors with.

review/text: This stuff really is very good.  The picture says it makes 15 waffles but the bag you get makes 37.  That's less than $0.50 each for a jumbo waffle!  Unlike other mixes, you only have to mix with water and let it fluff for 15 minutes.  No need to add egg and oil.  It makes it much more convenient to wip up some on a whim.  The first batch scared me a little bit because it mixes up really runny but it cooked up great.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Excellent Product...
review/text: I ordered the Heartland Blueberry Waffle Mix, the Heartland Malted Vanilla and the Carbon's Malted Original. This is by far better than the Carbon's in my opinion. The batter tastes like cake batter. I was expecting the waffle to be sweet like cake, but it was just a really good waffle. My 15 year old and I liked the Blueberry mix the best. My 11 year old and 17 year old liked the Vanilla better. I know others have mentioned liking the Vanilla better so you are just going to have to try them both.<br /><br />The mix could not have been simpler. 3 parts mix to 2 parts cold water. Mix. Let sit for 15 minutes. One thing that I've seen mentioned here and it bears repeating. After it sits for 15 minutes, you are going to have to add a bit of water to the mix as it sets up too stiff. Just a tablespoon or so should get it to waffle consistency. Another thing mentioned is that your go to ladle is probably going to put too much on the waffle iron. My first waffle spilled out of the iron. (That is when I tasted the batter.) The next waffle, I was careful to put a few tablespoons less on the iron and I got a perfect waffle.<br /><br />3 cups of mix yielded two Belgian waffles.<br /><br />I am using the Waring Waffle Maker Pro. Setting 3 1/2. Cook until only the faintest wisp of steam is coming from the iron. You don't want to leave too much moisture in the waffle in case you want to freeze them. Moisture creates water crystals that damage the waffle.

Ordered both this Waffle mix and the Waring Pro WMK600 Double Belgian-Waffle Maker [...]product from Amazon.com.  I was very excited to try out this waffle mix and my new waffle maker right away, so we had breakfast for dinner tonight.  We thoroughly enjoyed these waffles, Wow, really easy and delicious.  Light crispy outside, fluffly on the inside.  I see all kinds of yummy possibilities.<br /><br />The regular complete waffle/pancake mixes from the grocery store does not compare with this tasty mix.  Hearland Malted Vanilla Pancake & Belgian Waffle Complete Mix is in a class by itself.  Just order the mix, you will have no regrets!  So very good!<br /><br />(I plan on writing a review on the waffle maker after a few more tries, but based on tonight's waffles I am very pleased with this purchase too).

I used club soda instead of water because that's what my stepfather does in his "famous" Belgian waffles.  Of course, he has to mix lots more ingredients, and guess what???  These were better!  I also added pecans as they're a favorite.  We now have waffles for dinner as well as breakfast.  Gotta love a product that seems to have been much more trouble to make than it is.

review/text: I just bought one of these flip waffle makers after falling in love with them while staying at a hotel (it had a free breakfast deal in the lobby).  The waffles were incredible and the maker was fun to use.<br />I went on Amazon and bought one of those same waffle makers with ease, but, I had no idea which mix I needed to buy.  I tried a couple and they just didn't seem to either taste quite right or rise the right way.<br />I found this pack (Heartland) and I am glad that I did.  This is the perfect mix.  I have to say, 5lbs. is a lot!  But don't sweat it--if you love Belgian waffles, you will fly through a bag faster than you think.<br /><br />Enjoy:)

review/summary: Heartland Waffle Mix
review/text: I thought this product had ok flavor but I was dissapointed with the texture of the waffles.  I only added water and let the mix stand for 15 minutes as the package states. The waffles turned out tough and kinda rubbery. My wife says the homemade mix I make tastes better. I'll tinker with the mix on the next batch and will update my review.

review/text: I loved the fact that all I had to add was water. I purchased this mix along with my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JU9T6">Waring Pro WMK600 Double Belgian-Waffle Maker</a> and they're fantastic. Light, fluffy, and full of flavor. I wanted something that I could enjoy at a moments notice without worrying about whether or not i had eggs, milk, etc. These are now my go-to waffles and I'll definitely be checking out Heartland's others flavors like Multigrain and Blueberry.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was very disappointed with this pancake/waffle mix.  Could not taste the vanilla flavor (very weak, if any at all) and compared to the Golden Malted brand, this mix has a tendendcy to stick to the belgian waffle maker, even with a fresh coat of vegetable oil.  Sorry, I won't buy this one again.  Note: with this mix, you only add water.  With the Golden Malted mix you add egg, water & butter, which may be what helps it not to stick to the waffle maker.  If you do purchase this brand, be careful because it cooks much faster, too.

review/summary: Easy to make and cooks well, but the flavor is a bit bland
review/text: We ordered this waffle batter to make belgian waffles with our double waffle maker since the reviews were very favorable.  While the mix seemed to work just fine and conveniently only requires water, the taste fell a bit short of the delicious belgian waffles I am accustomed to eating in restaurants.  The texture was fine and the waffles browned nicely once we got used to the timing, but I could not really taste any vanilla and the flavor was on the bland side.  I have not tried it, but I suspect they would work well with other flavorings added.  If you want a standard waffle batter to add to and tailor to your preferences, this is probably great.  If you want a complete waffle mix that is ready to go with just water AND is full flavor, you may want to look around a bit more.

I would really recommend if you like chocolate covered pretzels.  Just the perfect snack if you need a little sweet and salty pick me up.

review/text: These are the same product as the Bite-Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.<br /><br />The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.  If you can get past that, the taste is unmatched!<br /><br />The Slim-Jim ingredient list was similarly disturbing to me as Slim-Jim has, as separate ingredients "chicken" and "mechanically-separated chicken."  I don't understand why one or the other doesn't cover both.

review/text: When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn't.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food.

review/summary: These used to be so much better
review/text: Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.

I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto brand) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.
