review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I happen to love flavored coffee, and am always looking for a new one.  I found this brand a few months ago, and have been trying the different flavors.....they are all good!  This one is my favorite though.....it is the perfect blend of Raspberry and chocolate.  I brought it to a meeting, and we spent more time oohing and aahing about the coffee than getting our work done!  It is also a great dessert coffee!

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.

review/text: recently tried the choc raspberry k cups.  I am not fond of the flavor.  It smells delish, but, definately not enough chocolate flavor for me.  I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup, along with a bold coffee, I get the desired flavor that I enjoy.  For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor, the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent. Thank you.

review/summary: Drinkable Flavored Coffee
review/text: A sample of these Van Houtte "French Vanilla K-Cups" were included with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> and, sadly, it was fairly disappointing. This seems to be a "hit-or-miss" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the "Large Cup" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH

review/text: We bought a case of these based on the positive reviews, but quite frankly no one who has tried it has liked it at all. It's a bit bitter, and the raspberry is tart tasting. Smells OK when it brews, but so far of all the people who have tried it (wife, myself, friends, relatives), no one has really liked it. So we have a half case of it sitting around collecting dust.

review/text: I've tried so many K-cups. The greatest problem I have with K-cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a "strong" cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K-cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However, I'm so glad I found this vanilla k-cup. I can actually taste the vanilla and coffee in my cup of coffee with this k-cup. I enjoyed my sample of this so much that I bought 2 boxes of 48ct in addition to the Hazelnut. I hope the Hazelnut is just as good.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this, but I can't
review/text: I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug- awful chemical processed cleaner/air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.<br /><br />If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.<br /><br />Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you!

review/text: I purchased this product after reading great reviews on here.  I really like chocolate / mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K-cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my brewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!

Then add some crushed ice and have a delicious cold drink. I am not fond of hot coffee, but love this refreshing drink when I need a pick me up.

review/text: I am so excited to see Amazon offering the Van Houtte k cups. They are by far my favorites. This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups.

review/summary: My personal fave
review/text: My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee.  To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee.  On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think).  That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for.  I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor.  It's just the right balance of "coffee" to "flavor" ratio.  You can taste it, but still taste the coffee.  And my kitchen smells heavenly!  But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences.  If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor.  And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig.  It's the most economical way to get them.  You get a discount and free shipping.

review/text: This is potentially the weakest tasting coffee on the market for Keurig Machine.  If you like weak tea then this coffee might just be what you are looking for.  I have now brewed 6 cups and all have been consistently weak even in the smallest cup setting. Not to my liking

review/summary: Weakest, worst 'French Vanilla' coffee i've ever tasted!
review/text: As a longtime avid fan of vanilla flavored coffee, I was excited about trying this brand of 'French Vanilla' on our new Keurig machine. In short, I am VERY dissapointed with this one! At any setting on the Keurig, this coffee tastes terrible. There is next to no vanilla flavor or notes (and the little there is tastes totally artificial and way off on accuracy for vanilla), and the coffee itself tastes very cheap and low quality. I wouldn't even give away these remaining French Vanilla K-cups, so I just tossed them in the garbage.

review/summary: Definitely "light"
review/text: I actually thought I was buying the Van Houtte vanilla coffee k-cups that I usually purchase and I overlooked the description of "light." It certainly is. You can barely taste the vanilla. It's good coffee, but if you're looking for a real vanilla flavor, go with the Van Houtte k-cups that are in a darker yellow package.

review/summary: Agravating K-Cups
review/text: Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.

review/summary: Good coffee, but not at all Creme Brulee-y
review/text: I love creme brulee. If I were to drown in a vat of it, I think that'd be a pretty good way to go. So, naturally, when I see something that is flavored like creme brulee but without the calories, I get excited.<br /><br />I got excited about this coffee.<br /><br />Now, it's good coffee, as far as coffee goes. Nothing wrong with that. But if someone served me this and asked me to identify the flavor, creme brulee wouldn't even make it on the list. It's almost got a bitter taste to it -- even Splenda didn't help much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I ordered two boxes and will be lucky if I get through one. Guess I'll sell the other one on ebay or something. Dunno. What I *do* know is that I won't be drinking it.

review/summary: Raspberry yes, chocolaty No
review/text: I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.  I love Emeril's the best and maybe down the road they will get Gloria Jean's Rasberry Chocolate?

review/summary: Darn Good Coffee
review/text: I've always been so so on coffee. I love flavored drinks and I like the IDEA of flavored coffees. But the reality never measured up to the hype for me. But this coffee is really good. It smells fantastic when it's brewing and the taste is spot on. Obviously to bring out the flavor you need to add sweeteners because both the main flavors in this are sweet. But whether I use cream and sugar or White Chocolate Raspberry creamer (my favorite way) it's a good cup of coffee. I have had this in the morning as well as for a dessert coffee. If you like flavored coffees that aren't either watery or overwhelmingly strong, you'll like this one.

review/summary: Rich aroma evokes a confectionery; light roast is delicious
review/text: Be prepared for visitors. The decadent aroma of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle imbues your kitchen (or office) as you brew this light roast from Van Houtte. We brewed a couple cups at the office (in a cubicle) and the rich aroma carried through the office air vents, attracting droopy-eyed co-workers in search of chocolate.<br /><br />Delicate for a flavored coffee, this blend made a delicious afternoon treat. And, amazingly, the artificial flavoring doesn't leave a strong chemical aftertaste. The smell of rich chocolate and raspberries lingers after the last sip, giving the impression that a team of chocolatiers just departed. Honestly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a> is heady stuff.<br /><br />We tested and enjoyed Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle both on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) and small mug (7.25 oz) settings. According to the Van Houtte website, "The 8-oz size makes the ideal cup of coffee, but you can vary the cup size if you want to change the coffee's strength (for example, choose a larger cup size to get a less intense cup of coffee)."<br /><br />If you are concerned about freshness, our box of 24K cups came with an expiration date of July 10, 2011, or more than six months from our purchase date.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: Very chocolately, raspberry taste unlike some of the Van Houette k-cups (Spicy Mayan Chocolate, for example, which (to me) has little or no flavor and smells like wet, sweaty socks.)  Well, the chocolate raspberry truffle definitely does have plenty of flavor and smells as amazing as it tastes. Definitely worth the purchase! Also, the 24-count boxes are great for host/hostess/party gifts and much better than the ubiquitous bottle of wine that everyone brings, assuming, of course, that your host has a Keurig coffee machine.  Great product!

review/summary: One of the best flavored K-cups I've tried
review/text: Often with coffee in general, and especially k-cups in my experience, flavors don't work too well. I was ordering a book and needing to get to over $25 for free shipping when I spotted these in my Quick Picks section and went ahead and added them to my order. One of my favorite coffees from when I was a college student was a pump of raspberry syrup into my coffee. This is surprisingly very similar and very good. It's now the third Van Houtte k-cup I've tried and I've been pleased with every choice, but most pleased with this one. I added a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevia Supreme-50pkts - 1.8 oz - Packet</a> and some half and half and it's a wonderful dessert coffee.<br /><br />I feel this is a much better option than those sugar laden artificially flavored non-dairy coffee creamers. My top two flavored k-cups are now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WRHQRA">Green Mountain 15535 Pumpkin Spice K-Cups, Light, 18 pods</a> and this one.<br /><br />I hope this winter that they come out with a peppermint k-cup!

review/text: There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though.

How disappointed we were.  There's absolutely nothing that indicates a creme brulee flavor or even anything with a slightly sweet (or sweet smell).  This is a smokey coffee and I think that makes a difference.  There's a somewhat nice aftertaste but it's nothing like we'd expected.  Now I'm pouring sugar and cream, or flavored cream, in it just so it's not wasted.  We have the vanilla flavored coffee in this brand so we really thought this would be amazing.  What's not amazing is that I'll never see my $33 again.  I can't wait until we drink it all up just so we can forget it ever happened.

review/summary: Van Houtte . . . is this a discontinued item?
review/text: I find it curious that you can not find this k-cup on Van Houtte's website.  You can find the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle light but not this specific k-cup. Given some of the very negative reviews of this product,  perhaps it is a discontinued item or maybe it is not a Van Houtte product.

review/summary: Don't waste your money!
review/text: Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.  It has a very strong artificial flavor that doesn't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly doesn't taste like coffee.  Like one other reviewer said, I'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I don't know anybody who would enjoy it.  YUK!

review/summary: One of the best k cups we've tried so far!
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/summary: What happened 2 my once-favorite coffee?
review/text: I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great-tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly, I am giving up on Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and will purchase another flavor from now on.

review/text: Having never sampled this flavor, I took a chance and ordered a 2 pack because it sounded so delicious.  I'm happy to say I made the right choice.  It's an excellent combination of chocolate and raspberry, where one flavor does not overpower the other.  It's my new favorite K-cup, and I will definitely buy more when this supply runs out!

review/summary: AMAZING!!
review/text: After seeing all the reviews for this, I had to try it and now need to order another box of them. The smell of it brewing alone is probably enough reason to want to get more, but it tastes just as good as it smells. I've come to expect the same aromatic results from other kcup flavors and every other kind I have tried hasn't come anywhere near how this one brews. I find myself sniffing other flavors while they're brewing to see if there is any smell at all and I'm generally disappointed. This is my favorite flavor thus far!

review/summary: Decadence without the guilt!
review/text: I am happy to find that Amazon carries the Van Houtte k-cups, as the pricing is far better than other resources for k-cups.  This k-cup flavor strikes a nice balance between coffee and the chocolate and raspberry flavors, and you can feel like you're enjoying a nice truffle candy without the calories or guilt.<br /><br />The two box packaging is a plus if you're like me and have a Keurig at home and another at work.  This way, a box can go to work and the other stay home.  NOTE: these are the 24 count boxes, too, not the 12 or 14 that seem to fill the shelves of the local supermarkets, WalMart and department stores!<br /><br />If you're new to the K-cups and want a flavored coffee that delivers the flavor in the title, you can't go wrong with any of the Van Houtte varieties.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and French Vanilla are my favorites, followed by Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee and Mudslide.

review/summary: Meh....
review/text: I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very "meh" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/"legs", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz "cup" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee.

review/text: I like strong coffee and found that some of the other K Cups were too light tasting.  This is the best one yet.  This is all i drink now.  I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean, so that should give you an idea of how my taste is skewed.  I mix this coffee with International Delight "White Chocolate Mocha" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrible waste of chocolate and raspberry flavors
review/text: I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a "tinny" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.
