review/text: My husband loves Tabasco sauce in his food and they were part of my birthday present to him last year. Their size is very convinient to have on a trip, picnic, in your office or also as a gift to someone else who is like my husband. Actually, before it he used to carry with him the smallest bottle that we can find at the market but still it is big to have in his briefcase when he is going to a different country. Now he has this mini tabasco sauce perfectly fitted in his briefcase on his way far from home and he can remember me every time!

review/summary: Sojos Complete dehydrated raw dog food
review/text: I have a 7 year old Australian Shepherd who thrives on this food. She never has health problems and eats this food with gusto, especially when compared to kibble (wouldn't you?) I typically make enough food for 3 or 4 days and store it in a lock and lock container in the fridge. I've always had an interest in feeding raw (and do occasionally give a turkey or chicken neck) but I also travel a lot and needed something I could bring along easily.<br />She had previously been eating a super premium kibble, but I like the idea of real unprocessed food so much more. The benefits are undeniable.<br />I am shocked to hear that several reviewers are supplementing with rice. This is a grain FREE food, as dogs are not really meant to eat/digest grains. It being grain free is what makes it so costly. The Honest Kitchen makes similar canine diets with grains for what I consider to be significantly less cost. If I wanted my Sojos to go a little farther I'd probably add egg or some raw ground meat.<br />The 8lb bag lasts her around 6 weeks, which is about how long the 28.6lb bag of super premium kibble she was previously eating lasted (and for around the same price).<br />Thanks to Amazon for the always-perfect service. I love being able to order this food with expedited shipping to my door for less than the price of buying it in store.

review/text: I bought this for a road trip across the crountry and back. My dogs are raw fed and this seemed the closest to what I made at home. We spent 15 days on the road and our four dogs enjoyed every meal the entire trip. They ate the food with gusto and had totally normal poops the entire trip. I used ziploc bags to fix a meal ahead (they eat twice daily) and stored the soaking food in our ice chest. Now I use this food for weekend trips and have some stashed in our disaster kit.

review/summary: Best food ever
review/text: I have to say that this is the best food available. My puppy had been having dandruff and a dull coat on a diet of high quality, corn free kibble. Her coat was shiny and flake free within 24 hours of starting this diet, and she loves it (thats not saying much because she'll eat anything though). I ate some myself and it is pretty good. It feels good feeding a food that is actually FOOD, not mystery brown chunks. It is pricey, I feed it along with a homemade raw meat/veggie deal, but it is great for traveling.<br /><br />I really wish it was more affordable so we could feed it to large dogs (we have two 90lb+ dogs). Check out Grandma Lucy's for a comparable product that is slightly cheaper. (10lbs for the price of 8lbs of sojos).

review/text: I have been searching for the best food to feed my two small dogs:  One is a rescue Maltese/Havanese mix, 7 pounds, one and a half years old; the other a 13 year old Bichon.  Did not want to make the commitment to the raw diet.  This is the next best thing.  There are other dehydrated dog foods on the market, but this one actually is chunks of the food.  Others have been ground up to the consistency of oatmeal.  My dogs love, love, love this food.  I have needed to contact the customer service department a few times.  A human always answers the phone and they have always answered my questions in a very polite and knowledgeable manner.  My search for the best food for my "babies" is over.  And, as I have told friends, if worse comes to worse, my husband and I can always eat this!!!  It looks and smells that good.  I know it is expensive.  I have two small dogs, so it isn't terrible.

review/summary: Amazing transformation for allergic golden
review/text: I've been feeding my nine year-old golden retriever Sojos for the past eight weeks (nine weeks if you include the transition period).  He's had so many positive changes that I wanted to write a review.  In the interest of fair disclosure, I have also added the following supplements to Teddy's food (starting at the same time I started Sojos): apple cider vinegar, salmon oil, a probiotic, and Dr. Pritcairn's "Healthy Powder" (nutritional yeast, lecithin granules, kelp powder, bone meal and vitamin C).  Given that the biggest change was the food, I'm giving most of the credit to Sojos, although I do believe the supplements are helping.  Here are the changes I've noticed:<br /><br />1. Minimal evidence of allergies.  Teddy has been highly allergic to pollens since he was tested at 18 months old.  I now believe he's also been allergic to some grains.  He has been on extremely expensive allergy pills and shots for years, which I've been able to discontinue with no trouble.  He has also been highly susceptible to nasty hot spots in the last few years (three occurrences in the last 8 months alone) and regularly had eye and ear infections.  He would also lick and chew his paws like crazy every day, to the point of tearing his paw pads.  I haven't seen him lick his paws for two weeks, the fur between the paw pads are no longer stained with saliva, and his ears are a nice flesh color (instead of their usual bright pink color).  I am so happy to see him comfortable, for once!<br /><br />2. Awesome weight loss.  In July he was 87 lbs (typical weight for him), but today (October 1st) he weighed 73 lbs (!!!!) when I took him to the groomer.  His highest weight was over 90 lbs.<br /><br />3. Increased energy and mobility. He has started acting more like a puppy again--zipping around the backyard like he's chasing some imaginary animal. :-  He was diagnosed with arthritis in one of his front elbows last December and has been on strong pain meds (he couldn't tolerate the NSAIDs).  I've dropped his pain meds to half the original dose and he's hopping up into our SUV with ease.<br /><br />4.  Fewer eye "goobers" and cleaner teeth.<br /><br />5.  Improved digestion and elimination.  No more rumbling stomach or stinky bombs.  Virtually no pee burn-stains on the lawn.  His poops are half the size, firm instead of runny, and have 80% less smell.  What's not to like about that?! LOL<br /><br />I love the convenience of the Sojos Complete and plan to try the beef flavor soon.  I've been very reluctant to try any variation of a raw diet for Teddy because I'm a vegetarian, so I *really* appreciate not having to prepare raw meat!  Although I initially purchased Sojos from Amazon, I have found it $18 cheaper per bag elsewhere.  It's not cheap to feed a large dog, but I am saving so much money in reduced vet visits and other medications (not to mention a happy, healthy dog), that the extra cost is well worth it!  Teddy eats his food with gusto, instead of begrudgingly.  I love my "new" happy, healthy dog!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/14/12: Teddy (who just turned 10) is now down to a healthy 61 lbs and is still doing very well.  He did have another small hot spot on his tail two months ago, but otherwise his allergies are still well under control, he has tons of energy, and we're thrilled with the weight loss.  I've used the beef flavor on occasion to mix things up, but Teddy's preference seems to be for the turkey.  I do hope Sojos will continue to come out with new varieties of the complete mixes.

I had wanted to feed a raw diet for some time, but couldn't commit to work involved... my "kids" were on natural balance and loved it until the manufacturer changed the formula, then they wouldn't touch it! that was when i did some research and found sojo's complete... they immediately took to it and can NOT wait to eat.  I make mine in daily batches since they only eat 1/4 cup twice a day...but it is so quick and so convenient... it literally takes a minute to measure, add water and seal up in a tupperware and refrigerate.  they are so much healthier and have a ton more energy.  I could not be a happier customer!

review/summary: Sojos has to be the best smelling dog food ever.
review/text: This food is awesome.  I have 3 chihuahuas and 2 are fed Sojos complete and one is a puppy who is moving over to it this week.  I can't say enough about this food.  First of all, it has a "born on" date right on the bag, easy to see.  I have never bought a bag that was more than a month old and when I ordered from Amazon my bag was literally only 1 week old from production.  (I was a little worried about that).  The food smells like chicken pot pie and sort of looks like it too.  My dogs are ridiculously picky to the point of my littlest chi being underweight.  I think it was a combination of them waiting for the kids to give them scraps and then they wouldn't touch their food.  I have tried several different brands and cost was irrelevant to me (due to their size, they don't eat much so it isn't a factor).  I tried one that was a dehydrated raw and it smelled like organs so bad, that I would gag when I put it out.  Fortunately for me, the dogs had about the same reaction.  They have taken to this food really well and I have noticed that they shed less and have a ton of energy.  Poops are fine and truly not as smelly either.  My older chi was getting a little chunky and he has slimmed down with this as well as I think being grain free, they are only getting necessary nutrients and not filler.  I like that you can actually recognize what the food is versus the pureed type of foods.  I truly see no need to look further.  I believe in the raw diet but know that there is no way I'm going to be feeding my dogs all those organs, meat, bones etc.  I have a hard enough time making dinners for my family.  LOL  I also mix up a couple of days worth in a twist lock container and just pour it in the bowl.  Easy as pie.  I highly recommend this food.

review/summary: A Fair Test with 3 Dogs - warning graphic poop talk
review/text: After transitioning from Natural Balance Duck and Potato, we've gone through several bags of Sojo's Turkey over the course of several months, so I feel I can write a fair review.<br /><br />Our dogs are small poodle mixes, rescue dogs, weighing 10 lb., 10 lb. and 7 lb. We follow the Sojo instructions mixing water to food in the recommended 2:1 ratio. We feed twice a day. I've spoken to customer service a few times with questions and they've been super nice, although they didn't always have helpful answers.<br /><br />Impressions: The food smells great (even to me!) and the dogs go bonkers for it. They love every bite.<br />Sojo's has variable consistency - some bags were a powdery consistency - creating a mush when mixed with water. These are the best bags - everything becomes part of the thick mush.<br />Other bags have big chopped pieces of veggies/meat - these are not my favorite bags. The added water hydrates the pieces and then creates a ton of watery gravy - too much fluid to feed the dogs.<br /><br />After a month our dogs each lost a pound of body weight. They had no body fat to lose so it was a bit distressing. They warn that fat/weight will come off a dog after switching to Sojo's and then an appropriate amount of weight will be gained back. Our dogs never gained it back. I was feeding the amount recommended for dogs up to 12 lbs (which should be more than enough food for our pups).<br /><br />Despite this, for an hour or two before each meal time all three pups were clearly in distress - shaking, quivering, starving. This went on for many weeks before I decided there is something lacking in this food. (I didn't know if this was excitement for the yummy food or actual weakness/lack of energy, so I gave it some time.) I even tried feeding more than the 12 lb. dog amount - enough to supposedly sustain a much bigger dog - and still they were quivering and weak (and our dog food budget was taking a big hit).<br /><br />I have slowly transitioned them back to a mix of Sojo's and Natural Balance (ratio of 2:1). Now our pups are happy again, they aren't shaking and panicked at meal time.<br /><br />The claim that dogs will have better teeth and better breath... Sojo's breath does seem a bit nicer (due to the parsley I assume) but their teeth were not cleaner. I imagine a professional cleaning plus feeding Sojo's exclusively might result in teeth staying cleaner. Feeding this food doesn't change the current cleanliness of their teeth (though their customer service rep tried to spin it this way).<br /><br />Sojo's has high water content so our dogs urinated constantly. That's a good thing for their kidneys, but a bad thing for our little guy who can't hold his pee. He had a million accidents while on Sojo's.<br /><br />Sojo's has high fiber content so our dogs became poop machines. Non-stop poop makers. This is good for their anal glands, but it really gave me and our septic system a run for its money (we dispose of their feces in the toilet). Tell-tale was the comment by our groomer when we picked up our little 7 pounder: "He did a human size poop. How did he have all that in him?" Exactly. That's Sojo's.<br /><br />And the worst, most telling, example that Sojo's didn't provide adequate nutrition... About 4 hours after eating, our little guy would go out to the dog yard and chew on old Sojo's poop. There are visible bits of undigested veggies in Sojo's poop and he would pick them apart and eat them. He was starving. Now that Natural Balance is mixed into his meals he no longer eats poop. He's happy and content. [Only on an all-Sojo's diet did he have this pica behavior. The veggie bits are still in the feces, but he has no interest and no need to eat them. Another spin from customer service: "The dogs love Sojo's so much I've heard they will eat the poop." Now we know the pica behavior is driven by hunger, not passion.]<br /><br />I equate Sojo's to the old saying about eating Chinese food "two hours later, you're hungry".<br /><br />In any case, I think we're all very happy now with the mix of food. They have lots of yummy veggies, some turkey and the kibble that sustains them. I wish Sojo's was enough, but it's not. I'm glad to have found a solution without giving up Sojo's altogether. And so are our dogs.

review/summary: Amazing results
review/text: Had never heard of Sojos before, so I'm glad I happened to stumble across it because my otherwise healthy German Shepherd Dog (� 3 years) had been scratching, licking, sneezing and chewing incessantly for months.  By process of elimination we eventually deduced there was probably some sort of allergy involved.<br /><br />I adopted Jake about six months ago and fed a super-premium breed-specific kibble, which was always accepted and seemingly enjoyed.  But the label showed nearly one hundred ingredients, and now I wanted to eliminate as many possible allergens as possible at once, in hope of identifying what Jake was allergic to.  That led me to a neighborhood raw pet food store (which I'd frankly always kind of snickered at) and by chance I grabbed a bag of Sojos Complete.<br /><br />I've had similar results as other reviewers.  The itching/scratching stopped almost immediately, for the first time in months. Jake had plenty of energy before, but now he actually seems supercharged, almost like he's on speed.  His coat is noticeably softer.<br /><br />This stuff looks bizarre at first, unlike any kibble or canned food you've seen.  Kind of like a soupy salad stew.  But it actually smells really (I mean *really*) good, and I half-joke that my dog is eating better than I am.  Jake woolfs Sojos down, and his poos are consistently normal -- not even a problem when I switched to this food cold turkey (no pun).<br /><br />I'm generally pretty jaded, but I think this stuff is really awesome.

review/summary: Absolutely the best dog food for nutrition and convenience
review/text: I began feeding this to my husband's border collie when we did a 5 day back-country hiking trip last year.  We needed something lighter, and more nutritous than kibble.  She absolutely loved the food.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, we began feeding it to our ancient 16-year-old border collie.  About a month after being on the Sojos complete, there were fewer clouds in his eyes, his coat was softer than it had ever been, and, unbelievably, he seemed to have less than half the dementia type episodes he had been experiencing.  He also slept better at night.<br /><br />Up until I fed Sojos, I had been feeding a very high quality organic kibble topped with homemade dog food (cooked chicken, turkey, hamburg, and loads of veggies).  The Sojos made an incredible difference - mostly for the old dog.  He lived to be 2-weeks shy of his 17th bday.<br /><br />With 4 active young dogs in the house at the moment, I use Sojos as a topper unless a dog has allergies.

review/text: I have used other Sojos premixes and decided to try this one as it already has the protein in it.  This would save me time from cooking eggs or preparing other proteins.  My dogs took to it right away and love it.<br /><br />I make a 3 day batch and keep it in the fridge and I usually put it over some rice and make it like a stew.  Adding rice can also help keep the cost down and stretch it a little as it can get expensive if feeding to multiple dogs like I do.

review/summary: I love this food!
review/text: I originally used this when I switched my first dog, Peanut, to home made fresh raw. He loved it and he thrived,then, when I started working, I didn't have time for all the cutting, pulverizing, supplementing, and storing that fresh raw required, I switch him to Taste of the Wild. I just adopted a neglected Mini Dachshund, Chip, who had a horrible skin infection, dry flaky skin, and dull coat. He had been fed exclusively human scraps, like pizza or chicken nuggets, or bologna. He refused to switch to a healthy dry. So... Im going back to Sojos! It is only a fraction more expnsive per meal than the dry foods I feed, due to smaller required portions, AND i dont have to buy endless cans of stinky canned food just to get Chip to eat, wasting A lot of dry kibble because he would lick the canned off each kibble and hide it! He dug right in to this, and for the convenience and nutrition, I am willing to stay!

Strangely, the dog who eats everything didn't like it (the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars), but the 10 year old shepherd LOVES it. He has never particularly liked any food we've tried and has always been underweight. We've tried adding all sorts of things to his diet to get him to eat without much success. He now looks forward to meals and cleans his bowl every time. He has been on this food for 3 weeks now and looks very healthy and happy. The food is easy to prepare and takes up very little space.

review/summary: Is SOJOS over rated?
review/text: We have two really neat creatures living with us and most people refer to them as dogs.  We, of course, want what is best for them and so we have been using SOJOS as part of the diet for them.<br /><br />In checking the internet, I came across a site which was an independent organization which thoroughly tested and evaluated a whole litany of pet foods.  To my surprise, this site rated SOJOS at a 3.5 rating out of a possible 5.  The kibble which we had been feeding, and continue to mix with the SOJOS is rated at a 4.0 rating.  Although our two creatures like the taste and/or smell of the SOJOS, we are trying to determine if we want to continue to feed them the SOJOS.  We want to get the most bang for our buck and are not certain if this gives us that.<br /><br />What really caught my eye and makes me wonder if we are getting the most bang is wording on the AMAZON site.  The larger bag of the Complete with turkey is listed at 8 pounds.  Yet, in the description, it says "Shipping weight 7.8 pounds.  Which is correct?  Are we actually getting 8 pounds of product or 7.8 pounds?<br /><br />We want what is best for our beloved creatures, but lately there has been a rash of new products and everyone is claiming that theirs is best for our four legged friends so one is going to have to rely on independent testers to assist us in making a prudent decision.  At this point, I do not feel that a 3.5 out of 5 really cuts it as top shelve.

review/text: I had always fed my 3 year-old german pinscher grain free kibble. Even after switching to other highly rated grain free kibbles, and he had always had a weird skin condition - it was oily but dry at the same time, and he always had a lot of dandruff. Earlier this year, I noticed he was beginning to lose fur. After inspecting his coat closer I saw he was developing a rash under his coat where he was losing fur.<br /><br />I switched to Sojos Turkey Complete and noticed a dramatic improvement on his skin condition in FIVE DAYS. My boyfriend even noticed. His fur is coming back and is looking so much better now. He also doesn't smell as much as he used to.<br /><br />After three weeks his fur has been mostly restored. He's happier, and I'm happier. Thanks Sojos.

review/text: I have a 20 month old German Shepherd who has LOTS of allergy problems--I need to feed him a Turkey and Veg mix and have been either making it myself or purchasing a raw mix already prepared.  A friend told me about Sojo's so I bought an 8lb bag to try.  It mixes great with the water, looks appetizing, smells good and most important, the dogs LOVE it.  Their stools were great (and I did not wean onto it)and it seems to satisfy them.  My only issue is knowing the portion of water to food---and I need to know how much of it equals one lb.  The feeding guidelines are in cups--recommended amounts.  I feed by weight.  I thought i had it figured right but i used way too much water so I need to decrease that for the next time I mix it up.  Otherwise, loved it.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I have tried every type of premium dog food on the market. Literally, but my dogs didn't like any of them. I've  been to the holistic vet for suggestions for food, we tried mixing dry/wet we tried homemade dog food, we have tried everything - all with limited success. The only food we can consistently give them that they are excited to eat, from their bowls is fresh vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, carrots, etc that the holistic vet suggested we supplement their diet. My dogs have been successfully eating Sojos for the longest period and the health benefits are AMAZING!<br /><br />I have a schnauzer poodle mix who is now almost two years old. In her short life we've visited the vet over 20 times because she has eye problems. She had entropion eyelid surgery because her eyelids rolled in and her eyelashes would scratch her eye (can you imagine living with the feeling that you constantly had hair/eyelashes stuck in your eye?) Then, when visiting the doggy eye-doctor we discovered our sweet girl was not producing ANY tears in one eye and close to none in the other eye. We had to put her on strong eye drops for the rest of her life that would help to make her tear glands produce tears. In addition we were putting in an eye gel to simulate tears in her eyes and moisten her eye ball. I hated giving her the eye drops because of the side effects: when she would smell human food (never dog food) she would salivate and it would drip from her mouth. So I stopped giving the eye drops and started using the eye gel more.<br /><br />I never considered that her diet and her dry-eye would be related but after I stopped the eye drops we tried Sojos because the girls literally wouldn't eat their very expensive food we had been purchasing. Amazingly, they ate it every time. Over the next four weeks we noticed that we had to put less and less eye gel into her eyes because her eye did not need them. Her eyes looked healthy and were moist. We took her back to the doggy eye doctor and their test confirmed what we had seen - her eye had started to produce tears by themselves.<br /><br />I should not be surprised as I suffer from severe allergies know the effects that allergies can have on my body. In taking away the grain and feeding my dogs Sojos, my sweet dog's allergies have subsided and her eye has improved. I am so grateful she is feeling better and enjoying the food she is eating. I do believe it was a grain that she was allergic to, I don't think the meat in Sojos made the difference. It is very possible that another grain-free food would have produced the same benefits. I am not going to test this theory as I have been waiting for years to find a successful food for my dogs. I do shout the benefits of going grain-free. If you are trying a different food or trying to decide to make the change, I think it is worth the money to see if it will benefit your dog. I wasn't expecting it would make the difference that it did and I ECSTATIC about it! I highly recommend going grain-free and think that Sojos is a great option.

review/text: Sadly for me and the time i spend cooking ground turkey for my little darlings, they really didn't like the Sojos complete food. They love the add meat variety (LOVE LOVE LOVE) but this- they ate when they were starving, but otherwise ignored. I wish they loved it it would be so much easier! They are little yorkies - perhaps it's a breed thing.

review/summary: No more "stinkies"
review/text: I initially ordered Sojos Complete Dog Food Mix to eliminate our French Bulldog puppy Boogie's "stinkies". Post research my boyfriend read that raw diet is the solution to "stinkies". Sojos Complete Dog Food Mix is all natural, convenient and smells flavorful. Sojos Complete Dog Food Mix is fresh and usually born within the same month of purchase. I regret the lack of transition from Solid Gold Just A Wee Bit to Sojos Complete Dog Food Mix for my two year old Dachshund Frankie. Frankie ate Sojos Complete Dog Food Mix for a couple of days and then completely stopped. I currently purchase Solid Gold Just A Wee Bit for Frankie. Boogie's "stinkies" are eliminated.

review/summary: Best Herbal Tea Ever
review/text: I have been drinking Celestial Seasonings herbal teas for as long as I can remember, and I have always found them to be pleasantly flavored.  A few years ago, my supermarket had the Gingerbread Spice flavor on the shelf in November - I had never heard of it, but it looked good (who can resist a tea with cookies on the box?), so I tried it.  I LOVED it.  Pleasantly flavored would have been a vast understatement - this tea is DELICIOUS.  And it smells wonderful.<br /><br />It takes me quite a while to consume 20 tea bags, so some time passed before I was ready to restock.  Much to my dismay, the supermarket only carries this flavor during November and December!  I had to wait until the holiday season to get it again.<br /><br />Imagine my joy at discovering that Amazon now offers Gingerbread Spice all year round!  What a happy surprise!  Now I can drink my favorite tea whenever I want it.<br /><br />I enjoy Gingerbread Spice with milk, but find that it is quite sweet enough without adding any additional sugar.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys herbal tea.

review/summary: Good Tasting Sugar Free Dip/Topping - Recommended
review/text: The Walden Farms Chocolate Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this "Chocolate" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles chocolate by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.<br /><br />I like the flavor and use it to augment fruits and other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with strawberries and with peanut butter.<br /><br />Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really chocolate.

review/text: Honestly this is not bad for there being zero calories, no fat, no sugar or carbs.  It does taste a little chemically but it is good with strawberries.  When I am craving chocolate, it definitely handles my cravings.  There is a lot of mixed reviews, so I think it comes down to personal preference and taste.  If your expecting it to taste like hersey's chocolate don't buy it. I think it's a great product for those of us who are dieting and cutting calories, sugars, and carbs.  My kids actually like it too, which should something in itself.

review/text: I had been looking for a low carb chocolate sauce for dipping fruit but was under no illusion that a no calorie chocolate sauce would be as good as a homemade ganache. I decided to keep an open mind.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't. This was the most disgusting stuff known to mankind. It actually took me back to high school chemistry lab when we created the fake banana scent out of something that smelled like sweaty feet and baby vomit (butyric acid). The previous reviewer mentioned a chemical taste and this is it. It tastes like it was manufactured in a lab, which it very likely is.<br /><br />Next time I will take the time, chocolate, stevia and cream and make my own. At least I know what I am eating and it will really taste like chocolate.

review/summary: Not quite your typical full flavored chocolate, but great for cravings
review/text: I have to watch my sugar (PCOS and insulin resistance), and I have a bad sweet tooth. I read bad reviews of this product, so I had to write my own. I just tried it frozen on strawberries and thought it was wonderful.. No aftertaste, not too strong (sadly), but a great way to treat myself to something that tastes sinful. I did not try this by itself, and I dipped half bananas in it and placed them on corn on the cob holders and put them in the freezer to try later, so I can't wait to see how they turned out.. But if you have to limit sugar or are cutting calories this is great. I can't imagine the bad reviews because I wouldn't dare drink a diet coke (I got used to coke zero and diet dr pepper, but REFUSE diet coke because it tastes like poison to me). So give it a shot on strawberries at least, and hopefully it will be great on other things, too. :)

review/summary: Nasty chemical aftertaste
review/text: I wasn't expecting much from a calorie-free "chocolate" dip. I figured it would taste mostly like artificial sweetener, and so I didn't plan to eat it straight. I sliced up a banana, put a tablespoonful or so of the dip on it, and then topped with with some fat-free whipped topping--so there were two things I *really* like in the bowl with the dip.<br /><br />I still couldn't finish it. I'm a diabetic, so I have to watch the amount of sweets I eat; I have a real sweet tooth, so I'm *used* to the flavour of artificial sweeteners and "fake" foods. (People, I think Fat Free Cool Whip is *good stuff*. We're talking "not a gourmet," here. Definitely not a food snob. But I thought that this was NASTY.<br /><br />Why two stars? Because my housemate *loved* it. He's happily spooning it onto oatmeal, fruit, graham crackers... he may be putting it on his hamburgers, for all I know. :) And if someone else thought it was *that* good, I can't give it one star, even if I personally loathe it.

review/text: This product is delicious!  I bought it to make my own hemp milk with, but it's also good to eat straight out of the bag with a spoon.  The options for how you can use this product are limitless.  It's really hard to believe something so natural and delicious is illegal to grow in this country.

review/summary: Hemp Hearts
review/text: I love my hemp hearts. I had a difficult time the first three weeks getting my body accustomed to them. The hearts had an opposite effect on me than other customers about whom I have read.  I now eat them daily and find I have more energy, plus, the overall effect seems to be positive.

review/text: Great product.  Helps tremendously in athletics.  I notice I have more energy and can play harder for longer durations when eating hemp seeds regularly.  They also fill me up so that I don't need to eat a big meal for lunch if I've had them for breakfast.  I typically cut up half a banana, take 2 Tbsp of raw, unpasteurized yogurt and 3 - 4 Tbsp of hemp seed and mix together.  Homemade banana yogurt with hemp seeds....great breakfast.

review/summary: I must have received a bad batch
review/text: I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again.

review/summary: Great Expectations not Realized
review/text: I had great expectations when I purchased these hemp hearts as someone at our local health food store was very enthusiastic about its ability to cut appetite and thus worked for weight loss and control  I found it pleasent to eat, tastes fine and texture is appealing although the seeds get caught in my teeth and under my gums so I need to brush, rinse and floss quickly after eating it.  I was surprise to read the fat content at 45 percent so I am only eating it with breakfast.  I don't think this is any miracle food supplement and probably will not buy again unless something changes with my experience.  I've used it for a month now with no noteable impact.

review/summary: Good Milk Subsitiute
review/text: Plenty of time to use before exp. date.(close to a year give or take) The flavor is very mild and won't throw off the taste of your recipe's.<br /><br /> I usually keep it in the freezer to keep it fresh. Follow storage insturctions on package. It will start to get an strong flavor as it starts to go bad. (just like flax or any other perishable food) I noticed that once when leaving some in the frige too long. (a couple of months)<br /><br />Mostly I use it for a subsitiute for milk. Just add water and/or other ingredients and blend. Great for drinking, cooking, and making "milk shakes". Or you could just use it as a sprinkle on your salads.

review/text: Hello,  I started to eat a little healthier, so I have to buy hemp seeds.  I am a Nutiva's consumer for 2 years now (coconut oil), so I know their product quality, and I wouldn't buy any other brand than Nutiva. I used few times a day: in my morning protein shake, with plain yogurt and in my strawberry smoothie. I need to loose weight, but I am not in a diet yet, but I lost 7LBS in 2.5 weeks. Like I said, I am not in a diet. I am not exercising, so I believe is the hemp seeds.<br /><br />For those of you who are trying to loose weight, I highly recommend you to buy the Hood� Calorie Countdown Fat Free Dairy Beverage. It only has 35 calories x serving, and  it has all vitamins and everything else than milk.  Google it.

My use of this food is too numerous to mention it all. You could try it on your salad , baking bread or pastries, as snack in a bowl of nuts, raisins,dried cranberries or whatever else that you might like. This food is so delicious that you could use it by itself and be happy with your choice. I recommend for people who do not know this food to give it a try.

review/summary: Bad taste and burn
review/text: I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.  Poor taste, plus a horrible burn all the way down my throat.  I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise.  Unfortunately I did not keep the packaging, since I had immediately transferred the seeds to glass containers to prepare for freezing.  These seeds are going in the compost bin (hope it doesn't burn the worms!)

review/text: I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh.

review/text: I ordered this product based on good reviews like 2 months ago and i really loved it and I ordered another 3 pound bag a month later, the second bag was just not right, I thought i must be a bad batch or something because it had more green shells in it and the seeds looked more brownish, it had this bitter burning taste. I called amazon and they said they would send me another ( i really did not wanna give up on it so i wanted to try another), same thing. I called again and they said they would send me another just to make sure that it was not a fluke. I got the bag 2 days ago and the same thing :(  finally i gave up on it. I will look in to another brand. I am really curious if other people are having the same issue..

review/summary: Maybe not for everyone
review/text: I put a heaping teaspoon of this product on my usual cereal (Nature's Path Heritage) and skim milk -- got really bad diarrhea for the next two days.<br /><br />I also tried the Nutiva's chocolate HempShake and I loved the taste of that -- I added about 8 oz of skim milk.  Seemed agreeable for two days, then on the third day the combination gave me several hours of rotten-egg flatulence like I have never experienced in my life.  Again, I had skim milk and hemp together in combination.<br /><br />Too early to say it's the hemp, might be the combination -- maybe hemp creates a digestive environment where the milk is indigestible. Usually I can eat just about anything so I was very surprised.  I'll give it another try someday...<br /><br />If anyone has any insight, please feel free to comment.

review/text: This product sounded so great. I started taking about two to four tbls. a day. After a week my lips started swelling, then the inside of my mouth started feeling strange and my tongue was very sensitive, then I started having what I thought was heartburn (which i never get) I would feel pressure in my thoart all the way down to my Solar plexis, By the end of the second week it became so intense I knew something was wrong with me, I just didn't know what. I thought "I"m having an allergic reaction"(I'm not allergic to anything) so it took me awhile to catch on, the only new thing I added to my diet was the hemp hearts. I quite taking them, in one day  I started feeling better, by two days, started feeling normal again.<br />So just be careful, people can have an allergic reaction to this.

review/summary: Wound up at the ER
review/text: I won't go all the way to 1-star since this is probably more about me and not the foodstuff but, despite the claim that hemp seeds are not known to contain allergens, I did experience *some kind* of reaction to 4 tbsp of this stuff this past Monday, about 4 hours after ingesting it. I passed out, was shaking uncontrollably when I came to, felt tingling followed by a loss of sensation, nausea, pain, and shortness of breath. I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did.

Just a question that should be raised since companies are in the habit of caring about their bottom lines over our bodies.

review/text: I really enjoy the hemp hearts. I have come to crave them. I am always looking for a good deal and this is indeed a great price for the qty. These come to abt 3 to 5 dollars less per lb. than what I can get locally. If I use auto ship it is 5 to 7 dollars less. My only complaint is the hulls of the 3 brands I have tried this has by far the most hulls and the only one with intact seeds. I doesn't take much to de-hull them but, it is time consuming. I realize "hulls are a good source of fiber" but, my teeth do not agree. I am tempted to pay a little more for less. If this is something that doesn't bother you I urge you to get it.

review/text: Sometimes health discoveries, (wonders), are simply amazing.  Hemp seeds are helping me turn my health around because I'm nurturing my cells.  How I know is because I don't crave or binge on junk food and sugars like before, as well as "diet" products, and I no longer feel like I'm starving. This became forefront to looking for real food, other nutrition<br />"secrets" and, basically, gave me motivation to come out of a slump I was<br />in while not looking after my health like I should have been.  A good friend threw me this life-line which I gladly pass on.  Amazon.com had the best price with the free shipping so I'm sticking with good people, and powerful nutrition.  My overall health is only getting better day by day, and a good outlook itself becomes good medicine.  Do the research, you'll be amazed.  Lucky you for discovering hemp seeds.  A. prouty

Here comes amazon with the great auto-ship feature which keeps our stock perfectly replenished each 6 months. The seeds come fresh and tasty. I love them, my 7 year old daughter loves them too, we take several teaspoons straight every day, I wouldn't want to loose any tossed over the salad. Taste is better than hemp oil. Perfect protein and EFA source without sacrifice to the taste!

review/summary: Essential!
review/text: We have been eating hempseeds for sometime - they are an essential part of our diet.  I genuinely notice a difference physically when I eat them along.  This is a good price and we have gotten good quality from Amazon.  PLEASE SHARE SOME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!<br /><br />We must work together to make this available to the USA INCLUDING the farmers.  We live under an oppressive, authoritarian regime which, only a few years ago, would have attacked you for eating what is literally "birdseed".  Wild!<br /><br />2nd Review w/Suspcription Purchase Method<br />We have been delighted to have hemp seed finally taken off Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (along with heroin, etc.).  I know that is insane to even write this but that is the nature of the degenerate and immoral drug policy barons from the DEA and ONDCP - to twist reality and prohibit what are supposed to be free American citizens from obtaining some of the best food known to mankind beause their pseudo fear of people smoking flowers(and then engaging in violence against these same peaceful, free human beings).  NUTS indeed!!<br /><br />In any event, we have started using the suscription method.  This is a great price compared to anywhere else that I have found.  It actually takes 4 mos for us to go through 5 lbs.  Therefore, I signed up for 2 mos and simply skip one.  I will give very great KUDOS to Amazon for how they have set this up - at least for this product, both the product and the system work great!<br /><br />Greg Logan

review/summary: Inconsistent at best - too many hulls
review/text: I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component.<br />I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound  bags I can get at the store.<br />My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of them<br />And they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating.<br />I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging.<br />I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments.<br />Grrrrr....

review/summary: Succulent
review/text: Like most good things (unpasteurized dairy, unpasteurized almonds, medical advice not sponsored by drug companies, gold and silver coin as tender in payment of debt, a government that follows the Constitution etc), hemp seeds are almost illegal and hard to get.  Thank God for Amazon!  These are the best hemp seeds you are going to get, short of growing your own, which, as we all know, would be illegal in the land of the free.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: This is a great product, very tasty and at the same time having all kinds of good natural nutrients. I buy it on "Subscribe and Save" program, getting 5 lb. every six months and enjoying sizeable discounts. It makes up a part of my regular lunch consisting of an apple, a banana, and a mixture of sunflower, pumpkin, and hemp seeds (1/4 of cup each). The apple a day definitely keeps a doctor away (to my delight), and the seeds provide a close to perfect combination of "right" protein and fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds also keep my prostate healthy, which is important in my age. Hemp seeds give the mixture the additional taste and flavor.

review/text: We love the taste & texture of these seeds.  I put several tablespoons in our salads & my husband has started scraping out his salad bowl with a spoon!  Perhaps the people who did not care for this product are simply not used to the somewhat different taste of raw nuts & seeds, compared to roasted?

review/text: Nutiva organic hempseeds are great in my morning smoothies along with flax, chia seeds, almond milk, Boku superfood, rice powder, fruits.  Delicious/nutritious way to start the day....and sustaining energy!  Years ago, i started buying hempseeds by one pound amounts from a bulk section and realized the air exposure may not be good to the product, so i found these 3# bags online....i get them auto-shipped and can be sure i never run out.  They arrive fresh every time....in addition, this is helping support the Hemp industry in general....by buying food, clothing, personal care products made from Hemp, we are voting!

review/summary: Nutiva hempseed is delicious
review/text: I throw this hempseed on salad, cereal or just eat is straight. It is wonderful and Nutiva's service is excellent. I'd recommend getting a 5 pound bag and use it everyday. You can always freeze part of it if you don't go through it that fast. We invite a lot a company for dinner. I throw the seed on salads. It is very attractive as well as tasty and it draws attention. People love it.

review/summary: Nutritional delight
review/text: I've purchased Nutiva hemp seed many times over the last year, and so far it has been delivered fresh and good tasting. Be aware that it turns rancid quickly and needs refrigeration. I use it to make hemp seed milk. I find this to be the most efficent and effective use of the product. I blend 1 cup of hemp seed, 3 cups of distilled  water, a small amount of kelp powder, and 3 pitted medjool dates, that have been soaked overnight, in my Blendtec blender. I then strain it through a nut milk bag. The blending is so complete that the only thing left in the bag are a few hard shells left over from Nutiva's mechanical processing and small amount of fiber. The Nutiva processing is pure mechanical and kept under 104 degrees F. They then store it under 40 degrees F. The plastic shipping bag is vacuum sealed. Hemp seed is a nutritionally complete food. It has all of the essential amino and fatty acids. 3 tbsp. supply 11g of protein. In order to keep it fresh I store it in a plastic tub in my freezer.

review/summary: New to eating hempseeds
review/text: After reading about all the health benefits of hempseeds, I went ahead and bought this 5-pound bag of them even though I've never eaten them before (coming from an islander culture, I was always taught to learn about and respect the healing qualities of various foods). Another reviewer here said that these hempseeds taste like raw pine nuts, and I would agree with that. Nutiva's hempseeds are delicious; they taste fresh, and I love their texture: they're soft like pine nuts, small like quinoa or couscous, and mild in flavour with a tiny bit of sweetness. As I type this review, I'm eating them with a spoon; it's good to eat even by itself. I'm very glad I got the 5-pound bag (with repeat delivery every three months), because I will happily incorporate hempseeds into my daily eating habits. I want to pour this over all my meals now; I may finish this big bag before month's end. If you're even a little bit curious if hempseeds are right for you, I'd recommend getting some and trying them out -- you may discover another superfood that you actually like. If not, then at least you had the experience of tasting something different.

review/summary: smell rancid
review/text: has anyone else noticed a rancid smell with these? they are also slightly green in color (the white parts are white, but the black shells also have a green counterpart.) I don't know if this is normal. I keep a small amount in the fridge for several weeks use, in a mason jar, the rest in the freezer. I usually mix them in smoothies, and didn't try them alone until just now for the purpose of this review. The taste is nutty, I don't detect any rancid taste... just the smell that makes me inclined to stop using them. I read that hemp seeds go rancid like an hour after being hulled.
