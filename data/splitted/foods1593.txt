review/text: Have been using this for our vinaigrette and can really taste the difference. Sweet, but not as  stringent on the palette as most traditional balsamic. Really brings out the fresh flavors in raw veggies, pairs beautifully with good olive oil. Worth the extra $, good price with Amazon, too.

review/summary: Smooth with Honey Flavor
review/text: This Scotch was a mystery to me; I always thought that Johnnie Walker only came in colors. Turns out, they have this little quiet Scotch called Swing.<br /><br />Swing is a soft, delicate, smooth Scotch. There is a lot of honey flavor along with an incredible smoothness. This Scotch is very easy to drink. There is no smoky flavor at all.<br /><br />So where does it fit in the color scheme of things, someplace close to Gold. The price point is slightly more expensive than Gold. Where Red, Black, Double Black, and Green make a wonderful smoky progression, culminating with Blue, Swing stands almost alone. Its cousin is Gold, but Swing is much more refined and maybe a little bit sweeter.<br /><br />I love this Scotch, and I am a died in the wool smoke fan - Green is one of my favorite every day drinking Scotch. I really dislike Gold, it is too thick and the edges are too sharp and unfinished. Swing hits a very happy medium with those edges smoothed off. There are no really sharp flavors in this Scotch, just a lovely sweet honey flavor.<br /><br />From the Johnnie Walker website, Swing was supposed to be made for sailing ships, to take to the new worlds and sell. The shape of the bottle was supposed to keep it upright in a ship. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the bottle. The maritime story is nice, but I much prefer Johnnie Walker's square bottle. The sad thing, this looks like a Crown Royal or Pinch bottle, and frankly was the reason I'd never bought it before. Don't judge a book by its cover; the contents are far better than Crown Royal or Pinch.<br /><br />If you like smooth Scotch, this is a winner.

review/summary: Healthiest Chocolate Bar there is today.
review/text: I have always been a huge fan of Udo's Oil.  There's actual science behind the product, and it works great.  When I saw that they put a full tablespoon of Udo's Oil into a chocolate bar, naturally, I was intrigued.  I figured it had to not have tasted that great, but I pulled the trigger on a purchase anyway.  It was $3.69, I believe, at my local health food store.  I was absolutely delighted with the taste, quality, and the way that I feel after eating these bars.  These are truly the healthiest chocolate bars on the market today.<br /><br />In addition, the per bar price of $2.77 here on Amazon (with Free Prime Shipping) equals nearly $1 per bar less than my health food store, which is an amazing deal.  Yes, you have to buy 12 of them, but I have NO problem eating 12 of these bars, believe me!

review/text: This is not the same Knorr chicken noodle soup that I used to buy in the grocery store. Instead, the noodles in this soup are round and shaped like short pieces of spaghetti. The noodles are toasted, which gives them a texture identical to whole wheat noodles. The broth is somewhat tangy and if you like whole wheat noodles you will like this product, but if you don't, do not buy this product. I would have appreciated the inclusion of "toasted noodles" on the product description because I would not have purchased this product if I had this information.

Pour melted butter over top, sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Try it, I've gotten lots of compliments on this and it's simple and fast. If you really want to have more fruit, try adding a can of rasberries to the mix!

Takes but a few moments, to heat the syrup:  substitute white sugar ~ with honey or raw sugar, or stevia.  For a gluten-free alternative to pie filling, use potato starch inlieu of corn starch.  Fold in the canned berries (1/2 can and 1/2 fresh works too), cool momentarily, gently fold into a bottom pie shell.  Top with an all natural granola mix, sprinkle w/cinnamon {+brown sugar}.  Roll edges of pastry inward to make a large tart.  Bake 30 minutes at 400.  Travels well.

review/summary: Juice Plus+ Orchard and Garden Blend capsules
review/text: There is a lot of controversy surrounding this dietary supplement. The manufacturer claims that their product is the next best thing to eating fruits and vegetables, and that it picks its fruit and veggies at their peak ripeness, and then they use a proprietary process to reduce them to a powder containing much of the original vitamins and nutrients, while maintaining high bio-availability (which means that your body is able to use and take advantage of the nutrients instead of excreting most of it as waste).<br /><br />Many scientific studies, however, claim to disprove, or have produced conflicting results to, many of the manufacturer's claims about the product (see the "Product Research" section on Juice Plus' Wikipedia page: [...]. It doesn't help that the main product distribution process is through the use of multi-level marketing (aka pyramid scheme), and that many reviewers/commenters giving it 5 stars are also re-sellers of this product who always seem to want to send you to their personal website for more information about the product. FYI: I, personally, have not, do not, and do not plan to sell Juice Plus+.<br /><br />Before I knew any of this information, though, our Lamaze coach recommended it as a convenient way for my pregnant wife to make sure that the fetus (and my wife) would get as many vital nutrients as possible. Of course, nothing compares to eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but it's not always possible to eat as many as JuicePlus claims to contain.<br /><br />I have personally used Juice Plus off and on over the past couple years, and I've found that, when I take it regularly for a couple weeks (morning and night, not all 4 capsules at once), most of the tension in my neck and shoulders disappears, which is amazing. So, what's the main catch? At just over $160 for a 4-month supply (per person), it's not exactly a purchase you shrug off. Until I'm able to find something that is as natural, convenient, and doesn't have all kinds of crazy side-effects, though, I'm sticking with Juice Plus.<br /><br />EDIT - 09-13-2012: So I've taken a lot of heat (and have even been personally attacked in the comments) for referencing Wikipedia information from a couple years ago that indicated that JuicePlus distributors worked under a multi-level marketing arrangement, which functions similarly to a pyramid scheme, but is completely legal. The Wikipedia article has since been amended, and now states: "Juice Plus products are marketed by individual distributors who receive sales commissions ranging from 6% (for enrolling five customers in 30 days) to 14% (for enrolling twenty customers in 30 days)."<br /><br />I also made reference to the many studies that tout the benefits of this product, and that many of the claims in these studies are "disputed by consumer watchdog organizations and governmental agencies as misleading". If you read the comments attached to this review (and my other, almost identical, JuicePlus review), you'll see that these studies are defended in the comments here (most likely by JuicePlus distributors) with almost cult-like enthusiasm. However, here is an interesting tidbit from Wikipedia in regards to these myriad "independent" studies. Discuss: "Of the published peer-reviewed studies on Juice Plus products, the majority were funded and/or authored by the manufacturer, Natural Alternatives International (NAI) or the main distributor, NSA. two were funded by individual Juice Plus distributors; and one was conducted independently."<br /><br />My review above praises the product for reducing tension in my neck and shoulders, but I feel as if I'm paying too much for this benefit. Wikipedia backs this up, referencing studies by the University of Berkley, as well as the Center For Science In The Public Interest, stating "it contains too little fruit and vegetable powder to offer significant clinical benefits, its effects can be attributed to the inclusion of added exogenous vitamins and micronutrients, and it is excessively priced relative to its potential benefits."<br /><br />I mentioned that I had not yet been able to find an inexpensive alternative to JuicePlus that offered the same benefits without any negative effects. However, for the past few months, I've discontinued JuicePlus, and have instead tried a product called JuiceFestiv (available through Amazon, Costco, and other retailers), which is similar to JuicePlus in that it contains powdered fruits and veggies in separate capsules. I've determined that JuiceFestiv offers similar benefits to JuicePlus, but at about 1/2 to 1/4 the cost (I've found the best savings when purchased on sale at Costco). That's right, you can get a 2-month supply of JuiceFestiv for $20 compared to a 1-month supply of JuicePlus for $40.<br /><br />I feel that it's important to take care of your body - you only get one - and that carefully researching and trying different natural supplements is a wise investment of your time and money. In this case, MY OPINION (which is backed up by research) is that JuicePlus is overpriced for the benefits it offers. I encourage everyone to try both JuicePlus and JuiceFestiv for themselves; compare the benefits your body receives, and compare the cost per benefit. You may find differences - nobody's physiology is exactly the same - but it's our differences (even of opinion) that make the world go 'round, right? :)

I don't eat enough fresh fruit and vegetables (I wish I did) and Juice Plus is a great supplement.  I have noticed though, that when I'm taking Juice Plus I actually crave the real thing more.  That is another thing I like about it!  AND...there are no strange ingredients!

review/summary: geat product! beware of seller mark up
review/text: First and foremost I would suggest taking Juice Plus to anyone as I've always benefited from its health benefits over the past 15 years.<br /><br />My problem is with the seller Salk trading of KY. My reasoning is: Juice Plus always arrives in boxes with a 3 month supply in each box. Salk Trading advertised Juice Plus on Amazon for $49.99 would be a great deal for a 3 month supply as its usually $100. I purchased 2 orders for $99.98 thinking I would be getting a 6 month supply. Much to my dismay, a 2 month supply arrived for my $100 which is a 33% mark up on the regular price. Seems as if Salk Trading buys Juice Plus, repackages it in smaller quantities,  advertises at 50% off on Amazon, and then sells at a 33% mark up. Do not buy Juice Plus from Salk, its a rip off and seems unethical.

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: My advice is to get this stuff through a person who sells it - I get all 3 blends and it costs me $60 a month.  Conflicting research?  Not hardly.  The wikipedia site is very biased against Juice Plus - I know because I looked up all the studies.  Believe me, the research is there to support it being beneficial by doing things such as boosting the immune system and reducing oxidative stress - and these findings have all been duplicated in randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials - and ladies and gentlemen, you can't do much better than that.<br /><br />However if you just read the wikipedia site to get your info, know this, they slant things.  For instance, a study researching Juice Plus to determine if it reduces oxidative stress might have looked at 5 markers of oxidative stress.  Maybe the study found that 4 out of the 5 markers did show that Juice Plus reduced oxidative stress, but one didn't.  Of course the wikipedia take on this would be making a big deal about the one marker of oxidative stress that didn't show Juice Plus reduces oxidative stress - now how biased is that?

review/text: I learned about this seasoning when I was deployed with the UN in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  My landlord, Marko Dragicevic, was a master barbeque chef who was hired by many locals to grill chicken, veal, beef and lamb for their large wedding parties in Capljina and he always used Vegeta. He and his wife also surprised me with a small barbequed meal just for the three of us on one of my birthdays and he used Vegeta. Everything is tender and mouth-wateringly delicious when you season it with Vegeta before cooking it -- This seasoning is especially great with chicken.  My 7 year old son loves the chicken drumsticks we prepare for him that are seasoned with Vegeta and onions and garlic.

review/text: I just purchased this here, usually get it locally in any Euro-mart or middle-eastern store in the Denver area. But I love getting things delivered when it's cost effective.  I was born and raised in eastern Europe and in 1984 there was no vegeta to be found in Denver. It used to come in a tin can years ago.  Lots has changed since, I am happy to be able to buy it everywhere now. How could you possibly slow roast a duck or a turkey (or anything) without Vegeta?  How do you make a really wonderful chicken soup without it? I wouldn't know. This is my secret ingrediant in my green chili. So now that I have shared my secret with the Amazon world, I hope you lovely people try it. I will warn you, the original has MSG, so if you have problems with that order the NO MSG version.  It is widely available, and you should always see it right on the label. Have fun cooking and Happy Thanksgiving 2011!!!

review/summary: ok root beer
review/text: This is an OK drink to have in the fridge, high cute value but I was not overly impressed with the taste. I've never been to this restaurant chain, and perhaps it is better off the tap at these "Dog n Suds" restaurants or something. I doubt I'll buy this brand again unless I happen to have some other business in Indiana and occasion thereby to imbibe at such a franchise.<br /><br />Note this root beer is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, and contains sodium benzoate as a preservative. There is no  statements as to the herbs and spices in it, and none particularly standing out to me on the palate. It's mainly a strong vanilla taste, it's almost as much like a cream soda to me as a root beer, really. The mouth feel seems somewhat better and smoother than run of the mill brands like Mug or Hires, but I seriously question if it justifies this Amazon price which is over $2 per 12 oz. bottle presently.

review/summary: Honestly Good Root Beer.
review/text: Sipping this rootbeer takes me back to when I was in high school in the 90s.  My buddy worked for my Mom's business and after a long days work, we'd walk to the corner store.  At this gas station (that no-longer exists) we stumbled upon this surprisingly excellent root beer that came in a very big glass bottle at that time for $1 that blew all the other "normal" rootbeers away.<br /><br />Now moved far out of the midwest, imagine my surprise when I happen to come upon a couple bottles at a store.<br /><br />You might be able to find fancier rootbeer with more natural ingredients, sure.  But you won't find much that beats this one in flavor.  This root beer is much MUCH smoother than any of the big name brews.  The flavor has a great but not overwhelming complexity with a very subtle initial "bite", a tasty middle with herbal overtones that stack up to high-class brews, but a longer creamier finish than anything else I can recall.  Great straight with an Americana-type meal or with ice cream.

review/summary: OK, but bad packaging
review/text: The flavor is OK, once you get it all mixed together. But the spoon they give you is short and weak and the sachet the tuna is in is tough and deep. So it's difficult to extract the flat packed tuna and then difficult to mix it with the short weak bendy spoon. There has to be a much better way to do this. The cover on the individual packages is poorly attached too, so they aren't well sealed, though all the actual food items inside are very well secured. But I won't buy this again.

review/summary: Ridiculously blatant lies-there are no round puffs of CC
review/text: If you are buying this rather than some other bag of cotton candy, because you want CC "balls" like bunny tails for EASTER - DON'T! this is one rectangular chunk of CC, not to mention, there is no fluff about it.  It is a solid, compact piece with pale colors occasional in a bite but mostly it's all white.  Pull it apart in a chunk and you might get a stripe of a color in there somewhere but not always - its often just white.<br /><br />I accepted the title and the picture and bought it figuring I might have to reshape a bit but I would likely get slightly mishapen bunny tails in bright spring colors. None of it is true - including the FLUFFY part.<br /><br />Not Fluffy<br />No spring colors - a little bit of really faded pink and really pale blue<br />No balls - one thick compact chunk<br />No cotton tails in any regard, just a complete and utter LIE<br /><br />Tastes alright if you don't mind it not being fluffy, like cotton candy. I've bought bags of cotton candy before so I'm not naive, they are not as airy as a plastic tub but they are usually cotton candy like.

review/summary: Not like the old days
review/text: When I was growing up, every year just after Thanksgiving, our home would be filled with multitudes of boxes from the Swiss Colony. From cheese spreads, meat logs, candies, and most importantly, the petit's fours! I remember Swiss Colony Petit's Fours being much larger, tastier and not dry as stale cake that has been sitting around for months before shipping. I was very disappointed in the flavor and quality of these little cakes and they are not at all the quality I remember growing up. It has been about 14 years since I had anything from the Swiss Colony and I have to say, it will be the last time I order anything from them. There are so many companies out there now that make them bigger, better and fresher (I know, I picked up a box from a famous brand at a local mall kiosk) than what I had when I purchased these. Granted, the price was cheaper...but I guess I got what I paid for. Very disappointed Swiss Colony!

review/summary: Makes puppy gassy
review/text: We use the Wellness Core Grain Free Original Formula for our adult dog and I love the product. She has a healthy coat and has been a very healthy dog with no illness. It was automatic when we adopted a new puppy to stick with the same brand but we purchased the puppy formula. Our new pup became very gassy and her stomach was constantly gurgling after each meal. We figured it was just because it was new to her system and we would give it a few weeks. Our vet told us she should be adjusted to it in a couple of weeks as well. She loved the food so there wasn't a problem there but the gas was BAD, constant all day and night long. She could clear a room! After 4 weeks we gave up and started giving her the same formula we give our adult dog. The gas disappeared after the 2nd feeding. Not wanting to waste all the unused puppy food, I thought I'd see if our adult dog would eat it. She liked it but it gave her horrid gas as well and she has never had gas! So back to the original formula for her and about $30 of puppy food to waste.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's a bad product but if you decide to try it and the gas starts...good luck! :) It didn't agree whatsoever with our pup.

review/summary: Puppy Wellness Core
review/text: I spent HOURS researching dog food.  I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  (With all my research on how grais affect people, I thought this would be wise.) So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving (as they recommend a slow...one week...transition of the one food into the other food).  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the "other brand" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The "other brand" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of "other brand" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.

review/summary: Bag is half pound, Not one pound.  Poor taste
review/text: The bag I received contained 8 oz. of tea, not the advertised 16 oz.  This is the reason it now sells for $24 when it used to sell for $48.  The manufacturer's label on the bag said it held one pound, but the bag was not physically large enough to accommodate that much tea.  Amazon gave me the option to accept half of my money back, which I went for.<br /><br />I might also note that the glossy-finish bag appeared to have been well worn.  It looked like it had been reused many times.<br /><br />Regarding the stems that another reviewer mentioned, over the years I have purchased Pearl Jasmine from three other suppliers (Numi, TeaSpring, SeattleTeaCup.com).  All of them looked like this.  With Davidson's product I actually noticed much shorter stems attached to the leaves than with other Jasmine teas, and the leaves were larger.  I also noticed that the pearls are slightly smaller than what I have purchased from other suppliers.<br /><br />The aroma from the open bag was pleasant and similar to what I have experienced with other suppliers' products.  The taste is another matter.  I brewed a cup and found a bitter taste not observed with any of the other brands.  Tea from other suppliers has always offered a pleasant aroma and taste that makes Pearl Jasmine worth the extra cost.  These are sadly lacking in Davidson's product.  I do not recommend it.

Each time I reflected on how much better I liked them over canned beans (even when cooked unsalted) and the last batch of dried chick peas I bought in the store. The burlap bag is kind of cool and the beans are in a plastic bag inside of that. Out of four cups of measured uncooked beans, I only encountered two beans that did not cook up soft. I will buy these again.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: These are very good, high quality Garbanzo Beans. I purchased these Garbanzo Beans for making raw hummus with, and I was not disappointed. They are very large and very good. They don't have that "off" taste that some garbanzo beans have. They make the best raw hummus I have ever made. They arrived plastic bag, inside a nice burlap sack. The beans were very clean and I have yet to come across a bad bean.<br /><br />High quality bean, excellent taste. You can't beat the price, and 5 lbs. goes a very long way!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Fresh Garbanzo Beans
review/text: I was a little nervous about ordering beans online, but am I glad I did! I make a lot of chick pea stews and hummus and I am amazed by the quality, texture and taste of these beans. If you are tired of canned beans, get these from Palouse and cook them up yourself. You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: I never want to eat canned beans again!
review/text: WOW!  I don't think I've ever had a real fresh garbanzo before because I've never tasted one this good.  I've never worked with dry beans before but this was real easy.  Soak over night and boil for an hour.  Couldn't be easier.  And the taste of these is so amazing, I enjoyed eating them plain, in salads, cooked with a little chorizo, possibilities are endless.  Next I'm going to make hummus with them.  And they are on prime!!  (I LOVE prime!)  So I never have to be without them.  I can't believe I waited so long to try these.<br /><br />As far as the company goes, I had an issue with my whole shipment so I contacted them and they responded in minutes. (excellent customer service).  First I had to contact amazon and then them again if it couldn't be solved.(I know, rookie mistake, contact amazon first)  But of course amazon took care of it with out problem (also excellent customer service).  Things are going to happen and it's comforting to know that if I have an issue it gets taken care of so easily.  I will definitely be ordering these garbanzos and other products from this company through amazon again.  I hope you love them as much as I do!

review/summary: Excellence
review/text: I had been eating, and thoroughly enjoying, Bush brand canned garbanzos as a vegetarian low glycemic index source of protein.  Sometimes my store doesn't have them in stock so I decided to buy dry and cook them myself.  I must say I prefer this way because I have the option of adding salt ot not.  These garbanzos are delicious plain and I often eat them that way.  Especially when I'm just having a couple tablespoons to get me through a hungry patch during the day.  I also add them to my bowls of cooked vegetables, along with olive oil, sea salt, pepper, etc., and nutritional yeast flakes. The garbanzos really round out the meal by adding substance and staying power to the vegetables.  I always make hummus for company and although I haven't made it yet with these garbanzos I have no doubt whatsoever that the hummus will be even better made with fresh beans.  After ordering I received an email from the grower thanking me and providing a link to their website.  To me this was a nice touch and the website is useful.  I found cooking directions there and as someone who can no longer read print I very much appreciate it when I can find directions online.  If you follow their cooking directions you cook one cup of beans and you get 2.5 cups of cooked.  Now I can easily eat 2.5 cups within the three days that they should be used but for calorie control reasons I freeze half of the cooked beans so I can stretch out how many days a batch lasts.  I'm totally happy with these beans and grateful for Amazon as a way to buy quality food I could not otherwise obtain.

review/text: I had never used dried beans before so I was a little apprehensive about buying these, but it turns out they are super simple. I soak them over night in water. I then boil them with salt for about 90mins or until they are very soft. I use them to make hummus with. I use about two cups of cooked beans, 2-3tbs of tahini, 1/3 cup of olive oil, 2tbs of fresh lemon juice, and 3tbs of capers. I know that capers may sound weird but they really do add something. Everyone who eats this hummus loves it. There is also a recipe on Dr. OZ website for chickpea popcorn and that was my intention with these but have yet to get around to making it, but its another way to use these beans if you get tired of hummus. They don't taste anything like canned beans. Its truly amazing how different they taste.

review/text: I dont know that these taste any different than any other dry chic peas, but they do taste great. The main thing for me though is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they are GMO free. I really dont want any of my money going to Monsanto and their ilk, and would probably forgo chic peas forever if i didnt have that option. That would make me sad, as they are a staple of my diet. Fortunately, i dont have to make that choice.<br />Also, the packaging is appealing. Not a contributing factor in buying these, but nice nonetheless.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Soooooo good.....................
review/text: These are my all time fav donuts!!! Unfortunately they are extremely hard to find in New York. The only time I have ever been able to buy them is when my kids' school would have a fundraiser, but now that my kids are teenagers, the fundraisers have stopped :(. I have searched high and low for these puppies and have been unsuccessful in finding them anywhere. There is a Krispy Kreme shop in Pennsylvania, but that is too far to go and there is one in New York City, but too hard to get to. I had gone on Krispy Kreme's website to order them, but they don't even sell their own donuts on there, which in my opinion is totally lame!!! One time I even spent an entire day searching the net for places that carry them and was told 7-11, Hess and Wal-mart do. So the obsessed woman that I am went to each and every store looking for these, only to find out that they didn't carry them :(. Sooo after feeling totally defeated, I came home and as a last resort I went on amazon. Why I didn't just check them in the first place is beyond me!! Because as I have said in the past, when in doubt, check good ol amazon. I have literally found the weirdest and hardest to find products on here and they have NEVER let me down. I think because it was food or something, I just assumed they wouldn't have them, but I stand corrected!!! Granted they are almost triple the price of a normal box of Krispy Kremes, but when you are desperate (lol), you will pay almost anything and since they are non-existent in my area (sigh) I just suck it up and pay the price.<br /><br />I buy these donuts from Seller Moms Express on here. I have also bought them from Huggys Haven & Connoisseur Market too, but they are more expensive and take forever to ship their items. I like Moms Express because if there is a problem with your order, she sends you out a new box of donuts free of charge.

I had to cut the bag of drops up with a knife so that my babies could have a treat when they come in at night. I have not looked to see where I can reorder the vanilla drop.

review/summary: The best orange marmalade ever.
review/text: I'm an orange marmalade freak. I read labels and try everything, looking for the best, and this is it. At least if you really like the bitterness of the orange peel to come through the sweetness. Few if any marmalades actually have oranges as their first listed ingredient. This one does. Most are too sweet, with little of the balancing bitterness that makes orange marmalade special, and many are too runny. This one's thick and chewy. Maybe it's not for everyone's taste, but for me it's heaven. But so hard to find in stores! Even my specialty grocery isn't carrying it any more. St. Dalfour needs to get its product representatives out there!

review/summary: Avoid this jerky like the plague
review/text: The jerky is the driest I have ever come across and crumbles as soon as you put it in your mouth.  Taste is terrible but I guess you would have to be able to get past the texture to better judge the flavor.  Even my dog doesn't like the jerky, normally his favorite treat.

review/summary: Decent flavor with the consistency of chalk and cardboard
review/text: I found the taste to be OK but certainly not "wild." The teriyaki flavor wasn't unique and didn't provide the spicy "kick" I was expecting. My main disappointment was with the consistency of the jerky. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it went down like cardboard and left a chalky taste in my mouth. Not a fan.

review/summary: Awesome taste!
review/text: I love this stuff! Wild Ride Kickin' Teriyaki has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 280 calories, or 70 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is slightly sweet (like Teriyaki sauce) and not too salty. It is one of my favorite Wild Ride flavors. MMmmmm! Yummy!

review/summary: Love this jerky!
review/text: I have not been able to eat pre-packaged jerky in a long time due to my severe migraines and the fact that nitrates and MSG triggers them. When I saw this jerky I had to try it. I was very glad that I did. It had a great flavor and was tender. My only complaint is that I couldn't put the 4oz bag down, so I think that I'll try the 1oz bags next since I obviously have no self control when it comes to this jerky! I also am back to try some of the other flavors but I did love this flavor.

review/summary: Great Taste but bad texture
review/text: I bought this for a road trip with my kids.  The taste is very good but the beef is "moist".  It doesn't have the same texture of most jerky.  If you avoid jerky because it is hard to eat, this would be great for you.  If you enjoy the flavor of the dried meat and the chewey texture of jerky, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.

review/summary: Free of additives, but also free of flavor
review/text: The texture on this jerky is similar to other bad jerky, like Oberto. It's very dry, not hard but firm, and kind of falls apart in your mouth - but not in a good way. The flavor is dominated by smoke, whereas most jerkys also include soy sauce or worcestershire sauce.<br /><br />All in all, I'd eat this instead of stuff at the gas station like Oberto or a Slim Jim, but when push comes to shove I'll order Wild Bill's jerky, Big John's, or pick up some jerky at the local meat market.

review/summary: Dry, Tasteless Jerky...
review/text: * This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin' Teriyaki  flavor Beef Jerky *<br /><br />Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything "kickin" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain "added" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided
