review/summary: Gold Standard for Catnip
review/text: Open the lid on the tub and you definitely have your pet's attention.  The aroma tells you it is fresh and the reaction of your pet is rewarding.  In my home it out performs the 'organic' brands.  Simply the very best for your cats, regardless of their age.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: This product is extremely good.  I have been drinking tea for many years and I originally bought this tea with the assumption that it would only be ok.  Bad mistake on my part, this tea quickly went to the top of my favourite tea list.<br /><br />The reason why I say Buyer Beware is that 5oz of tea goes rather quickly when it is your favourite tea. Order at least two cans, as you will be drinking this tea on a daily basis.<br /><br />If you enjoy green tea, then this is the tea for you.  It has a very nice flavour green tea with a nutty flavour from the rice that it balances it almost too well.

review/text: I was very surprised on how much I liked the tea.<br />I originally purchased this tea thinking it was Sencha Tea. I didn't realize it came mixed with roasted and popped rice. After making my first cup I found the smell and taste to be familiar but I couldn't put my finger on it. I am still surprised on how the combination of Tea and Roasted rice work. The Sencha taste is there but the roasted flavor makes it a very interesting drink that I definitely recommend trying.

I adjusted the water amount a bit for my own preference, and they came out perfect.... And continue to come out perfect, with one can down! I did not need to add sugar, but again that could be individual taste. Not too bad cost-wise, especially when you consider taste, as the mix at the grocery stores don't even come close. Enjoy!

review/summary: Terrific waffle mix
review/text: This mix makes terrific waffles and it works best using water (as the recipe specifies) not milk, as water makes the batter flow better and the waffles come out lighter and better. My son, who seldom cooks anything, likes them so much he makes them himself in the middle of the night when he is hungry. The batter recipe makes 2 waffles, but they are huge and for breakfast 1/2 is enough with an egg. They also save well in the freezer and come out great when reheated in a toaster oven (they are too big for any normal toaster).

review/summary: Don't let the malt scare you - wonderful mix !!
review/text: If you are expecting your waffles to taste like a malted milk ball then this is not the mix for you.  I dislike malt but LOVE this mix!<br /><br />It's super easy - container says add water, egg & butter.  I have used milk in place of the water and find the taste better but found that they brown less evenly.  Either way they taste great.<br /><br />All you do is heat the waffle iron. Mix the 4 ingredients and in under 5 minutes you have a super tasty waffle.<br /><br />I have found that the thinner the batter the crispier the 'crust' is and the custardy-ier (wow!) the inside is, while the thicker the batter the more uniform texture. These don't have that cake texture like some mixes do - these are like waffles you get at a hotel or restaraunt.<br /><br />Not overly sweet. I keep intending to try flavoring the waffles (vanilla, some savory, etc) but we always just opt for the plain ones - they're just so GOOD!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL60W">Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a><br />For years I had used another pancake style mix to make my waffles, always longing for a little more malt flavor and a crisper texture that did not get tough. I saw this mix and decided to try it. WOW! The first hint that you are in for a good waffle is the smell of malt and hint of vanilla that comes out of the can when you open it. Following the easy directions, you are going to be in for a real treat. These waffles come out crisp, yet fully tender. They seem to hold their crispness under syrup longer and the flavor brings you back to a time when quality meant something. I highly recommend this product. I also bought the natural mix and it works equally well.

Make sure you use a good belgian waffle maker or they won't taste as good. Villa ware makes an awesome waffle iron that I also bought on Amazon. Ok, now I'm hungry.

review/text: I have this on subscribe and save. It takes a little bit more work than an Aunt Jemima or Bisquick as you have to add eggs, butter and milk to the mix but it's well worth it. This makes the best pancakes and waffles i've ever had.<br /><br />I've also used this in the Ihop egg trick (mixing pancake mix into omlettes to make them easier to make and more fluffy) and it's AMAZING. I don't eat any other pancake unless I don't have an option.

review/summary: What can I say? UmmmUmmm, Good!
review/text: I tried to make homemade belgian waffles using yeast and etc. ingredients from scratch and the experience left me traumatized!! I ended up with a flat,soggy,eggy mess! since that day I've been on a quest to find a great Ihop quality waffle mix to make my mornings until I beckon up the courage to try my hand at making them from scratch again. During my desperate quest for the perfect waffle mix I tried Krusteaz...Fail!! I tried Bunnery Natural...Fail! I tried Bisquick...Ohhh Fail! I was about to try Kodiak and Classique,then one day while researching belgian waffle mixes used at hotels the Waffle gods' sent me the answer: Carbons Golden Malted! Don't forget the Malted! I took some of the other reviewers advice and seperated the egg whites, whip them to stiff peaks first then mix in for a fluffier waffle. I also used milk instead of water and added a extra 1/2 cup of mix, as the batter at the hotels usually seem a little thicker. I add a bit of vanilla extract, laddled it on the belgian waffle iron and got some pretty awesome belgian waffles. So far these are as close to Ihop quality as it gets w/o paying $7 per waffle and you don't have to leave home when you just gotta have that waffle. I still plan to try others out of curiosity but for now we definately have a keeper!

review/text: I have been buying this waffle mix for four years.  Taste is great.  The only other ingredients you need is one egg and water for each batch which makes 2 waffles.  The 33oz cans are a better buy than the 16oz ones.  Check out Golden Malted's other flavors for variety.

review/summary: Makes The Best Waffles
review/text: My family has used this mix for years. It is a Christmas tradition to have these waffles before opening gifts. Shipping used to be free when you ordered enough through Amazon, but I see things have changed. I did find free shipping (if your order is over a certain amount) from chefscatalog.com. It pays to shop around, but if you love waffles this is the stuff you are looking for.

I like mine crispy and these were crispy. The tast is fantastic. I would highly recommend this mix to anyone who like waffles.

review/summary: Best Waffles in California & Possibly the World!!!
review/text: While on business travel, I stayed at a hotel with a breakfast bar that had the best waffles ever. I asked and was told this is what they used. I had never seen it in the grocery store, but did run across a smaller can at Williams-Sonoma for a much higher price. I decided to check Amazon and was very pleased to find it at this price. My family loves these waffles and they are so easy to make. The whole house smells like heaven when they are cooking. You can't go wrong with this mix! I used to make homemade Belgian waffles with yeast(they are a pain, but my son's favorite). NEVER AGAIN. These are the new family favorite.

review/summary: Great mix is even better when prepared correctly
review/text: I'm no chef but I love a good Belgium waffle. After reading all the positive reviews I finally gave it a shot. My first attempt was tasty not as fluffy as I'd imagine. I followed the instructions to the T and they tasted great but I thought I was missing something. After googling a bit about making waffles fluffy I found the solution!<br /><br />First separate your egg. Put the whites in a desperate bowl from the yolk. Then use a mixer to beat the whites until 'stiff'. You can do by hand but it does take a few minutes and Pretty rigourous whisking but Itll happen. There's a few really good videos on it if you google it. Basically you want the whites to be so fluffy and frothy that they don't move - kinda like meringue.<br /><br />Now mix your yolks and the water together and mix really well. Then slowly mix the flour in being careful not to over mix. Shouldn't take long.<br /><br />Now the fun part (Google this for a video too if you don't know this term) Fold the egg whites into your batter. The better you do this without over mixing or deflating the whites, the fluffier the waffles will be.<br /><br />Don't know why they don't say that on the box but I did this and just had the best waffles I've ever had! Good luck!

review/text: I first tried this waffle mix staying at a hotel. They had one of those make-your-own waffles and this was the mix that they used. Best waffle I've ever had. So I tracked down the mix at a Williams-Sonoma store and paid way too much. I'm glad to see it here on Amazon.com, even though I have to buy three giant containers of it at once. Oh well, we'll use it all over time. It makes a delicious, perfectly brown and toasty waffle. Mmmmm.

review/text: This is by all the means the very best of the best pancake and waffle mix ever developed. I have spoiled my family so much that when I ran out and purchased some other mix at the grocery, my family knew right off that it was not the mix that I have spoiled them with over the past months. THe flavor just cannot compare to what is in the grocery!! In fact my family now insists on this and nothing else! It makes the best waffles either Belgian or otherwise and not to forget pancakes, unbeatable!! I like being able to purchase this through Amazon instead of the speciality store that I once was buying this from. Can't beat the price...3 cans for $18!! I even shared a can with my neighbor so she can spoil her family!

review/text: This is truly an excellent mix for waffles and pancakes at home.  I've typically used Bisquick and while it produces an OK waffle/pancake, this mix makes for a much better tasting product.  I don't know if it's the added malt or what, but Golden Malted also produces a far superior pancake than the mixes you'll find at the grocery store as well.<br /><br />It promises to save us a lot of money - my girlfriend and I have been regularly going out to breakfast because our local caf&eacute; executes so well on pancakes - this mix quite frankly tastes just as good as the diner's waffles and pancakes!

review/text: There was a place in Houston that made malted waffles using this mix. After eating there for years they switched to a cheaper brand, as usual. I tried to buy this product from the mfg but they would only sell it commercially in very large quantities. For years I have missed my favorite waffles. I happened to do a search, lately, and there it was on Amazon. I ordered it with 1 day delivery and bought a new waffle iron (a Warner Pro which is a gem). Just like I remembered them - best in the world. I also found my favorite syrup (Vermont Maid) here on Amazon after searching for it in stores without luck. I am a happy camper. Thanks Amazon, you are the best.

review/summary: Do not even wonder about this mix....
review/text: JUst like the fine hotels....all I can say. Cannot believe I can make this at home. After trying many internet mix recipes and an inferior waffle maker  I bought for 9.99 called chefmate (sold at Target)  I stepped up to the 26500y Proctor silex Waffle baker and this mix.....Amazing, I could not be happier and I am a foodie. My quest for awesome waffles is over and I made the mix with canola oil as I was out of butter....the first waffle this morning came out fantastic....can't wait to make a real one. The only down side I can see is making a few will take 8 minutes each....not a problem for two...but for 6 or more could be a problem....If I had a large family I would buy three of the Waffle bakers.....for around 26 bucks each you can't go wrong....

review/summary: Light, crusty and delicious waffles!!
review/text: I am not the type to write reviews, but this product was so great that I had to contribute. After trying several mixes from the local markets, I was beginning to think that my waffle iron was to blame. The other brands gave me cake like and doughy waffles which quickly turned soft after removing them from the iron. This mix, however, was perfect! The waffles came out very light with a nice crispy crust. I should have checked Amazon earlier!! I just make them by following the directions on the package, but I may experiment with the suggestions that the other reviewers mentioned. If you are frustrated with your waffles at home, don't blame your waffle iron just yet and give this mix a try!

review/summary: The absolute greatest
review/text: Carbons Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour is absolutely the greatest bar none.  If I could give it a higher rating that 5 stars I would.  This mix makes the lightest, tastiest waffles that we have ever had. I have a 3/4 box left of a Belgium waffle mix that I purchased at the grocery store that I imagine I would have to dispose of because neither my husband nor myself want to use anything but your Carbon's Malted Waffle flour mix.  Once we start on the last of the 3rd can, we will be ordering more.  Please. Amazon.com, do not discontinue carrying this item at this affordable price.

review/summary: I love these waffles
review/text: So my wife and mother in law only make pancakes and waffles by scratch, so needless to say they shook their head at me when I bought not one can but 3!  After making waffles my wife was sold on how easy it was and how really good they taste!  My mother in law said she still liked her waffles better (she likes the yeast flavor).  The ingredients on the can are all the same stuff as if you made them by scratch, without yeast.  The malted flavor adds a nice hint of taste.  Like other reviews said, I first saw this mix at a Holiday Inn Express.<br />One down side, I dont like the flavor of the pancakes.  They have different directions on the can for waffles and pancakes.  The taste is just not the same with the pancakes. That being said, I didnt buy this for the pancakes so I still give it five stars.

review/text: bought this pancake waffle mix upon amazon suggestion I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BXM2LU">Waring WMK300A Pro Professional Stainless-Steel Belgian Waffle Maker</a>. I wasn't disappointed in adding to order, very good flavor. I normally mix my own from scratch and whip up the egg whites to make it fluffier... IF you normally buy mix anyway this certainly is better then Krusteaz mix...<br /><br />I doubled the suggested recipe on can, using 2cups of mix. made eight waffles..have 3/5 of first can remaining... probably will not reorder mix again only due to my required need to feed family of 7 people. looks like about 18-20 waffles per 33oz can

review/text: Anyone who makes Waffles for any length of time knows this is the ONLY mix worth buying.  It is the one served at the better breakfast restaurants. motels, hotels and homes.  I hate to give any product 5-stars because there is always room for improvement.  However,I have no idea how this product could be improved on.  Add you own berry's, bacon, ham, etc.  But don't do it too often.  It really is best right out of the container.

review/text: I ordered this pancake mix when I originally purchased my Presto Flipside waffle maker and went through all 3 cans within just a few days.  We've had waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!  (I think my family might be tiring of them by now.)  I've already ordered my second "3 pack".  We compared this to another major brand waffle mix (starts with a "P") and this has the other brand beat hands down.  I also love my Presto waffle maker.  It makes great waffles and I didn't have to spend a fortune on it.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was a bit skeptical about purchasing what amounts to "special" pancake flour on the internet. However, I got my box, opened it up, and the scent of light malt vanilla greeted me. I decided to make pancakes at night!<br /><br />After my first few pancakes, I became a believer.  Not only are do the pankcakes/waffles smell amazing while cooking, they taste absolutely delicious.  My family agreed and wanted more.  They cook up light, fluffy, and I especially love the fact that when cooked, the color turns perfectly brown and looks like it came out of a restaurant. It is no surprise to learn that this mix is used in restaurants across the country.<br /><br />One tip that makes it taste even better: use real syrup. It may sound cliche, but in this case, real is better and will make you want to have pancakes every day.<br /><br />If you like to make your own waffles and pancakes, do not hesitate to get this.

review/text: I bought this to go with my new waffle maker, and it makes perfect waffles. That's the good part.<br /><br />The only negative (to me) is the sweetness. I can't eat more than a quarter of waffle IF I put maple syrup on it - just way too sweet. That's why I only rate it at 4 stars, and it's just a matter of personal taste.

review/text: Was planning to sell Belgian waffles topped with ice cream and a topping at our ice cream store, and went on a search for a quality mix. Based on the reviews, I decided to try the Golden Malted. It's very good, though at least in my Kitchen Aid waffle maker, you have to be careful to add a little extra oil or the finished waffle sticks to the griddle. Everyone likes the taste and consistency of the waffle.

review/text: We recently bought an expensive Belgian waffle maker, and first tried some waffle mix from the grocery store.  They were very good!  Then I bought some of this mix at Williams-Sonoma and the waffles were even better tasting and light as a cloud on the inside.  Amazon now sells the same mix for half the price!  My kids were amazed at the difference in taste.  Impress your family and friends with a waffle that tastes like it was made at the Four Seasons Hotel!!

review/summary: The best tasting waffle mix that you can buy.
review/text: I first heard about Golden Malted Waffle mix here on Amazon when I was searching for a new waffle maker and saw that on pratically every maker this mix was recommended. After reading up on the mix and finding out that it is the same mix served at various hotels across the country, I decided to give it a try. I have to tell you that this is the best waffle mix I have ever had. From the moment you open the first canister and you get that malt smeel hits your nose, you know that this is going to be good. The flavor is great and it is not an overly sweet batter which makes it good for both breakfast and for using for dessert waffles with ice cream and fruit. Also I recommend using milk in place of the water when making the waffle batter. It makes for a much better waffle. So if you are on the fence about trying this mix do yourself a favor and order. You will not be disappointed.

review/text: Plenty of folk have praised Carbon's magical waffle mix so I won't tread in their tracks.  What I can offer is a delicious alternative using Carbon's magical mix.<br /><br />I'm from Texas and we put pecans in almost everything.  Here is a Pecan Waffle version using the Carbon GM mix:<br /><br />1 cup CGM mix<br />1 cup fresh chopped pecans<br />3/4 cup milk<br />3 tbsp butter<br />1 large egg<br /><br />Beat egg then add milk and melted butter.  Follow with waffle mix and pecans.  Don't under cook, it should be a little crunchy.  Also, don't insult by using anything but real maple syrup and butter.  Count calories at some other meal.

I would suggest you order enough mix to qualify for free shipping because it keeps very well in the pantry. The waffle mix is wonderful as is, but I plan to try making them with milk or soda water as some reviewer have suggested. Enjoy!

I got home and immediately ordered the same waffle maker she had and this mix...My family LOVES it when I make them. I know some of you may think I'm a big dummy,but the mix calls for 5/8 of a cup of liquid and it took forever for me to figure out that 5/8 of a cup is 5oz..

review/summary: Excellent, easy mix - let it rest though
review/text: This is a great waffle mix for using in a belgian waffle maker.  I use it most Saturday mornings (including this morning) and love that Amazon ships it to my door.  I have gone through at least 6 cans of this mix and have never had a "bad" batch.  This mix is far above any of the ones I've tried from my local mega mart.  One piece of advice- let the batter rest for about 5 minutes after mixing it.  The batter is easier to measure accurately and the waffles come out better.  Enjoy!
