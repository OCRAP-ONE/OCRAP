review/summary: Three out of 6 jars leaked.
review/text: The honey tastes good.  But three out of the six jars leaked because the seal was broken.  I think you'd better put a scotch tape on the jar when you ship this product so as not to the bottle cap is opened during shipping.

review/summary: Bad batch!
review/text: I sent a letter regarding this order a while ago about the bad batch I received, it was just awful tasting!  I never got a reply on what to do with it, so here it sits in the box it came in.  I have had problems with packaging on this item in the past and left feedback on that.  The packaging finally got better than this happened.  If I cannot get this resolved I am going to cancel all standing subscribe and save orders of this.  A shame because the honey is normally delicious.

review/summary: Strong Flavor but Good Price
review/text: I agree with others who have mentioned the strong flavor of this honey. It has "earthy" "woody" undertones that while not bad, are atypical of most commercial honey. This honey does not taste at all like the generic flavored honey that can be bought in grocery stores. I use this honey for making my granola and in cooking where the stronger flavor is either masked or accentuates the flavors of the dish. For tea and toast I like to use a fruitier honey that is from a local peach orchard, but it's considerably more expensive so this honey works for baking.<br /><br />One of the honey's was sticky, but after close inspection it appeared that the inner seal was still intact so I went ahead and used it. I think maybe it was an issue with the filling process and not failure of the protective seals.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I've ordered this honey before and am very satisfied with the quality, however, the packaging seems to be an issue.  Three cases and each one had leakage from several bottles--not too significant but enough to make a mess.  Caps appeared to be tight but somewhow the honey oozed out??  Other than that, the product is good and I'll continue ordering it.

review/summary: Great product, Not-so-smart packaging
review/text: It tastes great.  I use it for everything that I may use sugar for.<br /><br />However, bottles have repeatedly arrived with the seal broken and the honey spilled into the cap.  Of the 6-pack, about 3 seals are usually broken.<br /><br />My proposed solution to the seller:  Don't fill the bottles all the way to the top and provide expandable volume for expansion due to heat -- which is inevitable. You can't fight physics.

review/summary: Very strong!
review/text: This honey is much stronger than any other honey I've ever tried. It has a very nice smell and taste, and, by nature of being stronger, doesn't require as much for flavoring things such as teas.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this product with Chamomile tea while I had strep throat (and later an upper respiratory infection and then pneumonia). Honey is great for a sore throat, and it also has some anti-biotic properties that I attribute to very diminished symptoms (compared to family members who were also sick). Unfortunately for them, they are not big fans of herbal tea and honey ;)<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering again, although these 6 bottles will last a while.

review/text: My husband was a beekeeper so we always had our own honey.Why one has to put organic or rainforest on the label is confusing. This honey is sweet and thin so it might appeal to some but the real thing is what I want.<br />Since my husband has died I now have to find another good source for clover honey. This is not it as it has no true honey flavor.

review/text: This honey is good as long as you use it for something where you want to taste the honey. This does not work in dishes where other flavors are important. This has a very strong taste as compared to some other brands (miller's, Ambrosia) I use. I mostly use honey for sweetening flavored teas and it does not work for me.

review/text: After work out, I make a honey tea, putting one table spoon in a warm water mixed with a teaspoon of creatine powder for the fast muscle recovery process.  This honey is so wonderful.  It tastes great.  And it brings out subtle and yet delightful scents of flowers. I can almost imagine wondering through exotic flowers and whatnot in the rain forest. And it's organic so you have a piece of mind knowing that it's pure and good for your body.

To me they are my favorite cookies! I can see having these with ice cream, whipped cream or just all on their own. They are the best!

review/text: Well ordered this as a gift for my uncle's birthday.  I am SHOCKED To see how little the quantity was.  I mean, there is probably a handful of each variety of nuts in this gift box.  And it's not like any gourmet flavored nuts..  SO I really did expect the gift box to be rather big with a very generous amount stuffed in them.  The nuts are packed in the shown plain wooden tray and clear wrap on top  and the chocolate box is tied together with some ribbon.  Very Ordinary.  I just cannot get over the fact that I spent $90 plus tax on this giftbox.  It would have been better priced at around $40.<br /><br />SO if you are looking to make a statement with a nice gift basket/tray...  this is DEFINITELY NOT IT!!<br /><br />Since it was a gift.. I cannot really comment on the quality of the contents..<br /><br />If I had more time I would have definitely returned and purchased something else.  Unfortunately I just spend $100 for a simple gift and paid $35 for 1 day shipping..  SO feeling terribly disappointed with myself for not paying more attention to the amounts and quantity provided in the description :-(

I called Amazon immediately and they set up a return, but could offer not help in obtaining the product described on the site. They seemed more interested in refunding my money than they did in trying to figure out how to get the fulfillment process right. God only knows what it will be like when they actually get the packet of rice cakes back and need to credit my account. Will their response be the same as mine right now?

review/text: These teabags have a great flavor with all the benefits of green tea.  They make great iced tea or hot tea.  The coconut flavor is not overwhelming.  It's a good balance with the passionfruit.  We enjoy this tea every afternoon, and it would make a great breakfast or morning tea, because it has no grassy or astringent aftertaste that is often evident with green tea.  The price is excellent.  It's been getting hard to find in our local stores, so it seems other customers enjoy this tea as much as we do, which is why we're so glad it's available on Amazon.

review/summary: BEST TEA EVER
review/text: I've never been much of a green tea person but this one is absolutely great.  I bought it at a local grocery story and fell in love with it, so of course I had to find a case of it on here and order it.  The tea has a great flavor that can actually hold up to the amount of sweet I add to it.  This will be a regular staple in my home now and it's great hot or cold.

review/text: someone had made a comment that you could not taste the chocolate due to the overwhelming clove. this is a good tea. i only gave it 4 stars because you do taste the clove pretty strongly. however, i happen to like this and think the tea tastes great. i am only posting this to say: if i do not add sweetner i only taste spice. ***but if i add a little sweetner, i notice that it brings out the chocolate flavor more. ***  happy national tea month!  enjoy! ~ jane

review/summary: Perfect food
review/text: Gobstoppers are truly the perfect candy.  And so versatile!  You can roll them around in your mouth for a long time, patiently sucking to get at the sweet goodness within.  Or you can just chomp into them and get a mouthful of almost overpowering sugary tastiness.  Another bonus is that they change colors, so there's that added entertainment factor of trying to guess which color will come next.<br /><br />The rattle of the box has a very appealing sound.  Maybe your cat will enjoy it as much as mine does.

They seem to take a little longer to cook but it's not a big deal. You can't even tell they are whole wheat once the lasagna is ready.

review/summary: Great Pasta!
review/text: DeLallo got it right! I tried the recipe on the box, a vegetable lasagna. The no cook noodles came out perfectly. There are 15 sheets in the box. The each sheet is approximately 3 1/2" X 7". It works fine in a 13 x 9 baking dish at 5 sheets per layer, 3 layers.<br /><br />I am not a fan of whole wheat pasta. I find the texture of most whole wheat noodles very unappealing. The texture of the DeLallo noodle was smooth and cooked very well. Not having to prepare the noodles for the pan cut down on prep time, too. I'll be ordering more.

review/summary: Healthy & Easy to Cook Wheat Lasagna Shells
review/text: I highly recommend these whole wheat lasagna shells. (At the risk of selling out). They are super easy to use. No need to pre cook them. They are ready to go straight out of the box. Wholesome and healthy, these taste great as well. I bought the Rozoni Wheat Lasagna pasta, but they are much smaller in width. They took months for Amazon to send them to me as well. I have not tasted those yet, so we will see how they compare in flavor. But these ones are absolutely great. I will be buying more shortly. The Ronzini ones also have to be precooked before hand. Only for five minutes, but still Lasagna takes an hour or so to make as is. Who needs the extra headache? Try these! Great for families. You can cook a bunch and have a meal for a week.

When I received the flowers none had bloomed yet so I thought that I would have them for at least a week or more. I followed the care instructions exactly but they still wilted and died within only a few short days. They also didn't open at the same time so it never looked like the picture at any point in time. I think next time I will order from a local florist so that I can actually get to see a beautiful bouquet like in the picture.

review/text: Granted, my expectations from Proflower weren't exactly high. I wasn't expecting the flower to look like the picture. But was it that much to ask for some stargazer and iris buds that are alive?<br /><br />What my mother received from her so-called "Spectacular" was a bunch of disgusting slimy brown rotten buds. Proflower must not care about what they send out because I am 100% sure this did not happen through the shipping process. Based on tracking records, the flowers were sent out wednesday night from a location roughly 150 miles away. And it was received around thursday noon. During that time, the local temperature was constantly below 80 degrees. There's absolutely no quality control when it comes to Proflower.<br /><br />Well, lesson learned. Steer away from Proflower no matter how tempting their prices may be.

So when I realized I would not receive them when requested, a date that would have given them time to open up I had to go purchase flowers locally. Not to mention that upon arrival of said buds, well after one look I can tell you that there is no way in heck that they would bloom to look anything like the picture, seems to be lacking like half the flowers and two of them that were sent have the stems broken not too far below the bulb s so there's two less from the already lacking amount.

review/summary: Delicious, but inadequate packing by Amzaon!
review/text: The first time I purchased these tart shells I was very happy with the shells themselves - they were delicious and made such beautiful individualized desserts, but (as previous reviewers had warned) almost 20% arrived to broken too be used.  However, I wanted to try them again and was very disappointed when ONCE AGAIN at least 20% of the shells arrived too broken to use.<br /><br />The Hafner box is well designed, but it was put in a larger Amazon box with one small strip of bubble wrap.  I think that the box of tart shells was tossed about so much inside the Amazon box (not to mention on the UPS truck, etc) that broken shells were inevitable.  But if the original box had been tightly encased in bubble wrap probably most, if not all of the shells would have arrived in tact.  I will not purchase these through Amazon again and do NOT recommend that others buy them here either.

review/summary: Great product, ineffective packaging
review/text: I would give these tart shells a 4 due to the quality, size and flavor-- they definitely are made with real butter and look attractive as well.  I didn't give a 5 either because they're rather shallow, which you can't see very well from the photos.  The three stars are due to the fact that Amazon packages the box that the tartlets come in, in a giant box with some bubble packaging to prevent the box inside from sliding around.  This is simply ineffective packaging for such a fragile item.  The outer box didn't even say "FRAGILE" on it, to indicate to the postal service that it needed to be handled carefully.  A previous reviewer had warned that she received her shipment with quite a few of the shells broken, but I thought I'd take my chances.  I also called customer service ahead of time to ask about this very issue and to request if anything could be done to improve the packaging or if they could communicate with the packaging dept. to prevent so many broken shells, and they simply told me I could send them back and have a new box sent.<br /><br />As it is, I received my package on time, though 40 out of the 240 tartlet shells were broken to the point of being unusable.  I consider myself lucky that only 40 were broken and will not be returning them only because I'm very happy with the product otherwise and have a catering deadline and can't risk sending them back only to receive a new box with even more broken.<br /><br />Order at your own risk.  Amazon doesn't seem to do much to accommodate for this item's fragility.

review/summary: Great tasting....but half are broken
review/text: I don't know why in the world they do this, but once again the inadequate packaging resulted in the bottom half of the box with broken shells.  Crushed to oblivion to be exact.  They are replacing them no problem, but really, people, just package them better and you won't have to replace them!  UPDATE:  Just got my replacement and once again tons of broken shells.  Aggravated!  No fragile marking whatsoever and just thrown into the box.  Idiots win

review/summary: bar count went from 10 to 8!!!
review/text: These granola bars are the best out there, however, quaker and amazon pulled a fast one on me.  I subscribe and save to these because honestly i eat 12 boxes in about a week and a half.  However, quaker changed the number of bars in a pack from 10 to now only 8!  Same price yet 2 fewer bars per pack. Now with this order I'm basically getting 2 less boxes each time for the same price.  Amazon should have at least warned me that my 10-count 12 pack order was now an 8-count 12 pack order and that i would be paying the same price.<br /><br />I guess its back to buying the variety pack at costco with 60 bars, the downside being the dreadful oatmeal raisin bars I am inevitably forced to eat.  Actually the oatmeal raisin are pretty good, just not at all compared to the chocolate chip peanut butter.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Hidden Surprise
review/text: These taste great, I was eating them for years.<br /><br />As I said, was.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Quaker is using partially hydrogenated oil (in English, that means trans fats).<br /><br />While they claim 0g Trans Fat, they're rounding down anything below .5 grams. There's no way to know if each bar has .1g or .4g... Quaker won't say.<br /><br />All those .4g add up in a day, as everyone touts "0g trans fat". So, in all, I had to stop eating them. Quaker Simple Harvest bars do not appear to have any trans fats, and I suggest those as an alternative. Unfortunately, they're much harder to find... and more expensive.

review/text: I absolutely love the chocolate macaroons. They taste like german chocolate cake in a bite. These are very high in MCT's and therefore make a great pre-cardio munch -on or even before training. I gave the blonde macaroons to my boyfriend as a gift because he likes those better. The empty tins are being used as containers for jewelery, you;ve got to love the crown design on them, they actually look pretty nice placed on your dressing table.
