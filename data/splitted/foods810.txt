review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

review/summary: I Love Sage Tea!
review/text: I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/summary: Great for colicky acid reflux babies
review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/summary: I use this tea for menstral cramps
review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/text: A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!

It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: Do NOT buy this product.  Although Amazon is showing the Classic Hazelnut flavor, they are shipping the regular Hazelnut flavor.  The regular flavor is terrible and tastes like 1/2 peanut butter.<br /><br />I wish Torani would stop messing with their flavors and/or test them with someone who can taste.  This tastes nothing like hazelnut.  It tastes like some kind of sweet chemical caramel flavor dominated by an off peanut butter taste.<br /><br />If you want the REAL hazelnut taste, look for "Classic" Hazelnut.  Unfortunately, you cannot trust Amazon to ship you the right version.  I have purchased this several times in past years, but now I receive the regular Hazelnut.<br /><br />This is just like the Caramel versus Classic Caramel debacle I experienced with Amazon last year.  If you use the subscribe and save, you will really be screwed because ALL grocery items are non-returnable.<br /><br />I suggest you buy at a local grocery store to be sure you are getting the CLASSIC Hazelnut flavor.  Hopefully, in 6 months and enough customer complaints, Amazon will fix this.  They also need to fire their Torani rep who keeps supplying Amazon with the wrong product or is "helping" by switching to new formulations.

review/text: I have to agree with everyone else. I once accidentally purchased the DaVinci Gourmet brand caramel and I remarked to my husband that it tasted like pancake syrup to me. When I bought this though, I was thrilled to be saving money. Imagine my disappointment then when I tried it the very first time. I believe this is the same syrup as the caramel, but with a different label slapped onto the bottle. No, really I do. I honestly cannot tell the difference between the two.<br /><br />Well whatever it is, it is NOT hazelnut.<br /><br />I would recommend the DaVinci Gourmet brand of sugar free Hazelnut OR hazelnut flavored Splenda packets instead. Amazon sells both DaVinci and Splenda, but neither have super saver shipping at the time of this writing. You have to balance for yourself whether or not the extra money is worth it to you.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I bought this, really hoping to get something decent. Maybe not perfect, but decent.<br /><br />How wrong. I added just a few drops to my coffee, and immediately, I noticed bubbles, like when you add vegetable oil to water. When I took a sip, all I tasted was a chemical-taste. I can't describe it more than that. I didn't taste hazelnut. It was merely a chemical taste.<br /><br />I will never by from Torani again. Highly disappointed.

review/summary: coffee shop flavor at home! autoship from Amazon.
review/text: I just love this torani syrup it has the most wonderful flavor. I could buy them at world market for twice the price in a glass bottle. Why? this is convenient and just as I am about to run out my autoship at the door. The hazelnut has such a sweet delicate flavor. Its like gourmet coffee at less than half the price in my pjs.

review/summary: Very good flavor, reasonably priced
review/text: To begin with, compared to my local supermarket I am getting nearly double (15.4 oz to 25.1 oz) for one dollar more per bottle with this amazon 3-pack. This alone means good things for me, because I can get great flavoring syrups for a more reasonable price. The flavor is pretty good for a sugarfree syrup, although the hazelnut flavor is slightly lacking compared to the "sugared" version (this is the reason for the 4-stars). But all in all this is a great deal for anyone looking to cut some calories (a starbucks beverage has about 300 sometimes more from syrup alone) and overall a pretty good taste.

review/summary: "Classic" is much better!
review/text: I agree with some of the other reviewers. I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the "Classic" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the "non-Classic?" that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the "Classic" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.

review/text: I bought is on S&S and that's unfortunate because I'm not even finished with the first bottle and I already am soooo disgusted by the flavor. It has a really strong smell that is quite nauseating. I actually think the smell is the reason I don't like it rather than the taste.<br /><br />I do LOVE LOVE LOVE the peppermint flavor as well as the vanilla one. So if you're wanting a solid sweetener without added calories/sugar then choose the vanilla.

review/summary: Recipe changed!!
review/text: I've ordered the sugar free Hazelnut syrup from Amazon before and it tasted just as I expected (like my local coffee house).  However, my most recent order (a pack of 3 bottles) tasted like caramel, smells very sweet and has no hint of hazelnut. I thought perhaps is was a packaging mistake since all 3 bottles had the same horrible taste. However, I was told that Torani changed the recipe. If you're expecting a hazelnut flavor, don't order this product anymore unfortunately.

review/text: I have been a user of Starbucks sugar-free syrups for about 5 years.  Their price has gone up from about $7 a bottle to over $10 a bottle.  I started looking for a replacement.  I ordered the Torani syrups as a lower-cost alternative.  The order arrived on time.  The price was good.  Problem is, I found I don't like the taste of the Torani syrups.  I should have tried the syrup as a local coffee house before I ordered.  My bad.

review/summary: Excellant Hazelnut flavor for coffee
review/text: I prefer hazelnut flavored coffee and used instant Taster's Choice brand until they stopped packaging it in the 6 or 7 oz canisters.  After experimenting with various flavoring agents I found this Torani syrup to fill the bill.  Don't add any sugar or sweetener as the syrup is already sweet.  Personally I am very happy with the results.  I have my hazelnut instant coffee again at a reasonable price.

Unfortunately, it is like other people have commented...it doesn't taste the same and it doesn't smell the same even though it says "original" recipe on it.  I guess on the plus side I use less of it but that isn't good for the manufacturer :).  Delivery was timely and they do come in the plastic bottles.
