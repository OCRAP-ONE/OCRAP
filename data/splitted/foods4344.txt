review/summary: inedible
review/text: I used to eat these candies as a child and I remember biting into them and being in nirvana. So I ordered a pound to see if they were everything I remembered as a child. Unfortunately I was hugely disappointed, I received a package that was little more than a piece of cardboard folded in half and taped to hold my candy. Once I got over that fact, I mean come on its just the wrapping over the item so I was not too upset about that. I opened the bag of candy and while I admit my expectations were high the candy did not even rate one star. They were rock hard and I could not even chew it, it was more like hard candy instead of the chewy goodness I remembered from childhood. They were not expired, I gave one to my room mate to try and he could not even chew it. Maybe I just got a bad bag but I was extremely disappointed.

review/summary: These are wonderful!!!! Try them
review/text: Ok- I had no idea what these were when I ordered them.  But my goodness am I glad I took a chance.  These are a sweet, malty candy- like sucking on burned sugar (not badly burned- just a tasty little bit burned).  I have tried these in my chai tea- oh my- it's SO good.  One little candy in a glass of chai is enough to get the marvelous flavor.  I've also put it in cocoa- and it's good in that too.  I gave them to one of my daughters when she had a bad cough and she said it helped.  I've no idea if it was just a placebo effect or what- but there you are.  I love these candies.  I've reordered twice since I got the first bunch.

review/text: This is a very refreshing cup of coffee.  I drink mostly flavored coffee and prefer a medium roast.  This is smooth with the sweetness of raspberry and no bitterness marring the flavor.  Some flavored coffees tend to have a chemical aftertaste but this is NOT one of them. It has quickly become one of my favorite coffees. However, I will likely drink less of it in the winter months when i tend to go for cinnamon pastry, pumpkin, winter carnival, butter toffee and cappuccino flavored coffees. I've already drank almost a whole box of it and will be ordering again shortly!  If you like raspberry this is definitely a k-cup worth trying!

review/summary: The Best Mexican Picante Hands Down
review/text: This hot sauce is so tasty with Mexican food / Tex Mex that for me personally, nothing even touches it. This isn't a hot sauce that I would use for Buffalo Wings or home fries. This stuff lends itself to tacos, nachos, burritos etc so well that it's hard to describe. I'm a hot sauce fanatic and I love habenero hot sauces, but habenero hot sauce just doesn't work on a taco like this stuff does. I always thought it did, and it is very yummy, but not like this stuff on Tex mex or Mexican chow. I live in Upstate New York and travel a lot for business. I buy this stuff on the west coast for $1.29 a bottle at the grocery store, bubble wrap it and bring it home in my luggage. I think about this hot sauce some times. It's amazing. To put it in perspective for you west coasters, I hate Tapatio. It's got too much vinegar. This stuff does not. I would like to thank the creator of this hot suace, because it's that good. It really stands out on Tex Mex especially. Mmmmm.YUMMY ! ! ! !

review/summary: Hot but not too hot - a nicely blended hot sauce. Purchase this "extra hot " variety. The regular version is Not Recommended
review/text: Lets face it - the Mexicans love hot food and generally know how to make a fine hot sauce. While the label (in small print) says "extra hot" there are many other sauces which are far hotter.  Think in terms of needing 5 or 6 drops for a bloody mary rather than spoonfuls when using this sauce. It is far from being "extra hot". I'd call it medium hot.<br /><br />Important: There is a significant difference between this "extra hot" variety of Valentina hot sauce and their regular variety. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called "extra hot" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the "extra hot" is far superior.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt ...<br /><br />Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!<br /><br />Normally I don't like any vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular version of Valentina. The difference may be this sauce uses actual vinegar while most others use acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar) and the chili peppers dominate in this particular variety of Valentina. I want to emphasize that this is ONLY true for this particular blend.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a nicely blended hot sauce worthy of your consideration. My four star rating means this is a very good hot sauce but, depending on your palette, you might find a few that are better.<br /><br />Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina and the "extra hot" (black label) variety that I'm reviewing here. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is painfully evident while the "extra hot" variety is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label.<br /><br />This is a near perfect hot sauce for a bloody mary and most other foods.<br /><br />BTW: Watch out for sellers that price the sauce low but charge very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis

review/summary: There is something special about that sauce
review/text: I have discovered Valentina sauce while traveling in Washington. Being a hot sauce lover I couldn't pass up this bottle when I saw it at the local supermarket. This sauce is thick if compared to other sauces such as Tabasco brand. It sticks nicely to the food. It's adequately hot, although not the kind of hot that burns your taste buds for a long time. It's made in Guadalajara, Mexico which adds a little mystery to it. If you're into hot sauces definitely try it if you stumble upon it. I don't think you will regret it.

I had never heard of the brand before but saw it on the shelf at WalMart maybe a year ago and bought a small bottle to try. I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce, several times a day usually. It comes in regular and extra hot. I have tried both and prefer the extra hot, although it is not that hot. It is about right for me. I go through a bottle or 2 a month.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Chili Peppers, Vinegar, Salt, Spices, 0.1% sodium benzoate as a preservative.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the 1 liter bottles are &lt;$XX. Made in Mexico. it comes in a smaller bottle as well, but I get the 1 liter size. I have one at work and one at home.

My Mojo delivers a great deal of flavor for a small amount of sodium.

review/summary: High quality, delicious, great price
review/text: I love balsamic glazes! I had never tried the fig before now but it truly delicious. It is thick and sweet, but not overly so with just a hint of fig. It squeezes easily and neatly making it great for plating or just drizzling. I love it on salmon, fruit, potatoes...and desserts! Amazon has it at a great price too. You get two big bottles that will last you a while.

review/text: These are nifty little packets of applesauce, in this case, apple and mango. I discovered these a couple months ago and they work very well for two different circumstances. First,  they make a real good healthy snack for my four-year-old boy, and he loves them. Second, I take them along as a snack for my daily walks. A single pack slides easily into a pant pocket and is easy to drain without the need for any cup or spoon or anything. Just take the top off and apply a mild sucking pressure to the opening. The packet is drained before you even realize it. Plus these things are delicious! I but them in boxes of 16 3.2-ounce  packets at a nearby Costco store.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The Brits secret to great curry
review/text: British friends of ours who are nuts about curries put us on to Patak's curry pastes.  I thought it would be difficult to find in the US but voila, Amazon has it.  Start by sauteing diced onion, add other ingredients such as garlic, red pepper, tomato paste, whatever to your taste.  Then add a tablespoon or more of Patak curry paste.  They come in different intensities and levels of heat with the Madras warm but not too hot.  The secret shared by the Brits is to make the sauce a day ahead of time and let it sit and integrate in the fridge overnight.  Next day, add veggies, chicken, lamb, whatever your choice might be and cook on the stovetop or in the oven then serve with potatoes or basmati rice and condiments such as raisins, coconut, pine nuts, and of course chutney.  That's it.  They swear by Patak -- why make your own curry sauce from all those spices and ingredients when Patak's done it for you?

review/summary: The Best Pickled Carrots ... EVER !! (n__n)
review/text: I've always loved pickled carrots and enjoy them when available at Mexican restaurants. I've purchased several different canned brands to enjoy at home but often found either the carrots were WAY too Spicy or the carrot were mushy and did not retain their crunch. But San Marcos brand the carrots are crunchy, flavorful, and got just the right amount of spice. It's not too spicy that your mouth burns but not too acidic that it tastes like vinegar carrots. The acidity and spice is perfect !! They last a very long time too. I've had a container of these sliced carrots in the fridge and they are still crunchy and flavorful as a freshly opened can. I know that whenever I'm craving pickled carrots ... San Marcos is the brand to get ! I recommend it over any other brand.

review/summary: Best Dog Treats Ever!
review/text: All of my German shepherds are very picky when it comes to any food or treats, but they LOVE these treats. Although I won't give them the unhealthy processed stuff that is offered at most pet stores, I have tested numerous brands just to see what their reactions are and they walk away from all of it.<br /><br />I have had permanent vocal cord damage for over 3 years now and can't speak above a very low whisper. I was really nervous when I had to train my new male GSD puppy because I am unable to show any emotion with my voice. Loud praise and "good boys!" aren't possible for me.<br /><br />Instead, I strapped a treat pouch on my waist filled with these treats. In no time I had him behaving like a perfect little gentleman - all because he knew he was being a good boy everytime I gave him a treat!<br /><br />That puppy is now 3 years old and we live on over 6 acres of land that's filled with all kinds of wildlife - bunnies, deer, coyotes, fox, etc and with these treats (and of course LOTS of love) I have even been able to train him to stay right beside me when he sees or hears another critter. Anyone who has spent even a little time with a German shepherd knows that they love nothing more than to chase after all kinds of animals.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about these treats - they are the only one's I can recommend 100%. Buy with confidence and know that your dog will LOVE them!

review/summary: Fantastic stuff at a great price
review/text: Citric acid is one of those incredibly useful items to have on hand. I use it mainly for cleaning tasks such as:<br /><br />> cleaning coffee machines - works much better than vinegar at removing hard water deposits.<br /><br />> cleaning hot water pots - as above. Much easier and less smell than using vinegar.<br /><br />> cleaning dishwashers - add a couple of tablespoons and run the dishwasher through a cycle when it is empty. Makes the interior sparkle like new.<br /><br />> boosting dishwasher detergent performance - add a small amount (about a teaspoon or less) to dishwasher detergent. Really boosts the cleaning power and eliminates hazy dishes. Be careful not to use too much, however, since it can pit delicate glass or metal.<br /><br />> cleaning steam cleaners, steam mops and irons - gets all the crud out.<br /><br />Basically, this is the best cleaner for anything that is affected by hard water deposits. You can buy commercial products such as Cleancaf or other similar cleaners, but the main active ingredient is citric acid. You can get it bulk at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />The only downside is that this comes packaged in a thin plastic sack. The first thing you'll want to do is transfer it to a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Makes it much easier to store and use. Regardless of the container, citric acid clumps up easily when there's humidity in the air, but that does not affect its performance. Just bust up the clump and you're good to go. The shelf life is indefinite when you use it as a cleaning product.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/text: WOW!!! My dishes have never sparkled like this. My washing machine is clean and smell free. Many uses for this product. Im pretty sure anyone buying this would put it into another container so Im not sure why people complain about packaging.<br /><br />Im not scientist, only internet research and personal experience. Take my advice how you wish. This is the stuff they put on Sour Patch Kids candy. Even though its edible, be careful not to get it in your eyes.<br /><br />Dishwasher: If you have hard water build up on your dishes.<br />Run empty dish washer with 1T. citric acid in each dishwasher cups.<br />Then, for a few following loads, add one tablespoon to both cups along with your regular dishwasher detergent.<br />That will EASILY do the trick and you will be amazed. I continue to sprinkle a bit in with every load now and the hard water never builds up.<br />This is five huge pounds. It will last for a crazy long time.<br /><br />Washing machine (top load): If you have a smelly washing machine that makes your clothes and towels smell funky...<br />Completely fill your machine with HOT water.<br />Throw in about 3-4 tablespoons of citric acid.<br />Run cycle for 2-3 minutes.<br />Stop cycle and let it set overnight (about 8-10 hours)<br />Turn machine back on to finish cycle.<br />Run a full load of towels with 1 tablespoon of citric acid only. NO detergent.<br />Run towels again with regular detergent.<br />This should clear things up. The hot water overnight cycle should be done approx once per month to prevent build-up.<br /><br />Front load (HE):<br />I would suggest researching this. The same method as the top load will help, but front load machines can build up nastiness like crazy and need to be wiped and cleaned in different areas.

review/text: After searching for Finish Glass Magic in our local stores and on the Internet (shelves are empty of Glass Magic and have a small canister of Finish Booster which does not provide more bang for your buck), I decided to try Citric Acid and a teaspoon added to dishwasher soap (I use powder) does a great job of producing sparkling clean, spot free dishes and glasses.  The added bonus is that Citric Acid can be used for other household cleaning projects and in baking and cooking.<br /><br />As an added note, I have noticed that in some stores genuine TSP is also hard to find which could be used sparingly in a load of dishes.  PHOSPHATE is the magic word and why our cleaning agents no longer clean as they used to.  If you see (PF) next to a brand name on the package, it means Phosphate Free and why our clothes and dishes don't seem as clean before Phosphate was eliminated.

review/summary: Strong citric acid
review/text: Keep in mind citric acid is not the same as ascorbic acid, which is vitamin C. It can be used to preserve vitamin C in canned foods though. It can also be used to add a sour taste to food, in beverages, to buffer the effects of hard water in laundry to make soap work better. Any acid can buffer the effects of hard water though, white vinegar is a cheap route to go usually. But for clothes you don't want a vinegary smell.<br /><br />Personally I use a small pinch in neti pot solutions. It enhances smells and seems to clean out my sinuses better when it's used. In 8 oz of water my recipe is a very small pinch of citric acid, 1/4 tsp of a no-additive salt, and 1tsp of xylitol.<br /><br />50% of the world supply of citric acid is from china if that makes any difference to you. Personally I'd prefer citric acid that was marked as made in the US, but that was hard to find.

review/summary: Great stuff, I use it for safe cleaning of iced tea stains
review/text: I drink home-made iced tea as my primary drink, and store it in stainless steel jugs in the fridge.  Over time, the interior of the jugs became stained and soaking/scrubbing them with normal soap and scrubbies did nothing.  I didn't want to use anything harshly chemical, and figured, hey, citric acid is a consumable food, but also an acid, why not give it a try?<br /><br />And it works great.  Now, as a jug is emptied I put a couple of heaping tablespoons of this stuff in it, fill it with hot water, and set it on top of the fridge to do its thing overnight.<br /><br />In the morning I pour out the citric concoction, and wash out the inside with a scrub brush, and, voila, the inside is sparkling clean!  It's like a miracle, and I love that it's not some chemical concoction that could possible leach into my beverages.<br /><br />Note that I also used the same technique to clean out the plastic reservoir for our dog's water bowl.  Great stuff at a good price!

review/text: I use this for homemade automatic dish detergent.  It works well and this is a good price for this amount.  You will want to repackage it after you open it.  The package did not open during shipping, but the bag is not really made for reclosing and tears easily.

review/summary: Worked really well for me :-)
review/text: I actually ordered this because I wanted to make my own natural dishwasher detergent. It worked really well with my recipe. It also worked well as a replacement for lemishine, which is what I usually add to my dishwasher to help clean due to the hard water in Phoenix. I got a lot for my money, and it has lasted for a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to change over to natural cleaning products.

review/summary: Cleaned Fogged Glassware in Just 2 Washings
review/text: Our water is medium hard (between 120 and 150 mg/l according to the data from our municipal supplier -- Bolton Point Water System near Ithaca NY -- data is available on the web). It doesn't take long for glassware to get cloudy gray film on it. We were seriously thinking about putting in a water softener to deal with this but decided to give this citric acid a try. Well, running those glasses through the dishwasher just once (with one tablespoon of citric acid and the rest Cascade Complete) took about 75% of the film off and after one more pass it was totally gone. Talk about sparklying glassware --- amazing, just about beyond belief.

review/summary: You can eat it and use it in your dishwasher!
review/text: This is food grade citric acid so you can cook with it and use it in your dishwasher too.  I've done both, but I'll get more use out of the remaining 4.95 pounds in my dishwasher.  It works as well as the lemon-shine product to remove mineralization on my dishes and silverware.  I use about 1tbsp per load.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews say it was poorly packed, but it is in a fairly sturdy plastic bag so I had no problems.

review/text: I purchased this to start making my own dishwasher detergent.  I was very happy with the price.  The shipment arrived packaged as expected and in a reasonable amount of time.  I went ahead and transferred it to a large plastic container for storage.  It was pretty clumpy, and I've noticed that my detergent gets clumpy as well.  This is my first time using citric acid, so I don't know if it's a brand thing or just an issue when working with citric acid.  Overall I am able to get clean dishes for a great price, so I'm happy!

review/text: I have purchased a lot of citric acid from iffy sources and been disappointed by it's lack of purity. So, I was very happy to see Amazon carrying a good quality citric acid at an affordable price. The granules in the Spicy World Citric Acid all seem uniform (important when you want consistent results), the color is good (no yellowing), it wasn't clumped or sticky. I will definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Why did I use Lemi Shine for so long?
review/text: I've got a well and VERY hard water, and scale is a problem in this house.  For years I've used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047528HM">Lemi Shine</a> in the dishwasher, in the laundry rinse cycle, and to clean sinks and bathtubs.  Because Lemi Shine is even more expensive here than it is locally, I figured I'd try citric acid.<br /><br />I wish I'd tried it years ago.  It works just as well as Lemi Shine, and is far cheaper.  Packaging wasn't a problem, since it was double-bagged.  I didn't want to store it in a plastic bag, so I refilled my old Lemi Shine container (about 12 ounces worth) and then poured the rest into a 2-litre bottle.  It was a perfect fit, and seems to be keeping the citric acid from clumping.<br /><br />I've signed up for Subscribe and Save.  If you've got hard water, I recommend this.

review/text: I use the citric acid to remove rust from my dad's old tools.  It is simple and does the job well. When finished, I dry the tools and usually spray them with some kind of protective spray or I may paint them with Rustoleum.  I don't usually measure the solution, but I started out using a 5-10% solution years ago, and i just eye ball it now.  The mixture is not harmful so I just dump the remaining solution in the back yard.

review/summary: A little goes a long way
review/text: I was wondering how much "acid" I have for my bucks.  1 teaspoonful makes about 8 cups of sour water.  Yes, I tested the ph with my tongue.  1 teaspoonful weights may be 1/8 of an oz.  I used an electronic scale, but didn't remember the details what I did with the numbers.  So, this 5 pound bag makes a huge amount of "lemonade".  For hair and skin use, it's basically an unlimited supply.  For laundry use, the powder can be conveniently added to the rinse cycle dispenser with sufficient concentration, and economically competitive too.<br /><br />Yes, vinegar are citric acid are different things but I will replace the former if I can.  It's hard to explain to kids that their hair will smell foul for a brief few minutes after a hair wash.  And that the washing machine smell foul before the rinse cycle starts.<br /><br />The double bagged powders arrived safely.  Why would you keep the powder in the original bag?  Use a cut out soda bottle and at least it's easier to carry around and easy to re-seal.

review/summary: WAY better than canned (prep instructions included)
review/text: I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos.

review/text: When my local co-op stopped carrying this product in bulk, I was nearly in despair.  In my opinion, this is the very best refried bean product you can ask for.  I often mix the prepared product with TVP, ground meat or sausage ("real" or vegan) and salsa for a very tasty pseudo-Mex-curry type dish served over rice or tortillas.  The only draw-back is the sodium content, but I can live with it.<br /><br />This arrived in 3 individual plastic bags in one cardboard shipping box.  I'm very pleased and I hope Amazon keeps this configuration available.

The food is pricy, the packaging isn't flashy and the name may not be well known - but this food is working for us.
