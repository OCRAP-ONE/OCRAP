review/text: This is my favorite flavor of Extend Bar! It really holds you when you're on the run and don't have time for a meal but don't want to eat fast food or junk food snacks. I have recommended it to family & friends with only good feedback from everyone. It's also a great snack to have at night instead of cookies, chips, ice cream etc.<br />One of my doctors sells them by the case at her office for diabetics and people needing to lose weight, since it's low calorie and low carb.

review/summary: A Diabetic's Dream Come True
review/text: This is hands down the best bar for diabetics on the market.  I have tried them all and then I came across these bars on Amazon. They are clinically validated to help control blood sugar for up to 9 hours and are packed with nutrients.  I eat 2 bars a day and I control my appetite and blood sugar bette rthan I ever have.  I just wish they were on the auto reorder program.  You also need to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUTRLW">Extend Bar Chocolate Delight, 15-Count, 21.16-Ounce Box</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV0GMU">Extend Bar Peanut Butter Crunch, 15-Count, 21.16-Ounce Box</a>bars.

I am a diabetic, so I am glad that they taste good, but $1.00 an ounce is way too much.  15 in one box and they are small.<br /><br />The only way I would buy them again is if they lowered the price.  They would be good if you eat a large amount for your meal and just want that taste of chocolate and you cannot eat the regular chocolate.  This has "sugar alcohol" instead of sugar.

review/summary: For those  who like mild coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig in the office for guests (and myself) but I learned that most of my guests prefer a lighter roast than I do. After tasting the Veranda Blend, I found it was light, but very aromatic and you could still add sugar and cream and it was very similar to a good restaurant coffee. So when supplying choices of blends for guests, I'm including Veranda as a milder blend for those who don't like French Roast or Sumatra or other bold blends. I find that there is a bit of woodiness, but also a slight flavor of nuts and cocoa. It's a pleasant blend of coffee and a very good cup if you don't want something awfully strong. Some lighter roasts are acid to me, but this one seems to be balanced.

review/summary: Caffeine Kick Without the Stomach Burn
review/text: After trying this new roast at the store and loving it, I was thrilled when I was offered a free sample of the k-cups to try on my office machine.<br /><br />Same as the store brew, mellow taste (to me that means no burnt after taste) and a high caffeine hit.  I am not a coffee aficionado so I cannot tell you about the cocoa or toasted nutty flavors that they tout.  What I can say, is that if you are looking for a simple blend that will give you the morning or afternoon kick that you need without leaving an acid stomach burn, try this coffee.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive as compared to brewing your own coffee from store bought beans in your Mr. Coffee, but that is the point.  You are brewing a fresh cup in the comfort of your own home without having to get out of your fuzzy slippers or in some cases, brushing your teeth.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a luxury and stop complaining.

review/summary: Best Coffee From Starbucks Yet, But, It Comes at a Price..
review/text: Brewed on the 10 oz. setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer, the first thing I noticed was the very nice, enticing aroma.  Could this possibly be the perfect K-cup?  I had to have a sip before I even sat down.  In that first sip I tasted some strength, some choclate and nutty overtones, followed by a smoothness I don't typically find in a Starbucks blend.<br /><br />For  the most part I don't drink Starbucks for several reasons.  First and foremost, they tend to over roast their beans and the result is an overly strong and somewhat bitter brew.  This Veranda Blend "Blond" brew isn't roasted so darkly and finally I can taste the real flavors in the coffee.  This coffee actually reminds me of what a good "Donut Shop" coffee used to taste like; before everything became darkly roasted.  But I stray...  The first sip as I said was very inviting with lots of interesting flavors and a lively yet balanced acidity.  As the coffee cooled in my cup the flavor changed a little.  It became more woodsy and earthy but with a bit more acidity.  Still a good cup that comes close to my favorite K-cup, Millstone's Fog Lifter.  Foglifter is a blend of both dark and light roasts in which the flavor doesn't change as the cup cools, the first sip is as good as the last.  The acidity is always balanced whereas with this Veranda Blend the acidity becomes slightly more pronouncd.<br /><br />I usually prefer a light to medium roast in the morning and throughout the day.  In the evening I like to relax with a darker roast or better yet with a real espresso (which sadly cannot be made in a Keurig).  My verdict for the Veranda Roast is that it will fill the bill for my everyday coffee if and when the Millstone Foglifter either isn't available at a reasonable price or is out of stock.<br /><br />The price you pay for this good Veranda Roast is, well, the price, and this is my reason for the deduction of a star.  Starbucks has long been priced higher than other coffees and the Veranda is no exception.  This is only a 16-count box which means we're paying right at a dollar a cup.  At the Keurig website I can buy Foglifter for around sixty-two cents per cup when it is in stock.  Am I being cheap?  Maybe.  I just don't find Starbucks to be worth the extra money just to have the brand name.

review/text: Starbucks must think their coffee is made of gold.  A much higher price, and only 16 in a box.  While I agree with most others here, the taste is very good, but not worth the money.  If you want Starbucks Blonde, buy a bag and get one of the ecobrew cups and make it that way.<br />Update:  I went and kept track of the number of cups I could get from a bag, and you can easily get 25 cups from one bag which costs about half of what these k-cups do.  I won't post prices, but you can do the math.

review/summary: A Treat in a Brown Box...
review/text: First and foremost, having enjoyed the 'Blonde' variety of Starbucks since it's conception, it's pointless for me to tell you that I buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today.  What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!

And of course, WAY over priced. Why is starbux almost 5 dollars more than all the other brands? In this economy? Guess he really needs the cash to fund more illegal settlements. The weakest coffee I've ever had. Horrible.<br /><br />Whats more? Theres a starbax on a corner not far from my house (go figure)...and it's amusing to see the lemmings line up around the building to pay $5 for a cup of coffee, when 3 blocks over is a small mom & pop Cuban grocery (family owned) that makes the best Cuban coffee this side of the everglades, made fresh to order. Not a soul in the parking lot, I jump out ask for a grande con leche with sugar. It's 16Oz. for $1, and not a penny goes to fund any illegal settlements in Palestine.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE these
review/text: There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them.  Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large.  None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Amazon and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day.<br /><br />That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things.<br />They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not "slime" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.)  He loves to set one on my desk as an "offering," which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews.<br /><br />Additionally, they double as a great "fetch" toy in the yard.<br /><br />Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process.<br /><br />Really a great idea, and a great product.

Everything the positive reviews say about them is true . . . they're a really good option because they don't splinter easily and it takes a good while for my pack of sniveling, snarling, white hot balls of canine terror (wiener dogs) to wear them down.  They eventually get small enough that they become choking hazards and you have to toss them.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in highly recommending deer antlers as a chew for dogs.  It's only that after first buying this brand, I then ran across real, honest to goodness deer antlers that were comparable to these in every way at a local pet store for almost exactly half the price of these.  If you can't find real antlers locally or online for a better price, these are absolutely fine.  But do look around first.

review/summary: Excellent purchase, and much bigger than expected
review/text: After reading the reviews about how some customers received an antler piece that was too small, I was concerned that the same thing would happen to me and purchased a medium sized chew for my Japanese Chin.  When I received the chew, I was surprised to see how big the antler piece was! My dog definitely loves the chew toy; she sniffs at it, and tries to chew on the end.  However, it's much too heavy and long for her to carry around happily, and she will inevitably give up on the chew.  I will be giving this chew to my friend's dog, who is a Destroyer of Toys (bit the nose off a rubber squeaky pig) to see how she likes it.  I have already ordered a small sized chew for my dog.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint is that the size estimate is really too vague.  4-6 inches for the medium?  Well 6 inches is 50% more than 4 inches.  I'd like to see the sizes more exact.

review/summary: BEST Dog Chew!!!
review/text: My 85-lb lab destroys anything he decides to chew, including the biggest, toughest rawhide, smoked bones, rubber tires, even granite kitchen countertops...that is until he got these moose antlers.  He stays occupied for hours.  He has been chewing consistently on two antlers for over nine months now.  Needless to say, these are WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!  (As a comparison he just mowed through $10 worth of tennis balls in less than a weekend).<br /><br />Definitely will buy again and highly recommend!!

review/summary: Good quality, dense, long-lasting
review/text: I've now tried various antlers for my dog from several different companies.  Some were much smaller than advertised, and/or old and chalky, and some splintered severely.  This antler was sized as advertized, and is holding up very well.  My strong chewer is only able to slowly wear down the ends, and it doesn't make a mess or splinter.

review/text: I ordered this product expecting it to to look like the picture shown.  When I received the antler it was about 4inches long and extremely thin (in width).  I have bought antlers for my puppy in the past who is an aggressive chewer and they have lasted for months.  This one is almost gone and it has only been a few days!  Definitely not worth the price and not as pictured!

review/summary: Pleasure for the dog and Sanity for me
review/text: I have an 18-pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who is addicted to chewing bones, toys and anything that might be questionable by a human.  He absolutely loves these antlers and I am happy to buy them for him.  This is my third purchase and the medium lasts my boy about 3-6 months depending on where he "hides" them.  This is one of his absolute favorite chew things (other than that blue monkey which ended up in the garbage).  I love this product because I do not worry about him choking or if it is okay for him to be eating plastic.  This product also gives me some peace and quiet since my buddy is entertained for so many hours, he does not bark at me.  WE BOTH LOVE THESE!

review/text: My 13Wk old Mastiff puppy loves these. I've already ordered two mainly because she runs off and chews on them under the beds then I can't find it later when I want her to stop chewing on people. The price wasn't bad for me $12 I think for the Med. I think that is mild in comparision to all the other chew toys i've bought that she wont even look at! The antlers dont smell and she has been chewing on one for about a month and it has barely made a dent. As long as she continues to be a chewer, I will always reccomend these!

review/summary: definitely not my idea of xtra large
review/text: This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.

review/summary: THE BEST CHEW ON THE MARKET
review/text: I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog "Swiderski," and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.  God does work in mysterious ways.

We've bought several of these things over the past year.<br /><br />They may seem expensive, however compare what you pay for rawhide chews over time, and these are well worth the money for how long they last.  Rawhide chews are not bought by us anymore, and we're saving money even after buying these.  Do the math.

review/summary: FINALLY something that my girls can't chew through in minutes!
review/text: We have two dogs that are just over one year old (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian.)  And boy do they like to chew.  When they were puppies we could get away with the conventional chew toys, but as the girls got older, their chewing muscles got stronger.  They now destroy any plastic chew toy in minutes.  Eventually we found bully sticks, which are wonderful distractions for those evenings when the girls have more energy than I do, but the sticks would still only last about 60 minutes.  And then we met the deer antlers...PERFECT! The girls love to chew on them and the antlers last and last and last.  The antlers arrived and were approximately 6 inches long.  I didn't have much hope of them lasting since they seemed kind of small and the girls really went to town chewing on them.  But for weeks now the girls have chewed on the antlers and there is still barely any gone.  Oh deer antlers...where have you been all my life?  :-)

review/summary: Product does not live up to reviews
review/text: Over the last several months I have been hearing about deer antlers and I've done a lot of research and read lots of reviews before I decide to try this product. I have three black labs that have a chew product every night to help keep their teeth clean and thought this might be a way to save money and give them something new to chew on. Although the cost was kind of expensive, I felt it was worth trying.<br />I was excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. The deer rack was a good 7-9 inches or more long as described, had very little smell, and is very hard compared to something like rawhide or other types of bones one might buy. These antlers were more then twice the size of the ones I seen at local pet stores in the area and only about 1/3 of the price.<br />Needless to say, all three of my girls chewed on their antlers for about 10 minutes and have not looked twice at them again. I might not be surprised if my dogs were picky but I find it interesting since my girls eat anything and everything. Perhaps if your dogs have never had anything to chew on in their lifetime they might like this product. Other then that, the product is a waste of money.

review/summary: An Extremely Exotic Drink
review/text: While reading a copy of Saveur from January 2007 a few weeks ago, I found out about Sharbat Rooh Afza. This crimson syrup can be mixed into water, club soda or milk. I find I prefer this syrup mixed with milk as it brings out the floral flavors very effectively. While the magazine said this is infused with the essence of rose, coriander seed, watermelon and other herbs and fruits I found this version mostly contains sugar, fragrant screwpine, rose essence and xanthan gum. This drink is best when you mix nine ounces of water/milk/club soda with two tablespoons syrup. But you can adjust it to taste. Some people add it to lemonade or pour it over ice cream. In milk it reminds me of strawberry milk with a hint of rose.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: great drink AND not bad for you
review/text: i stumbled upon this drink (cranberry & pomegranate one) when i was at a gas station in Malibu after hiking all day and its easily become one of my favorite drinks. I wanted something good for me without a ton of fake sweetener or sugar and found this. It not only tastes great, but they use natural ingredients and real sugar instead of one of the many artificial sweeteners. And they do it right. Instead of overloading the drink with a ton of sugar they just use a little so it tastes amazing and doesn't have a ton of calories.<br /><br />It's just so nice being able to read and understand what everything is in the ingredients list. You can probably count the ingredients they use on one hand yet it doesn't taste like anything is missing flavor wise. And the pieces of aloe pulp were a pleasant surprise. In fact I would be very disappointed if they ever cut back on the pulp or fully removed it.<br /><br />Anywho, I love this stuff so much I order it by the case through Amazon and have one box delivered a month. I flip flop between two flavors and hope more cases of different flavors become available as i have replaced my daily soda with a bottle of Alo Appeal or Enrich. I would rather consume a small amount of calories and have something all natural then drink something with zero calories and a laundry list of ingredients that I have no idea what they are.<br /><br />And no, I'm not a hippie ;) i just appreciate things that taste good that don't rot my guys

review/summary: Everlasting treat ball
review/text: There is a definate reason these everlasting treat balls are always sold out of the big local pet food stores- they are fantastic! My dog is a very rough chewer- he can even rip apart kongs, and he loves these treat balls. They don't last him for "hours" per say as the package states, but enough time that I am able to have him busy when we have company over. It's especially helpful if you insert a treat ball in both ends of the blue ball, making it especially challenging to pop out the edible discs. Not for an everyday treat obviously, due to quantity and prices, but I will definately buy them again!

review/summary: Not Everlasting, but Not Bad!
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a><br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are pretty neutral smelling, which is a plus for this line. I know dogs are all about the smell of things and the stinkier something is, the more they like them...but when you have to share the household with a dog, you need to find a happy medium. This is ours when company comes over. It has no real smell, but they aren't her favorite either.

review/summary: Vanilla Mint is a hit!
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the liver flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (BBQ and Vanilla Mint). I put a Liver and a Vanilla Mint in the treat ball and she went LOVED the VM. It took effort this time to enjoy it, and she worked on it for over a week until there was nothing left but a disk of the treat in the treat ball (so I removed it, gave it to her, and put a new treat in the ball). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!

review/summary: Great Toy!
review/text: I was looking for something that would keep my dog busy, but also wasn't food that he would just eat and be done with.  This treat, combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball is such a great solution.  My dog (about 60 lbs, Dalmation) has so much fun trying to get this out of the ball, and he seems to love the taste of the Vanilla Mint more than any others.  This takes him a while to eat, but also isn't a lot of food.  it's a pretty decent sized treat.  When I first got it, it took him a while to get the treat all the way out, even days!  Now he can do it in an hour so so, but I still think it's a great buy.<br /><br />Just make sure to get the right size for your dog! Too small and they will rip it apart.

review/summary: All four dogs love these
review/text: I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is!  These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls.  We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each.  These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and  giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy.  Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but this is definitely the favorite followed by the barbecue/smoke one.  The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger.  Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.

review/text: I have two golden retrievers one is 10 mos old the other is 8 mos old.  Every now and then I need to actually get things done, and with two goldens its quite a challenge.  I like to give them their everlasting treat ball filled with the vanilla mint treat.  It keeps them quite and busy for about an hour.  The treats can be a little difficult to get into the ball and first, but the more you use it the easier it is.  It seems like the big box pet stores and also my local supermarket do not carry these in size large.  They only seems to stock small and mediums.  Very convenient ordering through Amazon.  If you need a little time, these work great to keep the pups occupied and they have nice breath too!<br /><br />Cheryl

Does produce a bit of a non-pleasant odor when thoroughly slimed by my voracious chewer Labradoodle.

review/summary: "Everlasting" is not quite a good description
review/text: I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by "everlasting" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.

review/summary: Dog loves it, but has some issues
review/text: I love Nylabone products due to their quality and their treats being made in USA. However, this treat has a couple of downfalls:<br /><br />-It is a softer chew, so it doesn't last very long. Within half an hour our young poodle - who has his mostly baby teeth - had devoured about a third of the chew. We had to take it away so he wouldn't finish it all at once.<br /><br />-The chew is made with an orange colored dye. This dye stains fur and whatever fabric your dog may be chewing on such as carpet or their bed.<br /><br />-The next morning our dog had loose stools that didn't smell very pleasant.<br /><br />I will probably get the small size as a tiny treat, but the large size is not recommended. Even (or maybe especially?) for a big dog, as they will eat it faster and could get tummy troubles after.

Bought 8 bottles and friends have loved it too. A few bottles have gone home with them.<br />Try this Mojito: Muddle 4 fresh Mint leaves in ice.<br />  Squeeze in 1/2 fresh lime juice<br />  1.5 oz. Monin Spicy Mango Syrup<br />  1.5 oz. of any Good Rum<br />  Top off with Club soda<br /><br />A perfect blend of sweet & a little spicy refreshing drink.

review/summary: The Best Mango Margaritas EVER!!!
review/text: I first tried a Spicy Mango Margarita during a food tour of Old Town San Diego.  I loved the drink so much, I asked the bartender how it was made.  She showed me the bottle of syrup used and I immediately wrote down the name and looked up the product on my phone.  I placed my order through Amazon right in front of the bartender!!!  I bought a case of four and will buy more as Christmas gifts to family and friends who also love Mango flavoring.  if you love mango flavor and a bit of zip to your drinks, you won't be disappointed with this product!!!

review/summary: Spicy Mango Chelada
review/text: This is by far the best syrup I found to make spicy mango cheladas (mix with Cerveza and peppers).  I searched far and wide to buy this syrup.  The only physical location I seen was a boutique store in Japan.  So I now get my supply from Amazon :)

review/summary: It works, and I love it!
review/text: So I bought it to try it, I'm on my 3rd day and I am loving it. It curbs my appetite, I eat a lot and I snack a lot, after drinking this I haven't snacked, there's a bag of gummie bears sitting on my table, and I haven't touched it yet. I will be ordering another set and we'll see if my fat starts shedding. I drink it after lunch, after eating. You're suppose to drink it with food in the stomach, it works until the next day! I love it!!

review/summary: The best cat food
review/text: I bought this for my two cats on a friend's recommendation. It's probably the best dry food I've ever given them. They love it. And they're incredibly healthy, with shiny, soft fur, bright eyes, and strong immune systems. I'm going to keep buying this brand.

review/summary: non-organic chicken meal as 2nd ingredient
review/text: Why would a pet food that calls itself "organics" have NON organic "chicken meal" as the 2nd ingredient? I'm disappointed by this and most of the organic pet foods that include non-organic chicken meal, like this one, Newman's Own, and the "Organix" brand, or the other one that seems to be rarely organic is the chicken fat.<br /><br />So far the only really organic dry cat food I've found (all the main ingredients are organic) is PetGuard, and wow is it expensive. Best price I could find it was about 1/3 more than Nature Organics.<br /><br />I hope Nature Organics will revise this product to only include organic chicken products.
