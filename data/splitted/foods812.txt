review/summary: Best litter for odor issues!!
review/text: Purchased locally, not on Amazon... but it is the same product.  Now that I see it on Amazon I will purchase here -- it is cheaper than at Target.<br /><br />I have been using this specific litter for about 16 months now and cannot rave enough about how great it is for odor absorbency. I grabbed this brand, really, just to try it... after a lifetime of being a cat owner I am compelled to try every cat litter I see on my quest for a fresh smelling home.  WOOHOO!  I hit the jackpot with this stuff!  My (wait, mine?) litter box is located in the basement laundry room of my Seattle home... plenty musty and damp.  So if any cat litter can handle cat urine AND that environment, it's got to be amazing.  Seriously, this stuff doesn't let any of that ammonia stench out into the air.  Ok, it does... but that's when the litter is overdue to be completely changed.  For reference, we empty the fecal solids as needed, and when we do, we mix together the non-urine saturated litter with the clean, blue litter.  And every 2 weeks we completely change the whole litter box.  I use a little more than half the bag at that time (MEANING... 2 BAGS SHOULD LAST A SINGLE CAT OWNER 4-6 WEEKS, depending on your specific cat and litter box location) Anyway, really - give this stuff a try and you will be hooked just  like I am.<br /><br />As for the other reviewer and the blue dust?  I really have no idea about that.  I don't have blue dust on my tables and washing machines (I just wiped mine down a few minutes after reading her review so I could see if I'd been breathing in blue dust).  I appear not to have that issue.

review/summary: Don't buy this!
review/text: I purchased this synthetic cat litter from Target for several weeks, thinking that the odor control was very good and that it was more convenient to scoop less frequently.  For the first few weeks, I loved it and continued purchasing.  We keep the litter box in an small unused bathroom in our basement.  This fall, my inlaws came to visit and would be staying in the basement on an extra bed.  In preperation, I cleaned the bathroom and was horrified to discover a thick layer of blue dust all over the bathroom.  It clearly showed on the white paper towels!.  It was everywhere.  On the walls, ceiling, floor, behind the door, etc, and it was thick.  For a synthetic product, the amount of dust was unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product.  I have returned to traditional litter, and am disgusted thinking about the amount of blue dust that has probably been circulating our house.  We've never had a dust problem with litter before and clean the bath room ever few weeks.  I could not believe the amount of dust on the ceiling! Simply unacceptable.  There is no excuse for a sythetic product that is supposed to be absorbant to spew blue particles into the air, our lungs, and the environment I live in.  Avoid.

review/summary: Best litter ever should come in 20lb bag
review/text: I love this litter.  Of all the litters I have tried, this one surpasses all of them.  I have two large cats (Bengals) and I tried this litter to see if it could hold up for a week when I went away on vacation.  First, it limits the mess cats leave when they exit the box. Second, I did not smell the box when I entered the house and it doesn't bother my cats in any way.  To get the best use, you should remove deposits from the litter box daily.  Don't let it pile up. Stir the liter to reactivate it so that the wet litter can move the bottom and the fragrance can reactivate.  You will also enjoy it's benefit.

review/summary: One of the best of the French coffees
review/text: I once read of the French people, they are as picky as the Americans when it comes to coffee.  Their demand was they want their coffee dark, rich, and they want it cheap.  This coffee fits that demand plus it is very smooth, smoother than American version French Roast which I hate.  Want to try some real French coffee?  This is one of the best.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!!!
review/text: My husband and I love heart.  This producer ships quickly and the meat arrives still frozen solid.  We thaw one a week and slow-braise them with fabulous gravies (usually including sliced apples) but heart is also good cooked on the grill and kept pink inside.  There are many good recipe ideas on the internet.  My only tips would be to not get too crazy trying to cut away all the meat from the silver-skin and tubules - in other words, there will be a lot of meat still attached to the bits you throw out (but the dogs will eat it all up!) and also to have your knives really sharp.  Even with throwing out quite a bit, you will still be left with enough good meat to serve at least 6 adults.  If you've never tried heart - give it a go!  It is considered muscle meat rather than organ meat like kidneys or liver and is very flavorful with a pleasant chewy texture.  Check out You-Tube for cleaning and slicing instructions.

review/text: This is a product, not seller, review.  The seller was fine; very prompt delivery, and I would order other Nissin products from them again; but not the Hearty Chicken Cup Noodles.  It was a disappointment; not up to the quality of the other Nissin Cup Noodles line, which I like and continue to enjoy.  This Hearty Chicken was hardly hearty.  Just noodles and chicken broth, and rather bland.  I was expecting a richer version of their old Creamy Chicken Cup Noodles, but this product has no veggies or chicken meat, and far less zip.  It is decidedly inferior to their regular Chicken Cup Noodles.

review/text: I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Busy Bone Chewbone treat. He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15-20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.

review/summary: IMPORTANT: Please Read!
review/text: Amazon is scamming all the customers who buy this based on the reviews.  This webpage used to be for the Sugar-Free "Caramel" syrup made by Torani which I have been buying for years.  Recently, however, Amazon has been shipping the "Classic Caramel" flavor instead.  Classic Caramel, however, is a different product, and the taste is terrible.  I cannot get anyone in my household to drink coffees made with it.  Note that Amazon does not allow returns on grocery items.<br /><br />Please also see the review "Flavor not what it usually is."  I complained several times to Amazon that they were shipping the wrong product.  They assured me it would not happen again.  Appalling, but what Amazon did was to rename this SAME page to Classic Caramel and even change the picture.  But, note that the UPC is for the original "Caramel" product.  You will also find an occasional reference to "Caramel" on this page, but note that the reviews you see here are for a DIFFERENT product.<br /><br />Finally, do yourself a favor and get the plain Caramel and not the Classic Caramel.  It is 10X better.  I can go through a bottle of the regular Caramel in less than a week.  The regular Caramel is sooooo good.  In comparison, no one will drink the Classic Caramel.  Shame on Amazon.  They should have just made this Sugar-Free Caramel page "No longer available" (which it is elsewhere).  Note that they also added a second "Classic Caramel" page (with the correct UPC), but the description, etc., cut-and-pasted from this one.  Don't buy that either.

Although some of the older reviews for this product state that Amazon is carrying a different flavor of Caramel, I decided to order anyways, and Amazon is definitely back to carrying the standard SF Caramel flavor.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites of the Torani syrups.  I use it not only in coffee, but also in baked oatmeal with apple -- it tastes like a healthier version of a caramel apple!<br /><br />Amazon also carries it in the plastic bottles, which I like so much more than the glass bottles since they're lighter and won't break if dropped.

Torani sugar-free syrups are every bit as sweet as the regular syrups, but without all the calories - and no after-taste that you can get with some sugar-free products.  Torani is half the cost of Starbucks syrups, and taste every bit as good.

review/text: I've been ordering Torani Sugar-Free syrups for quite a long time (currently subscribe to Caramel) and they are perfect for guilt-free sweetening of coffee.  I previously used flavored creamers, much too heavily I might add, as my go-to sweetener + creamer for coffee.  By switching to a couple squirts using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GSK4CW">Torani 750 ML Syrup Pump (Pack of 5)</a> I am able to get by with just barely a splash of creamer which cut down the calories, sugar and fat considerably!<br /><br />This is definietly a great deal as a 3-pack and really is a versatile flavor even when using it with a flavored coffee.  I only wish they sold Sugar-Free Salted Caramel in the same manner with subscribe & save as that seems to taste better when I make Iced Coffees at home.  I still order those directly from the Torani website but actually would prefer if they came in plastic bottles like these Sugar-Free Caramel do.  (By the way, the shipping directly from Torani has got to be the best packaging I have ever experienced from any company that deals with glass bottles!)

She loved the taste, but had use more than called for to get the taste she wanted. Just a side note, she likes her coffee strong, and sweet!

review/text: This is a very good deal. I live in an area where fancy things like sugar free coffee syrup are difficult to find in the grocery store. Getting a 3-pack saves quite a bit of money.<br /><br />I really like these syrups. I use them daily to add flavor to my coffee. A spoonful adds a delectable amount of sweetness and a hint of flavor. I can't detect a foul fake sugar aftertaste.

review/text: I was a little skeptical about how a sugar free syrup would really taste, but my wife doesn't really enjoy coffee unless it's flavored with something other than plain old sweetener.  I ordered this and tried it out, and she was amazed how good it was.  I tried some myself (I'm not a huge fan of syrup in my coffee), and even I have to admit it's pretty darned good.  If it didn't say sugar free on the label I wouldn't believe it myself.  I definitely recommend this if you like caramel syrup but aren't a fan of all the sugar/carbs!

review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker, but enjoy a treat now & then of ice cream sweetened by Splenda (no dangerous nutrasweet for me).  Using this tasty sugar-free syrup poured over vanilla ice cream & scattered with some sliced almonds is a much healthier treat & is safe for diabetics or those of us watching our calories & endeavoring to eat wisely.<br /><br />I've tried several sugar free syrups & this is my favorite.  Wish Torani offered all their flavors in sugar free, though some is better than none.

review/summary: cleaner, more concentrated flavor than it's corn syrup sweetened counterpart.
review/text: I am a diabetic, type 2, and a caramel iced coffee junkie. The cheating I did while buying these drinks with a sugar based syrup was unhealthy for me as was the cream used in them.<br /><br />I decided a homemade sugar free version made with 2% milk would be a better idea, so I picked up a bottle of this stuff. It's flavor is more concentrated somehow, in a great way, with no after taste, and a better buttery caramel flavor than the corn syrup sweetened blends. Also you can use less to get that better flavor because of the higher concentration.<br /><br />My recipe is pretty simple;<br />In a large tumbler add, one third ice, one third cold coffee, one third 2% milk, and one shot glass of the sugar free caramel flavoring. (I use decaf, but no one notices the difference)<br /><br />My family and friends agree, it's better than the coffee shop versions that cost three or four dollars.

review/summary: Inexpensive and lasts a long time
review/text: I've used this product for years. It's reasonably priced and it lasts for a very long time. Just a little will go a long way. It doesn't take much to flavor your coffee. In fact, if you use too much it leaves an aftertaste. A three pack will be in your cupboard for quite some time, even if you use it daily. My bottle has been in my cupboard for a couple of years since I don't use it daily and it still tastes great. While there may be better flavorings out there, I think what makes this particular brand great is that it's difficult to tell the difference between the regular and the sugar free, and I've tried both. Finding good sugar free flavorings is difficult.  I've found this available at my local Smart-n-Final if you want to try it out before investing in a three pack. The per unit price will be higher this way, but it will be about the same when you consider shipping costs. If you've tried this already and know you like it, the Amazon price is very good.

For some reason, it tastes so much better drinking it from a straw.<br /><br />Run it in the Magic Bullet and I have a calorie free drink that is great tasting.  I hate to admit it, but I use about 2 bottles per week.  I really love this syrup.  I also bought the chocolate calorie free syrup and would not recommend it.

Especially when you consider that the big named ones have sat on the shelf longer than this one has. What makes me the voice of authority? I am a buyer at a small grocery store.<br /><br />Price aside, this curry is far superior. Just smell it! Divine... Yes, it is a bit saltier than other curry powders out there; just keep in mind that you don't need to add any more salt to a dish. A quick meal can be made by dumping a good measure of this curry powder in a pot with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036QLLL2">Thai Kitchen Unsweetened First Pressing Coconut Milk (95% Organic),13.66 -Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and whatever veggies/tofu/meats you have on hand. Basically, you just stir, heat and eat. For a lip smacking snack, sprinkle the curry on sweet potato fries. Yummy! I've also tried a bit mixed into my egg salad, tuna salad and macaroni & cheese with wonderful results.

review/text: After my local paper gave a review of a restaurant and remarked on how much they liked the curry fries I tried them. They were the best fries that I have ever eaten. I made it a mission to find out how they spiced these fries. After some investigation I found that they used a Madras curry (southern Indian style of curry). I decided to order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00155CZC0">Madras Curry Powder (SunBrand) 4oz (113g)</a>. After deep frying some Orida Shoestring french fries I heavily sprinkled this curry on them. They tasted just like the ones that I tasted at Amsterdam Falafel & Kabob. They are soooooo good. I am defiantly impressed with the flavor of this Madras curry. I would heartily recommend it.

review/text: Wild birds just love this log of goodies. I've seen just about every kind of bird feeding on this suet. It is easy to hang on a wire to a tree limb or other hangers you may have.<br />There is a plastic stem in the middle with a "+" pattern at the bottom to hold the log on. At the stem top is a hole for you to hang your log in your desired location.<br />I just used a piece of coat hanger wire to attach the stem and then hung it on a limb then turned the wire over and around then back under the limb to attach the wire to its self with a fashioned hook.<br />Had to do this to keep wild animals from trying to take the log off the limb!

review/text: I buy the smaller version of these logs too and I love the size of these!  They're hefty and they last a while.  Easy to open and hang up with the built in hook eye.  They hold up very well in warm weather too.  A nice alternative to greasy suet.

review/summary: I like Stevia but this has NO lemon flavor
review/text: I've only recently started using Stevia, and I really love that it's a natural plant product that has no calories or carbs and that it doesn't mess with blood sugar levels.  I've bought some of the other flavors for my morning coffee - hazelnut, chocolate, vanilla and toffee - and really love them.  So when I found this Lemon Drop flavored Stevia I thought it would be good in plain or seltzer water.  I add regular lemon juice to my water sometime, but don't usually add any sweetener.<br /><br />I tried using these drops twice, and both times I ended up with sweet water without any lemon taste or smell.  I am very disappointed!  Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but I'm not wiling to pay $11 to try again.

review/text: I enjoy these wintergreen flavored lifesavers.  The flavor is refreshing without being too intense or overpowering.  I also like the texture of these lifesavers.  They are not as hard as conventional lifesavers; they have a softer texture, which is more enjoyable to chew as it crushes gently.<br /><br />I usually have one to two after lunch and my breath feels fresh for the rest of the afternoon.  A good choice of breath-fresheners!

review/summary: Hugely Improved Packaging!
review/text: I purchased the gift box about 2 years ago and was very disappointed with the packaging.  Much to my surprise, just recently, the seller contacted me to let me know they made changes to the packaging and wanted to send me the improvement to review again.  I must admit, the changes are wonderful.  The new box is sleek and attractive.  The package contents were nicely packed though perhaps the stuffing was a little bit over the top.  I almost missed the included jar of mustard (which is a wonderful addition) though everything was wonderfully packaged and actually looked like a present (last time it was sorely lacking).  If the seller is going to go out of their way to make changes based on reviews and customer comments, you know this is a seller to do business with again.  My next pretzel gift will be purchased from the San Diego Pretzel Company for sure.  My thanks to the seller!

review/text: DO NOT be freaked out by the ostrich! This tastes exactly like a slim jim- it is shorter and fatter in size, but the flavor and texture are the same. You would never know you weren't eating 100% beef. Gave it to a few friends telling them it was a slim jim and they loved it. They had no idea it was anything but. I wanted a high protien snack that was not as fatty as a slim jim- they leave a gross oily residue in your mouth. This product is low fat, low carb, high in protein and tastes great (seriouly, just like a slim jim). *The Ostrim Natural has no nitrates.

review/text: I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.  I'm not even half down with my first order and I already ordered a second batch.  This is just really good stuff, if you like beef jerky and beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  When you eat it the stick has a snap to it, tastes clean, not oily / greasy or fatty.  You taste just meat and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing and are thing about another.

review/summary: Acquired taste and great when delivered fresh
review/text: This tastes nothing like a slim jim to me so for those that claim it does, either they haven't had one in a long while or their mind is tricking them.  Most of my friends get a whiff of it before they try it and turn it down.  I'm Asian and trust me half of our food doesn't look tasty or smell good, but is often very good.  I love these sticks.  I will admit they are probably going to be an acquired taste for some.  I've only bought the natural from amazon.  I tried some of the other flavors and found them a poor product.  Their additional flavors were in harsh contrast to the natural flavor of the ostrich meat so I can see how some would see it as a turn off.  My personal opinion though.<br /><br />Like a few other said, I don't like the inconsistency.  Sometimes the quality is good, sometimes not. I'm wondering if there are dips in the ostrich meat market where they have to sometimes use meat they normally wouldn't.  Or if they were left in bad conditions too long during transport.  If the saltiness and dryness were consistent each time, I'd be much happier.

review/summary: Teriyaki Flavor
review/text: Got to say when I bought these I was worried about the ostrich, not  going to lie.  When they arrived however they  tasted great, on top of that they're low in fat and great for protein.  This is the exact reason I bought them because I'm trying to lose the last few pounds while gaining muscle. The thing is though that I still think Jack Links tastes better.  Jack Links Slim Jims are high in fat however but on the other side there jerky is low in fat and on top of that around 20g of protein per pack. I gave this product a 5/5 because it was so low in calories and still tasted good but I will say when I finish off with this last bit of body fat then Ill probably switch over to Jack Links because the higher amount of protein. Still great product because it's healthier, 5/5 stars.
