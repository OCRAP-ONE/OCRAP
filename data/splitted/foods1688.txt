review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: These chips have great flavor as is but I am more into the buffalo wings flavor more than the bleu cheese flavor, but it's a combo that seems to work well, I probably would like it even more if it just had the heat and flavor of just the buffalo wing sauce. And you cannot beat the crunch on these.

review/summary: Buffalo Bleu
review/text: I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer.

review/summary: Always delicious and always expensive
review/text: Kettle chips are always delicious,though a little expensive considering they're just potatoes.  WAY better than anything Frito-Lays puts out.  It's a shame that the independent chip companies are dying out at the local grocers because Frito-Lays crowds them out, when the independents are so much better.  Take a trip to your local Trader Joe's or Amazon to find good chips nowadays, and cheap too if you find them on sale here, cheap all the time at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: A very tasty chip!
review/text: These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips.  If you like spicy foods, you'll love these.  The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra "bite."  The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November.

review/summary: OK but not great
review/text: First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.

review/text: A big fan of kettle-cooked chips since I was a kid, I tend to go around buying any and all brands and flavors I can find.  As a result, Buffalo Bleu was on my list.<br /><br />I was in for a real surprise when I got my hands on this flavor.  It has a great taste -- not too sweet, not too salty -- and a nice crunch.  There's not really anything else to say; if you like good chips, give these a try.

review/summary: One of the healthier chips
review/text: Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.

review/text: These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead.

review/summary: A salty, spicy crispy delight!
review/text: This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds

review/summary: Stale, too oily to touch and tasted weird
review/text: I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss.

review/summary: Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE
review/text: I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!

review/summary: Check the label
review/text: The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.

I like this particular brand, it has the best taste overall with a nice spice taste.  I have discovered that the powder mix tastes just as good as what's served in the coffee shop.

review/summary: Very good instant chai mix!
review/text: I am so glad to have found that amazon carries this product.  My local Kroger sells it, but w/subscribe & save, it is substanitially cheaper!  For reference, Kroger normally prices this at three ninety nine for one ten ounce container, so a good savings here on amazon!!  I wasn't aware this product even existed until recently.  It is a little (almost too, I mean) sweet, but the spices are really nice.

review/text: I've tried most of the Jello Pudding Sugar-free/fat-free flavors -- and I'm re-ordering all of them.<br /><br />I have found that the Chocolate and the Chocolate Fudge do not dissolve as well, nor set quite as well, as the other flavors. They both taste great, and are only slightly different in flavor from each other. As sugar-free/fat-free ways to eat chocolate, they are wonderful. But it is more difficult to get these chocolates to mix and to not be runny.<br /><br />The chocolate fudge when it comes out runny does make a delicious sugar-free/fat-free syrup.

review/text: I usually but Harissa as a paste but my refrigerator tends to get overly full so I thought I would give powdered harissa a try. Very satisfactory taste, no bitterness, and adds a rich intensity to my dishes. I used it in a garbanzo bean soup and as a rub for lamb in a tagine. Very, very good. Then found out that it too, must be kept in a sealed jar in the frig. Oh well, even with needing to be refigerated I think I will stick with the powder. Great, well balanced flavor.

review/summary: Raspberry, Hibiscus, Great Tea!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do! It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me, but you should know it in case you're allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: This is absolutely the worst coffee I ever experienced.  I love the Subscribe and Save way to buy on Amazon, but had an awful experience with this coffee.  It brews lighter than a cup of tea, and so I thought there was something wrong with the Melitta One Coffee Brewer and tried an alternative method with a cup drip maker.  I ran it over the bag 4 times and got a correct colored cup of coffee that still tasted weak.  I know this is light roast, but this is not right.  Can't return this item.  Count it as a life experience that you can avoid.

It is tiny though.  Two or three rounds around my mouth and it's gone. I was figuring out when I could get it next and happened to think about Amazon.  Sure enough they had 12 packages for 15.88 or something of the sort.  It was cheap compared to what I paid at CM.

review/summary: Less Sweet than the Other Comparables
review/text: This syrup tasted really good.  It was probably my favorite of the 3 that I've tried because it is the least sweet.  It is still sweet but not as sweet as the others in my opinion.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.

review/summary: I only buy U.S. "grown" maple syrup!
review/text: I ordered this particular brand of maple syrup for a variety of reasons: 1. It's organic.  2. It's NOT Canadian!! Our family boycotts any products from Canada until that country discontinues bludgeoning baby seals to death for their fur. 3. It is grown & manufactured by a family farm that follows sound ecological standards.  So, when I received the syrup, I was totally happy that all the above was true plus it tastes great!  Not as thick as other brands, and that's OK. I highly recommend this product, and urge readers to support family farms, organically grown (mainly for environmental reasons), and to think about whose economy is being supported by your purchases.  Not to preach or anything!

review/summary: Had mold in the bottom
review/text: This maple syrup was very good.  I was very disheartened to find mold in the bottom of the bottle on my last serving.  I didn't think mold formed in maple syrup.  It was gross.

review/summary: Ruta Maya Organic Cubita is my favorite bean of the 3...!
review/text: I've tried these 3 Ruta Maya coffee beans-<br /><br />1. The Medium Roast is Very light, and compares nicely to a Breakfast type Blend (too bland for me).<br />2. The Dark Roast has an acid finish, and was bitter.<br />3. The Ruta Cubita is my favorite "distinctive tasting" bean, with No acid finish! It has Yummy chocolaty undertones!  :o)<br /><br />BTW!- I bought "2" 2.2lb bags from Costc*.com online, for $40 (Including S&H). You don't have to be a member (only a 10% non-member surcharge).<br />I freeze the extra beans in "Glass" jars (plastic bags breathe, and dry beans out!), and keep nicely.<br />Frost free freezer is bad due to temp change (condensation).<br />Never re-freeze/re-refrigerate, and thaw before opening.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 lb. bag
review/text: I started with 8 oz. of this product at first.  I loved it so much, I worked my way up to the 3-lb. bag in a relatively short time.  I use it in smoothies with coconut milk kefir, banana, carob powder, vanilla extract and stevia.  YUM!!!  I also blend hempseeds into my salad dressing recipes for a creamy, delicious dressing.<br /><br />I love the fact that the hempseeds stay fresh in the freezer for months.  I put some in a jar and keep it in the refrigerator so it's ready for me to use when I need it.

review/summary: Hemp for breakfast
review/text: Nutiva Organic Hempseed is a high quality prodcut. Hemp seeds are high in protein and essential amino acids with an omega-6 to omega-3 EFA ratio of about 3:1. I use about three tablespoons in my breakfast smootie every day so a 5lbs bag will last me about four months. I portion about about a month's worth, reseal the bag and keep it in the freezer so the seeds are still fresh by the time it's emptied. Good stuff!

review/text: I received my hemp hearts quickly in a vacuum sealed plastic bag and have just recently opened them after running out of my previous supply. They taste just as good as the ones I bought from my local health food store, and I love that I was able to buy them in bulk for a much better price online. Just make sure that you have a large container for storing them after opening if you do not have a way to re-seal the package.

review/text: Great product.  Helps tremendously in athletics.  I notice I have more energy and can play harder for longer durations when eating hemp seeds regularly.  They also fill me up so that I don't need to eat a big meal for lunch if I've had them for breakfast.  I typically cut up half a banana, take 2 Tbsp of raw, unpasteurized yogurt and 3 - 4 Tbsp of hemp seed and mix together.  Homemade banana yogurt with hemp seeds....great breakfast.

review/summary: I must have received a bad batch
review/text: I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again.

review/summary: Great Expectations not Realized
review/text: I had great expectations when I purchased these hemp hearts as someone at our local health food store was very enthusiastic about its ability to cut appetite and thus worked for weight loss and control  I found it pleasent to eat, tastes fine and texture is appealing although the seeds get caught in my teeth and under my gums so I need to brush, rinse and floss quickly after eating it.  I was surprise to read the fat content at 45 percent so I am only eating it with breakfast.  I don't think this is any miracle food supplement and probably will not buy again unless something changes with my experience.  I've used it for a month now with no noteable impact.

review/summary: Good Milk Subsitiute
review/text: Plenty of time to use before exp. date.(close to a year give or take) The flavor is very mild and won't throw off the taste of your recipe's.<br /><br /> I usually keep it in the freezer to keep it fresh. Follow storage insturctions on package. It will start to get an strong flavor as it starts to go bad. (just like flax or any other perishable food) I noticed that once when leaving some in the frige too long. (a couple of months)<br /><br />Mostly I use it for a subsitiute for milk. Just add water and/or other ingredients and blend. Great for drinking, cooking, and making "milk shakes". Or you could just use it as a sprinkle on your salads.

review/summary: I Love this seeds. Taste like Sunflower seeds
review/text: Hello,  I started to eat a little healthier, so I have to buy hemp seeds.  I am a Nutiva's consumer for 2 years now (coconut oil), so I know their product quality, and I wouldn't buy any other brand than Nutiva. I used few times a day: in my morning protein shake, with plain yogurt and in my strawberry smoothie. I need to loose weight, but I am not in a diet yet, but I lost 7LBS in 2.5 weeks. Like I said, I am not in a diet. I am not exercising, so I believe is the hemp seeds.<br /><br />For those of you who are trying to loose weight, I highly recommend you to buy the Hood� Calorie Countdown Fat Free Dairy Beverage. It only has 35 calories x serving, and  it has all vitamins and everything else than milk.  Google it.

My use of this food is too numerous to mention it all. You could try it on your salad , baking bread or pastries, as snack in a bowl of nuts, raisins,dried cranberries or whatever else that you might like. This food is so delicious that you could use it by itself and be happy with your choice. I recommend for people who do not know this food to give it a try.

review/summary: Bad taste and burn
review/text: I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.  Poor taste, plus a horrible burn all the way down my throat.  I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise.  Unfortunately I did not keep the packaging, since I had immediately transferred the seeds to glass containers to prepare for freezing.  These seeds are going in the compost bin (hope it doesn't burn the worms!)

review/text: Be careful when ordering.  The package I received was not air-vacuum sealed like previous orders.  As a result, the contents were comprimised, creating a rancid smell and bitter taste.  After one teaspoon I was forced to discard the entire contents of my 3-pound bag, which resulted in a complete waste of money.  Amazon does not allow returns for this product.  Buyer BEWARE.
