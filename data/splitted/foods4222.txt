review/summary: The best dog food
review/text: This is a phenomenal pet food.  I have used it for 5 years with two dogs and it's wonderful.  First, they think that it's delicious of course and eagerly eat it day in and day out. Second, it's been crucial for my pet's health.  Dog 1 had allergies and was scratching and putting her paw into her mouth.  After going on this food, she no longer had those issues and her coat looks fab. She's a black lab mix.  Dog 2 was adopted with horrendous inflammatory bowel problems and suspected allergies to common proteins.  We had to start him on a very restricted diet of only novel proteins and chose the Wellness Simple food.  He didn't enjoy it as much and when he was stable, we switched him to this and he did great.  He loves it and it has kept his gut stable.  Also a lab mix and his coat looks great on this food.  We use both the Wellness fish kibble and canned food.  Highly recommend.  It's pricey but as someone else said, cheaper than the vet bills!

review/summary: Attention AMAZON:
review/text: I think Amazon is doing a disservice to Wellness Dry Dog Food by mingling all the reviews together rather than separating the opinions out, based on the particular type and "flavor" of the Wellness food being reviewed.  I was researching the food for SMALL BREEDS and zeroed in on that particular type, but the reviews were all over the place talking about many of the other varieties.<br />My experience with using the dry Wellness for Small Breeds, both the regular type and the Healthy Weight type has been excellent.  All out mini dachshunds love the food, have beautiful coats and are very healthy.  My only suggestion is that they offer the SMALL BREED variety in super size bags.  Buying 12 lbs at a time is ridiculous when one is feeding multiple dogs, and many of us with little guys, have more than one..... the potato chip theory, right?

review/summary: The "dream food" of small breed overweight dogs!!!
review/text: This is it, look no further if you want a healthy, holistic dog food which supports  your dog immune system and keeps her weight under control. My dog was 2-3 pounds overweight and i had a very hard time finding a dog food which is good in nutritions and its low in fat. After 1 month my dog became lean and much more energized eating wellness healthy weight dog food. I believe all overweight dogs should be on this diet, its trully wonderful! I've tried other brands to help my dog lose those extra pounds, along with long walks, but this is the best! The best holistic weight management dog food.

review/summary: Best brand out there...
review/text: I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.  I was looking for a brand without additives that all my dogs would benefit from.  I have a few that need to lose weight.  Wellness makes the best product.  I buy the small bites for my little ones....pieces are small and they love it.  I but the Healthy weightCORE for my "dieters" and mix it with canned green beans or peas and carrots.  So far my Golden, who was an overweight rescue at 129 pounds, has lost 19 pounds -- she's been on this food for about 7 months.  I buy the original CORE version for my baby bulldog, who had a lot of gas.  No more smells and ripples in the night!  Amazon has the best price for Wellness. And its shipped right to my home -- no lugging big bags back and forth.  Yes, it's more expensive than the other stuff--but it really works.  And that will cut down on future vet bills.  All my dogs are healthy and have nice shiny coats.  Priceless!  Wellness now has a SIMPLE version for those dogs who suffer with food allergies.  A family member has a little Teddy Bear with severe skin issues -- she'd scratch until raw and bloody.  She switched to the SIMPLE version of Wellness and has been itch free ever since.  Again...great brand!

review/summary: Stop the scratching!
review/text: Dogs probably don't really want to spend most of their lives scratching, but it seems that's what they do.  After trying many foods on two dogs, Wellness has stopped that.  It must be the natural ingredients because when I've tried "supermarket brands" they go back to scratching again.  Thanks, but I'll just stick with this.  Coats are shiny, even after swimming and mud baths.  It's expensive compared to "supermarket brands" but a bargain compared to other holistic dog foods and the vet bills we used to have!  Many years ago, we started feeding it to our black lab and he showed significant improvement in a couple of days.  After he died, (he was 14) we eventually got a golden retriever pup and tried him on the cheaper food but he showed the same signs of scratching and dull coat.  We put him on Wellness and all symptoms cleared up quickly.

review/summary: Perfect for mini schnauzer
review/text: First let me say that every time i read some of the dog food recipes on the labels i begin to think that there are real bits and pieces of fish in the bag. lol but no. This dog food is phenomenal. My miniature schnauzer had been on puppy chow before i got him.( not the best) however i made the foolish decision to transition a pure breed mini schnauzer from puppy chow to Purina One. And that's when the problems started. My dogs coat went from a nice black with brown highlights to a black coat with his pale white skin showing under it. He looked sooooo sick and his coat felt really dull and wiry. He refused to eat any more of the Purina one and so i had to think fast. I had remembered that a breeder website (bijou poodles i was thinking about getting one) had listed some top grade dog food as one of their links. So i so Wellness Core as a good choice. Well I decided to go with the fish and sweet potato recipe and my dog was not disappointed. He loves the food and has began to get a lot of his color back.<br /><br />Bag: Very loud bag package. Plus i don't really like the resealable feature since it does not come with a zip lock. However if my dog gets into the dog food bag the material food be so loud my neighbors wood here it.<br /><br />Smell: awesome he lost his cool as sooon as i cut the bag open.<br /><br />Quality/quantity: Wellness does not do like some companies and make the bag really big, while theirs less than half the dog food in the bag. 15 pounds is exactly that, 15 pounds. Also my mini would eat a lot of the puppy chow at one time. However with Wellness he only needs about a half a cup and hes full!

review/text: I've fed my little pug this dog food brand all his life. Now as a young adult I feed him 2/3 cups of food daily. He's energetic, happy, and not over weight as pugs tend to get. He also has a very healthy and minimal stool - which is great because he is trained to use a litter box with a "permanent" type doggie pee pad (changed daily) in the bottom. Pudge is always ready to eat so, I try to give mostly healthy treats: maybe a few bites of veggies of my dinner plate and maybe a milk bone a few times a week. But he loves his Wellness and its made him a handsome, healthy little dude

review/summary: Best dog food we have fund
review/text: Wellness is by far the best dogfood we have ever fed our yellow lab.  Though it is expensive, we figure we spend the same amount  or less than we would through purchasing a cheaper food as we would need to feed more for the same caloric intake.  We get by with a thirty pound bag about once a month or so.  Our lab's coat is healthy, he has high energy, and his "movements" are solid... May be too much information.  However, that is one of the big differences I notice with cheaper dog foods.  To help with further comparison, our lab is 8 years old, is an active hunter nine months out of the year (waterfowl spring and fall, rabbits, upland birds), and he is an indoor family dog.

review/text: I will no longer feed my dog(s) standard grocery store foods though I did have a cocker spaniel live almost 17 years mostly on that before I knew better. This is a very good food. Good ingredients (meat should always be the first ingredient, not corn, wheat, etc). Can be a little pricey, so you may have to shop around, but it is worth it. You will occasionally find dogs that can't tolerate certain foods and this is no exception. So far hasn't been a problem for my dog after > 2 years of this particular type. Breed: Giant Schnoodle, ~66 lbs. He loves fish so this is perfect. If we're having fish for dinner (tuna, baked tilapia, etc), you can be assured he'll be nearby with his nose turned up somewhere sniffing around.

review/summary: My picky Husky loves this
review/text: I have a chow mix and a husky. My chow eats anything and is on the Wellness Healthy Weight (chicken flavor). My husky is really picky. She finally ate the Wellness puppy chow when she was a puppy after refusing to eat many other brands. At almost 2 years old I really wanted to change her to "big girl" dog food. She is still pretty skinny, because she is so active and still did not eat very much. I decided to switch her to the Wellness Core, but she constantly vomited. So I got the Wellness Fish and Sweet Potato since her puppy food had sweet potato in it too - hoping that she would eat it. NOPE. I guess she does not like fish!!! :-( Then I noticed that she likes my chows chicken flavored food, but the low calorie food was not ideal for her since she needs to put on a few lbs. So I finally tried this one ......... and BINGO ........... She LOVES IT!!! She can't get enough of it and always wants more. I am very happy with this food!!! And even better - it shipped from a location 30 min from my house, so ones it was shipped I had it the next day! The price is also about $10 lower than where I used to order Wellness before!!! So this is where I will always get it from now on! Thanks for fast shipping and a great price! I also recommend Wellness - its really a great food with real meat and NOT byproducts and tons of corn! ;) Your dog will love you for getting a great food!!! :)

review/text: My puppy loves it, and I love my puppy.  She doesn't eat a whole lot just yet, but she will soon.  Looks like it costs about $50-$60 for a month's supply.  Considering that I spend that much on myself in a week, I'll gladly spend that much on my sweet Layla for a month.  The better you spend on dog food, the less you'll spend in the veterinarian's office.  And that's exactly what I told my vet when I took her in for her rounds of shots, and she agreed wholeheartedly.  She only wants my money for routine office visits.  I firmly believe that Wellness dog foods will help ensure that you only take your beloved pet to the vet for routine maintenance.

review/summary: Picky dog gobbles it up!
review/text: I have two rescue chihuahua mix dogs (2yr old chiweenie 19 lbs. & 7mo jack-chi 9.6 lbs.). Both have started turning into butterballs from extra treats given during training as well as not enough walks, and could each lose 1-3 pounds. We've stepped up exercise but I still wanted a food that would help maintain their weight because they're both low to the ground and weight gain prone. My bf and I have been searching and searching for the "right" food to give them both. The choices and information on dog food is insane and combined with finding food they'll both eat is head spinning!<br /><br />The bigger/older one is super picky about all food and is known to spit out treats he doesnt like and to not even sniff new foods he hasn't experienced until u show him or break it up for him, but the little one will gobble anything in a flash. Previously we've had the oldest on Kirkland brand adult food and while he doesn't "love" it, he'll eat it with some waffling and overall its proven to keep him solidly healthy. After getting the 2nd pup who has typical jrt skin sensitivities I started researching foods to help him out and switched him from blue buffalo puppy to blue wilderness (also he stopped growing up and started growing out bc of too much puppy food richness which our older one also experienced when he was transitioning to adult). (As most know small dogs can stop growing much sooner compared to large dogs.) We tried to feed blue wilderness to the older one but found that he definitely turned his nose at it and given half and half portions preferred Kirkland over blue. In general I think blue is an awesome food but tends to be a little too calorie dense for our guys. Combined with their recent chubbiness and based on great reviews and ingredients, I decided to try Wellness Super5mix Healthy Weight for small breeds.<br /><br />We've only just bought some a few days go so I'll have to report back on weightloss, but we were super excited that based on first a small sample to each, then second when we mixed a meal with their old food they both immediately gobbled up the food. This is amazing because our oldest has always seemed to tolerate his kibble but hasn't ever loved any brands we've tried to date. This is the first time he's started eating a new food immediately!! My bf is also happy bc he would rather feed them the same thing than to have separate kinds for each like we were doing. I'm pretty sure we've found the "it" food that works for us!!!

They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination. I also feed the senior dog formula to my 100 pound German Shepherd dog as I believe it has given him wonderful joint health help as he ages.

review/summary: Some Diamond Pet Food Wellness are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/text: This food has been really good for my dogs!  Their hair is softer and shinier, their eyes are clearer and their energy is better.  Even though this is much more expensive than the food I had been giving them I find it a bargain because after more than a year I see a profound difference in their appearance and health.<br /><br />Also buying through Amazon has been an excellent experience!  I usually have the food within a couple days, the shipping is free and my delivery guy even brings it in for me!

review/summary: Makes my beautiful dog more beautiful!
review/text: We have an 8 month old beagle mix.  We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that.  My daughter picked up a bag of Iam's puppy food and that's what we were giving her the first month. Her poops smelled so bad from day one when we got her and didn't improve on the Iam's.  She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well.  She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself.  We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back.  She loves it!  She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).<br /><br />We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy.  We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing.  We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.<br /><br />She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!<br /><br />Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too!  Whoever was selling the puppy chow would take awhile for it to arrive but this one usually shows up in a day or two.  Do wish this was available at our local market though!

review/summary: after 10 years my dog feels great!
review/text: My dog is an 11 year old pitbull and has had a sensitive stomach, reoccurring chronic ear infections, and was always licking her paws since she was a puppy. She would get up to walk around and immediately throw up for no reason. This would happen sometimes several times a day. Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more. If your dog has any of the same symptoms my dog had, you should definitely give this food a try. It might not be a fix for every dog but it doesnt hurt to try. It worked for my dog!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food For Some
review/text: I have a 6 year male old lab mix that has had numerous problems with allergies, skin irritations, and digestive issues that could not be fixed through steroid injections or expensive medications.  When he was young I fed him Beneful and he did okay for a bit and then he would have medical issues.  Through expensive medical treatment, we would get him back to normal but it was only a short time before the next outbreak.  I tried everything.  Supplement pills, different foods, allergy medication, steroids, limited diet and nothing seemed to work.  He would get better and then back to being bad with him constantly itching, chewing his skin, and he just looked miserable.  It seemed as though this cycle would never end.<br /><br />Then while visiting my brother who owns a collie recommended this food because I kept commenting on how healthy he looked and how soft his fur was.  I was hesitant at first because I had tried so much and nothing had seemed to work.  I gave the Wellness Super5mix whitefish and sweet potato a chance.  All I can say is that he no longer has ANY skin irritations, his fur is shinny and soft, he has a lot more energy, and overall I would say he is in his best health every.  The change came after about 3 weeks of him eating the food.  We use to have to bath him once a week and with the Wellness food we bath him maybe once a month.<br /><br />But I will say this food will not have the same effect for every dog.  As some of the others on here have stated that their dog had loose stool issues and the dogs simply refusing eating the food, this is very true.  My other dog has no allergies what so ever and I figured if it worked for the one dog it should be fine for the other so I would only have to buy one type of food.  The non-allergic dog began eating the Wellness and had immediate issues with loose stool and upset stomach.  So I keep him on his old food which is just the average food you would find in any pet store.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you have exhausted all other efforts.  All I can say is that my dog is in his best health ever and it was only due to a better diet and more attention and with the help of Wellness.  I would recommend this food to anyone who shares similar dog problems as I have experienced.

review/summary: Quality kibble from a brand you can trust
review/text: My dog was experiencing skin allergies and had actually chewed her tail down to the bare skin. Her once shiny, lustrous coat had become dull and flaky and she was putting on extra weight to boot. After a trip to the vet (where she got a clean bill of health but I was told that she was about 8 pounds too heavy) I immediately switched her to this food and scaled back her portions on the advice of the vet. It's been about 6 weeks and the results are clearly visible. The scratching and the hot spots are gone, the coat gleams once again and the dog has shed most of the excess pounds.....she really seems to enjoy the kibble and happily scarfs it down when put in her bowl.<br /><br />Dogs react differently to different foods but I highly recommend giving this one a shot. It's worked wonders for my pup.

review/text: After two years on Eukanuba lamb and rice i thought i would try a different food for my choc lab just to give him a bit of variety.<br />He likes the food alot not surprisingly but the difference is after three weeks of eating it is that he is alot hungrier than he was before, his poop is alot looser, he is thirstier and his breath is not good. His coat condition and enery levels are very good though so a mixed bag for me over all. I will likely go back to the previous food with the next order.

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop. I did some research and decided to try the chicken super5mix and after mixing it into his food for about a week or so his stools became significantly less watery and it takes him about half the time to do his business than before (where I would watch him struggle and it looked painful and sad :( wonder what they fed him at the shelter ). He's my first puppy and I noticed that after a long time in the sun/we go out for a jog, he would have this weird funky smell like rotting chicken. I'm guessing that's his sweat smell. After about two weeks on Wellness the smell decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! His coat is also glossier. Leonidas hasn't been on this food for that long so I'm a bit hesitant to attribute the change just to food.. but I really think that's what it is. Bought the 15-lb bag to test it out last time, just ordered the 30. I'll try to remember to update this after he finishes it :)<br /><br />P.S. he also has MUCH less gas. win-win for both Leonidas and myself (but more for myself)

Seems to be extremely palatable, and our pup had no issues switching over. He's extremely active so we've been feeding him a little more than the recommended amount on the bag, and his weight and energy level have remained constant. Wonderful food thus far -- no stomach or gas problems, just a mild case of fish breath. Would recommend to anyone!

review/summary: Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein
review/text: I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine.

review/text: I've been a user of Susie's Hot Sauce for over 20 years.  My grandmother used it as well as my mother and other family members.  The sauce is so delectable to the palate.  The correct ingredients make the sauce tantalizing and pleasing to the consumer.  The sauce has just the right consistency.  Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Repeated consumer,<br /><br />Carla Parris

review/summary: My favorite hot sauce and the hottest I've ever tried!
review/text: I am a big fan of hot sauce and hot peppers. So when I went to visit Antigua last year and ordered food at a local restaurant called Putter's, I naturally put some of the Susie's hot sauce on my kielbasa dog. The taste was amazing, but my only mistake was completely underestimating just how hot this hot sauce is! Just a little is a enough to set your mouth on fire, and the heat sensation builds up in your mouth as you eat more food with this sauce.<br /><br />The taste is also unique and unlike any kind of hot sauce I've tried before. The ingredients say it contains hot peppers, mustard, vinegar, and spices. It is amazing how such a simple combination can make such a great taste. I liked the sauce so much that I picked up a bottle at a convenience store before returning to the US. I've shared with my family and they all like it too!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this sauce to everyone. It tastes best on fried food, but it can really be used on anything! The bottle says it won the 'Golden Chile Award' and 'Texas Shootout', so it must be good then. Although it is a little pricy here on Amazon, definitely buy one at least to say you tried it out. You'll be glad you did!

It's good as your breakfast caffeine and protein, lunch substitute or after dinner dessert. It's pretty much good any time of the day.

review/summary: best chocolate bar, period
review/text: This is the most amazing chocolate bar I've ever tasted.<br /><br />I usually eat dark chocolate with a much higher cocoa content.  70% is what I usually go for, I'll occasionally eat 85%, and anything less than 60% isn't really worth bothering with.  So at 55%, I didn't think I would even like this when it was first offered to me.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />High-cocoa dark chocolate is delicious, but I don't need very much of it for an enjoyable experience.  A half ounce or so makes for a pleasant snack, and I won't feel compelled to eat more.  But one or two or three squares of Almonds & Sea Salt is rarely enough.  The flavor and texture are so intense and wonderful that I might actually eat an entire 3 ounce bar all at once.  Not good for my weight, but a ringing endorsement all the same.<br /><br />The secret is the salt.  The interplay between chocolate, sugar, and salt is something that caught me completely off guard.  I've since sought out other salted chocolates, and there are some OK ones out there, but I keep coming back to Chocolove (the fact that they're a local company doesn't hurt either).

review/summary: Seriously Addicted
review/text: Delicious: this bar combines the perfect amount of salt, a creamy dark chocolate, and the right number of flavorful almonds. I have put myself on a Chocolove Budget, because I could sincerely (and have, sincerely) eaten a bar a sitting, multiple times a day. Such wanton indulgence is highly unusual for me! I don't consume chocolate or sugar like this outside of these bars!<br /><br />I first discovered Chocolove chocolates at a retreat center where groups of people would gather around 3-4 Chocolove bars instead of going out for drinks, or coffee, or dinner -- you know, normal social gatherings. That is the power of Chocolove's Almonds & Sea Salt in Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />You will likely join the addiction (and it's such a delicious addiction to have).<br /><br />You have been warned (and encouraged)!

review/summary: The Best Chocolate of Your Life
review/text: I'm sure there are some who could argue chocolate all day long and debate the merit of one chocolate over another based on ingredients, production, etc.<br />Really, I'm about how it tastes when you put in your mouth.  I'm not someone who normally has a sweet tooth.  Don't get me wrong - I like my sweets, but when it comes down to sweet vs. salty/savory, I will always pick the latter - until now...now that there is Chocolove Sea Salt and Almond I basically couldn't dream of a more delicious treat.  I have to ration myself to three squares a day.<br /><br />And let's face it: how could a food with a hard engraved on it not be good for you?!  Plus, doesn't chocolate like this have antioxidants that are good for you (never mind the joy hormones that will get released when you eat it).<br /><br />Just try for yourself, you won't be sorry (your hips might be sorry, but you won't).

And that's the response from a company that ships out of Las Vegas Nevada, which is hardly a temperate climate itself in the summer!  In all my years of dealing with online purchases, that had to be about the worst customer service I've ever received.  I won't be ordering from them again anytime soon.

review/summary: Great soy-free tuna choice!
review/text: My son has multiple food allergies, one of which is soy. Thankfully he is NOT allergic to fish, but in shopping for tuna he can eat, I've discovered that nearly all canned tuna has SOY in it (because it's packed with vegetable broth, which contains soy)!!! THIS tuna, though, contains only "light tuna & water," which makes it edible for my allergy-ridden boy. We stock up on our own allergen-free foods that can be easily stored long-term and used in emergencies if/when we can't get to allergen-free foods. Because of our food allergies, we wouldn't be able to borrow from the neighbors if there was a national disaster or some other emergency and we were on our own without power or access to grocery stores for a period of time. Having a supply of these quick protein sources on hand helps me rest at ease that if we ever had an emergency, I would still be able to feed my boy. The pull-tab tops are especially handy for this, as well as when we need a quick "on-the-run" lunch--don't need to worry about remembering to bring the can opener. Just pop, pull, drain, and eat. He loves them! Thanks, StarKist, for keeping ONE tuna source that's soy-free and providing our family with a valued protein source staple.

review/summary: Watch out for the lid on these things.
review/text: My low star rating is not for the product inside the can, but for the packaging. I loathe the SmoothPull lids on this brand of low sodium tuna. I would have given the product one star, but the tuna inside is tasty, so two stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, to get to the tuna - which, again I say, is tasty, flaky and you'd never guess was missing any sodium (and it really is low sodium, for canned tuna anyway, the nutritional data can attest to that) - you have to deal with the SmoothPull top (patent pending).<br /><br />These lids are designed so that once you pull up the tab, you can supposedly just give it a light tug and the thing pops right off, no peeling required. Let me tell you, the lid does not just pop right off. It flies off like it was spring loaded. Most of the time I wind up dodging a spray of juice and bits of food when I open these suckers, but this latest time I actually cut myself. These lids are sharp!<br /><br />So I'm going back to my old sodium rich brand of tuna unless I can find a low sodium brand with an old-fashioned lid on it. You don't always have to reinvent the wheel.

I usually get my tea directly from SL but when I run out I have to fall back on Dilmah...and having moved here from Australia (where the tea is widely available), I'm very happy that Dilmah is finally available in the US.<br /><br />Update - March 18th, 2010<br />I've been drinking Dilmah Premium for a long time now and love it but lately wanted to widen my horizon; With that in mind, I tried the Dilmah Supreme and Dilmah English Breakfast. Dilmah Supreme rated an average on my scale but ah, the English Breakfast! If you wish to have an extra special cup of tea, bold and rich in flavour with subtle nuances, then the English Breakfast is definitely your cup of tea! While more expensive than the Dilmah Premium, it is well worth the price! Enjoy...:)

I did request for a 100piece teabag packagings instead of 50pcs.....I guess....they may not have that kind of demand here in USA. I hope that they will consider sending 100pc per package..as it will be more cost saving, for customers like me.

review/summary: World's Best Tea
review/text: My husband and I returned from Africa where we were introduced to Dilmah Premiun Ceylon.  We have been tea drinkers for many years, but had never enjoyed our morning cup of tea like we did there.  On our third day in Cape Town the hotel resteraunt ran out of their supply and we were given another brand of tea...which we didn't even finish.  Instead we went to a local grocery store and purchased these tea bags for our use.  We will not drink other kind of tea ever again. I am so relieved to find in available through Amazon.  Please do consider bringing us the 100 count tea bag packages that we found in Africa.

review/summary: Excellant
review/text: Perfect taste and aroma. As soon as I opened my first box of Dilmah Tea I knew it was going to be good.  After years of becoming more and more dissatisfied with other brands, I knew there had to be better tea out there, somewhere.  This tea has the bold and distinctive taste I have longed for since visiting Europe years ago.  These so called herbal teas and blended teas on the market smell good but the taste is certainly a dissappointment.  I drink both hot and iced tea and Dilmah certainly has provided excellant taste either way. I am definitely pleased with Dilmah as well as Amazon for processing and shipping the order quickly.

review/summary: Great Ceylon Tea
review/text: When my husband moved to the states from London, he had a hard time finding a good Ceylon tea.  He would get Luaka in the specialty shops there and we couldn't find any place to order it online without spending a FORTUNE on shipping.  This tea is very similar in taste to the Luaka and the best Ceylon tea we've been able to find easily in the states.  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: All-time favorite!
review/text: I began drinking black tea when I lived in New Zealand. Dilmah quickly became my favorite, but when I returned to the US I couldn't find it much to my dismay. I tried every black tea on the market, but nothing compared to "my Dilmah". My mother-in-law heard of this and began sending it to me for Christmas. One year however, the package came from Amazon. Funny, she's hasn't sent anymore...but that's okay, because I've been buying at Amazon ever since (I think that was the point). LOL

review/summary: The Best Black Tea!
review/text: I first had this tea in a restaurant and was so impressed with the aroma and flavor it had. I did not pay attention to which brand it was at that time but ended up going back to ask the owner where he got it from. It has been my favorite tea since then. Like another reviewer said, this tea does not get over-brewed easily and so it does not become bitter as some other brands. I also like their Earl Grey very much. I used to purchase it from Taiwan whenever I go back for vacations, but it's great that you can get it from Amazon now!

review/summary: I am thrilled amazon sells it!
review/text: I am from new Zealand and they have this tea in all the grocery stores over there, I loved it when lived thee and missed it when I moved to the USA. I ran out of my stash from my last trip home and was bummed. I was thrilled when I took a chance and looked to see if amazon selled it and they do! I love the taste, it is better than any tea we have in the USA and they other thing I love is that they are not individually wrapped which is not wasting paper and extra packaging. They do not have strings and that may bother some, but I like it better as you can compost them or put them right down the waste disposal.<br /><br />Def give this tea a try if you are a tea drinker, it's the best!

review/summary: Before you even drink it - fabulous
review/text: As a lover of niche fragrances, I've been heady with the enjoyment of tea notes that have presented themselves in perfumes in the last several years.  Very view perfumers get that tea note just right, but conversely, few teas have so memorable a scent as to be worthy of wearing.  Dilmah Premium is one tea worthy of many forms of appreciation.<br /><br />Your Dilmah tea drinking experience starts with the first inhalation - once the tea bag is free from the packaging, just take a moment to close your eyes and inhale.  The depth, the brightness, the hint of floral (remember, these leaves are the close cousin of the camellia and azalea afterall) - absolutely heady, rich and almost overwhelming.<br /><br />The actual brewing must be brief, tho the yeild is strong and plentiful.  Warm, the flavor truly invites you to sink in to the cup, yet silmultaneously fortifies and strenthens the reslove to get up and do that which must be done.  I don't often consume iced tea, but my husband says that this makes a tasty cold beverage as well.<br /><br />Would that I could, this would be my scent to wear, not only my beverage to drink. Fantastic aroma, flavor, all made that much sweeter by knowing that it's fairly and ethically grown and sold.

review/summary: Weak cup of tea
review/text: I'm sorry, I simply do not see what the hype is about.  I've been a tea drinker for decades, always in pursuit of a full, deep and well-balanced cup of tea, for breakfast or mid-day; especially, for convenience, in bag form.  This particular brew I would rate just one notch (barely) above standard Lipton or Tetley tea bags.  For a large cup of tea, at least two bags are needed to impart even the slightest hint of depth.  It smells interesting enough in the box, but there simply is no depth here.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by costlier loose teas over the years, and from some authentic Sri Lankan tea bags given to me by a close Sri Lankan friend.  I will not go out of my way to purchase this particular tea again.<br /><br />Am I missing something??

review/text: The first time I had Herbs de Provence was when my daughter brought some back from Paris with her.  I fell in love with the flavor.  Now, I use it in all italian sauces, put it in marinades for chicken and pork, etc.  This was not a bad price, either.  Grocery stores are much higher priced.

review/summary: Excellent!!
review/text: I was not sure if this would leave my food smelling and tasting like potpourri because of the lavender. I was wrong. This is an excellent product that can be used on more than just meats. I used it on fish, chicken and on scrambled eggs. Full of flavor without adding salt. This is a great blend of herbs and spices. I only wish I bought a larger amount before. Getting the large bag with my next order. Highly recommended!
