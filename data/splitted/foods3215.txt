review/text: Great tasting fat free hot chocolate!  The packets don't have enough in them to make a great cup of hot chocolate, so this canister is perfect as you can put in the amount you want to make the taste perfect!  Stores here don't carry this canister anymore so thank you Amazon!  Wish was a bit cheaper though!

review/summary: A delicious cocoa mix
review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

This is so very rich and smooth, I like the flavor but wish it came in a dark chocolate flavor. And I really agree about the coffee, it makes it so much better. Most cocoa mixes are like drinking colored water, this is so good and you don't need milk to get the thick and rich balance. LOOOOOVE IT !!!

review/summary: THIS POPOVER MIX IS DELICIOUS...YUMMY!
review/text: I ate at a restaurant that served popovers and loved them and decided I was going to make them at home. Amazon came to my rescue because I found this great mix which made my attempt a bit easier since I am a novice in the kitchen. I can't remember the last time I cooked or baked anything!  I must say that I lucked out. I've already made two batches of popovers and they are wonderful.  If you have never had a popover, you are missing out on something special. Buy this item and get into the kitchen. You wont be disappointed. I promise you!!!! Each package makes 12 muffins and I only make 6 at a time.

review/text: We fell in love with popovers while traveling (especially in Minneapolis) so we bought a 6-popover non-stick pan and the Stonewall mix.  It is very easy to put together six popovers and the result are great.  I am sure a more experienced cook could find ways to make variations, but basic is just fine for us.  One problem - the recipe (which says twelve) only makes about eight.  I run the pan through twice at no problem.  We just love it!

review/text: The Stonewall Kitchen Traditional Popover Mix makes yummy popovers.  What is great is that you just mix a few ingrediants, put it in the oven and voila, you get the taste of great homemade popovers. Be sure to use real popover tins or the popovers will not rise properly.<br /><br />The only minor negative is that occasionally, one of the popovers doesn't rise to the proper height. But that is not typical. These popovers have virtually no fat, and they are surprising low in calories...a big plus.  Buy them and enjoy!

review/text: I remember Tutti Frutti from my childhood. It came in very small boxes, and there was only one flavour. Strawberry? That's somewhat strange, since Tutti Frutti, of course, means All Fruits.<br /><br />Today's children are spoiled, if you ask me. These days, Tutti Frutti comes in large bags, and yes, there is a mix of several different flavours in each. Unless I'm mistaken: pear, lemon, strawberry and orange.<br /><br />Personally, I find Tutti Frutti to be a tasty but nevertheless rather boring candy, which you can buy in any good grocery store here in Sweden. (Incidentally, I grew up thinking Fazer was a Swedish company. Actually, it's Finnish.) However, both Chappie and Norma Bates, known from my other reviews, love it, and so do the guys at the warehouse department where I work.<br /><br />I'll give All Fruits four stars. Sometimes, at least, the optimists are right. There really is progress.

review/summary: A real benefit for those watching calories
review/text: Let's be honest.  0 calories?  Not likely.  But I believe they are within their rights to say 0 calories if it is less than 5 calories per serving.  So even if you ate the whole jar in one sitting, it would be less than 60 calories.  This flavor of dip is by far my favorite of the Walden Farms dips.  It's a nice alternative to plain vegetables.  If you've had ranch dip before, I think you will find this to be similar.

review/summary: Whoa Great Buzz
review/text: This stuff is awesome, I am a diabetic and so this sugar free rockstar is great for me. I love the buzz it gives me in the morning. Suffice to say this drink has less caffeine than 2 cups of coffee. My husband and many other people I know drink way more than that during the day. So the caffeine if anybody is worried about that is not really that much. The FDA recommends a person consume no more than 300mg of caffeine in a day. I don't drink coffee (Yuk) and I don't drink soda so I don't have to worry about that. I wouldn't have more than two of these a day though. Each can contains 160mg of caffeine. The taste of this is soooo much better than red bull (should be called red butt). Anyway I can't live without this stuff now!

review/text: I used to be a Sugar Free Red bull addict.  Once I had Diet Rock Star, I converted.  The drink comes in a larger container than Red Bull, which is nice, but I also like the taste better.  It is great on it's own as a pick me up, but is also great mixed with Midori or Grey Goose (and I am sure other various liquors).  Plus, only 20 calories in the entire thing!  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee
review/text: This coffee tastes GREAT.<br /><br />I usually purchase Folger's classic style blend from Sams $11 due to the convenience of the, packaging and expected level of flavor.  One day, I bought a 12oz. package of #4 from Seatle's Best from Wally World (Wal-Mart) for $6.00, having already experienced the goodness from Borders before they went bankrupt, I was happy to see a great price on the product.<br /><br />I absolutely have fallen in love with this coffee!  A cup of this, and "Coldstone Sweet cream" Creamer is great.  Simply put, I prefer to have my day start with that combination and I'm saddened whilst I am at work and my cup finally runs empty.<br /><br />However, the $31 price on 3 bags seems a bit high, as a 2-pack of 12oz goes for $15.00 on here as well.  Huge markup on the 3-pack, which makes no sense.

This coffee was so fresh, so rich in flavor, and stayed fresh until the last cup. Unfortunately I now I have three bags of Starbucks to plow through until I can buy this again. I also plan to try level 5. It works well in an espresso machine as well, very rich and satisfying, and the beans do not seem as dry as Starbucks.

review/text: Beware any coffee that doesn't tell you what kind of coffee beans they use. There is no info on the bag and nothing on their website that I could find. I would be surprised if these were Arabica coffee beans, although they could just be really inferior Arabica, I suppose. I know lower quality stuff is being grown in Vietnam but that's generally the limit of my cursory knowledge of coffee beans. I know what I like and I hated this coffee. I drink my coffee with no cream or sweetener. To drink this stuff I would require cream, sugar, and a gun pointed at my head.<br />My wife picked up a bag of this mud at the supermarket because we do like trying different brands but after one pot we threw out the rest of the bag. I realize that tastes vary widely but you might want to try buying only one bag instead of a 3-pack. Then you won't feel so wasteful as you're spitting this bilge into your sink.

The pineapple chunks are so natural tasting, delicately tender, and supremely ( and yet suprisingly ) still juicy on the tongue, with just the right amount of sweetness. I've tried more than a dozen other premium brands and probably at least another dozen or more so-called "natural" health food store offerings, as well as several grocery store brands of dried pineapple chunks, but none, even the most expensive ones, come close to comparing to these. Simply the best!

review/text: Hey, this is not chocolate in the actual sense. I expected it to be close to a container of chocolate frosting. It was not. It is like syrup, thin and runny. The taste is not milk chocolate. All you can taste is sugar and bitterness. There is no chocolate taste like anyone living in the US is familiar with.

review/text: I am not quite sure why this product is found under the 'natural' foods category.  In the ingredients we find artificial flavors and we also find partially hydrogenated oils.  This product most certainly should not be considered "natural" or healthy.

review/summary: Worst smell coming from a wafer
review/text: Store brought, open at home and the package smell like it had a methane gas leak. Didn't think it came from the wafer. Ate one and immediately felt nausea, kept burping a methane like smell which made me feel like I want to throw up. My family could handle the smell, took out the trash which I ditch the wafer into. Husband walk by and almost threw up from the smell. What an cookie event that was. Don't get me wrong, Garden makes great chocolate wafers which I totally enjoy. But the Durian, don't say I didn't warn you.

review/text: If you have never had "Jack Fruit" then nothing can prepare you for the flavor of these wafers. Upon opening these, an odor I can't even begin to describe wafted up and I knew I was in uncharted territory. I forced myself to take a bite and really tried to give them a chance. After chewing a few times, I couldn't take it anymore and into the trash they went. I can only describe the flavor as stale (slightly rotten) oniony/garlicly kind of flavor.

review/summary: You have to like Durian
review/text: These have a mild Durian scent and flavor that I love.  I got hooked on Durian in Hat Yai, Thailand with a scoop of Durian Ice Cream.  I have sought it out ever since.  It's an acquired taste, however.  The closed Durian cookies to my house are 80 miles away in a Vietnamese Grocery.  I guess someone once bought them, went outside and ate one, came running back in freaking out, so the Grocer tries to not let me buy them until I assure him I know what they are.  My kids were totally grossed out (fun!), but now the older one eats them.  Durian Ice Cream is better, I think, if you want a low-level Durian fix, but it's much harder to find.  I have a recipe posted on my blog [...]

review/summary: Yummmy stuff...
review/text: First of all, I downgraded this from 5 to 4 stars because of the packaging only.  It comes packed in a plastic pouch that makes it very difficult to use every last bit.  As far as the good stuff, I betcha this is what they use in Thai restaurants for panang curry.  It is the simplest thing I've found when I'm really jonesing for some great curry - add some coconut milk (the real thing, not that lite junk), a little fish sauce, some sugar, and whatever veggies you have around - red bell pepper, carrots, zucchini, a nice fat serrano chili - maybe a little chicken - ladle it over some brown rice - voila!  A great meal. I have kept this in the fridge for over six months at a time with no molding or spoilage whatever.  Try it!

review/text: I order Panang wherever I go but never knew there was a Panang curry paste.  I'd been looking for Panang recipes on the web and discovered the paste.  I came straight to Amazon (the best company ever invented!) and ordered this paste immediately.  Two days after receiving the paste, I made Chicken Panang Curry at home, yum!  I can't say enough how grateful I am to have discovered how simple it is to make at home, how glad I am that Amazon carried the product and how delicious it is.  I live on an island and finding exotic spices etc is not that easy.  If you enjoy curries, try this one!

review/text: Made chicken panang with it last night, and it was pretty tasty; you definitely need to add a few tablespoons of fish sauce (plain or hot), and more sugar than the recipe calls for. I hear that "Hand" brand panang paste is higher quality, so I'll give that a try the next time (not available here at Amazon, but Google "Hand panang" and several sources will come up).

review/text: This is an excellent curry paste. My only gripe is that the bag it comes in is sort of awkward to measure the paste from. So I snipped the corner off of the bag and squeezed it out, which worked well but now it's awkward to store. Anyway, the flavor is really great. It's spicier than the panang curries we've had in restaurants but we're going to use some coconut cream to cool it down a little bit. Will buy again.

review/text: Curry has officially become my FAVORITE food over the past year.  I can't believe I waited 35 years to try it.<br /><br />We went through all of the grocery store curry pastes and never could find one that had great flavor and spice.<br /><br />Mae Ploy knocks it out of the park!  We always have 3 or 4 of these in our fridge & pantry.  These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk (we've recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories)<br /><br />A definite MUST HAVE for curry lovers<br /><br />Add some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX0K">Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce, 25-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a> to your pantry as well!  Goes great in stir fry and other asian dishes

All you need to do is cut up your desired vegetables and choice of meat and wok them. Then add  one can of coconut milk, a half teaspoon of fish sauce, and about three tablespoons of the panang curry (if you like it hot!) Mix and voila, it is ready!! This product is easy to use and is simply delicious!!

review/text: This is great bread mix. I put it in my bread maker and it comes out delicious every time. I've found that using real butter helps it rise higher than margarine or oil. I've added different ingredients to make different types of bread. We especially like adding flax seed, rosemary, oregano and minced onion. Bread is a little pricey but so worth it. Fresh & no preservatives.

review/summary: Good oven bread
review/text: I bought this product only because others said it was good.  I was surprised how well it worked as an oven bread.  I also had trouble with the rise as did many reviewers, but by adding some of my own yeast and proofing it in a 150 degree oven for double the time created a really nice not-too-dense bread that baked up beautifully.  I baked mine in the oven and made them into rolls instead of a loaf.<br /><br />Another note:  I added to my last batch 1/2 cup each chopped nuts and diced dates for a more mediteranean flavor.  After the first rise when you punch it down just put the add-ins and knead a few times to incorporate, then mold it how you like (loaf or rolls) and let rise another hour to 1 1/4 hours and bake as directed (shorter time for individual rolls) and enjoy.

I highly recommend this mix, but you may need to add eggs.
