review/summary: THESE ARE GREAT!
review/text: I don't know if it's the sea salt or what, but you can actually taste the potato in these chips.  The chips are not greasy, and they're nice and thick.  And knowing that they're a much healthier choice than other brands, is important to me.  But even if they're a healthier choice, we would not purchase them unless they tasted great.  And these are great! And with AMAZON'S packaging and fast delivery, I definitely will be ordering most of my chips here.

review/summary: amazing
review/text: These chips are great.  Strangely enough I was a bit overwhelmed by the fact that they have a strong actual potato taste.  Though of course that's a good thing in chips, but I have never tasted any other chips like these. You simply can not compare these to chips like Lay's or other national brands.  They are just salt and pepper and potato.  You don't taste grease or manufactured flavors.  They are crispy, but NOT hard to chew or too crunchy.  totally perfect.  Buy them, but be prepared to eat way too much.  Though one complaint that I didn't have - someone who tried them wished they had more pepper.  But I think they are perfect as is.

review/summary: You can taste the different potatoes!
review/text: I was initially afraid that I'd been sent the wrong product as the shipping box seemed to be for the variety veggie chips, but once I looked carefully I saw that the UPC label had the right product name. At any rate, the best thing about these chips is that they actually have a potato taste and each type of potato is a bit different. Very good crunch. And the blue chips make them really fun to serve at a party. Kids love them! Great product. We'll likely get them again.

review/summary: Burnt Chips
review/text: I bought a case of these chips and found three bags had small holes in them at the bottom seams (just big enough for air and/or a bug to get in).  So,I had to throw them out.  And, many of the chips were broken up and many seemed burnt or way overcooked.  I think I'll stick to the supermarket bags next time.

When this order arrived, I ate one bag each day until I came down to 5 bags. I realized what I have done.<br /><br />However, it was yummy and no trans fat.

review/text: The chips are so-so.  For me a package when opened must pass the smell test - these didn't.  When ordering a case (12 bags) I assumed they would be shipped in a factory packed box.  Not so.  They were repackaged by Amazon in a box designed for ten bags.  The case consisted of 12 bags.  No problem for the packer as he just squeezed in the two extra bags.  You can imagine what that does to potato chips.  I now have 6 bags of whole chips and 6 bags of chip pieces which can be eaten with a spoon.

review/summary: Not Bitter at All
review/text: I have tasted several brands of barley tea.  All of the following were cold brewed, including the one I bought here.  One of them was a gift from Japan and wasn't roasted, so it wasn't bitter at all.  One of them was roasted and VERY bitter.  Another one was a mixture of lightly and deeply roasted and tasted okay (not very bitter).  This one I am reviewing however, is excellent in taste.  It isn't bitter at all, even after cold brewing for several days.  The package says it is gently roasted in small quantities.  That, plus the fact that it is organic, I believe is the reason it doesn't have the bitter taste.  If you don't like bitter drinks and want to drink barely tea, this is a great choice.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: The BEST "mango in a container" product ever!
review/text: Item arrived quickly and frozen on dry ice.  After sampling a thawed container, I have to say this is the best canned mango product I've tried.  It was very sweet like a fresh mango should taste....NOT like the typical flavorless mango mush in heavy syrup.  This would be good for anything requiring mangos from a fruit smoothie to mango nut bread to mango wine.  I've got 6 gallons of mango wine going and so far so good!<br /><br />I also contacted The Perfect Puree's customer service before ordering and they provided me with the information I needed on sugar content.<br /><br />Will definitely buy more and possibly try some of the other purees they sell.

I am looking forward to using it in many of my recipes.  So, yes, I would buy this product again.

My last shipment had some problems with a the Contianer of Pepper being broken and was all over the bottom of the shipping box. I immediately notified the seller and they immediately sent me a brand new Container of Ajika Dried Prickly Ash or Sichuan Pepper 2 ounces to replace the bad one.  I was amazed at the service and will continued to buy from Amazon, because of their wonderful service.  So, both the Ajika Dired Prickly Ash or Sichuan Pepper and the Customer Services that quickly replaced my broken container of pepper deserves 5 healthy stars each.  Which would give them 10 stars in my book. Thank you and yes, I will continue buying from Amazon, because of their wonderful quick service.<br /><br />I just thought I should mention that here also.  So, yes, I will buy this product again.

review/summary: Awesome taste, nasty after
review/text: Sprecher is amazing.  one of the best.  but, the Orange Dream is kinda iffy.  the taste is great, kinda creamy, very orange, but still very soda and not some kind of hybrid drink.  The thing that makes it a 3 and not a 5, is the HORRIBLE aftertaste.  To me, the aftertaste is similar to that of burnt popcorn.  and its STRONG, almost as strong as the initial taste of the soda.  We got 2 4-packs, and both me and another person agreed it has a strong "burnt food" aftertaste.  I am drinking the last bottle of the first 4-pack and will begin on the second 4-pack tomorrow.  if those 4 do nto have the nasty aftertaste, or if it is lesser, i will edit this review to note that the first 4-pack was from a bad batch.  Overall, great soda if the aftertaste doesnt bother you much.  Helps to be eating something with the soda so you can kill the aftertaste<br /><br />EDIT.  ok, second batch.  same aftertaste...  its possible its a big bad batch and both 4-packs were from the same batch.  so, i wont lower the review score any more than it is.  its a good soda with a horrible aftertaste that MIGHT not be in all of the bottles.  lets hope not.

review/summary: The ingredients recently changed!
review/text: I would have given this salad dressing five stars in the past, but the ingredients and consistency of the dressing recently changed.  If you get a bottle that says "New Look" and "Same Great Taste!", be aware that you are getting the new recipe with less sodium, but also a thinner consistency with less cheese solids and a less robust and authentic taste.  Vinegar and water are now the second and third ingredients listed after soybean oil.  The original recipe contained soybean oil, water and then parmesan and romano cheese.  Romano is now the fourth ingredient and parmesan is further down in the list.<br /><br />I will give more information later, but this consumer is not pleased.  Why do companies mess with something that is a success?<br />Maybe we should express our discontent.<br /><br />This change is in the works right now.  We have two bottles in our refrigerator - new and old.  The older one has an expiration date of August 2012, while the newer one has an expiration date of October 2012.

I will definitely buy this again.<br /><br />=== update ===<br />I have bought this several times I want to start by saying that I have NEVER been dissatisfied with the kit.  I will say though that the ingredients have been inconsistent.  I have gotten an all malt kit with non pellet real leaf hops, a standard liquid and dry malt with pellet hops kit, and a kit with syrup, dry malt, pellet hops and additional raw sugar.  Every single one has been a winner on the pallet and the price is great, but I would like to see this be more consistent and for the description to tell exactly what is in the kit.<br /><br />Keep in mind though, every single kit has produced a quality stout with great flavor and at a price that can't be beat.  The price of ingredients does fluctuate as they are commodities, but this kit has been able to produce a fine stout at a great price every single time.

review/summary: Great Meat Substitute for Hamburger!
review/text: I grew up eating Loma Linda meat substitutes, including this item: Vege-Burger. I also eat meat, but I prefer the Loma Linda and Worthington meat substitutes when I have the choice.  To find these products in restaurants you have to find a Seventh-day Adventist school (or sometimes an SDA hospital), and patronize their cafeteria, or college snack bar.<br /><br />First thing you need to know: Loma Linda Vege-Burger is not meat.  It doesn't cook like meat - can't grill it because it'll burn easily.  It doesn't taste like meat.  It has a similar but not overly identical texture to meat (it's not as tough as meat, but is substantive which provides for chewing satisfaction; this is the biggest complaint of meat eaters: not the same chewing satisfaction as animal meat).  This vege-burger has a similar form to loose, cooked hamburger in that it's pellet like, and it'll stick together.<br /><br />The purpose of this meat substitute is to give people who prefer not to eat meat a similar and clever alternative that we can use in recipes where hamburger is used.  The nutritional value of this product is plant protein.  For any vegetarian - however you choose to define the term - there are concerns for missing nutrients from the diet that aren't provided by meat (vitamins, minerals, etc).  I'll leave that topic up to you to figure out.<br /><br />Loma Linda Vege-Burger is best, in my opinion, in cases where a well defined pellet of "meat" is appropriate.  This includes for me: taco meat, meat loaf, and chili.  I like this product very much - it's one of those staples of meat substitutes for me.  I cook with this vege-burger just like I do with meat except it's already cooked.  It's slightly delicate - fry it at a lower temperature than hamburger, and don't bake it as hot or as long as a hamburger meatloaf - just get the veggies cooked in your meatloaf - as much as you want them cooked - I like my celery and onions a little crunchy to add texture.  Oh, and in the meatloaf I like to add some pecans!  Yes!<br /><br />Worthington brand also makes a canned vegeburger (available here on Amazon as of this review 6/2010).  For me the Worthington burger is a finer, smoother grind - ie not as pellet like.  I like it especially in pasta sauces, meat balls, and stuffed green peppers.<br /><br />To your health!

It may be made in the form of a burger, great for meals and snacks.  I may also be used in all forms that hamburger is used.  For example burger and rice is very satisfying.  It might also be used in the making of a lasagna.  Really great for those avoiding the problems associated with red meat.  This is a better vegetarian burger than any other that I have tasted and my mother was a vegetarian.<br /><br />My other favorite vegitarian foods are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BEZVW2">Loma Linda Big Franks, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYFAKG">Loma Linda Tender Rounds with Gravy, 19-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DN7C5A">Worthington Vegetable Skallops, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Big time meat eater
review/text: I have been looking to find a source of protein while maintaining a lower caloric intake. I love ground beef, but it tends to be higher in calories/fat. I stumbled upon this product while surfing the Amazon website, and I thought I would give it a try based on other reviews. I'll add my review to other favorable ones... while it's not quite ground beef, it's hard to tell the difference. I have used it in several dishes and was hard pressed to tell a truly discernible difference. I will definitely be ordering again.

review/summary: My favorite vegetarian "meat" product
review/text: I grew up on this stuff. It's so quick and easy to use. I love that it's never greasy or funky smelling like real ground beef and there's never a danger of e-coli from not cooking it enough. It's also cruelty free. No animals had to die in the process! Yay!<br /><br />I use it for chili, taco filling, and it's easy to make vegeburger patties just by adding bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings. It can even be formed into meatloaf or meatballs. I've made Hamburger Helper with it before which was pretty good. Its uses are endless. I'd love to try this in shepherd's pie. Loma Linda makes the best vegetarian "meat" products.

review/summary: A good ground meat substitute
review/text: This has been used in my family to make "hamburgers" for as long as I've been alive and I love it.  Like I've said in other reviews for Loma Linda/Worthington foods it's not meat, it is not meant to taste like meat.  I've also stated before that the meat substitutes are an acquired taste and it tends to be like it or hate it.  Vege-Burger is versatile, but it is not something that can be eaten without seasoning as it is not palatable on its own.

review/summary: Awesome meat substitute!
review/text: The texture and density is just like real ground beef.  It doesn't really have much taste on its own, but that is where seasonings come in.  Throw some veggies in, some onions, scallions, peppers, maybe even some olive oil.<br /><br />Don't expect this to taste just like beef though.  Beef has a high fat content so there is quite a lot of flavor in beef.  Ever try rinsing off all the fat from your ground beef?  Well when you do, it loses a lot of flavor.  And this is what this reminds me of.  Fat free ground beef.  Use your imagination and create something tasty!

review/summary: Awesome chili
review/text: As I type this, my crockpot is filled with Vege-Burger, kidney beans, onion, garlic, celery, carrot and spices. It smells fantastic in here! The Vege-Burger makes an extremely hearty chili, and the texture is perfect. I also use V-B for tacos and burritos and "meat" sauce for my pasta. This is a wonderfully versatile product, with a pleasant taste that takes on the flavor of the spices you use. It has great "mouth feel". The only caution I would give is that you need to use oil in the pan if you are going to sautee it, because it will stick to the pan. But that's not an issue with crockpots, of course.

It has a great texture and a subtle unique taste that can be dressed up with spices or good as is. We're great fans of Loma-Linda meatless, though we're not exclusively vegetarian.

review/text: We are not vegetarians . . . but we are trying to "cut back" on red meats, etc.<br /><br />We think Vege-burger tastes best in recipes calling for lotsa' spices, as in Tacos, or Chili - we had some VERY good dinners from these = Dad also made a casserole, but the spices were lacking and the taste was less than stellar, but okay.  He promises to try harder.<br /><br />Overall, we are most happy with this product.

review/summary: Healthy product just be sure to season it well
review/text: Bought the first case on a whim thinking that I would sneak some in the chili or tacos without telling the family.  Well, the hubby saw my put it in and threw a hissy fit.  Chili turned out great, but he was not a believer.  Eventually he wanted to add some burger to something he was preparing and we did not have it in the house, so he grabbed a can of this.  He has loved it ever since!  This comes unseasoned so be prepared to season it well to go along with whatever it is you are using it in.  Originally I planned on only using it in chili and for taco "meat", but we have expanded the use.  Yesterday we made meatloaf that had ground turkey blended with this and it turned out terrific.  The hubby blends it all the time with ground turkey and the kids are totally unaware.  We did try it once with a box of hamburger helper and we won't do that again- messed up the texture too much.  I also love that it is shelf stable so it is a great pantry item.<br /><br />Be warned- if you are not used to working with this stuff it seems a little nasty coming out the can.  It does cook up great so long as you season it though.  The calories are half that of the ground turkey we use and has more protein.  Check out the nutrition label- it is some good stuff.  Highly recommend!

I bought the low fat version and loved it so much that I have never tried the full fat version (why when I enjoy the low fat one). It makes the best meat-loaf. Everyone loves it, even my non-vegetarian friends and family. We used the meat in a pasta dish last week, and everyone thought it was actually beef. This product is awesome, and I will recommend it to everyone. Give it a try!

review/text: Foojoy China Classic Min-nan Oolong (Wulong) Tea<br /><br />Personally I prefer a very strong mug of tea so YMMV.<br /><br />My first sip and I was disappointed in the tea. I thought it was weak and lacking in body but it had an interesting aftertaste. Not nutty but I've seen this tea's taste described as Toasty. Good word.<br /><br />The tea is very good with food. The tea doesn't overwhelm the taste of the food  and the toasty tea aftertaste really seems to accent the food's flavor.<br /><br />So 2 stars for drinking out of a mug, early on a cold morning; 5 stars in a tea cup, whilst scarfing down foods.

review/summary: Perhaps the greatest hot sauce ever?
review/text: Let me start this review by saying I'm a bit of an expert on hot sauce.  Maybe not as much as Scott Roberts (of scottrobertsweb.com) but fairly close. I use hot sauce all the time.  I've tried hundreds of brands.  And this is easily in my top 5 hot sauces ever.  It might even take the #1 spot, if the hotter version of this, made with fresh scorpion peppers (Cauterizer) did not exist.<br /><br />First, it's hot.  It's not so ungodly hot that I can't run a solid line down my burrito, but it's hot enough where even the most hardcore of chileheads can tell it's hot.  It's hot enough to get the job done.  And it's a perfect heat where I can use it with anything.  It is one of the hotter non-extract based sauces out there (which means it should have good flavor -- those who don't know, most extract sauces taste a little chemically and thus lack in flavor).<br /><br />Second, there's flavor which is the most important category.  After all, who wants to eat something that's hot, but doesn't particularly taste good? And flavor is where this sauce excels.  This is a Louisiana style hot sauce with a vinegary base, but the flavor is much more complex than any other Louisiana style hot sauce I have ever had.  While there is a bitter vinegery taste that we have come to associate to Louisiana style hot sauce, there is a sweet fruity flavor at the same time.  It works as a Louisiana style hot sauce, and also with dishes that one normally wouldn't associate with a Louisiana style hot sauce.  In short, this sauce is good with anything which makes it the most versatile hot sauce of its style.<br /><br />Third, they all have some cool artwork on the bottles.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoy spicy foods, you really can't go wrong with this hot sauce or anything Heartbreaking Dawns really.

review/summary: husband's favorite hot sauce
review/text: I am from Buffalo, NY where hot sauce is plentiful, home of Franks hot sauce.  My husband has very specific taste for hot sauce, many products which claim to be extremely hot and spicy normally don't fit the bill for him.  This hot sauce, on the other hand, is his new favorite.  We purchased it in a shop in Hudson, OH while in town there for a wedding, and he was so happy to see the website on the label of the bottle.  It is more affordable at the website, however.  But if you are looking for hot sauce that is truly hot, you won't be disappointed with this.

review/summary: Expensive
review/text: For a black tea that is NOT Puerh by the way, it seems very expensive to me.  There is nothing special about the taste.  I have been using it to make Kombucha tea because this tea isn't robust enough for me (I prefer puerh for my hot tea).<br /><br />The packaging isn't great.  Looks nice, but being wrapped in paper, placed in a wooden box, & then having a plastic plexi glass type cover that slides into place doesn't exactly scream "fresh"  to me.  Because it's in cake form, I didn't have any storage jars to keep it in.<br /><br />If you are looking for a potent black tea, try one of the puerh cakes.  You may either love it or hate it.  It's one of those things.  If you aren't feeling daring, then you might want to consider looking into Davidson's Teas right here on amazon.  You can get some amazing prices on their organic teas & they have a good selection.  Plus you can save even more with the subscribe & save.

review/summary: I would call them Bread Crumbs not Crackers
review/text: I ordered a case of these a few weeks ago and while they are made with cracker material they are not crackers they are a cross between bread crumbs and crutons.  Not one cracker, in any of the boxes, are within ten percent of whole.  They are all pulverized!  There was no damage on the outer case, or any of the inners, but they look like they were either dropped from the 78th floor or tossed into the truck at 100 MPH.  It's total loss.  I would not chance it again.

review/summary: Could you have a worse name for a candy?
review/text: People who take candy seriously are a vulnerable group.  So why name a straightforward candy "nerds"?  It seems like you are poking fun at your supporters.  Especially for the sour ones (which are I think the best), the conventional thing would be to call them something like "McGillicutty's" and have a picture of a scowling Irishman.  The candy itself is just going to be sugar, corn syrup, stabilizers and some flavoring--the name is what gives you a sense of what it is.<br /><br />In general, the Wonka lines have been a depressing experience.  First, no one should have been so cynical as to use the name "Willy Wonka" for real candy.  It's like Fruit of the Loom having "Thomas Jefferson" briefs.  And I'll get back to that.  But second, the candy has consistently been uninventive, third rate, and with no particular appeal.  All it does is drag W.W.'s image into the ground as opposed to it being an inspiration.<br /><br />And as we all know, Wonka is now actually a part of Nestle's.  Now as someone previously in the candy business, I have to say that Nestle's main-line and high-quality line products in the candy/chocolate world are pretty good.  But as a company, Nestle is a nightmare--poisoning pets, starving babies.  If Nestle owned the real Willy Wonka factory, the Oompa-Loompas would turn out to be slaves.  I just can't understand a world in which Nestle owns the right to put out low grade candy and call it Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Willy Wonka represented the dream of doing good, being a child, and being honest.  That was why Charlie got the factory--because he precisely wasn't the kind of guy who would go far in Nestle's.  I feel like in this product, Nestle is basically saying to Charlie, "you're a nerd!  Maybe you can work in the tech department programming the payroll computers!  But you sure as heck can't run the factory and we're not interested in any of your spacey ideas!"<br /><br />And one last thing--if you're my age, you've probably had to listen, more than you wanted to, to the song "Nurds" (the spelling was "charmingly" wrong) by the Roches.  Now if there's one thing you don't want associated with your candy product, it's roaches.  Animal contamination is always a real threat, and it's often not taken seriously enough.  So, Nestle, when you were done with your ethically-dubious activities in the third world, you somehow chose a name for a candy that would both spit in the face of Charlie Bucket and make the consumer queasy.  Who's running this show? [15]

However, they are not perfect stars - they are a little lumpy in some places and also a tiny bit softer than many other sprinkles of this kind (which I consider a positive taste wise, but can change your decorating technique, I suppose).  All in all, make sure you look at those three little stars to the left of the picture - most of them are going to look like the middle one - kind of uneven and not "perfect," which isn't a big deal to me but something to consider ahead of time in case it is to you.

review/summary: Sugar Twin
review/text: We love this box of sweetener because we make iced tea by the gallon, year-round.  The easy open/close dispenser is perfect for our useage and 1/3 cup of Sugar Twin sweetens 1 gallon of tea perfectly to our taste.  We can't find it in our local stores anymore and are delighted we can order it online.
