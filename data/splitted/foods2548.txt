review/summary: Good toy
review/text: We got one of these in large size for our Australian Cattle Dog mix, and he loves it.  We use it each night (sometimes in combo with other similar products) to feed him his dinner.  The cube can hold a full cup of kibble.  It's entertaining to watch him "herd" it all over the den and it keeps him busy while we prepare or eat our own supper.  I agree with the earlier comment about the settings being "easy" and "slightly less easy."  I wish it were a little more challenging, but it's still a great toy.

review/summary: Buster Mini Cube dog
review/text: I had looked for a dog toy that would hold dog kibbles so that I did not need to purchase a specialized dog treat.  This one holds dog kibbles.  You just drop them in the hole and shake a little to get the kibbles into a compartment.  You can turn to adjust it to minimize or maximize the ability to get the kibbles.  I have a small dog (8to 10 lbs.) and it took a bit of time over several days of me pushing it for him to catch on.  But he did catch on and can roll to get kibbles, sometime one, sometime more.  He will get frustrated when the kibbles don't come out, but I would say it's a good item.  Entertaining until they run low, but you do not want them eating too much.  It can equal a meal.  It's a once a day toy or....

review/summary: Buster Cube is entertaining for dog and owner!
review/text: I really believe this is a very useful and must have "toy" for your dog. Our morning ritual now consists of filling the cube with our dogs normal hard dog food when we have our breakfast. This keeps them very entertained. It also makes them think they're hunting for their food since bits fall out as they push the cube around. You will enjoy watching them entertain themselves.

review/summary: It is just play, play, play now.....
review/text: Be aware, my spaniel will not do bathroom business IF he gets this thing outside.  I bought this for my one year old cocker spaniel.  He loves it.  I was so surprised at how fast he learned to roll the cube; one piece of dog food fell out and he was rolling this thing across the house for more.  Of course, I short his meals and feed about 1/2 his dry dog food via the cube.  I have four dogs, so this thing has caused some fights.  So, I ordered more and extra for my friends.  Save your sanity, just get two (one to play with and one on standby).

review/summary: Great Item
review/text: I've been very happy the the cube. We received it before it was supposed to which was great! We have a 20lb Dachsund/Terrier/Beagle Mix. Seems to be a decent size but he can pull the whole thing in his mouth so we are trying to teach him to smack it around instead of just chewing on the whole thing. The crazy guy has also figured out how to pull the cork part open. We were recommended this from our trainer and she said she has never had a dog figure that out. It only took him about 20 mins to do so now we just watch him very carefully. I wish I could find a medium size but I'm not sure they make one in the size I need. I still give it a five star because I can finally eat a meal in peace.

review/text: Neither I nor my dogs could get treats out of this! I shook it and rolled it every which way, nothing came out. It wasn't easy to load, either. I tried it with tiny treats, it made no difference.<br /><br />I tried a few different times, we couldn't get treats out of it, so the dogs quickly lost interest.

review/text: This is definitely a step up from the IQ ball as far as the level of difficulty.  My Border Collie was very frustrated by it for the first few week, so he barked at it incessantly! Now he has fun with it, and it keep him busy, giving him a "job" to do.  I really wish this were made of a hard rubbery material like the Kong toys, as the hard plastic makes it very noisy when my dog knocks it around on the hardwood floors, trying to get the treats out. Consequently, I can't let him play with it while I'm teaching piano lessons!

review/summary: Good product, just not right for me
review/text: I bought the mini size buster cube thinking it would work for my little mutt (15lb beagle/pom mix) since I had seen other reviews mentioning how much their small breed dogs loved it. Maybe it works better in a home with carpeting, but it turned out that it was too large for my little girl (who is insanely food-motivated)to flip over easily on a consistent basis (the flooring is too slick so when she put her paw on it to flip it over, it just skidded around). She ended up batting it all over my hardwood floors like her old twist-n-treat toy , and was decidedly frustrated that she couldn't get anything out. It's also much too big for her to carry around in her mouth (and she'll carry/chew just about anything she can get her teeth on).<br /><br />It's a great idea, and a great product...I just wish it came in a smaller size (and was easier to access for cleaning). We'll be trying a puzzle ball next.

review/summary: Great toy to challenge my dog
review/text: We bought the large size for our ~65 pound labrador retriever.  He had been really bored and we wanted to find something to challenge and stimulate him.  It took a little while for him to figure it out.  At first he just pushed it around on the carpet and didn't understand that he had to roll it.  Then we took it outside, and the grass naturally caused it to roll over more, and he got the idea.  Now we feed him half of his food in it.  We think he really enjoys it.  He has tried to bite it a bit, and so far it's held up well but will always be a supervised toy.  The center piece is easy to remove for cleaning.

review/summary: BEWARE!  Dangerous to Dogs
review/text: We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain.  He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before, or since then. We immediately threw away the cube.  By the way, the cube was not damaged when it caught his canine tooth.  It was a freak occurrence, but one we would never chance again.  We were lucky.

review/summary: Shepherd and Cattle Dog Love It!
review/text: We bought the large cube because of our 97lb. German Shepherd mix, and we also have a Cattle Dog mix (35lbs). They both LOVE this thing. Put some regular dog food in it, and the boys race to see who gets to play with it first. Usually our shepherd gets it, so we give our other boy another toy (monster ball, which I also recommend). This thing has taken a beating over the last couple of months. Our big boy can pick it up in his mouth and carry it, throws it up in the air (it's really loud when it hits the ground) throws it down the stairs, jumps on it... anything to get that last piece of dog food out! It definitely keeps them busy. I've also washed it in the dishwasher because with that much play, this thing does get really dirty. It has a couple gouges out of the plastic because I have caught my big boy starting to chew on it when he gets frustrated- which is why I would not recommend leaving this alone with your doggie. You never know what could happen, even though it looks totally safe. (Better safe than sorry, right?) I would highly recommend this toy for anyone who needs more mental stimulation for their dog!

review/summary: Finally a toy my dog can't break
review/text: I have a very destructive dog. She is an American Eskimo and is far too intelligent for normal toys. They bore her or she destroys them, generally within minutes.  Other treat dispenser toys, including the standard Kong, are too easy for her.  Enter, the Buster Cube.  I was recommended this toy from a local trainer who has had great luck with it.  For my dog, this is not a very difficult toy to figure out, although compared to other toys she has had, this has taken considerably longer for her to master. About 2 days in, she's able to flip the cube on soft carpet and turn it successfully until all of the food we put inside of it is gone.<br /><br />We enjoy feeding her meals with the cube, as it helps stimulate her mind, keeps her occupied, and feeds her all at the same time.  This is also one of the first toys that she can't just pick up, chew, crack, shred, or decapitate.  I love this and have suggested it to several other pet owners.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: My lab loves the buster cube. It didnt take her long to figure out how to flip the cube to get the food to come out. There needs to be an "expert" or advanced dispensing setting because she can empty it now in under 2 min. I have had to buy several other interactive toys to keep her busy for a longer period of time.  My other dog has never figured out how to use it.  She just pushes it lightly which causes it to just slides across the floor without dispensing treats.  Its durable and my dog has not been able to break it.

review/summary: Good for a while, maybe better for smaller dogs
review/text: This is a pretty good idea, but might be better for smaller dogs. It's easy enough to pull out the middle and put food in, and it definitely kept my dog entertained. Food doesn't come out too easily, so he has to work for it.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't last all that long. My dog (~50lb pit) figured out how to pick it up by using the hole in the middle as a grip. He eventually did this enough that the middle piece started to crack and bulge out. Eventually it got hard to remove and replace the middle piece. Now I can't even lock the middle piece in, so it's useless. This thing is also pretty loud on any kind of surface other than a carpet.<br /><br />I would recommend for smaller dogs who won't be able to grip it by the center hole.

review/text: This is a good toy to keep your dog busy. However a little hard to get the opening loose to put the treats in. But then once you have the treats it keeps her busy (cairn terrier). Just make sure you put the lid/insert back in really good and tighten it. My dog got it loose and pulled it out and then chewed up the insert...which then leaves the ball part with no way to close it. SO just make sure the little plug thing is tight.

review/text: I picked up the Buster Cube after reading some positive reviews on it. Its a great toy, lots of fun and holds their attention for a long time. I put a handfull of kibble in it(an amount that my pup would eat in a couple bites) and he was occupied for at least a 30-45 minutes. I would 5 star it but it is its very noisy, even on carpeted floor, thats my only complaint.<br /><br />Update: The buster cube didn't make it through the weekend. My dog was able to remove the center piece, and then proceeded to chew on it while i was out of the room. Luckily I was only gone for a couple minutes and the center piece is still sort of functional. disappointing.

So I had quite the mess to clean up! I was hoping it would last a bit longer and keep him occupied while I was at work. I wanted a refund or to exchange for a different item but the company would only replace it! Which doesn't help! So now he can only play with it while i am sitting with him and watching him. So don't get it if your pup likes to chew at all.

review/text: I am 64 years old, and have been trying this type of sauce for many years. Once I was in a restaurant in south east Asia, and had a sauce that was out of this wold, found out it was Hoisn sauce. I had been trying to find this same taste  for many years here in the states, but just never seam to find it. All the brands just did not taste the same, till I found this brand of sauce. It is the same sauce they used in the restaurant I was in in Bannock.If you want to try the best Hoisin sauce in the world, this it the real thing, not some weak imitation sauce. Try it, you will love it.

review/summary: Superb coffee
review/text: This coffee is unique in that it is probably the mildest. It may seem lacking in that coffee bite taste, especially for those with failing taste buds like me. I bought it because I tasted it decades ago. The shop owner raved how one did not need cream or sugar.  I will keep a supply of it, since I do switch blends and kinds for variety. Worth the cost.

review/text: It's coffee.....  The three individually packed 1lb bags are convenient... The 5lb bags are obviously a better deal but I'm not an addict drinking 7 cups/day.  I am, however, a lover of good coffee and I do not necessarily notice the distinct Brazillian flavor I was hoping for.  Anyways, this is a lot cheaper than starbucks @ 10-15$/bag.  But the quality is the same caliber...  Not better but equal.  Based on the price alone, I'll be getting more - maybe the "dark roast" variety.

review/summary: THE BEST CANDEH EVAR.
review/text: Seriously--if you like the taste of honeydew melon, this is your G-dsend.  Its taste is NATURAL and it leaves an aftertaste in your mouth as if you've just eaten a whole, sweet, ripe honeydew melon.  Of course, if you hate honeydew, you won't like this candy, but if you loooove honeydew like I do?  You will be amazed at how this candy captures the essence of such a refreshing fruit.  Sure, I'd prefer to eat the real thing, but since I usually can't, this is a good substitute that fits in your pocket, LOL.  My second favorite flavor is the mango.  Mmm!<br /><br />$10+ for 10 packs is a little steep, though.  These retail for $.89 at a lot of big city Walgreens and I recently paid that price ($8.90 for ten packs of varying flavors, mostly honeydew and mango with some orange and green apple thrown in).

review/summary: Great quality and value.
review/text: I just brewed up a pot in my french press after receiving the bag in the mail today and I have to say I am impressed!  Like another reviewer noted, this is a true dark roast.  Extremely fresh tasting, and very smooth flavor with very little acidity.  I can definitely see myself ordering this again.  ~$30 shipped for 5 lbs versus paying 8-10/lb at a grocery store for wildly varying quality and age...it's a no brainer.<br /><br />Edit: (8.10.2011)  Unfortunately I have to re-visit my original review of this product.  The past 2 times I've ordered I've noticed the quality reduced significantly.  The beans seem somewhat stale upon arrival and there is a definite bitterness that was not present in orders 6-12 months ago.  I've decided to switch to a local roaster that produces a far fresher and superior product for not much more money.

review/summary: Outstanding Roast
review/text: I am a dark-roast coffee drinker who appreciates beans that have been roasted according to generally accepted standards (nonetheless mindful of conflicting definitions of exactly what constitutes say, French v. Italian roast, from one area to another). Apart from very well-known, and might I add expensive, whole-bean coffees sold at Amazon that I have purchased, Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is the first that I have purchased that is, in fact, a true Italian roast. The beans, characteristically, are almost black and are glossy with a pronounced oily surface - as they should be. I brew these beans as "regular" coffee as well as Espresso and find that, in either case, they present me the precise dark-roast flavor that I seek. I must admit that my palate, whose acuity is mollified by Balkan pipe tobacco, cannot adequately distinguish the subtle differences amongst different varieties of beans. As a consequence, my singular focus is on the precision of the roasting. Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is spot on in that regard, producing an exquisite cup of coffee - if one prefers a very dark roast. Finally, at a little over $5 per pound, I dare say one is not likely to find a superior, similar roast, at twice the cost. At $27 for a five pound bag (and free shipping), I believe few would be disappointed with this roast as is. Furthermore, one could use this roast, blending it with "common" coffees found on local grocers' shelves to add body - and flavor. Well done, Amazon!

review/summary: 5 whole lbs.
review/text: This is a lot of coffee for the price. Very nice flavor. It's a darker bean but not a full on dark roast to me. Coffee oils present on the beans when you open the bag. Adds taste. Not bitter at all and a real good buy that I'm happy with and will buy again.<br /><br />Update:<br />On second thought I would call a this a true dark roast. What confused me was this is a good one. Darks usually are bitter to me. I always thought many producers put in additives for the dark flavor. Not one I find too pleasant usually. I've been avoiding dark roasts for a while and now found a good one. Good quality at a price that is hard to beat. Oils on the beans really flavor it up! Good smoother dark roast. 5 lbs of Quality.<br /><br />So two years later I'm still buying this coffee. I have ordered for other people because I have Prime and every time the comment is "That is a giant bag." and then "I told you it was five pounds when I ordered."  Five pounds in person is a lot. This really is a bargain. All have liked it. The other flavors are good too.

review/summary: Does not taste like an Italian Roast
review/text: I would not consider myself an expert on coffee, but I did not care for this flavor.  It seemed quite bitter, and did not have the same flavor as the Italian roasts I have had before.  I used to get coffee pods, and one of my favorites was the Italian roast.  I have since switched to whole beans that I grind myself, but I was disappointed when I tried this one.  It did not have the same flavor I was used to in an Italian roast.  It is possible that the ones I had before were the ones that were not true Italian roasts, but this coffee just seemed bitter, and without any real flavor to it.  I did use the entire bag, but it is not something I will order again.  This is the second bag I have ordered from Coffee Bean Direct, and I am hesitant to try another flavor, because I was not impressed with that one either.  Maybe I just ordered two bad bags, but both of the bags I received seemed over-roasted and bitter.

review/summary: The grind is a careful matter.
review/text: You will get a "bitter" espresso if your grind is too fine.  It seems many people grind beans at the wrong setting.  Using my burr grinder I set at medium to get a "sugar grain" size grind for the first test.  My grinder has 3 settings for medium.  I use the smallest medium setting.  Next I move up to the middle medium setting to test again for taste.  I can go down to the highest fine setting but I don't find that setting as tasty as the medium setting.<br /><br />Crema is easy to get so testing for flavor is the my procedure.  Crema is more plentiful at my medium settings using my pump espresso machine.  This the best bean I've used in 3 years of pump espresso experience.  Best taste.  Best crema.  I don't use sugar or any sweetner.  Mostly black (cafe noir) but I do use half-and-half (cafe au creme) or 3% milk (cafe au lait) as well.  I can make a chocolate coffee by adding real chocolte syrup.<br /><br />Your grinder may be different.  So may be your taste.<br /><br />If you grind too fine the shot is bitter, crema is less, and water flow may be poor even seeming to stop as though something is wrong with the machine.  You can test with a grind too fine if you like and the results may be as I've written here.<br /><br />Your espresso machine may be better.<br /><br />This Italian roast espresso works as drip (coarse grind), French press (coarsest grind), and espresso as described above.  It's an all-around bean.  Iced coffee is good.<br /><br />The fine, even very fine powdery grind, should make a turkish well enough but I regret to state I've not tried to make turkish.

review/text: I am a coffee lover, have automatic espresso machine, used to roast my own beans, etc. When I read the reviews on this coffee, particularly that it would be freshly roasted prior to shipping I was attracted. I purchased five pounds and I have to say I was disappointed.  You can see when coffee is freshly roasted by the foam it leaves in the filter when you brew it. You can also taste a freshness.  This coffee had neither. Over all it was just mediocre and like I say in the title, it is not as good as Starbucks, which is not the best either, but at least a common reference point for many.

The first time i tried it i knew this was the roast for me. Upon arrival I opened the bag and noticed the beans still had all of the oils on them still holding in all the flavor of a fresh roast. They smelled great, and i've never had a fresher bolder cup of brew. I'm hooked on the taste, and I'll most likely never go back to shelf or store bought coffee again.

review/summary: Italian Espresso roast - perfect for my daily drink
review/text: The wife and I love coffee.  We're not coffee aficionados that pick apart this and that about beans and roasting, we leave that to the pros.  But we do appreciate a good cup of joe on a daily basis.  This coffee delivers.  Given how much coffee we drink, I'm curious to see how long this 5lb bag will last us.  I'll update this review when I'm down to a pound, that means it's re-order time.  This has become our daily drinker and has replaced the Starbucks Espresso Roast that we've been buying for $10/lb the last couple years.  It makes a nice, dark smooth coffee each and every time.  Almost sweet and not very acidic.  For my 16oz traveler, I fill it up, put half a tsp of Coffeemate creamer and half a tsp of sugar and I'm good to go.  Aromatic, and nice and bold, just sweet enough to enjoy for my first hour of the day.  Keep in mind, we do not own an espresso maker, this stuff goes in our grind and brew coffee maker each and every day...twice a day.  I'm not a big espresso drinker, not because I don't like it, but because I don't own a machine and don't really have the time to make shots most days.  This coffee seems like it would do the trick in that dept as well, but I wouldn't know.  I do know that this coffee makes a great daily drip that is not too in your face but gives you exactly what you're looking for.  We will be purchasing again when the time comes, and as always, excellent job Amazon, for quick delivery.<br /><br />EDIT 1/24/11<br />I meant to update when I re-ordered coffee but forgot.  This 5lb bag lasted us from 10/30/10 through 1/17/11, sometimes brewed twice, most times brewed once daily.  I got wonderful news from my doc that I needed to cut my daily caffeine intake, so I'm down to brewing in the morning, which means this next batch of coffee might last a little longer...let's see how fresh it stays.  All-in-all, this was a very good coffee.  So good that we'll continue to purchase this brand and blend from now on.<br /><br />EDIT #2 5/10/11<br />Upgrade to 5-stars.<br /><br />I re-ordered another 5lb bag at the end of April 2011.  The previous bag didn't last nearly as long as my first order.  I tihnk it has something to do with the fact that we (wife and I) purchased an expresso maker.  It's not a fancy one, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XT6AX6">mypressi TWIST Handheld Espresso Maker</a> makes pretty good espresso and these beans realy do make a decent shot.  I don't have a burr grinder, but bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BRLXUI">Mr. Coffee electric grinder</a> to prepare grinds for the espresso shots.  Even after being ground with an electric grinder (purists will not agree), these beans do make a good shot with even better crema.  Now I can honestly say these beans do not disappoint one bit - for both daily drip coffee and single shot espresso, these beans are superb.

review/summary: Strong yet low acidity!  My favorite espresso.
review/text: I've had lots and various espresso all around the states, Canada, Spain, Germany, Italy...  This is a really good, unique coffee/espresso.<br /><br />I run this through an Aerobee Aeropress.  Not the best, but certainly not the worst.<br /><br />Comparing this bean to the Lavazza Crema/Gusto that I purchased from Amazon, Coffee Bean Direct's  espresso is my fave because of its uniquely non-acidic flavor.  I'm not sure of what bean types are in CBD's blend but it has a strong flavor 'like' starbucks (if you've ever had their espresso straight up] without the burnt qualities, but does it without the lingering bitterness that comes from Illy, Lavazza types.  However, depending on the mood, I may steep these beans/grinds an extra 30/40 seconds more for that bitterness/acidity.  Even with longer steep times, the  bitterness is never as heavy as the Italian brands.  The Lavazza is bitter even with an extremely short steep time.<br /><br />On the flipside, and as mentioned before, this blend has a punchy flavor that none of the Italian brands have.  The combination of the intense flavor with limited bitterness is why it's my favorite.<br /><br />I'm on my fourth bag and still loving its qualities whether in espresso or coffee/americano format.<br /><br /> Enjoy!

Trader Joes has some decent stuff, but I don't go there that often, and there is room for improvement.<br /><br />What we have here is part of that ongoing quest, and at $31 (if you subscribe) or so for 5lbs, you're looking at ~$6 a lb!  Don't forget most bags you get aren't a pound (12-13oz), so this would be a steal if it's good, let alone very good.  Let's get to the heart of what most people are looking for, it's very good coffee.  It's a dark roast that isn't too bitter, and it's not lacking in flavor.  It works well in lattes, americanos, and espresso.  I've had better, but it's definitely very good.  Now for those of you with a super automatic espresso machine, the oily beens won't work incredibly well in their shallow hopper.  It's no huge deal, as you'll need to give them a nudge or refill more often than usual.  They did work well in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a>, and I suppose they would in most grinder hoppers (generally steeper).<br /><br />I'm debating continuing my subscription and dealing with the sticking, as it's such a great deal.  I use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007D6M3E">Clip-n-Seal Bag Clips - Medium 10 pack</a> to clip the bag shut in a manner to preserve freshness, as wells a spare can leftover from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SJHO4M">Kicking Horse Coffee Z-Wrangler Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 12.3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> for quick access.  FYI, the Kicking Horse coffee is great too (I use it for cold brew coffee).  Anyway, this is good coffee with a few minor quirks for me (and perhaps not you) to deal with,

review/summary: Excellant Espresso and/or Coffee
review/text: Brewing this as an espresso yields a strong coffee flavor with mild bitterness.  If you grind it slightly course compared to an expresso grind it cuts down the bitterness to just a great overall coffee flavor.  I have also ground it as a normal coffee and it also comes out with a good strong coffee flavor.  Not over powering.<br /><br />So depending on what you like.  If you want a good coffee flavor coming out of your machine.  Go with this.  I also use San Francisco Bay Columbine Supreme and find both have great qualities.

review/text: I received my batch in November of 2011. This coffee turned out great and makes a nice strong brew that isn't bitter. I like a really strong brew. I use a Bialetti moka pot and a blade grinder to prepare my coffee and it turns out great. I have tried this coffee many different ways; straight, with half and half, and other times with syrups. I will continue to buy.

review/text: First time buyer of these 5 pound bags of coffee. I really like Italian Roast Coffee from 'you know who' and was hoping this would at least be close enough to switch to. Unfortunately it's average at best. No better than Eight O'clock Italian Roast Coffee which I can get at my local grocery. It's flavor seems dull and/or muddy, not at all what I like in my coffee. But it was a good try and many will like it I suppose. All is not lost as I donated the 4+ lbs of the bag to a school employees lounge that I know. I MAY try another from this roaster but I'm not sure.

review/summary: Smells like hotel lobby coffee but taste a bit better
review/text: After all the glowing reviews, I tried the Italian Roast and ground it fine for Espresso.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was that the aroma was not as rich as the Lavazza coffee beans I normally use and smelled burnt, but heck I would try it anyway.  The taste was better than I expected vs. the initial aroma of the beans.  The aroma after brewing was also of the burnt variety<br /><br />After trying it for two day with my Rancilio Silva espresso machine, I will go back to Lavazza and pay the premium.  Just to have the rich armoma of fresh coffee beans is worth it.  Maybe it would be better used in a regular coffee maker?<br /><br />If you like hotel lobby coffee and no rich aroma, then from the price it is not bad.

review/text: Having lived near Chicago for most of my adult life, I moved to a very rural spot in the northeast with few coffee offerings, even the grocery store (yes, store in singular).  Starbucks is two hours  away, and the only choice I had was to buy an espresso maker and begin to experiment.  This Italian Espresso is the best I have found, and I have stopped searching.  I will be buying my fifth bag soon.  The roast is always dark and consistent, the beans with a beautiful oily sheen.  I have a grinder, so in changing the consistency of the grind I can use it for all my coffee needs.  In fact, my consumption has increased considerably because I have company stopping for coffee all the time.

review/text: After reading all the reviews I bought the 5# bag with free shipping. It took over a week to get my order. I did so much want to like this coffee. My impressions are that it pulled a nice looking shot with a rich crema and good body. To me the coffee looks and tastes over-roasted. There is no discernable after taste lingering on the palate the way a good espresso does. I am only on day 2 of this bean. I froze most of it in tightly sealed mason jars and vacuum bags. The coffee has no fresh aroma and I am wondering if I received a fresh shipment. If not, their loss. I expected better than this, even considering the low cost. I hope it makes a decent drip coffee. If I change my mind about this bean I will add commentary, but until then I am left wondering about the 4 and 5 star reviewers.

review/summary: Freshly roasted beans and great taste!
review/text: I have purchased several varieties of a famous Italian brand of espresso beans through Amazon over the past 2 years. I use a Rancilio grinder and espresso maker and while not disappointed in the taste derived from the beans, they were seldom as fresh as I would prefer with very little or no exterior oil content and many times produced a weak crema on the espresso.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise when I ordered these beans and opened the bag! A beautifully colored roast and glimmering with an oily sheen. After an adjustment or two on the setting of my grinder, I was enjoying an espresso that was full of flavor but not bitter (not to mention a marked improvement in the quality and quantity of the crema).<br /><br />While preferred tastes vary among drinkers, you will be impressed with the freshness and quality of these beans. I'm ready for my re-order.

I tried a couple of different grinds however ended up with my grinder set at just into the extra fine range.  I used the Gaggia recommended two scoops for a double espresso and a fairly firm tamp.<br /><br />I loved the results!  I preferred the taste over the Lavazza.  The brew also resulted in more crema than the Lavazza.  The crema seemed to last forever.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/text: I have been using this blend from CBD for a year or so.  Everyone at our house loves it.  It's less oily and less burned than Charbucks.  Renders an excellent crema for espresso.  We use subscribe and save and the savings with this 5 pound bag are astronomical.  You get five pounds for about the price of 3 of the 11 ounce Charbucks bags.<br /><br />We have tried other varieties of beans from CBD.  They have a great selection and you can get just what you want, whether its a heavy roast convention or a mild shade grown organic.  I recommend this brand to all of my coffee fiend friends.<br /><br />Incidentally, we use it with a Saeco Vienna super-automatic.  Online reviews frequently mention that a lot of beans, particularly the oilier ones, will cause mechanical problems, such as gunking up the burr grinder, etc.  With the CBD beans, we haven't had any problems with the Saeco.

Upon brewing you know you have a good cup of coffee after that smell permiates the office and you see a line in front of the coffee maker before its even done.  I would highly recommend this coffee due to the overall quality of the beans and the smooth taste of the coffee itself.

We have an Espresso machine and ground the beans each morning. 5lbs is a lot of coffee to buy and end up not liking it, but the other reviews are spot on. Makes a wonderful coffee for Cappuccino and Espresso. It is not as good as the Esssey (which is very robust), slightly below the Illy but find it better than the Starbucks brand which tends to be a slight bit bitter.  I have used all the other brand names so if you have tried any of them you will have a baseline to help make your decision to purchase. We are going to order another bag.

review/text: These coffee beans arrived within 24 hours from Amazon, and were perfectly fresh and oily black, so I don't agree with the review saying you should order from the roaster and pay the shipping, at least not if you are an Amazon Prime customer.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I ground some straight away and just finished a four-shot espresso made on an old-model Pavoni (with the manual press and the eagle on top), and can tell you that it was delicious - not as "creamy" or thick-bodied as some, but absolutely dark and espresso-tasting - nutty, tangy, good after-taste. All in all, very satisfying and I'm already looking forward to another later in the day. I think it will do fine in the French press as well. In sum, for less than half the price of Starbucks or Peets, these beans are a great value and I would recommend them to serious espresso drinkers (although true coffee snobs won't be happy with spending so little, I'm sure!).<br /><br />As for the five pounds, I filled a cannister with about a week's worth, then divided the remainder into four sealed plastic storage bags, put them in the original bag the beans came in, wrapped the whole thing in plastic and stuck it in the freezer, so I can easily remove a cannister-portion at a time.

I would compare this to the italian roast from Peets, and that is a good solid blend in my opinion. With subscribe and save, its really hard to beat this stuff for the price.<br /><br />Just as an idea, we go through a couple of pots a day between 5-6 of us, so we are regular coffee drinkers, and we appreciate a good brew. I think if you pick up a bag you won't be let down. There are other coffee brands that are out there that are better, but for the price this stuff is hard to beat. If you want some coffee that I really  enjoyed, I'd go with some of the Kicking Horse stuff.

review/text: Fabulous - very nice dark roast, not at all bitter or with that "burned" taste that many dark roasts have. I'll be putting this into my french press and drinking this for a long time.<br /><br />If I had anything critical to say, it would be the packaging. Why in the world do they not make these resealable? It's 5 pounds people, I'll have this bag around for at least two months. If anyone has suggestions about storing this, please let me know. There has to be a better way than a rubber band around the bag that often breaks in the freezer.

review/summary: Great espresso at a reasonable price
review/text: Excellent everyday espresso. Dark oily beans. Quality has been delightfully consistent - we've been getting 5 lbs. every 2-3 months for quite some time now. The blast of aroma when you open the vacuum seal bag is amazing.

review/summary: Wake up world!
review/text: I have tried numerous coffees. I have tried every brand on the grocery isle, numerous web purchases, I have even tried roasting my own (which turned out quite decent, just time consuming). That brings me to this coffee; It first arrived at my house and I immediately check the packaging. The aroma was seeping through the packaging giving it just enough air to continue the roasting process even in the packaging and delivering stages. A true Italian espresso is a nice dark, oily black. After cutting open the bag I found this to be true with the Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso. There was no chass in the beans (the chass is the outer layer of the green bean which crackles and falls off during the roasting process). Something that I found with other online vendors. The grinding process was as expected, after numerous grinds the oils tend to cause the grounds to stick and clog any chutes they come in contact with. This is not a fault of the beans or the quality of the beans simply a price I pay for enjoying a cup of dark roasted espresso. The flavor of the product was amazing. It has every hint of nuts and coffee flavor that I love. The product is simply amazing. The cost is a plus too. With the item shipping monthly I can not find a better deal on such a great product anywhere!<br /><br />I have also tried the Six Bean Espresso, it too is simply amazing. There are a lot of different flavor profiles found in the beans. When I want to switch things up I order a bag of it. :)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFAX2">Six Bean Espresso, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Gourmet ona Budget--A Better Coffee Bang than the "buck"!
review/text: Best Value Period! Grocery bean coffee has now become too pricey, especially when you consider it is not fresh! And forget ANY coffee in a can;I could mention numerous celebrated name brands here that have no more quality than "Direct" and cost sooooo much more,nevermind. This is my third outing with Coffee Bean Direct, tried other grinds and was very satisfied, the Italian Espresso lives up to the other reviews here, just finished my morning cup, black with sugar,[no froth for me] made with the approved Melita method, science IS a part of this mix, as is GOOD water--believe it! This espresso has a rich clean taste with a great after taste and NO acid. Do a Google on the Melita coffee making method and give it a try with any olde bean your are drinking, there is a difference. BTW, if there is any downside it could be that 5 lbs last a good while, so keeping a very tight seal on the bag while using 1 pound containers[poured off]at a time helps preserve that "fresh" taste. We have always refrigerated[not frozen]and have been pleased with the results. Are there better coffees, probably so, but you are gonna pay about double, the law of "diminishing returns" kicks in at this point! C'mon, you can almost buy 2 bags of Direct to their one for the same money! Do the Math!

review/summary: Nice dark roast
review/text: This is a nice dark roast. We normally drink a French Roast as we like our coffee strong, but tried this and really like it. Probably will still order the French Roast, but this is a nice change every once in a while. Beans were fresh and the price was right.<br /><br />MH

review/text: Great expresso coffee! It's strong with lots of flavor. I used to buy Italian Roast from Starbucks, but this product is so much better. It's fresh, aromatic, and delicious. It has this creamy strong flavor. HIGHLY recommend this!

review/summary: Great price and size!
review/text: I really like this coffee!  Not having to going to the store to figue out what<br />kind of coffee to buy and at what price is great! As coffee prices continue to rise, bulk buying is<br />the way to go. If you like dark, rich coffee,this could easily double for a Starbucks bag of<br />beans. With free shipping, I can not imagine getting coffee any other way.

review/text: The title says it all!  No more high dollar Illy espresso for me.  Saving money on my espresso habit was 1/2 the reason I bought an espresso maker, and it was not making any sense to spend all that $ on Illy beans.  These beans are just as good!

review/text: I'm VERY particular about my coffee beans and like my coffee dark and strong.  Before their pricing got ridiculous, Starbucks French Roast was my go-to blend. This coffee is as good and comes at half the price. You can't beat that.

review/summary: Smelled Great But Coffee Lacked Flavor
review/text: I bought the Italian Roast Espresso after reading all the great reviews.  I like dark roast, bold coffee so I was prepared to like this coffee.  Unfortunately, even thought the coffee looked and smelled great when I opened the bag, I felt it lacked flavor.  The coffee is definitely bold but and was very bland in flavor. I rarely use flavored creamer but had to with this coffee to add a little something.

review/summary: Not to my liking
review/text: This Coffee arrived on time and was well packaged.  Taste is individual, but I found this coffee to have a "burned" taste.<br />My guess is that it was either over roasted or roasted at too high a temperature.<br /><br />It leaves an aftertaste on the top of the tongue and, for me, it tastes burned.<br /><br />As many people really like this coffee, I may have gotten a bad batch, but I will not risk a second try.
