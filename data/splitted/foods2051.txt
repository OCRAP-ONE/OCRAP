review/text: I didn't even realize I had some of this at home, from a gift directly from Japan. It was just sitting around forever, when I finally decided to try it. What an experience. I am a tea person--I mean, I have a cupboard full of different types of loose tea of all varieties. This quickly became my any-time-of-day-or-night favorite. I've tried another tea vendor's version of Genmai Cha, but so far, Hime has a richer, woodier flavor that is perfect 24/7!

review/summary: Quick and apparently yummy toy
review/text: If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

review/summary: Num num bacon num num
review/text: I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.

review/summary: I Love These Say My Dogs
review/text: I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.
review/text: I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.

My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.  They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.

review/text: My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).

review/summary: Read the fine print
review/text: We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this "edible" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically "edible", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these "healthy" edible Nylabones.

review/summary: Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: Great energy booster for those long cycling rides
review/text: I stumbled across this product at my local bike shop prior to doing a 40 mile ride (my 1st 40 miler).  I am diabetic and always concerned that I'd be on a long ride and my glucose levels would tank leaving me in a very bad situation - if you are diabetic then you know what I mean (similar to bonking as the term is used in cycling) but probably a bit more serious.  Because of the diabetes, I would not take my medicine before my rides (I typically ride very early mornings) because of my concern of low levels, but with this product, I no longer have those concerns.  I wanted something light (don't like heavy meals when riding, don't like milky type drinks or overly sweet tasting drinks when riding either) that would keep me going once I got out on the road and this was just the ticket.  I use it as a supplement to my one pack of oatmeal meal before a ride along with a honey stinger organic waffle and banana; it keeps the energy levels up and includes ingredients to keep your electrolytes in order, too - not too bad, huh.  During those long rides is a time when I as a diabetic welcome loads of carbs and bit of caffeine don't hurt either.  It mixes well and the taste is very very light, too; I like the tropical fruit flavor.  At first I thought it was something wrong because the taste was so light, but later read that that's how it is.  I carry 2 water bottles on all my rides and this energy drink will definitely be one of the two drinks that go with me on my rides.  Before buying a jug, you can try one of the single packs to see if you like it and which flavor you like best; they actually taste pretty good.  I would not recommend this to those that are couch potatoes though, especially diabetic couch potatoes.

review/summary: Revised from Disappointed to not bad
review/text: Updated Review:<br /><br />I was forced to use this on a recent 75 mile ride and I must say I was too hasty in my earlier review. This worked very well. I still won't get another can, but it is good to know that it works as advertised.<br /><br />Previous Review:<br /><br />I love GU gel so I thought I would give this a try on bike rides lasting longer than 2 hours. This don't taste as great and is not as effective as Perpetuem from Hammer. There is no protein component in this mix. The ratio in Perpetuem has worked well for me, this Roctane drink failed miserably. I will finish the canister during my workouts at the gym.

review/summary: Pretty, nutty taste, interesting(?) texture.
review/text: We're big quinoa fans, so I decided to give Kaniwa a try. It's very similar, but a much smaller grain. We cooked it basically the same way. The appearance on the plate was very pretty - reminded me of caviar. I really enjoyed the lightly nutty flavor. The texture, because of the small grains, is a bit grainy or sandy. I didn't mind it, but some people don't like unusually-textured foods. It's possible that the texture would be less distinct, had we cooked it longer - quinoa, I know, has a very different texture if you cook it al dente or let it go till the grains puff out.  Worth a try if you're a quinoa lover!

review/text: The tea wasn't light green as it was shown in the picture, but rather a dark green-brown. That might be attributed to the flash of the camera, but I'm not certain.  The tea itself definitely has a bit of a smoky flavor as desired by a gunpowder green tea, and is mostly in a pellet form, so I give it a 4/5 stars. Definitely worth the price.

review/text: My cats have been eating both tuna with egg and tuna with cheese for at least six years and they love it. My cats are checked out at the vet annually and they have always been very healthy. Some cats will not eat canned food if they are not introduced to it as kittens, and one of my cats is a rescue from a shelter and he only drinks sauce or juice from cans with "chunks" of something.  This 9 Lives food is flaked or shredded tuna, very tiny pieces, so he eats this without problems and loves it.  I have been buying this cat food for years and will continue buying it.

review/summary: Good Enough Most of the Time
review/text: I have four cats which live in my home and I also feed one feral cat who lives outside. Though the feral has been eating at my house for 10 years, he still runs away whenever I come out the door. BUT, he does return once the food is left for him.<br /><br />My inside kitties are pretty spoiled and eat mostly Pro Plan and Fancy Feast, but for my feral guy (whom I had Trapped, Neutered, and Returned to me) Nine Lives and Friskies are his daily fare.<br />He really, really likes this Flaked Tuna with Cheese bits in sauce. He is also an aficianado of other of their varieties, but this one with the cheese is one of his favorites.<br /><br />I, like most cat people, have a regimen for feeding of the felines. At 5:00 PM, my inside kitties get their wet food. They have dry food available all day, but as the days winds down, it is time for the wet stuff. I give them six, three ounce cans of various varieties of Pro Plan and Fancy Feast with the feeding station being set up in the master bath.<br /><br />Clever creatures that they are, they soon learned that I then headed to the kitchen where I prepared dinner for Feral Kitty. They found that if they whined and begged, I would give them an additional can of food just to shut them up, so that I could get Feral Kitty's dinner to him. He gets two 5.5 ounce cans plus dry food.<br /><br />One day I decided to quit putting the expensive stuff out in the kitchen for my inside guys. It was getting out of hand expense wise. So, I plopped down Flaked Tuna and Cheese, went and fed Feral Kitty and then was on my way. The next day I noticed that the little inside guys had eaten ALL the 9 Lives I had given them. It was a big AHA for me. They are not so picky as I thought. They took like this Tuna with cheese. For a long time, I bouught them Albacore tuna when it went on sale at the grocery store for 10 for $10. They got tired of it. But, the would eat the 9 lives. I was astounded. So, I have kept my Feral Kitty quite happy with his favorite Tuna with cheese. Plus, I am now saving a bit by giving the more inexpensive 9 lives to the inside kitters. Everyone likes it!!<br /><br />So, Flaked Tuna with cheese comes highly recommended by Trinity, Gabriella, Wisdom, Mercy, and FERAL KITTY....and me. Hope your less choosy, or tired of the rich stuff, cats will enjoy this alone with mine!

review/text: My 19 year old cat eats both hard food and canned food and 9-Lives Select Tuna with Cheese Bits is the one canned food brand that she never tires of. First she licks the juices out and then returns to finish the solids. Unfortunately, both Petco and Petsmart stopped carrying these Del Monte 4-pack brands and I was unable to find this in the major nearby grocery stores as they must have given up their shelf space to higher profit-margin labels. I was happy to see this product available on amazon.com and order 3 cases about every 2 months. With the reasonable selling price and speedy delivery my cat is happy too.

Cinnamon Plum Spice disappeared from my grocer's shelves months ago, and has been out of stock on Amazon as well. Glad to see it's still available!<br />However, the price is unbelievable - if I am reading this right, these are $5.93 for a box of 5 *little* packets of oatmeal (1 packet is half a breakfast serving for a grown-up!) I buy other flavors of this brand in my grocery store on sale for as little as $1.50 a box of 5 packets. That would be 30� versus $1.87 per packet? Are you kidding me??

review/text: The reason for me purchasing this gum is because it was NOT made with ARTIFICAL SWEETNERS.  Every gum today is made with a low calorie SWEETNER and it was madding trying to find one that used real sugar but Freshen Up Gums do.  This gum has a nice burst up juicy flavor in the center which helps carry the gums taste along.  It is soft not hard which sometimes is a problem I found with finding gum made with real sugar. And then the flavor last a good long while which was another reason I like Freshen Up over other brand. So nice flavor, soft texture, long lasting, and no ARTIFICAL sweetners. For me that rounds out or should I say squares up to be the perfect piece of gum.

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

review/summary: My cat loves Whiskas Beef in Gravy
review/text: My cat will eat NOTHING but Whiskas Beef in Gravy cat food. Being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing. I get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues. Its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food. Her cat is her companion through hard times.

review/summary: My cats come running
review/text: I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food.

review/text: I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!

review/summary: Very average product.
review/text: I was happy to see "single-serve" dried cherries.  When they arrived, not so happy to notice they had added sugar.  Surely cherries have enough natural sugar that adding more is unnecessary?  And then, they were exceedingly sweet, and just "sugar" flavored, not really cherryish at all.  I could only choke down 5 or 6 (while drinking lots of water to eliminate the sugariness) at one time.  Not a repeat buy.

review/summary: Hormel Real Bacon Bits
review/text: It's very convenient to have these in the cupboard.  The pieces are too small to be considered appropriate for such things as baked beans or other dishes where you want crumbled bacon.  For times when you want a taste of bacon, in small pieces, such as in scrambled eggs, they are excellent.  They feel, smell and taste like freshly cooked bacon.

review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />*****<br />update 2011-01-06, Thursday<br /><br />the stuff i got is the item i refer to in the review as the OLD version. apparently the data shown by amazon is actually the out-of-date info and the newer info is what i called OLD. [*grin*]<br /><br />very good & well worth a FOUR.<br />*****<br /><br />i rate this [based on the previous version] a FOUR.<br /><br />the previous version ["You purchased this item on July 6, 2010"] of this was really _quite_ good. this stuff is lovely on sandwiches, scrambled eggs, baked potatoes, mac-n-cheese and most anything that you like with bacon on it. that's most anything for me. [*grin*]<br /><br />i came here to buy some more and now i'm hesitating. why? cuz ...<br /><br />old - no mention of "picnic bacon" on label<br />new - "with picnic bacon"<br /><br />what is picnic bacon? from google = "Picnic bacon is from the picnic cut, which includes the shoulder beneath the blade. It is fairly lean, but tougher than most pork cuts."<br /><br />old - no mention of smoke flavoring<br />new - "smoke flavoring added"<br /><br />often, to me, smoke flavoring tastes sweetish. i don't care for sweet bacon.<br /><br />old - "50% less fat than USDA data for pan-fried bacon"<br />new - "30% less fat than USDA data for pan-fried bacon"<br /><br />more fat? does that mean more flavor or more of the [very rare in the old package] lumps of pure fat that are so ... revolting when bitten into?<br /><br />old - "Fat content has been lowered from 3 g to 1.5 g per serving"<br />new - "Fat content has been lowered from 3 g to 2 g per serving"<br /><br />more fat in another measurement. again, what does it mean to the flavor?<br /><br />they are still both "one tablespoon = one slice fully cooked bacon". plus, they are still the same 4.3 ounces per package.<br /><br />i'm gonna buy the stuff but it worries me when SO MANY changes show up.

review/text: These pods cost way more than ordering through Nespresso. I didn't know that and paid about twice the amount I should have. Also it took 3 weeks to ship. When I ordered through Nespresso it took 3 days. On top of all that, many of the pods were crushed. Some didn't even work they were so crushed. In the end, don't buy the pods here. Just buy them from Nespresso's website.

review/text: While I am very pleased to see Nespresso machines available for sale on Amazon, it is very counter-Amazon that this supplier is being allowed to offer Nespresso coffee capsules on Amazon at such inflated prices and slow shipping times. One is supposed to be able to go to Amazon for better pricing and excellent order fulfillment/delivery.<br /><br />This supplier charges twice the amount that you will pay buying directly online from Nespresso (and from a much larger assortment as well!). Also, Nespresso express ships them in a matter of days versus weeks from this supplier.<br /><br />Nespresso coffee is excellent! The Nespresso system is one of the best additions I ever bought for our kitchen. However, while it could make sense for you to buy the machine here on Amazon, please do not buy the capsules from this supplier.

I couldn't figure out if I was missing something in the description...perhaps 100 capsules for $55? No, 50 capsules for this price. Why would anyone in their right mind pay TWICE as much for the same thing you can get directly from Nespresso? Oh by the way, the coffee arrives the next day without having to pay for premium shipping. I have been buying directly from them for almost four years and have never had a problem. Amazon you really need to take these people off of your store! Some unsuspecting person will buy a machine on this site and buy coffee at a 100% mark up. They won't be happy when they find out how they got ripped off on the capsules.

But I was suckered into purchasing this set of overpriced coffee capsules when it appeared as discount pricing together with a nice capsule stand. It was implied that I would be saving money, but as has already been adequately pointed out, the actual price here is double what the manufacturer charges.<br /><br />What disturbs me is that I tried to cancel this order before it was shipped. I have never had problems with Amazon before, but every time I tried to cancel (I tried at least 6 times), I got an error message that said to try again. Ultimately, the order was shipped (from Arizona I think) and I got it OK. But I cannot recommend this price or supplier.

review/text: The product is great.  Unfortunately, the company's extraordinarily difficult website makes purchasing Nespresso capsules all but impossible.  That difficulty requires me to pay 40-60% higher prices by forcing me to buy from 3rd party providers like Amazon or Ebay.  Nespresso's marketing strategy has created a BLACK MARKET in their Nespresso capsules.  I called their 800 phone number, it hangs up on me.  There is no customer support email to whom I can email my complaint, and their postal address is in England.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.

review/summary: A great coffee experience
review/text: We have used pretty much every coffee brewing method, but I think for home or office use the Nespresso is best. We also have and use a Kurig. For larger cups of coffee we use it. But for the small tasty concentrated cups (expresso) we always use the Nespresso. The variety pack has a good variety of blends; coffee tastes fresh. In combine with the machine (we bought one without all the bells & whistles), it is simple to use and clean. My office bought one of the nespresso machines; then I bought one for home. It came very well packaged and with good set up directions. To be a perfect experience, the capsules would be more readily available -- you will find the machines, but not the capsules at many places.

review/summary: Don;t Buy
review/text: Coffee is nice but way over priced.  I was especially concerned by many of the reviewer's disappointment with this Israeli production.  I personally prefer NOT to buy anything from Israel, so it is good to know the source of the product.
