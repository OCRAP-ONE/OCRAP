review/summary: Eliquid
review/text: This oil is great for creating your own eliquid. With this and just a touch of a tobacco flavoring, you get a flavor that is a perfect match to that of a menthol cigarette. Flavor is great, so I guess it would be good for food to even though I didn't use it for that.

review/summary: Trio bars are the best
review/text: Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.  I love them.  They come in four flavors.  Tropical is my least favorite of those flavors, but I still really like it, just not as much as the others.  The tropical flavor is more subtle than the other flavors; there isn't a strong flavor from any of the tropical fruits contained in it.  So if you enjoy the nuts and seeds and don't want a strong fruit component coming through, you might like the tropical ones best.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the "glue" that holds all the other ingredients together.  The "third" fruit in the tropical flavor is actually three tropical fruits:  pineapple, mango and papaya.  I can't taste any distinct flavor of pineapple and the mango and papaya are very light.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is "good" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.  I'd rather eat my least favorite flavor of these than just about any other bar.

review/text: I used to love Mr. May's bars, but not this last batch.  They've changed the packaging from a well-sealed pouch to a thin cellophane wrapper.  The new ones are rock hard and disgusting.  One of the boxes I got had several unsealed cellophane pouches which I had to throw away.  I'm done, Mrs. May.

review/text: I have heard people rave about these but had not been able to find them in local stores. I was apprehensive about purchasing a 24 pack of something I was not sure I would even like but the price was good (less than $1 each) so I went for it. I am so glad I did, these are yummy and versatile. You can eat them as is, you can break them up into large chunks and sprinkle them over a salad or into smaller chunks for yogurt, you can also put them in your favorite cookie dough or pancake batter. I will be ordering more of this flavor and the others before the promo is over.

review/text: These are really great bars.  They're not for everybody, but if you enjoy Mojo bars, or anything similar with nuts and/or seeds.  A bit hard, so if you're looking for something soft, this isn't for you.  Probably something you should try before getting a big package of them.  I have purchased them at Whole Foods before.  You may be able to get singles here as well.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: We like these Mrs. May's Trio Natural Bars. These are a little on the chewy, sticky side, so beware, if you have dental problems (chew carefully). Packaged in an almost indestructible cello package. The ingredients are as follows: Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Tropical Fruits (Pineapple, Mango, Papaya), Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Dates, Raisins, Rice Malt, Natural Flavors, Cane Juice, Sea Salt. That's it! There are 24 bars in a 28.8 oz or 840 gram box. Each bar is 1.2 oz or 35 grams. The box says: vegan/no trans fat/no additives/no preservatives/no cholesterol/gluten free/diary free/wheat free/non-GMO/kosher and product of China (that worries me more than a little). Calories 170 each, 100 calories from fat, 12 grams total fat, 1.5 grams saturated fat, 0mg cholesterol, 45mg sodium, 14g total carbohydrate, 2g dietary fiber, 6g sugar, 5g protein, 2% calcium, 8% iron, 0% vitamins A & C. Yummy flavor, can taste the nuts and tropical fruit, not too sweet for most people, certainly a lot less sweet than any other granola/snack/breakfast/protein type bar we've tried. Wish they were bigger, pretty small. Otherwise, very good bars.

review/text: I got a box of Trio bars for quick sugar supply during work. They taste great, and servings are the perfect size for me (one per day, without getting too much calories).<br /><br />They are not messy in the sense that the bars do not stick to hands or surfaces. However one small annoyance is they are dry, causing spread of small chips, and a need to clean up the desk after eating.

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA!!  ~ This ruins it for us!!
review/text: Ya know, we tried this product and loved everything about it except the fact that they are made in China (and they are quite pricey) We've had toy recalls b/c of lead in paint on toys MADE IN CHINA, we've had dog food recalls b/c of melamine in the food MADE IN CHINA.  Even though these products have SOME American grown fruits and nuts in them, that promising fact is completely RUINED b/c it's all shipped to China where it is made into bars, etc. and packaged. If you know anything about how much pesticide and insecticide is used on those ships --and how many rats are on board--you'd probably refrain from eating this product again.  C'mon Mrs. Mays--if you really want to be "wholesome," you'll choose to make and package your product right here in the good ol' USA where oversight is better and, in which case, your fruits and nuts would not be exposed to the toxic environment of a slow boat to China.  Also, you wouldn't want to encourage the horrible work conditions in China for the Chinese people. Mrs. May's needs to JUST SAY NO TO CHINA, make an all-American product, and then we'll buy!  For now, even the half-price lightning deal just is not worth the risk of the product being "poisoned" or tampered with in China.  We recommend buying a bag of nuts and a few pounds of fruit--it'll be less expensive!! Who needs the bars after all, although they are convenient.<br />Read this from Mrs. May's website:<br /><br />IS THE PRODUCT ACTUALLY MADE IN THE US WITH US INGREDIENTS?<br />No, we ship our raw materials to China from USA and they are packaged in China and brought back to USA.<br />Direct Link if you want more information:<br />[...]

review/summary: Best. Granola Bars. Ever.
review/text: After years of trying different granola/energy bars, I was ready to give up. Everything I tried was either too dry, too tough to eat, or too disgusting to contemplate. I had pretty much given up.<br /><br />I was given a sample of Granola Gourmet at my local Whole Foods, and I was instantly hooked. These are simply THE BEST granola bars I have ever had.<br /><br />Moist, flavorful, and remarkably filling, I'm totally hooked on them! The Spiced Orange Cranberry and [[ASIN:B002AJ1S1E Granola Gourmet Very Berry Granola Bars, 10-Count Bars<br />(Pack of 2)]] are my favorites, and my wife loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AJ1RME">Granola Gourmet Chocolate Espresso Granola Bars, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />The fact that they are diabetic-friendly makes them even better! A friend of ours gave up wheat, dairy, and refined sugar for Lent, and was having a hard time of it. I gave him a couple of my Granola Gourmet bars, and he was hooked! Lent is long since over, and he's still eating them every week.<br /><br />THANK YOU Granola Gourmet team for bringing such a great product to the masses!

Not for me.<br /><br />On the positive side (sort of) I got a package that was 1 short of the four packs that were supposed to be in the box and had a post-it note indicating that one was missing - but it got sent anyway?  Odd.  When I let Amazon know, they refunded my entire purchase price.  Bad product, good customer service.  So I didn't feel bad at all when I tried several bites from two of the packs, then tossed the whole batch in the garbage.  Oh boy, Oberto.

review/text: I do not know what has happened to this product. I once loved it. Now it is completely dried up and almost tasteless! I continued to buy it many times hoping I had just received a bad batch but have seen no improvement. Too bad. It was once my favorite snack.

review/summary: OK, but not great
review/text: This is marketed as "thin style", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars.

review/summary: NOT The *Classic* THIN STYLE!!!
review/text: This jerky is delicious, but please don't think it is the Oh Boy! Oberto Thin Style from 15-20 years ago.  You remember, right?  It was about as thick as 4-5 sheets of paper and oh-so easy to chew?  Well, this product is pretty damn THICK for a supposed "thin" jerky.  If all you care about is flavor, then go for it.  It's salty, but that's what makes it good.  I was hoping it would be the classic thin style, but NOPE.

review/summary: Regular is Salty--Peppered is Great
review/text: I would say I get less salt from sucking on a handful of sunflower seeds. This was horrible. Despite what the package says this is not the original jerky. I would eat a bag a day back in 2005 and 2006, so I was so excited to see this but it did not taste at all like the jerky from way back then.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just ate the thin peppered beef jerky and was surprised by the difference between the flavor of the peppered and the original flavor. Two thumbs up for the peppered jerky, in fact they don't even tast like they were made from the same company. I will make sure to always only buy peppered.

review/summary: Salty leather strips
review/text: If you like beef jerky that is dry, over salted and super tough then Oberta Peppered Thin Style is sure to please. Despite being very tough in the first place the poor meat quality contained large amounts of gristly material that simply could not be chewed. The peppered flavoring was not bad and the only notable highlight in an otherwise terrible product. So two stars on the review. Otherwise this is worst quality jerky I have ever tried.

It seems more people go for the thick jerkey, and flavored with sweetners, but this one is salty and very thin, just perfect, and adding the pepper makes it perfect for me. It is a little expensive for the amount you get, but worth it for me.

review/summary: Not a good substitute for the Senseo pods. Very disappointed.
review/text: We purchased these Wolfgang Puck Coffee pods because Amazon has had Senseo pods out of stock for quite awhile.  We love our Senseo coffee maker but it's difficult to find the pods anywhere else (except from Senseo and they cost quite a bit more than the ones we purchased from Amazon).  We tried these Wolfgang coffee pucks but they're too thick to put 2 pods in at a time.  They come packaged one to an envelope and although we understand that the reason there is to make them seem "fresher" but it's a pain to have to cut up each envelope - not to mention a waste of paper.  The pods only produced about a 1/3 of a cup so we had to wait for the first one to finish brewing and then insert a new pod to make almost a full 8 ounces of coffee.  Even though the Senseo pods were packaged with a lot more pods into one package, they were still fresh and what's more important, we liked the coffee taste much better than the Wolfgang pucks. We will not be ordering the Wolfgang pucks again.

I read (and re-read) this product description, as I taste this coffee, wondering where the full-bodied cup with chocolate notes is?! No body at all and, most certainly, no chocolate notes. Wolfgang's coffees may be estate grown at high altitudes so that the coffee cherries may ripen slowly and happily, thus, allowing their unique flavors and aromas to fully develop blah, blah, blah, but the fact of the matter is that an infused dirty sock has more flavor than this "Chef's reserve", "Medium roast" atrocity. There must certainly be something wrong with the selection of the top 5% of the world's coffee production or Wolfgang's personal recipe has lost an ingredient or two because this coffee is simply AWFUL! Generic instant coffee has better (and more) flavor than this celebrity chef's gimmick.

review/summary: Nice alternative for Senseo
review/text: I have a Senseo, and I've been getting tired of the Senseo-brand coffee. Unfortunately, a lot of the "gourmet" coffee brands (Starbucks, Green Mountain) have partnered with the more upscale single-serve machines (Tassimo, etc.), so I was excited when I found these. I've been very pleased with them so far. As reviewers have noted about other WP roasts, the pods are packed very full and are a bit thicker than Senseo pods. I have found that 1 WP pod fits snugly but fine in Senseo's single-pod holder, but 2 WP pods do not fit in the double holder - although that is not a problem for me as I rarely brew 2 pods at once. I was happy to find that brewing 1 pod on the large setting produces a reasonably flavorful cup compared to some of the other brands, which only taste good on the small setting. I would definitely buy these again, and I look forward to trying some of the other WP roasts.

review/summary: Good coffee, not a seamless user experience to get it right
review/text: I decided to try this coffee after reading many positive reviews. It is pretty good for Senseo (definitely not the best coffee I've ever had as one reviewer noted - I'm not sure where she's been getting her coffee!). To get it to taste optimally, though, is not super-user friendly. The pods are bigger than most Senseo compatible options. This can result in richer tasting coffee, but requires just a bit more effort. I've found that I need to run the pod under the faucet and lightly pre-soak it before loading it in the machine to ensure my coffee brews the whole way through. Otherwise, it's watery. Also, it's a big pod and needs to be positioned in the single-serving filter just so in order to produce good coffee.<br /><br />If you follow those tips, it makes pretty good Senseo coffee. I'm not sure it's that much better than Senseo brand versions, but it's a fun change.

review/summary: One of his Best Blends
review/text: Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve is a hearty, medium roast hinting toward the territory of an Italian or French (roast), blended to deliver a bolder taste but not acidic or bitter.  It's the preferred blend in our house for waking up.  The 10g pods, being much thicker and heavier than any Senseo brand pod, require the use of the double pod holder.  You must also wet the bottom of the pod first before stuffing and pressing it into place in the holder to ensure a proper brew.  Yes, that's more than you do for a standard sized pod in the Senseo, but it's really no effort at all for a superior "cuppa Joe"...  You pay more for Puck's coffee, but you receive more for your money, and it seems clearly worth it from a taste perspective.  Enjoy!

review/summary: If only 2 pods could fit in my Senseo coffee maker .. 5 stars
review/text: The coffee is delicious, the cost under the subscribe plan is the best value in the marketplace, alas -- the size of the pods forces me to only load 1 pod and hence have to get a mug of java via the one pod button, remove the used pod and load the 2nd pod, then push the 1 cup again.  My mug is full;however, I have to standby and wait for the the first cup to complete before loading the 2nd pod and filling my mug.  Minor inconvenience more than offset by the taste and value of Wolfgang's product and the convenience of receiving the coffee at my doorstep without shipping or tax.  Highly recommended:-)

review/text: I tried these in my Senseo machine due to the unavailability of their brand of coffee pods.  Several attempts and finally got a decent cup of coffee.  If you use the single holder and wet the pod first you get stronger coffee with the foam!  these hold more coffee and you get water blow by if they are dry.  Weak nasty brown stuff that no one would want to drink.  Tried the double holder with similar results.  Got the idea for wetting them off the internet.  Wish i could give the person credit who figured it out!

review/summary: Best tasting coffee pod by far
review/text: I have a Bunn MyCafe single serve coffee maker at home. We used to have single serve coffee pods at work. Between home and work I've tried just about every non-flavoured coffee pod available. I've settled on Wolfgang Puck Chef Reserve as my favorite coffee by far. Yes, I mix it up with other brands and brews, but WP Reserve is what I reach for most of the time. I find it has just the right body (in between a lighter roast and a dark roast) combined with a smooth enjoyable flavor. BTW, Wolfgang Puck Coffee recently (summer of 2010) changed their packaging and branding, what was WP Reserve is now WP Chef Reserve in a new box (same great coffee).

review/summary: freshly roasted coffee in a pod
review/text: We have a Bunn MyCafe pod coffee brewer in our office so that everyone can brew his or her favorite roast or flavor. WP coffee pods stand out as the freshest roasted coffee in a pod we have tried in the past three years. Reserve Blend is the favorite of those who like a bolder and darker cup. Toscana is the favorite of those who prefer a milder and smoother cup. This has become our standard coffee brand. Before WP we routinely had 5 or 6 different brands on the shelf. None of those have been touched since we discovered WP coffee pods.

review/text: I have a Juan Valdez one-cup brewer, and they stopped making the Juan Valdez pods. I tried Senseo and didn't care for them. I gave these a try, and WOW-I just love them! They are a little big for the brewer I have (I heard the Juan Valdez is almost the same as a Melitta) but I just make sure the edges are tucked in, and I don't have any problems.<br />The selling point of this coffee is the taste-it's really wonderful. It might be one of the best coffees I have ever had. The roast is strong, but not too strong. It's great for any time of day. I usually drink it in the morning, and for the first time I really forward to my morning coffee as a treat. I highly recommend!

review/text: this dont exactly fit correctly but make a decent coffee, better than the standard pods.  I'm generally not a huge fan of the senseo, but these make it better.  Still not as good as an above average coffee shop.  For iced coffee, the pods are strong enough to (barely) fit one pod into the single pod holder, brew a single, then put it aside and brew a double into your ice tray, so you have coffee cubes for your ice coffee.  MUCH better than using regular cubes.  I recommend chilling the coffee as well before mixing..  I like a strong cup if you couldn't tell!
