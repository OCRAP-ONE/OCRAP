review/summary: Quality treats
review/text: I purchased these for my home-bound mother to have on hand when people, accompanied by their various sized dogs, visit her.  She can give the huge labs multiple small biscuits and the tiny doxies one.  There was no need for various sized treats.  The service was excellent as usual and the quality of this product is excellent.  No imported ingredients.

I have pugs and they were too big for them.  I ended up having to break them all up to feed it to them.  Please ensure for future reference the description matches the product pictured.

review/summary: my favorite smoked salmon brand
review/text: I've tried three brands of smoked salmon.<br />Chicken of the Sea smoked salmon in the 3oz package is by far my favorite.<br />I pour the liquid from the pouch onto dried cat food, the the cats love it.<br />Rinsing the smoked salmon in the pouch removes the salt taste in my experience.<br /><br />Good at room temperature, nibbled from the pouch and on sandwiches, but I also use it for omelette's and salads.<br />Am here because I got tired of asking store managers to please stock more & decided to buy online in bulk.<br /><br />It keeps fresh in the pouch a long time btw. I've found pouches misplaced for years and it still tasted just fine.

review/text: I love salmon, and this has a good taste, a bit too salty, but I'll be using all of it.  One thing I wanted to mention is the smell.  It's STRONG. The first couple of times I ate it for lunch, I threw the empty packet in the trash under the sink. By dinner, my husband thought something had died in the kitchen! We were both looking for a dead mouse (sorry, but it was that bad) till I realized it was the salmon packet.  Now I take them out immediately. Luckily it tastes a lot better than it smells.

review/summary: Good for camping/emergency stash
review/text: I have used this Chicken of the Sea smoked salmon for my pasta dish and I found it to be satisfactory. It is not to my gourmet standard but it is decent food. The salmon is drier than the refrigerated smoked salmon you get at the local grocery store. Whether it is saltier than the one at grocery store could have been affected by the fact it is drier than normal. My suggestion for the use of this salmon is that it should be used for adding to pasta or to a dish. I think it is a little bit too dry for sandwich or for bagel and lox.<br /><br />I think it is good to keep a stash of this for emergency food as it can be kept at room temperature and I plan to use it for camping.<br /><br />Here is my recipe for the salmon dish I made last night. I cooked pasta according to instruction and drained. Added Extra Virgin Olive Oil to the drained pasta. Added two packages of the Chicken of the Sea Smoked Salmon and then add freshly ground lemon pepper spices and grated Parmesan Cheese. For healthier kick, I did add oat germ to the dish. It adds similar texture to the Parmesan cheese with a little oatey nutty flavor. The great benefit is that I added extra fiber and extra cholesterol lowering kick to the dish. Salmon is great source of Omega 3 which helps with the lowering of Triglycerides and Cholesterol.

review/text: This isn't terribly good smoked salmon.  The "smoke" is added liquid flavor.  The salmon is decent quality, but not top notch.  It's exactly what you should expect for this price.  That said, it's very good for putting in a spread.  A package of cream cheese, some chopped capers and dill, dump the whole package of this in and mix with a fork, and you have a pretty darn good salmon spread.  It's also tasty on crackers, if you just want a quick fix of something salmon-y.  For what it is, it's perfectly acceptable.

review/summary: Good Smoked Salmon
review/text: First off like a fellow reviewer stated put the package in the outside trash after opening i leaves an odor.  For the price of 3 ounces at the store its $5.00 per bag of a different brand, so this is a relative margin. I like it with Capers and it really gives you a low calorie meal and tastes well with the capers.  I prefer my smoked salmon thinner cut but this is pretty good.

review/summary: Pretty good, but hard to find
review/text: I used to eat a canned smoked salmon from Trader Joe's that was great and only about $2.59/can. Unfortunately TJ's discontinued that product a few years ago, and I hadn't been able to find a good alternative until I found this product. Now that I've found it, at only one store in Tucson, AZ, I think I've bought them out and they are not restocking it. It's frustrating. I use it for a meal with cheese and crackers.<br />I will agree that it can be dry, but that's what I used the juice for in the packet. The size is good, but the smell is very strong. I think it's worth what you want to use it for and for me, it works well, tastes good; just wish it was a little cheaper. I pay close to $4 for each pouch.

review/summary: Tasty and versatile and, at least for me, not too salty.
review/text: THE GOOD:<br />The salmon is a decent sized piece of salmon, heat smoked, and salted.  Every package I've eaten has been tender and flavorful.  The salmon can serve as something in dips, roll-ups, with cream cheese and crackers or cucumber slices . . . and it can be the center attraction in a green vegetable salad or warmed and served with potatoes or rice.<br /><br />THE PROBLEMATIC:<br />Several reviewers mention the salty flavor.  In my experience, the salt is very strong in the liquid inside the pouch but not so strong in the salmon itself.  I've used the liquid in salad dressing and dips, but unless you like it salty, don't use all the liquid.  Comparing the sodium content of the smoked and non-smoked products (you have to adjust the listed amounts because for some reason the nutrition listings use 2 oz. serving for one and 3 oz. serving for the other) reveals that the difference is approximately 46 grams--or 1/5th more--for the smoked; perhaps the smoky aspect makes the salt taste stronger.<br /><br />In any even, I hope you try it and--most importantly--enjoy it!

review/summary: Chicken of the SALTY Sea
review/text: As other reviewers have stated, this product is way too salty.  Maybe that's a requirement for the unrefrigerated packaging to help preserve the salmon.  Maybe it's because most all processed and packaged food contains way too much salt these days.  If you like smoked salmon stick to the packs in your grocers meat coolers.  Maybe this would be better if rinsed in cold water before consuming.

review/summary: A good snack item
review/text: This is a good item for a light meal, but you do need to like the flavor.  There are many varieties of smoked salmon.  This one does not have an overpowering smoke flavor (which some people do not like).  It tends to be a best buy compared to similar products, and is sometimes available in the seafood section in supermarkets.  It is a good source of Omega 3.  It comes in an easy to tear open package, but be forewarned that packages contain some amount of oil, and it is necessary to use care in opening the package.  I have some difficulty in finding this product in local supermarkets, including ones that used to carry it.<br /><br />A somewhat better product for general use is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NRMHFI">Tyson Chunk Chicken Breast, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> which can be used for a variety of purposes such as sandwiches, stuffed tomatos, and salads.

You get the smoothness of green tea and the robustness of black tea.  dont be fooled by hype, its just as good for you as green tea (they're all the same leaf: young budding tea is "white tea" whereas mature tea is "green" and very mature is "black").  I put the loose leaves in an infuser and get the hot water from my Keurig machine so I don't have to boil water.<br />  Anyway, this is great stuff and VERY cheap.  My local co-op charges about $65 per pound of oolong and this stuff is just as good.

I'm looking forward to ordering more just as soon as i get more room. 2 pounds of tea is a lot. As to the nay sayers who did not like this company's tea I say "rubbish" this tea is fantastic. ESPECIALLY at the price. What world do you live in that you can get gourmet tea for around a dollar an ounce? These are perfect workaday teas. I do not not want  a tea that the price makes me wince when  I make a cuppa. So in summation brilliant teas from one of my new favorite tea houses.

review/summary: Hibiscus oolong iced tea - yum!
review/text: My boyfriend and I like to go to a fancy tea tasting bar in Berkeley. They have a huge menu, but I tend to favor the oolongs. When we buy some to take home, it costs quite a lot for just 3 ounces of tea leaves. This same tea tasting bar was developing their own line of iced teas and were giving away samples of them for a while. I really liked the oolong-hibiscus, and I wanted to buy some but when we went there last time, they didn't have any. Soooo...I decided to make my own.<br /><br />A supermarket just a few blocks from me caters mostly to latin americans and sells hibiscus (or jamaica, in spanish) in bulk (although you can also buy it by the pound on Amazon...it was cheaper for me at this market, but if that market wasn't just a few blocks away I would have purchased from Amazon) and I found this oolong on Amazon and thought I would give it a try. To me this tea has a nice green, floraly and slightly smokey flavor and cost less for this huge bag than for 3 ounces at the tea bar. It worked quite well in my iced tea concoction, and I'll definitely be buying more when it runs out, although two pounds is a LOT, so it may be a while.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here is my version of oolong-hibiscus tea:<br /><br />1/4 c. oolong tea<br />1/3 c. hibiscus flowers (dried)<br />1/3 c. granulated sugar or equivalent amount of any neutral sweetener (I'd like to try some stevia)<br /><br />Pour four cups of boiling water over the tea and hibiscus. Let sit 15 mins or so. Add four cups of cold water, strain out the tea (I use an ice tea pitcher that comes with a removable tea compartment) and stir in your sweetener. Serve over ice. Yum!

You do not need to use a lot of tea as it could become bitter after it steeps and you leave the tea in the pot or cup and drink that way. I prefer a infuzer that way I can make it as strong as I would like. My husband jut throws the tea in the tea pot! I guess this is a personal preference. Enjoy!

review/summary: It's A Balance
review/text: I've been around the world, and good tea is one of my most favorite things.  If you are tired of the typical English/American black teas, this one is worth a try.<br /><br />There is a good oolong flavor, but I found the first pot I made terribly weak.  I had to use 2-3 times as much as I would expect from a top-shelf tea to get as strong a brew as i like.  However, even using 4 Tablespoons per 18oz of water, I'm still paying less per cup than the others out there, so...  At 7 USD a lb, this is affordable for those who drink tea throughout every day.<br /><br />As a side note, i've discovered a way to improve your brew.  While it IS better quality to recieve tea whole leaf, I have found that If I place it in a cloth satchet and crush it just prior to brewing, I get a good cup with less without loosing anything in quality.

review/text: I love this tea although I only drink iced tea (gallons and gallons!) I will also agree with other reviewers on the brewing time...steep it too long and it can get bitter.  I have drank at least 1/2 gallon a day of this tea for 3 years and I never lost a pound (What???  I have to worry about diet and exercise too???

review/text: arrives quickly great price and I drink tons of tea, a bit green for oolong but it has a good oolong flavor I would not seep this one longer than 2 min or it can become bitter the price is fantanstic and seeping second or third time is still great and loses the bitterness. Yes I would buy again. But if your a tea snob and want a more than every day tea youll have to pay much much more. This is a great every day tea I like the Englis Breakfast also.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I've ordered several times from this company and I am 100% satisfied with the product and service. I only gave this a 4 star because I actually liked the regular Wulong better than the Sechung Wulong. The Sechung seemed to be a little more bitter. I wouldn't claim to be a connoisseur of teas and drinking Wulong has not caused me to lose any weight. I put about 1/2+ cup of leaves in a coffee filter and brew it like coffee. I usually dump the first pot (I read this gets rid of any caffeine) and then brew another. I save the leaves in the fridge and can easily make 3-4 more pots of tea without losing flavor. It just seems to keep on giving! I pour it over a cup of ice and that's what I drink all day long at work. I am also surprised to find the prices are quite a bit cheaper on Amazon and when you factor in the free shipping...I have been ordering directly through the website and just saved myself $10 ordering through Amazon. I don't know how they seem to have such a great product at such a low price but I hope they continue because I am a happy returning customer.

review/summary: Best Chai since Seattle...
review/text: This the best Vanilla Chai tea I have had since I moved back from Seattle. Lots of great<br />flavors of chai out there. (spicy, mild, or sweet, and many ways to make each). But, back here in Wisconsin? The only place to have one made for you, worth a darn, has been Dunkin Donuts, IMHO, and that has too much sugar/sweetner, for me. And, Starbucks around here has been quite watery. So making my own that tastes this good has been an excellent treat. I, now, have to buy the 6 pack of 20(decaf), because the whole family has been helping me go through it, now that they have tried it. Great price on here for the 6 boxes/20 bags each, decaf or leaded. And, of course, MUCH cheaper than having it made at a coffee shop! AS ALWAYS: Amazon's service and free shipping has been hard to beat! ... If your here reading, we all have different tastes we like. Just my and my family's opinion. (We're VERY sold!)

review/text: If you're looking for an authentic masala chai, one that will blow you away with a full-on assault of cloves, cardamon, and anise, and leave your mouth feeling fragrant afterward, then this is definitely not the tea for you. However, if you want a little bit of a spicy fragrance in your decaffeinated black tea, then this spiced chai will fit the bill.<br />It also makes a very refreshing iced tea. Use two bags in one pint of boiling water, and allow to steep for about five minutes. If you wish, dissolve sugar to taste into the hot tea, and then pour the brew into a quart-sized pitcher of ice. This concoction is the perfect thing to accompany mildly spicy foods on a hot summer evening.

review/summary: The Absolute Best Coffee for Pod Machines that handle larger Pods
review/text: First of all, we've tried over a dozen coffee pod providers over the Web -- Baronet Coffee makes the best tasting coffee we've tried.  They offer small (7 gram) pods for machines like the Senseo, and then 10 gram and 12 gram "Mega" pods for larger machines like the Bunn My Cafe Pod Brewer, the Cuisinart Pod Brewer, the Krups 1010, or the Grindmaster Pod Brewer.  I prefer the 12 gram pods as I like stronger coffee; my wife likes the 10 gram pods as she likes it a bit weaker.<br /><br />DO NOT buy the 12 gram Mega pods if you own a Senseo; they will not fit.<br /><br />Btw, our hands down favorite machine is the Bunn My Cafe -- you choose the cup size from 4 to 12 ounces, you can plumb the MCA model into a waterline and never have to fill it, and the coffee is excellent.  It also looks great.<br /><br />We have tried all flavors of the Baronet pods -- among our favorites are the 12 gram French Roast & Sumatra, and the 10 gram French Toast and Butter Pecan.  In short, buy with confidence and prepare yourself for some great coffee.

This 12 Gram Pod is perfect for the Bunn MCP and Opod brewers. Both will handle the larger pod without trouble and allow you to select the amount of water so you can tweak the cup to your own taste.

I learned how great the naturally ripened fruit really tastes. Most of the mangos we find in markets here are still green and lack the mature, well-developed flavor of tree-ripened fruit. The Danielle Sweet Mango Chips capture the pure essence of ripe mango flavor!<br /><br />We'll be setting up a recurring order with Amazon so that we'll never have to be without our favorite snack.

review/text: I learned of this item from a healthy food blog.  These have surprised me to be even better!!  Sweet, crunchy, and slightly salty.  All natural and super healthy!  Perfect for adding to breakfasts, salads, desserts, or straight out of the bag as a healthy snack.  So glad I didn't wait on my Whole Foods to start offering these.

review/summary: Coconutty!!!!
review/text: These are a great gluten free snack!  I eat them alone or add them as a topping on yogurt.  They are crunchy, slightly salty/sweet, not greasy and travel well in a hot car. If you like coconut, I bet you will be a fan of these chips!  Be advised, if you are expecting these to be the size of a potato chip, they aren't.  They are big rectangular shreds about an inch long.

review/text: Danielle coconut chips are the best things ever in life.  I first found them at a airport gift shop on a phoenix layover and I've been addicted ever since.  They carry these at Whole Foods, but the supply is always sketchy and random, so ordering them online in a 6 pack always seems like a good option.<br /><br />Here are the flavors that I really like:<br />1. Coconut - the best ever<br />2. Mango<br />3. Honey Banana<br />4. Tangy Pineapple<br />5. Sweet Potato<br /><br />The okra ones are okay, so are the taro and the durian, I find the jackfruit ones disgusting, the pumpkin ones are gross and the carrot ones are SUPER icky (but I despise carrots, so I may be biased)

review/summary: I've gone Bananas over these Banana Chips!!!!
review/text: My first exposure to these chips was at a local gourmet deli.  I hestitated to purchase them due to the price ($3.25 for a 2 oz bag) but I bought them anyway.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  These taste nothing like any banana chip I have ever tasted.  They are simply DELICIOUS!!!  The flavor is sweet but non-geasy and the chips have a nice crunch with a light as air puffy texture.  The Ingredients: Just fresh Bananas and palm oil - that's it.  No preservatives - No Trans fat.  The only down side is the price, HOWEVER, if you order them through Amazon's subscription service you will get them at a better price.(you can choose how often you want them delivered).  I couldn't wait to place my order and now I will be receiving them on a regular basis.  TRY them, you won't be dissapointed!

review/summary: Expensive, but good
review/text: It's pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I've had in Thailand) & healthy to boot. If you've never tried durian / heard notorious things about the fruit / hated how the actual fruit tasted, fear not! It doesn't taste/smell remotely like the fruit: more like non-oily potato chips with a smooth buttery aftertaste.

review/text: I usually don't like artificial coconut flavored stuff, but this roasted coconut chip is soooo good. I ate the 1 whole bag on my way to work, though I do not recommend doing that. The chips are crispy and sweet, with a strong coconut flavor. I would give the jackfruit one a try if Amazon sells the 6-packs rather than the 20-packs one. In short, if you like coconut in general, or even if you are not a big fan of coconut, give it a try and you will be amazed!!

review/text: If you love coconut, then this is for you.  As a bona fide coco-'nut', I can tell you this product is delicious...crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes.  The drawbacks are that the bag contains a pretty small amount and the pieces are brittle and break.  That being said, the coconut is great for snacking or garnishing desserts/baked goods.

review/text: I first purchased this Danielle product at all places, Marshalls. I was on my way to the movies, and was looking for something to munch on, and somehow found this bag to look appetizing.  I immediately opened in my car to see if I was gonna like this hidden snack before I got all comfy during coming attractions.<br />Oh WOW...I was hooked.  I literally had to force myself to stop eating, and wait until I got to the movies.  It took a lot of restraint, and (I'm a picky foodie when it comes to snacks.)  I enjoyed every little tidbit of Coconut in the bag, and was sad when it was gone.<br />When the movie ended, I googled where I can find this snack, and found out it was only sold in stores in the New York area.  Somehow Marshalls ended up with this product due to some overstock not sold, or in some other capacity.  I hit the Marshalls the next day, and sadly found all the Coconut sold out.  I purchased the Pineapple in hopes it had the same kind of taste the Coconut had, but no...it was horrible.<br />I've been looking high and low for this at other local Marshalls, but no luck.  I finally caved in, and purchased here.  I'm excitedly waiting for my 12 bag order.<br />If you LOVE Coconut as much as I do, you will truly love this snack.  I agree with others, for the price, the bag should have a bit more to enjoy.

review/text: After buying coconut chips at Trader Joe's and loving them, I had to find more (I don't live near a Trader Joe's). Found these on Amazon and HOPED they would be the same kind of product. Was excited to find out they are! They're basically shaved pieces of coconut that are baked/roasted. Ingredients listed on the bag are fresh coconuts, sugar, and salt. They're delicious and have the perfect crunch! As a bonus, they're a natural treat. I eat them as a snack all by themselves; my toddler loves them too! The six-pack will last us quite a while.

review/summary: Heavenly snack for a coconut lover!
review/text: We're on vacation in Maui and I happened to pick up a bag Danielle's coconut chips from a shave ice vendor down the street. I LOVE coconut but get discouraged by all the over-sugared options. These are WONDERFUL! I have 2-year-old twin boys, and I couldn't get them to stop eating them. I was so eager to get my hands on more that I emailed our local Whole Foods from the beach, only to find out that they don't carry the coconut flavor. I begged them to reconsider - but then I discovered that Amazon carries them, so all my troubles are over. :) Really, if you like coconut, give these a try! (By the way, the mango is delicious, too!)

review/text: These Danielle coconut chips are absolutely outstanding.  I typically don't like coconut (mostly the texture...flavor is okay), but these are one of the best snacks I've ever eaten.  I've recently introduced them to three different family members who ordered them immediately upon trying them.  The texture and flavor are wonderful...tiny little ribbons of crisp coconut.  And the whole bag is only 250 calories.  Yes, the bag is small, especially for the price, but they are worth it.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/summary: Sooooooooo good!
review/text: We're staying at Stanford's Children's Hospital with my son, and I'm sure I don't have to elaborate how 'pleasant' hospital cafeteria food can be, even at a 'great' cafeteria (as hospital cafeteria's go, Stanford's is actually very good. But it is still cafeteria food). On weekends the Children's side cafeteria closes down so you have to go over to the main hospital's cafeteria for dinner. Grabbed a turkey sandwich and was looking for some chips or something crunchy, and I saw these. I'm a big coconut fan so I figured I couldn't go wrong, and it's healthier than potato chips so I'm game. I made the mistake of trying a bite of them before I had my sandwich, I didn't want to put the bag down! Holy smokes, seriously the best 'chip substitute' I've ever had, and if they weren't so expensive I'd switch over from potato chips completely!! Perfect combination of salty/sweet, loads of coconut flavor (I've had some where it's really subtle and mild, this definitely is not), great size strips (like someone said, looks like they put it through a strip paper shredder just a bit wider), perfect crunchiness. Anyways, definitely a rare treat because of the expense, but so worth every penny! I may have to grab another bag for the road home though before we get discharged this afternoon. ; )

I have been hiding them from everyone in my house. It's not that difficult as they don't like coconut but when teenagers get desparate...all bets are off.<br /><br />Definitely purchase this item. I have also tasted other items by this vendor and all were fabulous. Definitely worth the cost!

I do, however, want to let others know that the amount per package is really small, the pieces are also not very large (after a short time of nibbling you almost feel as though you should have just bought a package of shredded coconut from the local market and toasted it in your oven... or even had purchased a fresh coconut)... as far as "bang for your buck" these got a thumbs down for me. I have no problem spending more money for healthy goods for my family, I see it as a very worthy splurge - but, these left me disappointed... bag full of air and a small palm-ful of toasted coconut...  :(

review/text: Acually has a bit of Blueberry puree...not real sweet, edible applesauce.<br /><br />You don't really need a spoon for it, as it is REALLY THICK, you can peel the aluminum foil based top off, tip and shake it into your mouth without any mess.<br /><br />There's supposed to be a half an apple in each and there's NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRYP...YAY!
