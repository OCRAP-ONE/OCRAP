review/summary: Product is exactly what the description says...
review/text: I ordered two 24-packs of the K-cup portion packs and got exactly what the description said: there were 24 k-cups in a brown paper bag (shipment came in a box, the box had 2 paper bags) with a variety of different flavors. The most repetition I found was 3 of the same flavor. Because it was a grab bag, you do risk getting those gross (or at least to my pallet) flavors of eggnog flavored coffee, but it's still worth getting if most you will get is 2-3 of that flavor. There are brands of coffee I know I will not purchase a full box of because of this grab bag (Grove Square.. hardly tastes like coffee. I need to add regular coffee brewing next to the keurig to dial down the creaminess of the orignial). All in all, money well spent.

review/summary: thumbs down!
review/text: I love sampler packs and trying new kinds but with this half were not even coffee instead a lot of spiced cider and hot chocolate which we do NOT drink!! Very unhappy.<br />Its even more annoying than I first noticed 12 are grove square ciders or cocoas! 4 are grove square cappunccino  and only 6 are good coffees.  Grove Square for me is the worst its always too sweet and its cheap in the stores. This assortment is way overpriced and so not worth it And I only recieved 22 not 24

review/summary: like other reviewer's say: not a great sampling of flavors!
review/text: I 2nd that they assortments were not great although i seemed to luck out more than other reviewers.  there were too many of the "boring" flavors like french vanilla (at least 3 each) and hazelnut (3 or 4 each).  i did get some good flavors that i've been wanting to try but the reason we purchase this is try out new flavors so having several of the same flavor (especially the common ones) is not the reason we buy this so whoever is organizing this - take a clue!<br /><br />and it was packaged sloppily.  thrown in a paper bag like an after-thought.  not done very classy!

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: Description states: "This is a variety of flavored coffee . . .This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee."  So I ordered two for 48 K-cups of "flavored caffeinated coffee" and received 9 ciders, a few cappuccinos, and a hot cocoa - about 30% of my order was not coffee!  Two cups were so damaged I threw them out as the top seal was broken.  Several others were "dented." Guess this is a lesson in you get what you pay for, as this was the most reasonable value pack offer, but I'm afraid to drink the product as they came in two paper bags packed in a cardboard box, which looks like someone put this together in their kitchen with scrap K-cups they've collected.

review/text: Unlike some of the others who complained about a poor selection, my purchase featured a wide variety of attractive flavors. Unfortunately I will not be able to try them all because many are dented and crushed, causing some of them to come open in transit. Unfortunate and disappointing. Packaging them in a brown paper bag might not have been the best idea.

review/text: The description clearly states, "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee." but it was not 24 samples of coffee.  Several of the K-cups were ciders and there was a hot chocolate.  That would be fine if the seller disclosed that in the description but to say you're sending 24 COFFEE samples, then send something other than coffee is just plain deceitful.

review/summary: Cider is not coffee
review/text: I bought 2 variety packs and the  flavors seem to be fairly decent and varied especially taking into consideration the low price. My only problem and the reason for knocking off 2 stars is the inclusion of 4 cider K-cups in each package. 1/6 of the order consisted of non coffee products and the description specifically states "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee".<br /><br />I purchased this for $14.25 and noticed only 3 days after ordering, the price had increased to $17.18. I know it's only a few dollars, but as the price increases I find it difficult to justify buying this product again. Especially since the package is NOT exclusively coffee as the description states.

I honestly was a little surprised that it came in such a big box only for the K-cups to be in a brown bag and not in their own box like you buy at the store. Other than that small quirk, I probably will buy my K-cups from here again but not after looking at other sellers.

However, I fully read the description and completely understand the concept of a "grab bag" so I'm not unhappy with what I received.  Luckily for me, I also love french vanilla.

review/summary: 13 Varieties But Old Holiday Flavors & Inconsistent # Per Variety
review/text: This was my first order of k-cups and I was looking to try various types of flavored coffees.  In a 34 cup variety pack, I received 13 different flavors from 4 roasters.  While the overall variety was nice, the # of cups per variety varied:  1 cup for 4 different flavors, 2 cups for 4 different flavors; 3 cups for 1 flavor; 4 cups for 2 flavors; 5 cups for 1 flavor; and 6 cups for 1 flavor.  I'm a bit disappointed in the # of cups per flavor wasn't more consistent as both my husband and I wanted to try each flavor we received.  Also, I suspect that some of the cups may be old as the 14 of the 34 cups are holiday flavors from past holidays last year (it's June 2012 and I rec'd 4 cups each of spicy eggnog & gingerbread and 6 cups of pumpkin spice).

review/text: Yes .... It does come in a paper bag but that didn't bother me since it is an assortment and they probably mix in cups from boxes to make these for people. They're we're different varieties of cappicuccino versions, donut house, even two over ice choices and a sleepy time tea. So you really get to try different types and things. There are about 5 weird favors I got which I may or may not try or leave for guest to try out being ... Coconut, Eggnog, ... Blueberry ... Stuff like that. Those normally aren't things I would drink but then again it's nice to be creative and different. Will buy again.

review/text: I just received the sampler a few days after I ordered it. The K-cups were in a brown paper bag and stapled close. It was wrapped in an air wrap so they weren't damaged in any way. I thought it was a little odd that they were just in a paper bag, but it doesn't really matter. I got these for my mom for her birthday so I just put them in another bag. There were several different flavors. Overall, no complaints; reasonably priced. I've read a few negative reviews, but they seem to be rare. If you're looking for some K-cups, go for it.

review/text: The sampler had a pretty good selection of flavored coffee, but the least desirable flavors (with the worst reviews) were the most prevalent.  Im not sure why they would include 1 or 2 samples of the highly rated coffee, and 6 samples of the very low rated coffee.  Maybe they were just trying to clear out some coffee they couldn't sell otherwise. If they would put 2-3 samples of every coffee, the customer could sample more variety. I did give a rating of 3 stars because there were some good flavors included, and I found a couple of new favorites.

review/summary: Poor Variety
review/text: I don't mind that this assortment came in a brown bag - I use the K-cups quickly so who cares what box they came in. And the 24 cup package was the best deal I've found anywhere. However, I agree with others who noted that the assortment was poor. Most were Green Mountain Blueberry or Hazelnut - not much variety at all.

review/summary: Great assortment at a great price
review/text: I was a little worried by some of the reviews which indicated that the assortment might not be very assorted.  But I was very happy with my order.  The most repeats of any given flavor was 3.  I received 3 each of several flavors, and one or two each of the rest.  All told, there must have been about 12 different varieties.  Well done!  If I didn't already have a huge amount of K-cups here, I would immediately order two more of these variety packs.  Hopefully they will still be offering this at the same price in a few months when it is time to get more.<br /><br />Decided to just order two more of these 24-pack assortments, and they were even better than the first one reviewed above.  This time, there were 24 different k-cups in each one!  Fabulous!  My only quibble is that they were packed in cardboard boxes that were open and placed upside down in the shipping carton.  So when I grabbed the first box and lifted it out of the carton, all the K-cups spilled out into the carton.  Not a big deal, but how hard is it to tape the box shut, or at least put it right side up in the shipping carton?  In any event, was so happy with the assortment, that I will probably order two more.

review/summary: Not a nice assortment
review/text: I have wanted to try flavored coffee but didn't want to take the chance of buying a whole box and not likely the flavor. This was a good solution. I read the few reviews and took chance. Well I'm a little dissapointed. Most of the box expires by December which isn't to big of deal because I'll have them gone by then, but the assortment sucked. At least a third of them were the same flavor from the same maker. When you add that to the number of "french vanilla" ones that I got it's at least 2/3 of the box. I wanted an assortment, not mostly french vanilla made by a few different companies. I think I have 5 or 6 that weren't french vanilla. Oh and top it off, those 5 or 6 are the only different brands too. The rest of the box is Van Houtte coffee.

review/text: I have been purchasing K-Kups for over a year now and most of the time I purchase them from on-line vendors.  They are always packaged very carefully, in single layers, neatly lined up and protected by a layer of cardboard.  This particular vendor delivered my order in a timely fashion, but neglected to package them with care.  They just threw 24 K-cups into a box and closed it for shipping.  3 out of the 24 were damaged/punctured.  Very disappointed, will go elsewhere from now on.

review/summary: Disappointing Assortment
review/text: I spent a lot of time trying to decide on a variety sampler pack of K-cups.  Reading the description of this set, I was excited to order, since there were so many flavors that I hadn't tried before.  If you read the list of flavors, it sounds great!  But...the bag I received was really lacking in excitement.  I understand that they couldn't include everything listed and that the collection might vary somewhat.  But there were NONE of the following from their list:  Rain Forest Nut, Pumpkin Spice, Mocha Nut Fudge, Island Coconut, Caramel Vanilla Creme, Mudslide, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Vanilla Cupcake, Pecan Praline.  Of ALL of those flavors, I would have thought ONE of them would show up.  I received SEVEN of one kind, Jamaican Me Crazy.  So, that's more than a quarter of the sampler being the very same kind.  I wish more care was taken to pack the K-cups with more thought for the customer.  I am not one of those grouchy reviewers who is never pleased with anything.  But, sadly, I was disappointed in this purchase.

review/summary: Read the description!
review/text: I'm glad I ordered this without reading the negative reviews, but even if I had at least I have the reading comprehension to understand that the two things most people are complaining about are actually listed IN THE DESCRIPTION. Who buys something online without reading the description first? Honestly...<br /><br />1. Yes it comes in a brown paper/zip lock bag. Whoop de doo. You could still give it as a gift, just get your own cellophane bag and tie it off with ribbons. If you have a lot of friends with keurig machines you'd be able to pick a couple flavors for each friend, and it would be adorable to do a little gift bag with a coffee cup and these.<br /><br />2. Yes some of the coffees were ones I don't like, and yes some of them were repeats, that's what happens when you order a grab bag. It flat out states in the description that you will most likely NOT get 1 pack of each of the flavors, and that the flavors listed are EXAMPLES, you are not guaranteed which ones you will receive.<br /><br />If you can't accept those two "downsides" don't get this product. Instead try Keurig K-Cups Travel The World Sampler Pack (35 K-Cups) Those are supposedly the same every time, and the gift box is supposedly adorable. Twice the price, but hey, if it's what you're looking for...<br /><br />As for myself, all of the cups arrived in fine condition. Yes I did get an overage of a particular flavor(I'm really fortunate that I love hazelnut coffee) but I liked that many of them were multiples. Since I live with my boyfriend this mean that we can each try a cup of the flavors with extras. And if we don't like one we can save it for when company comes, someone we know will probably enjoy the cup.<br /><br />As a service that allows you to try a bunch of flavors without having to buy a box of each this was cheap and pretty effective. I'll be purchasing again, and next time I'll be sure to come on here and put in which flavors I get, I didn't write them down this time, and they're all mixed in with some other samplers now.

review/summary: Don't waste your money.
review/text: Very dissatisfied.  I ordered this variety of K cups because of the wonderful assortment of flavored coffees.  I don't like to drink straight black coffee of any kind, so I was excited that I would be getting something of a treat to look forward to.  This was not the case.  I received it 2 days ago and when I opened it, found only 4 flavored coffees in the whole 24 pack; 2 each pumpkin spice and spiced eggnog.  The rest of the entire order was non-flavored, regular coffee.  I am totally disappointed and upset that I didn't receive at all what I wanted and paid for.  Needless to say, I won't be buying anything from this company again.

Probably 2/3 of my order was unflavored coffee.  Will never order from them again.  It's definitely overpriced for what you receive.  And, they just throw 24 K-cups in a shipping box and they are loose in the box and with no packing materials to keep them from banging around. Just disgusted.......

The majority of the coffee is french vanilla.  And hopefully we will like spicy eggnog and kahlua because those make up pretty much the rest of the coffee.  This looks like somebody threw in the coffee they didn't like into a box and sent it to the sucker who was stupid enough to buy it.  I am not usually this brutall with reviews but this angers me.  The coffee was in a brown paper bag and thrown in a box to ship.  If I could return this I would but this is not a purchase that can be returned. How sad this is.

review/text: WARNING!! DO NOT PURCHASE!! This is a mixture of any flavors that cannot be sold. It comes in a flimsy, torn paper bag that is stapled at the top. Mine were mostly eggnog, a flavor I hate, and that was never even mentioned in the list of possible flavors. There were no coffee house K-cups and no Van Houten, two brands that I wanted to try. There's no way this was random either. I got six hazelnut which I buy in bulk every month, six blueberry, eight egg nog and then an assortment, one each, of four "random" flavors. The K-cups are flat and ragged looking, which means they are probably old or damaged. This is simply a way to get rid of damaged merchandise--open boxes or undesirable flavors. I expect better of Amazon!

review/text: What we were hoping for:<br /><br />Something a little more like the picture.  We were especially excited to try Chocolate Glazed Donut and Pumpkin Spice.<br /><br />What we got:<br /><br />6 - Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 - Caramel Vanilla Creme<br />6 - French Vanilla<br />4 - Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 - Cinammon Roll<br />3 - Southern Pecan<br />2 - Butter Toffee<br />2 - Mocha Nut Fudge<br />1 - Mudslide<br />1 - French Vanilla Supreme<br /><br />Sadly, we already have entire boxes of Wild Mountain Blueberry and Caramel Vanilla Creme, and the ones we were most interested in from this bunch we only got one or two of.  My mistake for not reading the reviews, but I disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety.  The description says that a buyer will get a "wide variety" and I hardly think 3 flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as "wide variety".  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  If I would have bought these flavors on the Keurig website, I would have paid less per K-cup than I paid for this package... and I paid the higher price specifically for the variety.  I do not feel I got what I paid for and I think Amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising.<br /><br />Final note:  The K-cups came in a paper bag ... with no visible expiration dates.  One of them was punctured on top.  Considering some of the other reviews, I am worried about whether or not these K-cups are even good anymore.  Some of the other reviews suggest that at least some people received theirs in a box with expiration dates included.

But the last one we received is probably the last one I will order.<br />When we started getting this the selection was a nice variety and was just what we were looking for. But then they began to have bunches of the same flavors and little variety.<br />But the final straw is the package we got today. They usually come it their own box, but this bunch came in a plain brown paper stapled closed bag that was sealed in a plastic bag. This offered little protection to the K-cups, since several of them were slightly damaged. Plus, all but one of the K-cups was Green Mountain flavors and there were many of the same flavors.<br />Basically, I believe I would of been better off just ordering the Green Mountain flavors we like, it would of been cheaper in the long run.

review/text: Before buying this product, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough variety.  When I received the package which contained the K cups packed into a brown paper lunchbag [they did indicate that this is the way they are shipped], I was very excited to see what flavors were inside!  It felt like Christmas morning.  I was pleased to find that all of the K cups were intact and there were a wide variety of flavors, including seasonal and special edition flavors.  Yes, there are a few flavors that are in particular abundance, but they are the most commonly enjoyed flavors so I think it is reasonable.  There are a lot of Green Mountain flavors which I have no problem with because Green Mountain coffee is excellent.  I was happy when I saw 2 Timothy's Kahlua K cups because that's a flavor I've really been wanting to try!  Here's the tally:<br />Green Mountain Coffee French Vanilla 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Hazelnut Noisette 6<br />Timothy's Kahlua 2<br />Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry 4<br />Green Mountain Coffee Gingerbread 2<br />Gloria Jean's Mudslide 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Caramel Vanilla Cream 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Mocha Nut Fudge 1<br />Total 35<br />That's right... I ordered the 34 count and they sent me 35.  The 35 count is $2.12 more than the 34 count on Amazon, so this decision definitely paid off!  That was generous, or perhaps clumsy of the sellers.  Either way, I will take this in a positive light.  Overall it was a good purchase!

review/text: This variety oack is a great way to sample several of the flavors green mountain has to offer.  I would have preferred to receive more than one of the cinnamon roll and fewer of some of the other flavors.  I don't know if this is random, or planned.

I got about 7 different flavors - nothing terribly exotic but I did learn I really like blueberry coffee which I never would have ordered on my own!  So I may order again - it's kinda fun to see what you get.  Does come in just a brown paper bag (like a large lunch bag) but I didn't care about that. It would be nice if they tried harder to get more of a mix of flavors.  The cups were still about $.75 each so it's not like they are so reduced in price, that you should be happy to get any assortment (and they do save on the packaging).

I will definitely purchase this again.<br /><br />For all you people that receive 4 - 5 of the same cups, you should have read the reviews first. If you did, and thought "Huh, I'll take a chance", it's your own fault. I'd rather get this even if I got only four different kinds. Its better than an entire box of the SAME kind.

review/text: I just received my 24 K-cup variety pack & was a little disappointed.  They were all thrown in a brown paper bag in the shipping box which certainly wasn't very appealing.  Also disappointed in the variety.  Out of the 24, there are (5) Gingerbread, (3) Southern Pecan, & (3) Pumpkin Spice, which are all Limited Edition for the holidays.  That's about half the "variety" in only 3 flavors. I guess they have to get rid of these flavors. Will not order this variety pack again!

review/text: I got a new Keurig coffee maker for Christmas, which was exciting to me, because I often want one cup of flavored coffee in the evening. So I went right to Amazon and found this great idea - a sampler of flavored coffees!  I thought this would be perfect, so I could find out which ones I'd like.  But when they arrived today, only half of them were flavored and the other half were non-flavored coffee.  And all of the flavored ones are doubles, so all in all I got 6 flavors.  What a disappointment! I feel like I wasted my money, because the coffee maker already came with a sampler of regular coffees.

review/summary: Tried a second time and it was great!
review/text: My husband bought me the Kuereg so I could make my flavored coffee and he could have his traditional coffee.  I was looking forward to trying many new flavors and was disappointed that 1/2 of the flavors were French Vanilla and Hazelnut which are flavors that can be found any place you go.  I wanted to try some flavors not normally found in the grocery store.  Having said that, there were 7 k-cups of pumpkin spice which I found to be fantastic and will order.  There were three other flavors that I am looking forward to trying.  I am going to try to order this again and may change my review.<br /><br />Updated Review:  I went ahead and tried ordering this package again and couldn't be more pleased.  It was exactly what I had expected the first time around. Of the 35 I received, I had four different kinds of hazelnut, four different kinds of vanilla, and then the rest were different flavors.  I had only four duplicates so I will get to try a good variety.  I left it at four stars because of the disappointment of the first order.

I had intended to give this as a Christmas gift, but am unable to do so now. It looks like I have just gone to my own cabinet and thrown some stuff in a bag.There is no expiration date on the bag, so as far as I know, the k-cups could already be expired and the company is just trying to move their leftover stock onto the unsuspecting consumer. Additionally, the lack of variety was disheartening. I will NEVER buy from the BECCO Corp. again. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most certainly would! I would also add that although the advertisement was for caffeinated coffee only, I received several decaffeinated coffees. Oh,and I have already checked to see if I could return this item. I can not because it is a grocery item and they are non-returnable. To summarize...buyer beware!

review/text: One would expect a 35 variety pack to contain a little variety. 10 flavors(6,6,6,4,3,3,3,2,1,1) and 27 of the KCups from Green Mountain.<br />Not impressed with the selection.  Will be returning.

review/summary: A bunch of packets in a brown paper bag.
review/text: I ordered this thinking it would come properly packaged. What I got was a bunch of coffee single serves in a brown paper bag.<br />I can't believe Amazon would sell something packaged like this. You wouldn't buy this if it was at a yard sell.<br />Very, very disappointed in what I got.

review/text: I ordered these as a gift and they came in a brown paper bag. That's it. How does one give a gift that comes in a brown paper bag? Should have went to a retail store. Makes me wonder what the quality is. Did they just pick them up off of the floor and put random ones in a bag? Also, if your looking for a majority of eggnog flavored coffee, I certainly got a disproportionate amount. Merry Christmas.
