review/text: Once you open the bottle you sense the Saffron aroma, which is a good sign, meaning that it is a quality product made from real Saffron.  I bought my first bottle to test if the product really decreases your appetite and it does.  I take two tablets in the morning and two more during the day and so far it has made a big difference, specially with the sugar cravings that ruined my diet and weight.  I ordered two additional bottles and will update this review once I finish the second bottle.  So far, I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Fake "Manuka" honey!
review/text: I used to buy Manuka honey from a distribution who got it from NZ right off the ship. Manuka honey has a very specific taste and dark in color. You feel like eating something precious. This jar was tinted dark brown to resemble a dark Manuka honey in the picture, but inside the jar is a plain floral honey which is $5 in value, not a $32.68 per 2 jars as they charge. They took the expensive honey home and selling this one. I also was surprised that they put UMF 5+ (Unique Manuka Factor)-usually no such a low UMF. I felt being cheated! Do not buy this honey!

A few sprinkled into oatmeal livens up the breakfast and chopped up make a wonderful sprinkle over ice cream (with hot chocolate sauce). In addition, the self life is superb. I am planning to get some more and have also decided to add it to my emergency supplies. Will recommend this product highly to all who like pineapple or just something sweet.

review/summary: Probably not authentic, but totally yummy.
review/text: My favorite coffe shop uses this brand for their chais that they sell. I used to be able to get Pacific Chai at my grocery store, but they stopped carrying it. Luckily, Amazon to the rescue! I know it's not nutritious but it can warm you up and it is totally delicious. My daughter and I prefer the vanilla flavor, and if you heat up some Silk brand soy milk & blend it with the mix ( instead of the water the label calls for) it is really amazing! Plus, we women need to get our iso-flavanoids, and this is a really yummy way. I've used regular milk too, but believe me, for some reason the soy is so much better. I've even got my totally soya-phobic co-workers drinking it that way, and the owner of the coffe shop actually put soy milk on the menu as an option with the chai. Like my title states, it's probably not authentic chai but it is still super tasty and the spices ( cinnamon, ginger, cloves) are very warming. It's the perfect drink on a cold day or if you have the chills and can't seem to get warm. The label says you can serve it cold but I haven't tried that yet; to me it just seems like a hot drink.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ingredients really do suck- non-dairy creamer w/coconut oil & corn syrup solids. Black tea is waaaay down on the list. But, I just take it for what it is; an occasional indulgence when I crave something hot & sweet & spicy ( of the non-masculine variety! ) to warm me up.

review/text: My sister introduced me to vanilla chai several years ago, our favorite being Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai which is no longer available.  We, then, went on a quest to find another "favorite vanilla chai".  We definitely found it in Pacific Vanilla Chai.  While I liked it best when it was available in the striped bags rather than in the canisters (don't know why), it is excellent.  I recommend this beverage to anyone who enjoys tea.  As their slogan says, it really is "the taste of peace and quiet".  Enjoy!

If you don't have to worry about calories, it's great with a little milk, ice and ice creme blended with whipped topping on top. In the winter it's my comfort drink with lowfat milk, if I'm having a bad day, this soothes me.  With the 6 canister's it's great to be able to give away 2 or 3 canister's as gifts.

review/summary: The best chai available!!
review/text: I have always enjoyed Pacific Chai Latte. Liking my Keurig, I decided to try Cafe Escapes Chai Latte when I saw it. To begin with, I found the Pacific Chai was much creamier than the more watery Cafe Escapes Chai. The amount of spice in the CE Chai was overwhelming in taste, whereas the Pacific Chai spices lent a nice balance to the flavor of the drink. Lastly, I like the granularized honey in the Pacific Chai much more than the Sucralose in the CE Chai, which left a bad aftertaste in my mouth after each sip and required food or brushing teeth to get rid of.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't buy or recommend the CE Chai again and highly recommend the Pacific Chai!!

review/text: After searching for a healthy alternative to grocery store creamers, I settled for the corn syrup solids in the Pacific Chai dry mix found here. The taste is great, and requires a smaller amount of mix to produce a high level taste. The six containers that came in this package were perfect for shipping overseas to a peace Corps volunteer family member in need of a taste from home. Recommended for a better taste in dry mixes than grocery store options commonly found on shelves.

review/summary: Once you try this chai, no other will be good enough
review/text: I'm a sucker for chai tea. I saw this drink at my grocery store and bought it just to try it out, I'd never heard of it before. I bought both the Vanilla and the Spice Chai. I went home, made myself a cup, and was absolutely blown away at the amazing flavor. I went back and bought more so I could have some at work, some at home, and some on my motorcycle. I even sent some to my boyfriend in California in a care package (he's in the military and going through training) and now he's hooked on it, too. I love arriving at home, making myself a cup, and relaxing after a day's work. Several months after discovering this treasure, I was out to lunch and realized I wanted some chai tea. I didn't have anymore drink mix with me, so I stopped at my local coffee shop and picked up an iced chai. I've been ruined! I didn't care for the taste of the chai from my coffee shop anymore! I even tried starbucks iced chai and found myself very disappointed in how fake it tasted. Bottom line: nothing compares to the flavor of this chai drink mix. On top of that, there's 13 servings of chai per 10 oz container, which costs about $3.50... I usually pay $3.50 for one small chai from my coffee shop. This drink mix costs about 25 cents per serving. It tastes better and is way more affordable. What more could you ask for?

Try to find this at a local convenience store. The main brand of gas station around me sells it 2/$3.50.

review/summary: Good for if you're in a bind...
review/text: This is a good product to buy if you're in a bind and need a Mexican sugar skull shipped to your door very quickly (which for some weird reason I did). It arrived within 2 days and was well packed and nothing on it was broken. The product description picture is essentially what you get, I was hoping that the one that I got would have been a little more creatively designed, but it wasn't. It's just a sugar skull with a few random squirts of colored icing squirted all over the top of its head.

review/summary: Great Italian dressing, also a great marinade
review/text: We've been using Ken's dressings for some time now, expanding to try new ones as they become available in our area.  check around locally as shipping costs can make these heavy items often more expensive to ship, I love it when Amazon picks them up and fulfills them directly.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite dressings, especially for use as a marinade.  I put my chicken or steak in a marinade container, cover it with this dressing, sprinkle on some Monterey Steak Seasoning and let it sit for a day or two in the Fridge.  When we BBQ the meat, it's really tender and tastes great.  This is a very tasty dressing, you'll like it.<br /><br />5 stars, great tasting and a wonderful marinade.

review/text: If you have a nostalgia store (or other shop that might have nostalgia candy), go there. For $18, you don't get a whole lot of candy. Yeah, some of it is really fantastic and delicious, but it seems to have just been repackaged from recent productions of the candy. The box is also somewhat small and contains that crinkle paper confetti stuff for effect (I guess?), but it takes up a lot of space in the box.<br /><br />In all: I wish there was enough candy to justify paying $18 for it, but there really wasn't.

review/summary: Veja - Links mimic real weiners
review/text: Veja-Links taste like real weiners. They are a little softer than a real weiner, but not as soft as Loma Linda Big Franks. Also, they nor real weiners have the savory flavor of Big Franks to me. Some people don't like their veggie dogs soft. For those who want their veggie dog to taste exactly like the real thing, I would reccomend another product from this same company - Morning Star Farms veggie dogs. They're in the frozen breakfast section of your local grocery store. They are firm just like real weiners and they have the exact same taste. However, I prefer Big Franks to both of these veggie dogs.

review/summary: If you're jonesin' for a hot dog
review/text: These vegetarian "hot dogs" are really good. They have the right texture, which most tofu dogs and the like don't have at all. The seasoning is very good too. They stay firm boiled or grilled, although you cook them less than a product containing meat. They only have 50 calories each, and 3 grams of fat, only 0.5 grams of that is saturated. They have 0 cholesterol and 0 trans fats. They only have 180 mg of sodium. If you're doing Dr. Fuhrman's "Eat to Live" and you're just going nuts for some meat, try grilling one of these babies and slap it on a whole wheat pita bread. It will kill those cravings and keep you from doing something you'll regret.

review/summary: Son likes them, I don't...
review/text: I ordered these when I found out the Morningstar Farms veggie dogs are no longer available.  After reading about 100 reviews, I decided to try this variety.  We have been vegetarian for 12 years, so I am used to the faux meats.  Some I like, some I don't.  I LOVED Morningstar Veggie dogs, they were my absolute favorite.  Most veggie dogs in the refrigerated section of the grocery store have a ton of onion in them!  These Veja-dogs are OK on taste, but I do not like the texture.  It is A LOT like that of a hard boiled egg white.  When I first got one out of the can I did not want to even try one.  It was squishy and had tiny dark brown spots.  The syrupy stuff they are stored in really grossed me out too.  I have eaten about 5 now and am still not crazy about them.  My son however LOVES them.  He says they are his favorite.  I will try another Worthington veggie dog (Super Links or linkettes) before giving up on the "canned" dogs all together.  I hate onions, but I prefer the texture of the tofu dogs found in the grocery store.

V_L saved our dinner problems many times--like when we got into the park after dark and needed to eat and get the tents up.  We ate them cold mixed with vegetarian beans (no pork).  They are a great quickie meal when we are doing a 70 hour work week, great on a bun with sourkraut, or toppings and pickles, or just the kiddie standard of ketchup.  Grilled in the summer is good too for a different taste.  We buy by the case, they don't last long around here.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Diane Kalata

review/text: Veja-Links are a soy "hot dog" that is a nice alternative to the real thing.  I really like to use them to make a spread.  Boiled eggs, onion, relish and ground up Veja-links makes a good sandwich spread.  You can grill them or make pigs-in-a-blanket just like you would with real hot dogs.  The one thing that is different is no animal "by products" whatever that means.

There was a time when it was difficult to find these products but then Kellogg bought the company along with Morningstar Farms and the products were available.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten "red apples" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with "red apple" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this "red apple" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this "red apple" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD.

review/summary: beware of hot weather with this product
review/text: I recently purchased this product (not here but at walmart where it is $6 a box not $10) for a cake I was making for a friend.  I usually do cakes in butter cream and fondant but she wanted whipped icing.  Anyway,  I did a test batch a week before and it was really good.  The icing came out fluffy and stiff enough for icing and piping. It held up really well in the fridge for several days.  However the day of the cake it was a very hot day and not having air conditioning, my kitchen was very warm.  The icing completely collapsed despite several tries with several batches, freezing the bowl and mixer whisk, ice applied to the bowl, and extended whipping,  I could not get it to stiffen.  It was a soft, runny mess and did not make for nice icing.  I was unable to pipe with it at all. So if you purchase this just keep that in mind.  I still prefer buttercream but the taste is creamy and less sweet that buttercream if that is what you prefer.

review/text: First, about the size.  This smaller cup is the perfect portion size for soup.  When I first bought Dr McDougalls years ago, all the choices were in this size, I believe.  Anyway, I THINK it says light sodium because they reduced how much sodium they used to put in it, or because compared to other brands it is pretty light.<br /><br />Second, I really like the taste of this soup, and don't find it horrid at all.  I realize that different folks have different tastes--which is why they make so many choices.  I can't stomach the Pad Thai, for instance, but I truly like this soup.  I usually steam some stir fry veggies in the microwave and eat them along with this soup.  Love it.  I am aware that the soup contains miso powder, which may not be everyone's cup of tea. Look at the ingredients and decide for yourself.<br /><br />If you aren't sure, you could always go to Whole Foods or someplace where they sell these products one at a time to find your faves.

I guess I should be more careful to look for "reduced sodium recipe" when I buy these products, but I still felt deceived.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, but the portion cup doesn't live up to what I've come to expect from Dr McDougall's soups.

review/text: I had hoped when I bought it that it would replace the original Chicken Free Ramen soup but it's as horrible as the new chicken free soup. I loved the original and I do not understand why they would replace it with these vegan soups that just plain taste awful.<br />My advice-save your money.

review/summary: The Worst of the McDougall's Cups
review/text: The flavor is pretty rough.  Some of the other chicken flavor ones taste better.  A big issue with these cups for me is that the paper cups start to burn in the microwave when cooked at the printed directions.  It's not an issue with my microwave.  I've never run into this problem with any other pre-packaged food or most of the other products from this brand.  I'm not sure how safe that is to eat.  The company makes some good food - try the pilaf or noodle cups.  They are much better than the soups.

review/text: When I was growing up, medium-sized bottles of herring in sour cream were a staple.  I was was aware of herring in wine sauce....but my parents never bought it.  I have searched for herring in sour cream here on Amazon, to no success as yet.  However, I DID find these BAR HARBOR WILD HERRING FILLETS IN CABERNET WINE SAUCE here on Amazon, and decided to try them.<br /><br />I never knew that herring was such a dry fish!  The wine sauce inside the can is plentiful -- but it still doesn't take away all of the dryness.  There is a goodly amount of wine sauce -- but not so much that it will spill out of the can when opened.  If you are careful opening the can, spilling of the wine sauce IS preventable.  (It's a little difficult for me, at least, to open the can by the pull-tab.  So far, I have had four of the twelve cans in the shipment -- and had to use a can-opener to open each one.)<br /><br />The good news about the sauce, aside from it's delicious taste, is that it has enough time, in the the can, to permeate the fish, with some of the sauce still left over.  As I have mentioned, the sauce doesn't take away ALL the dryness -- but it does take a bit away, and so the over-abundance of wine sauce IS a good idea.  A doubly-good idea, I think, is to DRAIN the sauce which has not permeated the fish, (before eating the fish), into a small container, and keep it in the refrigerator.  Then, you can use it for various other things -- such as adding it to tuna fish, as I have done.  Then, the tuna becomes tastier, and you can leave out the mayonnaise, (which is mostly oil anyway), and get a richer tuna flavour, possibly with fewer calories!<br /><br />These "Bar Harbor Herring Filets in Cabernet Wine Sauce" have the OU stamp of approval from the Orthodox (Jewish) Union, so preumably the cabernet wine, (listed in the next-to-the-last position in the ingredients), is KOSHER caberbet wine -- although the word "kosher" is not found in front of this ingredient.<br /><br />This product is "sustainably harvested from the clear cold waters of the Gulf of Maine".  It is also stated that it is a "Product of Canada". On the back of the cardboard sleeve encasing each tin, it is stated: "Produced in Canada, for Bar Harbor Foods, Whiting Maine, 04691 USA....."  This may confuse some people, (it confuses me a lot)...but I prefer to consider it a happy product, jointly produced by two of the greatest countries in the world!  Whatever you may think of my opinion, you must admit that it's nice to find a product produced ANYWHERE else than in China, these days!<br /><br />Eating four cans of these herring fillets, (6.7 ounces, 190 grams each), in two days,says I like them -- and I do.  They even have a<br />slight, very tasty smoky flavour -- without any liquid smoke listed amongst the ingredients!  (As liquid smoke -- along with, (darn!), so many other things that taste SO good -- is rumoured to be cancer-causing, this is certainly a good thing!)  But the fish is, as I have said, semi-dry....in spite of the wine sauce in which the fish comes, and in which it is saturated.  These fillets in cabernet wine sauce ARE delicious -- but I do wish I could also find herring fillets in sour cream, that I grew up with.  A different flavour, and not, perhaps to everyone's taste -- but at least herring fillets in sour cream are NOT at all dry.

review/text: I am always searching the food stores for a good canned fish at a reasonable price.  I finally found one that I really enjoy on the internet. The Bar Harbor All Natural Herring with Cabarnet Wine Sauce was a great buy for me. Now I can stop some of my searching.  In ordering I also joined the club and received more percentage off my order.  The club will now send me one dozen cans every 6 months. After 8 weeks I am down to three cans.  I may have to increase the volume of my order in the future. I usually enjoy the canned herring on or with crackers for an enjoyable lunch.

I eat canned fish often so very pleased to find this unique Cabernet Wine Sauce flavor.  Considering the relatively low price per ounce, this product delivers an unexpected pleasant and tasty experience.  I enjoyed the whole case!  Shipment was prompt.  I will definitely reorder.  By the way, what other comments say about holding over a sink a trash receptacle when opening is correct.  These guys don't sell `air' you get the whole can of product packed to the rim.

review/summary: Freeze drying doesn't work well with soybeans...
review/text: I really wanted to like these because I love edamame and I'm always looking for healthy snacks I can keep tucked away in my office (for afternoon 'munchy' emergencies)!  I bought this along with the 'Roasted Veggies' mix of which I will review separately because I had a much better experience with those.<br /><br />The flavor itself isn't bad but the freeze drying technique just doesn't translate well for these soybeans.  It was like popping a handfull of sponges and dry chalk into my mouth.  Chewing on a bunch of these will instantly dry out your mouth and the resulting texture/mouthfeel is uncomfortable and well... unpleasant.<br /><br />As another reviewer suggested, these might work well as a salad topping to add extra crunchiness assuming you like crunchy salads.  I might consider using them as a garnish on top of a nice hot bowl of tomato soup.  I would not repurchase this item or recommend this to anyone else.
