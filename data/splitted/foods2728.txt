review/summary: Fantastic Deal
review/text: I have a 100 pound dog, and he goes through at least 1 pig ear a day.  These are a fantastic product at an amazing product - the 24 count is a little over $1/ear.  Just be aware that these are LARGE.  You would want to have at least a 40 pound dog to get through one of these in one go.

review/text: These seem tasty, my dog loves them.  They say they are made in USA and all natural, which is good.<br /><br />However, my dog devours these ears in about 20 minutes.  The other pig ears we bought in the pet store take him 2-4 days to completely chew up...  But these don't even last an hour.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 3 month old doberman.

review/summary: Smokehouse pig ears with no smoke...
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y2TWQ">Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Smoked Pig Ears Dog Treats, 24-Pack</a>  I was disappointed in the quality of this product.  The pig ears where supposed to have been "smoked" but they have zero smoke smell and almost smell a little on the spoiled side.  The pig ears cost $1.25 each when you buy them in the 24 count bag which is the same price I can buy non-smoked pig ears locally at Petco and Pet Smart.  Also the size of the pig ears are on the small side compared to similar products I have purchased in the past at the same price from other suppliers.  There is nothing really wrong with the product, my Boxer will chew them up regardless.  I guess I was expecting a higher grade pig ear based on the Amazon product description than what I actually received.

review/summary: IT'S A SMALL, SMALL EAR
review/text: After researching "roasted pig ears" for my beloved dog, I chose this product...the package arrived in a timely manner; the bag was so small and lightweight I couldn't believe it contained my order...Unfortunately it did. I didn't bother to un-tie the hand-knotted bag but put the LIGHTWEIGHT package back into the box in which it arrived and will now return them...For the price paid, I could go to one of the local pet supply stores and purchase MORE than 24 ears...and also would have an ear large enough to satisfy my large mix-breed pet! These ears are SMALL...while they appear to be ears, not strips, they are ridiculously small and have no weight to them. Color me disappointed. I thought about ordering another brand but this experience has made me gun-shy...or ear-shy !! Poor product; cheaply packaged in thin hand-knotted plastic bag...No thanks. My dog--and my wallet--deserve better !!

review/summary: STAY AWAY from this Amazon's contract seller!
review/text: I ordered 2 cans on Amazon.com with this vendor because S&H was free. Please STAY AWAY from this INDIRECT VENDOR: Amazon does neither  store nor ship the product. The cans arrived both badly bashed in from Phoenix AZ, although the well-packed box containing them showed NO damage whatsoever. The vendor had knowingly shipped damaged products.<br />I gave a 1 star rating solely to alert customers not to order from this vendor. The Marron spread, of course, is always 5 star: same great taste and same iconic label as decades ago! Yes, it is the flavor of my childhood!<br />Subsequently, I ordered product from Lepicerie.com  ("The grocery store" in French) where a 6-pack (same net weight per can) cost me a little over $8.00 per can INCLUDING S&H. I returned the damaged cans using Amazon's free shipping label. As always Amazon provides excellent customer service.

I couldn't get over the difference simply changing from a diet of hard/soft mix...which I was first on Royal Canin for him and then tried SD z/d...then went to this.  It worked...period.  To those bashing the company, quit the hysteria!  IT WORKS...and now both my cats are on it and doing well.  I lost two cats last year, and mine are doing well on this diet...and I'm thankful to have it!

review/text: Previously I had bought and thoroughly enjoyed Adagio Teas Green Tea, Dragon Well.  I wanted to try another brand, and ordered this tea, partly due to being attracted by the organic label and the brand name.<br /><br />What a mistake!<br /><br />First of all, the tea leaves in this tea are so small (almost like ground particles) -- very uncharacteristic of dragon well teas.<br /><br />Second, the taste is so bland, and so weak.  I can swear that all I taste is simply the paper bag!<br /><br />I literally had to throw 5 packs away, with plastic film covers intact!  Along with the first pack that was open.<br /><br />To really taste dragon well tea properly, avoid this tea by all means.  The first tea that I bought, Adagio Teas Green Tea, is heaven compared with this.

Having said that, I still like it and feel it is much better tasting than most other energy drinks.<br /><br />As far as the boost from caffeine goes...not a lot. I can drink three of these and still feel drowsy in the afternoon.<br /><br />To sum up...good tasting iced tea that is just barely an energy drink.

You may think that 6 is too many, but you will find yourself using it all the time.  I use it in casseroles too.  It does contain salt so be careful when using it in a recipe to leave out the added salt.  What is nice is that it is a complex enough blend that it doesn't make all your food taste the same, like some seasoned salts do.  This enhances different flavors in different foods so shake away and reap the compliments!

review/text: Gatorade G2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of Gatorade without quite so much sugar. As I am in a "pre-diabetes" state these days, I am drinking this type of Gatorade instead of the regular Gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it. The really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after I exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system.<br /><br />G2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising; it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular Gatorade.

review/summary: Colored, Fake Turbinado Sugar!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/summary: Great Flavor but Bottle Top Hassle
review/text: I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/summary: Nice mix, but..
review/text: I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault.

review/summary: How pepper should be
review/text: The blend is beautiful, flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground. The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident. I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag.  The packaging needs to be rethought, though.  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isn't really user friendly.  Something self sealing would be preferable.  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag, the cellophane doesn't want to stop tearing when you do.  Scissors are the best way to open and you'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder.  I'll certainly be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Subtle & Varied Peppery Spice For Every Dish!
review/text: The problem(s) with preground supermarket pepper is that the peppercorns are the cheapest that they can buy...and the preground product has already oxidized and lost all its freshness, potency, and breadth...which means you end up using much more of it than fresh-ground, and even then the flavor profile is flat and overpowering at the same time.<br /><br />This mix is the definition of "peppery"...like the way you would describe a certain note in a fine wine or French perfume...and the subtle zest really opens the other flavors of the dish the way fresh herbs from a garden do.

review/text: This is a great blend of flavors, and I'm highly satisfied with this product. However I do wish there were more pink peppercorns in the packaging which would've added a little more sweetness to the blend and soften some of the "bite" in this mix. Don't get me wrong, I love the heat of black & white pepper, but in this blend I was hoping for something a little more distinctive. Nonetheless, this is a great value. The shipping took a little longer than I thought- 3 to 5 days ended up being 8 (not incl weekend). I also bought the Szechuan peppercorns to roast up and add to this blend...that *should* work out nicely! Overall a dependable seller. Good luck!

review/text: I tried the teriyaki flavour and was very pleased. It's fairly high in salt, 560mg of sodium per oz, but that might be normal for jerky. It has been a long time since I've had any. I do remember the brand I used to get was very very dry and tough. This one wasn't. It was the perfect balance of moisture with a chewy texture that doesn't take all day or tire the jaw. Very Tasty.<br /><br />Update: I got the salmon last time and enjoyed them thoroughly. I tried the Ahi this past time and was disgusted. (They weren't available when I first wrote my review) They were dry, crumbly and foul. I definitely advise against the Ahi

I can find this same product in the grocery store for a little over $3 per package, which would be @ $20 or so for six packages. I'm not seeing where the $39 price tag, even adding shipping and handling, comes in. If you can't find this product locally, have no other way to get it and have the bucks to spend, I'd recommend it as a great sugar-free candy. But, it's really too pricey for me to buy it from Amazon again.

review/summary: these chocolates are one of the best I've ever had, andI'm  from Europe!!
review/text: I am used to GOOD quality chocolate, with a strong bite, and creamy smooth snap, underlying tones of lemon and bitterness in dark chocolate. Let me tell you right now, these chocolates are very very good.<br />They are slightly heavy on the bitterness if anything- all the better for me. I've had those other dark chocolates ( sugar free and non sugar free) from American made brands, and they are all awful. DOve sugar free are creamy in texture but with enough bite to feel like you're chewing something, which yelids to a smooth bittersweet creamy consistency. And the chocolate flesh IS consistently smooth- unlike other brands which resemble crumbles in your mouth.<br />The melty interior is so good at first I wasn't aware it's actually an almost=ganache interior, ever so slightly softer than the shell, but not enough to be a soft centre chocolate.<br />This centre makes them perfect to "eat" as opposed to just put in your mouth and let them melt, like a soft centred chocolate would do  ( I'm thinking of a liquidy centre like soft caramel or mint cream, which actually flows out).<br /><br />These chocolates are way better than the peanut butter filled ones too- for some reason, those ones don't pack the dark chocolate punch at all, and the peanut butter inside is not very peanutty or buttery. You can eat a whole packet before finding any peanut taste at all- those ones are totally disappointing.<br />THese dark chocolate truffle chocolates are really good. I'm ashamed and proud of myself for buying a load of them on sale, and I won't be sharing them!

review/text: These chocolate bites are simply heavenly. So perfectly creamy. They taste DECADENT--you would never guess that they're sugar free!! Plus, perfect portion-size control--you can have one bite for less than 40 calories, or 2 for around 70!!! WONDERFUL. I only wish I could access them more easily, it's so expensive online and hard to find in the store! Worth it, though!

Dove Dark Chocolate Sugar-Free Candy allows us to enjoy, once in a while, the smooth taste of chocolate without too much guilt.

review/summary: An Acquired Taste for Most
review/text: I love Vegemite and Marmite!  It is definitely an acquired taste for most Americans, and I learned to love it a long time ago.  My taste for it was reinvigorated by a wonderful trip to New Zealand where it is commonplace.  Not so much here - hard to find and expensive for a small jar.  It is a yeasty, salty, umami taste treat - perfect spread lightly on toast, sandwiches, rice cakes.  It's not for everyone, but I was delighted to find it through Amazon.com.

review/summary: Very Satisfying
review/text: I love these ginger cookies. They satisfy my sweet craving with one or two cookies. Definite ginger/molasses flavor & lightly sweeten. I do not have any restricted diet, but I was looking for a good ginger cookie. I was pleasantly surprised to find this gluten-free cookie so tasty. The texture is soft so they ship well & arrive in perfect condition. (I've learned my lesson & will only order cookies that are soft or cake-like - anything else arrives in crumbs & are a total waste of money since Amazon does not refund on grocery items.)  Hope this helps, enjoy.

review/summary: Delicious treat and gluten-free!
review/text: This gourmet cookie could be served as a dessert at a 5-star restaurant.  The combination of ginger and molassas is unique, the texture is soft, and it is  incredibly good with coffee or tea.  The cookie is not overly sweet (which I love).  Pamela, you are my new best friend.  I found these by accident in Virginia while visiting my Dad.  I went to the local supermarket in search of some healthy food and, to my dismay, they had a health food section and a gluten-free food section. After I tasted the cookie, I immediately looked on the box to see where they were made. To my great relief and happiness, they were from California (where I live). When I found that Amazon carried them, I was downright gleeful and ordered a dozen boxes as a Christmas present to myself. My husband said, "Whatever are you going to do with all these cookies?"  Now they are his favorite snack, so (WARNING!!!) they can be contagious.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I love ginger, molasses and all of the autumn spices so when I saw these packs of 6 at the Amazon Warehouse for $8.99, I decided I would give them a try.  They are a soft chewy cookie which handled shipping very well.  They have small pieces of slivered almonds in them.  The cookies have a distinct ginger flavor.  If I could change one thing, I would add more almonds.  The almond slivers are few and far between but I am a nut lover so keep that in mind.  This cookie is aptly named as a ginger cookie. If you are not a fan of ginger, don't buy these cookies.  I think that's where some of the other reviewers may have erred. This is definitely not a cookie for people who don't like the zesty peppery flavor that ginger adds to baked goods.  The other thing that I liked about them is that they are not common.  You aren't going to see 10 different brands of these at the store, that's for sure.

review/text: These will satisfy the craving for gingerbread.  When you bite into them, you'll immediately know you're in for a treat.  The eating experience alone hits the reward center of the brain.  Soft, dense and chewy describe the cookie's character.  The rich flavor of molasses provides depth to the tasting experience.  Shredded Ginger gives the cookie a distinct texture and kick to the palate.  One cookie can satisfy the worst craving for carbs.  All the Pamela cookies are delicious, but this one could be a dessert all on its own.

review/text: These cookies are so delicious and happen to work for my very restrictive nursing diet (dairy, soy & egg free).  They aren't ginger snaps, but rather a soft cookie with almonds.  I will certainly be purchasing these long after I am off the nursing diet.  It is also wonderful to be able to purchase these without making the 30 mile trek to Whole Foods.

The warm molasses and ginger spices, it was Almost like I had just gotten it fresh from the oven. I like the fact that each cookie is separated by a piece of paper :) Reminds me of the quality of the food that I am lucky to have to access to!<br /><br />ps-for the naysayers, this IS gluten free, dairy free, and refined sugar free so it's not going to be like a regular cookie. However even with those constraints I think Pamela's has done a tasty job :)

Anyway, the cookies are very tasty, and the subscription price makes them less expensive.

review/summary: Significantly fewer hair balls under the couch and bookcases
review/text: I have a 60 pound Golden Retriever. She drops at least a kitten worth of hair a week and I had been constantly finding balls of hair that have drifted under furniture every time I sweep the hardwood floors. I've been using the FURminator shampoo for a couple years and that definitely helps. The one bummer with the shampoo is that hair is flying off of her for several hours after a bath. It's excellent at getting the hair loose but it doesn't all come off in the bath. The conditioner seems to solve that problem. I would estimate that the amount of hair in the hair trap after giving her a bath is about double when I use the conditioner after using the shampoo and I no longer have the hair blowout problem for a couple hours after her bath. Don't get me wrong, she still sheds but not anywhere near as much. Now the ongoing battle of everything being covered in dog hair is a winnable battle. The amount of daily shedding that occurs is significantly less as well. My Golden has problems with allergies and can be sensitive to a lot of products. I've seen absolutely no reaction to either the shampoo or this conditioner on her. If your pooch isn't so thrilled about having to sit in the tub for five minutes while the condition does it's magic, try smearing some peanut butter on the wall of the tub. I have found that to be an excellent distraction for her.
