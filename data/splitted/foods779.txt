review/summary: Started out okay, but became a lost cause.
review/text: This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.  After a couple of packs(12 cans) she refused to eat it at all.  This was not the only flavor she was given during this time, but she knew when it was part of her meal.  I don't know what happened, but it is not on our menu any longer.

review/summary: Warning red before buying Mis-leading product info!
review/text: First off, I love Phillippine brand dried Mangoes. Too bad these were Royal Phillippine dried mangoes. NOT THE SAME THING. The picture for this product is what I wanted to order. I received something different. The Royal dried mangoes i received were very similar but not as good and more importantly not what I ordered. After trying a few I noticed that they weren't as good so I checked me orders to make sure I purchased what I thought I purchased. The picture was what I ordered but under description they say "Royal Brand Naturally Delicious Dried Mangoes from the Philipines are without a doubt the best tasting..." So the picture they advertise is for Phillippine dried mangoes but under product description its a different brand called Royal. Mangoes are still good but not what I ordered. Disappointed with seller eauction for not clearly advertising product.

review/summary: Well worth it, if you can control yourself
review/text: These are great tasting dried mangoes.  They're tender, don't taste too sweet, and have a nice texture.  They're also very addictive.  I would have given it 5 stars, but you have to watch out for the sugar content.<br /><br />Although mangoes are naturally sweet, these have 32 grams of sugar per serving (or 640 grams per bag, considering there's 20 servings per bag).  That is 1.4 pounds of sugar per bag (including the natural sugar from mangoes), when the bag weighs less than 2 pounds.<br /><br />If you can control your servings, get it.  I have a hard time controlling mine since these mangoes are so good, but am able to do so.  You can also get them from Costco (if you have membership) for around $14.

review/summary: Tree-ripened mangoes do not need sugar added
review/text: I just cannot understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  I am truly baffled.  The added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  It ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />Why buy dried mango?  If you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  Canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  There are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  These enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  These ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  Since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />The best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  If you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  Keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  They last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  Prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. Your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />However the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  Thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar will come off in the liquid found in the meal.

review/summary: Great if you want it as candy!!!
review/text: I am a health food nut. I discovered dried mangos in my local nature/organic food store. They were bulk quantity by the scoop around 9-10/lb. I LOVED THEM so much and soo much healthier as a substitute for a sweet snack, that I wanted to find a better price. After reading reviews about this brand I went to Costco and bought the 30 ounce bag... HERE ARE MY THOUGHT<br /><br />IT CANNOT EVEN COMPARE TO THE NATURAL literally RAW pieces of dried Mango in the organic store WITH NO ADDITIVES!!!! We are talking about DRY pieces of real fruit<br /><br />This AS I SUSPECTED (but nevertheless bought the bag) IS MORE LIKE CANDY!!!!<br />Ingredients list: Dry Mango, SUGAR, Sulfur Dioxide (for preservative)<br /><br />The pieces of mango are COATED with something like powdery SUGAR!!! It is very sweet. 31g of Sugar per serving of ~42g. ALSO the inside part is sort of still juicy EXACTLY LIKE A CANDY. And dont get me even started on the Sulfur Dioxide. I bought grapes that said: "Treated with SO2 PLEASE RINSE THOROUGHLY!!"<br /><br />SO HOW DO I RINSE THIS MANGO!!!<br /><br />SUMMARY: If you want candy-like stuff, buy it. GREAT PRICE. If you want REAL RAW amazing dry mango with no sugar and no chemicals go to a organic health store. My store recently had a sale I got 3 pounds at 7$, which is just as low as the costco one. I will finish this bag that I bought from Philippines and never buy it again.<br /><br />P.s. My first amazon review JUST because I knew that I will be tricked into getting this candy but went ahead anyway to prove my initial worries.

Only way down the page in the description does it actually mention "Royal Brand" mangoes from the Philippines. If I'd known these weren't the product being advertised, I'd never have paid $18 for the bag. The Philippine Brand dried mangoes are worth it. The Royal Brand mangoes are not.<br /><br />Buyer beware!!! This is a bait and switch.<br /><br />I can't speak to any dried mango products purchased through other sellers, only Eauction.

review/summary: Sweet like Candy
review/text: If candied fruit suits your taste, Phillippine Brand Mangoes are perfect.  However, with 32G of Sugars, it is too sweet for us - practically resembling candied-mangoes, if there is such a thing.  Plus, according to the packaging, these mangoes are NOT organic, and subjectively written, "The Best Tasting Mango in the World."<br /><br />On the upside, this fruit is mostly non-acidic, soft, and very moist. There were no pieces to discard; all were evenly colored and of apparently high quality despite the high sugar content.<br /><br />In comparison, we enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEDUTG">Klein's Naturals Mango, Organic, (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QVO">Sunridge Farms Organic Mango Slices, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> which taste like more like natural fruit, instead of candy.<br /><br />However, YOU be the judge since virtually all tastebuds are biased.

In a situation where you have cause to be suspicious, as I do in this one, it's best to just return it and hope the company gets their act together.<br /><br />I won't be ordering mangoes online again, which is a shame because I really do enjoy this particular brand and can't find it locally.

review/summary: Phillipine Brand Naturally Delicious Dried Mangoes
review/text: Phillipine Dried Mangoes are a delicious healthy treat that comes in handy if you have a sweet tooth but want to eat something that is good for you. Eating this product can become a habit. I knew nothing about Phillipine Dried Mangoes until my son introduced me to them. He was introduced to the dried mangoes while in Iraq,and he said that the product was so popular there in that whoever had a supply of Phillipine Dried Mangoes found an empty bag upon return to their living quarters because their comrades had eaten the entire bag! Instead of eating candy or cookies,I prefer to eat Phillipine Brand Dried Mangoes.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: So we're all supposed to drink lots of water and I don't know about you, but the plain stuff gets old for me after awhile. I don't always want to drink unsweetened tea because of the caffeine. A lot of the other "water additive" packets out there are full of artificial sweeteners - aspartame in particular, which gives me migraines. So I picked this up, and it really does solve all my issues with the other water additives I've tried. It gives water a nice authentic orange flavor (not at all fake, like kids' powdered drinks can be), it's not sweet (no sugar or sweeteners), and no calories. It just makes water very refreshing and good to drink, plus it has vitamin C. I am now ordering the True Lemon and True Lime because we never manage to keep lemon juice around for long in our house. I have even given water with True Orange in it to my son; I would never give him water with any of the artificially-colored or sweetened powder in it, but I feel perfectly OK giving him this, and it makes a nice change for him too. This is one of those "why didn't someone think of it sooner" products that I just love. Very recommended if you're trying to drink more water and want to jazz it up a little. Is also great in tea!

review/summary: Great in Tea!
review/text: I've only used this in tea so far and it's great.  It gives a nice subtle orange-y taste to regular tea (haven't tried it with green tea yet). The only thing I don't like is that it smells sort of like splenda or medicine a little BUT the taste is good. And there is no splenda or anything like that in here.

review/text: True Orange is awesome.  It is dehydrated oranges, with no chemicals or additives.  It can be used for any recipe that requires oranges, and it can also be used for flavorings.  There are so many wonderful recipes that are made with True Orange.<br /><br />Not only does True Orange make some delectable recipes and can be used for mouthwatering flavors, but it has a long shelf life.  Fresh oranges only last a certain amount of time.<br /><br />True Orange is truly wonderful.  There are indeed some recipes that True Orange (or True Lemon or True Lime) will make or break.

review/text: I've been trying to duplicate my favorite commercial iced tea, a green tea with citrus, and this has gotten me so much closer!  The beverage I love lists high fructose corn syrup and several preservatives in the ingredients, all of which I think are awful.  I'm brewing my own green tea, sweetening it naturally, and now I'm closer to that citrus flavor (plus the benefits of real green tea).

review/summary: Great for seltzer!
review/text: I recently purchased a home water carbonator. Since I like flavored seltzer water I also set out to find some flavoring agents, but I was incredibly surprised to find out how limited the options were. One brand had too many chemicals, another had too many calories, and another looked fine yet got terrible reviews. I'm so glad I tried True Orange! One packet perfectly flavors 1 Liter of sparkling water, for that barely-there flavor that I like so much. I feel good about consuming it, too, knowing that I'm not putting anything weird into my body or taking in unnecessary calories, which sort of defeats the purpose of trying to stick to water, anyway. I can't wait to try the other flavors from the True Lemon brand - I just wish that they were available directly from Amazon!

review/summary: Good flavor, bad texture
review/text: I ordered the slightly sweet (which has a different box than the one ordered).  It is exactly that, slightly sweet.  I thought the flavor was great.  The problem is the undissolved powder.  I'm not sure what refuses to dissolve: I've tried boiling water, I've tried microwaving after mixing, but nothing gets it completely smooth.  There's a gritty residue and a ton of grit at the end which is undrinkable.  I'm not sure if this happens to the regular Chai.  I don't want to buy 48 pouches and find that I don't like it.

review/summary: A little "artificial" for ICED tea, but okay if you like berries, I guess
review/text: I love pomegranate, I love berries, and I love iced tea. Sadly, I don't love this product as an iced tea. It has an artificial flavor that seems a bit cloying to me. Everyone's taste is different, and this one just doesn't cut it for me.<br /><br />Instead, I highly recommend Gloria Jean's Passion Fruit (Amazon is out of stock). A very close second place is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHDH9Q">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Tea K-Cup, Mango-Flavored Black Tea for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> for a flavored tea or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHH3VO">Gloria Jean's Coffees,  Tea K-Cup, Peppermint Herbal Tea for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> for a mint tea.<br /><br />To make iced tea easily in a Keurig, you need a very strong glass that won't break when taken from boiling to freezing. (Crate & Barrel's excellent Large Working Glass is the strongest I've found that still looks good.) In a 21-ounce glass, put your sweetener in -- 1.75 teaspoons of Splenda for me, 1.25 t for my husband -- then brew a MEDIUM cup of tea. Add ice to almost fill the glass. The ice will melt easily and will end up to be 1/4 of the total volume. Stir and drink.

review/text: I am extremely happy with my Keurig machine.  I drink 40 to 60 oz of tea  a day now.  In the past it was coffee with far too much sugar.  Now I use one k-cup of Pomegranate Berry Fusion Tea to make 20 oz of tea at a time.  A couple pacakets of Splenda and I have a refreshing, delicious drink hot or cold.  We bought our Keurig machine a little over a month ago and I will not go back to coffee or tea made any other way.  Pomegranate Berry is by far my favorite tea!

review/summary: Great for ice tea
review/text: I love the Keurig machine. I love this tea. It is wonderful hot or iced. I just got the Keurig 70 which now has an ice tea setting but if you don't this is all you do. Take a glass, fill with ice, pop in the K-cup and use the smallest cup setting. If you like sugar in your tea put it right over the ice so that the hot tea helps to dissolve the sugar. This also works for iced coffee. What I like to do is pour the ice, sugar and freshly brewed tea into my shaker, shake until blended and then pour over fresh ice. I make a double cup everyday to take to work. Hey they sell "shaken tea" at Starbuck's and charge a whole lot more for it so make your own.

review/text: I made this on my husband's Kuerig B70 in the 10oz size. The smell was overpowering, I could smell it in my upstairs bedrooms which are no where near the kitchen. The tea itself had a strong chemical-type taste, which in no way resembled either pomegranate, berry, or tea.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this tea as I love Gloria Jean's mango tea, and enjoyed the mixed flavor packages. Unfortunately, they've recently changed the mixed configuration to include this unpleasant concoction in place of the chai, so I won't be buying that particular package any more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I purchased 48 of these, and have tried it 4 times now, hoping it would grow on me. It hasn't, and the smell is now making me queasy. I will second what another reviewer wrote, however, in that it is more palatable cold than warm.

review/text: I like strong teas.  I never use sweetners or milk or any thing added so I need my teas to taste great as is.  At first, I found this tea to be too weak for me.  But, I played around and found if I fill my mug with 2 "small" cup setting. (using the same k-cup) I get a full mug that is strong enough to drink plain.  It has a VERY berry flavor so you have to really like berry.  It's not my favorite morning tea (I prefer strong black tea)  But it is good to sip on a cold day, or at night. Based on the flavor, I would think it would be great as an iced tea also, however, I prefer warm tea to iced so I havent tried it that way.  It is enjoyable and I would purchase more once I run out.

THE ACHVA HALVAS ARE ABOUT THE BEST OF THE IMPORTED COMMERCIAL TYPES FOR THE MONEY. IT IS NOT OVER-SWEETENED AS SO MANY ARE. COULD USE A FEW MORE PISTACHIOS - BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, RIGHT? MADE FROM WHOLE GROUND SESAME SEEDS, YOU CAN TELL FROM THE STRONG TANG AFTER EATING - SUGGESTION: LET SMALL BITS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH - DON'T CHEW IT, AND THAT WAY YOU'LL GET MORE OF THE SWEETNESS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS WITH UNSWEETENED COFFEE OR TEA. WE HAVE EVEN USED IT IN BAKING: DICE IT UP AS TOPING FOR COFFEE CAKES AND FILLING FOR CROISSANTS - WOW! WATCH OUT FOR THE CALORIES - BUT YOU DO GET THE BONUS OF VALUABLE NON-SATURATED OIL AND PROTEIN FROM THE SESAME.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I reviewed this jerky for my website and really was amazed by the texture. I do eat meat (and jerky) and am not a mock meat fan by any means, but you could seriously slide this jerky by any meat-eater. It had a great texture - nice pull, good chew - but it wasn't the least bit tough as some jerky can be. It is also rich in protein (13g per ounce); a good option for vegetarians and vegans.<br /><br />I waivered on giving it 4 or 5 starts because it isn't a food I would eat regularly since the main ingredients are wheat gluten and soy flour - two foods we try to limit in our household. But since this is my personal ingredient preference and no reflection on the taste and texture of this product (I devoured it in about 2 minutes), I didn't mark it down.<br /><br />Also, the teriyaki flavor is quite savory and a touch salty, not sweet as many teriyaki jerky's tend to be. I think this was a nice change.

review/summary: Best of the Vegan Dream Jerky
review/text: I got the sampler pack first and tried to find the one I liked best.  I really like the texture of this jerky as it's more like the "real" thing.  I also like primal jerky so I tend to go from one to the other as they are both so different.  Primal is softer and more oozy - difficult to eat on the run as the package can be hard to open.  This jerky is easy to throw in a ziploc and it's not messy in the least.  It's got a good flavor but it's really the texture that does it for me.

review/text: Best licorice on the market.  I don't normally like licorice but I was looking for organic products that I could eat and this stuff is good.  Normally when I think of licorice I think of real sticky or overly chewy.  This is really tasty and has just the right tecture.  If I had to nit pick I would say that the pakaging could be of the new aluminum bags that a German company develops that is non-plastic because plastic may not be safe for packaging food products but as far as what's available I recomend it with the highest rating.  No cancer causing anti-caking agents that they use in salt at least that's what der label says.  Again it has the highest standard of Organic which is USDA certified.  Placing 2nd order.

review/summary: Tasty, but the 'crunchy' is a bit oily
review/text: It is difficult to write this review since I had a somewhat mixed experience: the 'Smooth' is _absolutely fantastic_ while the 'Crunchy' isn't my thing. If you like Biscoff cookies, you'll *love* this stuff. I was skeptical, but had to give it a try. Put it on bread, apples, bacon, or just eat it out of the jar. Better yet, put it on bread with thin green apple slices and top with bacon. Awesome!<br /><br />As for my experience with the Crunchy, the flavor is pretty much the same as the Smooth, but there are little chunks of cookies in the spread. I expected that. What I didn't expect was that the oil in my jar had separated from the spread and was pooled in the top of the jar. I stirred it back in -- I've had similar experiences with Nutella and other spreads in the past, and that usually does the trick. Unfortunately, this one kept separating, which made the texture kind of nasty. The flavor was still good, but the experience wasn't the same.<br /><br />5+ stars for the Smooth, which I will be ordering again, but separately.<br />-1/2 star because they come in GLASS JARS. Just be careful, especially if you have kids.<br />3 stars for the Crunchy because it is a spread made from Biscoff cookies and IS crunchy.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5-4 stars for the bundle because it did let me try both options and now I know which one I like best.

Long story short, the spreads have the great taste of the cookie. They are almost too good, because it is hard to resist nibbling them. I've put them on toast, on English muffins, and even just from a spoon. Before you know it, the jar is empty!

So I am very disappointed that the great deals I usually find on Amazon, did not play out with this product, in fact I kinda feel like I was ripped off!

review/summary: Finest chocolate
review/text: I love valrhona chocolate. My mother is from the town in France where they are made, so I grew up with it . I have lived in the US for 10 years now and used to buy them from the brand US online store with coupons found online. There, the bag is 2.2 lbs and is branded valrhona ( go there to see what i mean, i didn't take a picture of my last bag directly from them).<br />From this seller, the bag is 2 lbs. by the look of the package, the difference in weight and the look of the feves ( see my picture, they are not in the best shape), i am guessing this seller buys in bulk, real bulk (maybe 2nd choice feves even?) and then repackages.<br />All in all, the chocolates taste fantastic as i expect from Valrhona, but i admit i was expecting the brand package (and look of the feves). If you intend them for baking, absolutely no issue. If you intend them as treats next to your coffee, then they are not looking their best.<br />Don't get me wrong, for the price i paid (less than at Valrhona), i will buy again. Soon. And often. It's just that because i know what the brand package looks like, i was a little disappointed.<br />Caraibe is one of my favorites too. They have different ones, which i also buy :-), but this one is very versatile and can be enjoyed by all, including my 21 month baby girl.

Not at all!!! The packaging has a very good protection with ice bags and special paper... So my chocolate was still a little bite cold when I opened it. The Valrhona chocolate is different from all the others since it has a true flavor, not fat, just right, unique... Yes, it's more expensive but if you want to impress, cook with it!

review/text: This is my favorite baby food line by far. They are consistent and readily available at just about any store. We got this variety pack on Amazon after already purchasing it from local stores. This is a great price compared to most stores and the variety of flavors is great. I wish they had more variety packs available for stage 3, but compared to other products out there it is hard to complain.<br /><br />Now I am just waiting for the day that earth's best moves away from glass jars. Our daughter has started grabbing these out of her diaper bag and if she drops them on our hard floors it will break the jars. I have broken a couple myself dropping them from the cupboard on to the granite counter tops. I really like the pouches that some lines are doing and even the plastic containers that Gerber does. Glass is great because it is recyclable, but so are the plastic ones if you live in an area that supports that or you can reuse them like we do for storing bulk spices. That is the only the con I have and it is not even big enough to rate this product any lower.<br /><br />For those of you that cannot tell what flavors you are getting, they are:<br />2 - Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal<br />2 - Chicken Tenders and Stars<br />2 - Vegetable Beef Pilaf<br />2 - Strawberry Banana

I like that they have a large variety of HEALTHY options that combine a whole variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and meats. In my opinion, there is no nutrition in mac and cheese so why bother giving it to them. They have different stages that seem to have been very appropriate for the eating abilities of my son.

I like that there's nice mixes of flavors, not just creamed peas, or pureed spinach, but chunky mixes of vegetables and meat broth. The first time we ordered these it took a while for them to come, but the next two times, they were sent right away.  The food is actually good enough that I would eat it with a little salt.  It's also nice that we can donate the bottles to our local art teachers for use in their projects.
