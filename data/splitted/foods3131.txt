review/summary: Not the best, but CERTAINLY, not the worst!
review/text: This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means "the strongest daggone brew we can make" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!

review/summary: An anchovy by any other name...
review/text: When you have to have anchovies for that home made Italian salad you grab for that can at the grocery store and usually wince at the cost. Got tired of the wincing, checked with Amazon and found this grat deal in a bulk package. True I could find a similar product at close the Amazon price but bulk buying is the best way to save money here.<br /><br />The one concern I have buying in bulk from any source is the experation dates of the product. Time and time again Amazon belays any experation fears by sending food goods that always have an extended date which is usually better than what I would find at the store.<br /><br />Good tasting quality product, good price, long experation date. What more can an anchovy lover ask for?

review/summary: great product - 2012 yields shocking price increase *
review/text: Anchovies are top quality - disregard the review which describes them as 'mush' - The anchovies are distinct fillets, always in excellent condition.  We have been buying and loving this product for years.  I would recommend pouring off the packing oil and serving with a good quality extra virgin.  Marvelous on brussel sprouts, salads, or plain on a multigrain (German or Scandinavian) bread.<br /><br />That said, they were just over $25/case in December 2011, and are now $42/case, in October 2012, a shocking price increase.  Given that Polar sources from Germany, Argentina, Chile, etc. , all of whom have equally weak or weaker currencies compared to the USD, why the increases?<br /><br />* - One last comment - the product needs to be refrigerated, in spite of whatever is on the cans or what folks believe.  Otherwise, natural expansion of the contents may break the vacuum seal, and over time, spoil the anchovies.  We now refrigerate all canned fish products as a result of having a few cans 'pop,' and having detailed product quality discussions with Polar (in CA).

They aren't the best anchovies you can buy obviously but are perfect for adding flavor to that pizza, sauce, or other dish you are cooking. I would buy again! For $1.32/tin you can't beat it!<br /><br />FYI I bought these about a month ago, just getting around to writing a review now.

review/text: I only use anchovies in making my pasta sauce (sugo).  It's a trick I learned a few years ago and I will tell you this: EVERYONE who tastes my pasta sauce LOVES it, even those who swear they hate anchovies!  It's a quick and simple recipe, amazingly simple, it's just a fast way I make it to get pasta on the table in under 20 minutes.  I have always used salt-packed anchovies from an Italian deli.  Ran out of anchovies and it's a few hours drive to get more so I looked at Amazon.  Found these and decided to give it a try.  Just as good and a LOT cheaper!!!<br /><br />So, you want to know how I make my sauce don't you?  Get ready for a meal in 20 mintues....<br /><br />Start cooking your pasta in the "Fasta Pasta" maker in the microwave (bought on Amazon). *I cook a whole pound of Dreamfield's Linguine in the 'Fasta Pasta' cooker (it pushes the maximum amount but it works for our family)*<br /><br />In a large skillet (I use non-stick) pour in the whole can of anchovies and the olive oil.  Cook and mash the anchovies down to a paste-like consistency. Add 1 large chopped red onion and cook for a minute, then add in a 15-16 oz can whole, peeled tomatoes. (I use a San Marzano style, but not Italian grown, found on Amazon) Mash the tomatoes with your spoon into the anchovy/onion, add black pepper to taste, and cook for a few minutes on high.  Drain pasta and add to the cooking sauce and toss well for a minute.  Turn off heat and add some parmesan or romano cheese and serve, delish!

review/text: They're Anchovies.  They're not as good as crown prince.  I took a gamble and picked these with a lower price, but should have forked over the extra ten bucks for quality.  The oil is "off" as are the anchovies themselves.  After a few seconds in your mouth they develop the right anchovy taste, but not until then... They might be okay if used in a recipe, but won't stand up for themselves on their own.

review/summary: Sea food is good for your health!
review/text: Last semester, I met my friend-she is from Aberdeen-at the kitchen when I was eating anchovies, and she looked at me in weird eyes. I asked her why, and she said, "Eating fish is weird..." I can understand her totally; Aberdeen doesn't have the ocean, but I would like to tell her that seafood including fish is the one of the best food in the world.<br /> There are many kinds of fish such as an anchovy which is small fish that lives in the sea, a mackerel, it is a sea fish with a dark and patterned back, and so on. In addition, there are sea weed, it is green-black and lives at the bottom of the ocean, a sea squirt, it is covered with many bumps and hard red shell, an octopus, some people eat live octopus as well, a trump shell, and so on. I live near the ocean, so I can get to the store where sell the seafood easily. Once I get to the store, I order a sliced raw fish. As I order, a sales person catch the hopping fish-it is fresh fish caught at the morning- in a fish basin and slice the fish, and serve them along with sauces to us.<br /> I like seafood for the following reasons: taste, variety was to cook, health. I want to tell you about taste. You could think an anchovy looks at you when you eat an anchovy, but once you chew an anchovy, you will change your mind because it tastes salty and delicious. The taste of sea food is like that the freshness of the ocean spread in the mouth. Moreover, we cook seafood in variety ways. Among those variety ways to cook, my favorite one is slice. Usually I eat sliced raw fish with sauce;<br />when I eat it with soy sauce mixed with vinegar and red pepper sauce and wrap with a sesame leaf, it tastes so much better.<br />We can also make fish or seafood as soup or stew. For example, we make soup with seaweed, and it is not only this tastes so good but also it is so good for maternities; the ingredient such as protein in the seaweed influences to them. Because of the reason, Korean eat seaweed soup on every their birthday.<br />Seafood is healthy food as it has healthy ingredients. These ingredients promote the growth and help people to digest well. In addition, the best effect is that we can get calcium from sea food; sea food promotes to absorb calcium, and then makes bones strong.<br />Nowadays, sea food is considered as exotic food in America because people have interest in well-being life. With this interest, they have started to eat sea food as they have already known how it affects to our health. Of course, fast food is delicious, but it only makes our body fatter. There's no a favorable influence. In contrast, the sea food is not only it tastes really good but also it is healthy food. That's why the seafood attracts to New Yorker. If you want to eat something delicious and healthy, eat the sea food, and you could also enjoy your exotic well-being life.

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

review/text: This drink is tasty. I have always been a fan of peach juice but haven't been able to find it so I decided to try this. It is super sweet though and I am not thrilled by the presence of high fructose corn syrup in the ingredients. I know that peach juice (nectar) is typically sweet but maybe it could be better without HFC. This is not something I would give my kid, for example.

Very refreshing.  By itself the peach flavor comes through 100 percent.  and the price is cheaper than the supermarket.  am ordering another case after writing this review.  stock up for the holidays for making  easy cocktails for your guests.

review/summary: Healthy Tea Supports Weight Control
review/text: *****<br />This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is "designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight." Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It's suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I'm not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don't care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we've included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins." Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****

Yummy truffle fudge surrounded by terrific hard chocolate. If you like chocolate, you'll be satisfied.

More acid crispiness comes through and light fruity flavors are added. But I found it shows best against lightly sweet foods: fresh blueberries, salads with acidic, lightly sweet dressings, etc. Other pairings were not as good: most fail to bring much notable flavor. I got my money's worth, but not much more.

review/summary: Real Pilaf taste
review/text: My husband loves rice pilaf. The problem with making it from a boxed product in the past is that the flavoring is usually too much and too strong.<br /><br />I did not have that problem with this version of Rice a Roni. The taste was spot on. It was not too strong and the rice actually cooked up nicely.<br /><br />The only recommendation I do make is that you follow the box directions for the most part except you should add at leat a half a cup more water than they recommend. If you don't the rice will dry out before it is completely done cooking.

review/summary: Rice A Roni Rice Pilaf
review/text: As much as I'm a fan of cooking everything from scratch, I am definitely not above using a boxed meal every once in awhile.  Sometimes you just don't have the energy or ambition to cook something from scratch, especially rice, which if you don't have a rice cooker, can be time consuming and difficult.  So Rice a Roni products are ok to me, used in moderation.<br /><br />The ingredients, for a boxed meal, aren't terrible.  There is MSG unfortunately and a very high level of sodium.  Which means this probably isn't the best meal for someone with health problems, or for that matter anyone trying to be healthy.  But it does have real onions, rice, and other spices which is ok.  I like that they use turmeric for the coloring since that's supposed to be a pretty good spice for you.  The fat content in this rice box isn't too bad either compared to some of its competitors out there.<br /><br />The cooking process is pretty simple as well.  Even if you use a microwave its just a matter of zapping it a few times to brown the rice and then cooking it with water.  And you only dirty one bowl and one spoon in the process.  It says to cover with something during the actual cooking process and I've found that covering with a towel tends to produce a more tender rice, but that may just be my imagination.  They offer suggestions on how to make this rice a meal by adding chicken and veggies too, although I didn't do that, I instead sauteed some pieces of sausage in a maple mustard and added them to the mix, which actually worked quite well.<br /><br />The rice itself is kind of light flavored.  There's some flavoring sure, kind of chickeny actually.  But its not very strong, and I prefer my meals strong.  The flavor was good, I just wish it was more pronounced.  Adding that aforementioned sausage did help a bit.  The texture was enjoyable.  The rice was just firm enough to get a good bit through it but soft enough to really sink your teeth into.  And it wasn't a mushy mess like these can sometimes turn out to be.<br /><br />I'd probably have this product again.  Its not something I'd make a regular part of my meal, but in a pinch its a good way to fill out dinner.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

And I learned a valuable lesson: you cannot return grocery items through Amazon. Or at least that's what they told me when I tried to return it. This is a Chinese sencha and while there are many Chinese teas that I really like, I've yet to have sencha grown in China that was anywhere near as good as Japanese sencha.

I only paid $8.35 for two 12 OZ bags of this coffee.<br /><br />As soon as I open the first bag I could smell the beans and it was great! WOW, a very good aroma! As I ground some up for my coffee the scent of maple was strong. I loved the taste of this coffee from the first sip.<br /><br />I made a pot of this coffee at work and everyone really enjoyed it. This coffee received many compliments.<br /><br />I came back to Amazon to order more for my children who are away in college. But the price had doubled!  So now the kids don't get any of this delicious coffee - for now.<br /><br />If you love the taste of Maple then you may love this coffee too. Give it a try... it is absolutely delicious!

review/summary: Just what I was hoping for
review/text: Looking for a stick-to-your-ribs, tasty stew with beef and potatoes (mostly)? This was it for me. Really satisfying. About 400 calories per can, 70% of your daily sodium requirement, and about 25 grams of protein (less than half of your minimum daily need).<br /><br />But what I look for in the canned staple foods I buy on Amazon is: will I actually want to eat it, or will it just stay in the carton until a year or two later when it gets "donated" to the next food for the needy drive.<br /><br />I'm gonna eat this! No doubt about it. Virtually all of these canned stews have too much sodium (table salt) in them, so you should have only one can per day as a meal. But they are a good, basic meal preferably along with some bread, fruit, berries, vegetables, cheese or other dairy products such as yogurt or sour cream.<br /><br />This stew will not supply all your vitamin needs. That's the reason for the recommendation for other foods to eat along with it (or you can take vitamin supplements).<br /><br />I've found buying canned stews and other foods on Amazon by the carton and getting a break on the shipping charges is a good deal. For my grocery shopping locally, now, all I need to get is dairy, fresh fruits and berries in season, and frozen foods. Fewer bags to bring home.

review/summary: "Tea Totaler"
review/text: I love this tea -- as well as their Irish Breakfast Tea and English Breakfast tea.  It's rich and dark.  I don't drink coffee, but do drink lots of tea and feel this tea is worth the price.  I used to buy this tea at our local kitchen shop, but it's cheaper at Amazon.  If you buy the 6-pack of 50 bags at Amazon, it's even more economical.

review/summary: Splendid!  Divine!  Outstanding!  Run, don't walk....
review/text: If you want to get a good sampling of a great tea, this is the way to do it--buy 20 or 50 tea bags as a trial before splurging on a larger order.  The sunk costs are only ten dollars U.S., there's free 2-day delivery via Amazon Prime, and you can decide later whether to stock up in earnest.<br /><br />Leaving aside sentimental attachments to T of H formed while sitting about the kitchen for hours drinking it and working on problem sets for e-mag and analytical mechanics with some of my good college friends, it must be said that Taylor's of Harrogate really know what they're about when it comes to tea...this in a way that many Americans may not equipped to really appreciate.  I'll skip mentioning some of the floor sweepings that you can find at the grocery store, but, for literate comparison, the good folks at Twinings are worldwide marketing experts and have made huge strides bringing a selection of decent teas to the peoples in many new markets, viz their English Breakfast is available 'round the world.  Taylor's of Harrogate are in my view another thing altogether.  I think they offer a better tea to a smaller market cross section.  The Scottish Breakfast itself is a wonderfully strong and brightly coloured tea--this is tea-nerd talk, granted--but the color (or colour) of it is remarkable; it gives you straight away the feeling that you've happened onto something rather special.  And the flavor (flavour, if you will) is, in the words of my tea-hound office cube-neighbor (neighbour...), "manly."  It'll give you a nice boost, but it won't wire you out.  It drinks well straight or with milk or even with cream, and of course a little sugar never hurt a breakfast tea.  If you like "black" teas (hong chaah!!), this is one you should not miss.

review/text: Sorry Amazon, I am going to cover the Lindt Lindor Truffles Dark Chocolate and Extra-Dark Chocolate.  These are made from the best chocolate I have had the pleasure of passing over my taste buds in a very long time.  No matter what the situation is, I can pop one of either the Dark Chocolate or Extra Dark Chocolate in my mouth and know everything is better.  The Dark Chocolate is the only dark chocolate that to me has a good taste as opposed to bitter. So, I try to keep it stocked at all the times. I just got my order for this month and it is good that a person of a certain age can still get so excited about a package.  Thank you to Amazon for their timely delivery of this fragile item.

We keep a variety of flavors of these, as well as the Happy Tot brand, in the refrigerator for a once or twice-a-day treat.  I like that it incorporates a serving of fruit and dairy, although the sugar content is approximately 15 grams (I think...going from memory).  These are very convenient to pack for travel or going out to dinner.  The other brand that I mentioned also incorporates a vegetable in some of the flavors, FYI.

Now she is 15 months and has been eating the smoothies straight from the pouch, using the opening as a straw.

They still ate them, but weren't as big of fans on our trips to the beach in recent 90 degree weather. I definitely recommend refrigerating them before serving, as they liked them better cold than room temperature, but I think they would still have eaten them. They are great for a clean, healthy-ish snack for field trips and I will surely buy them again for lunches and such, as they are a nice pantry staple when we are out of fresh fruits.

I love how this is a wholesome ORGANIC milk product that contains 25% of the daily recommended amount of Calcium. She would literally eat 12 of these a day if I let her!  These are a staple in our pantry and have a fantastic shelf life.  The price on Amazon with subscribe and save is decent if you can't find it on sale anywhere else.  Highly recommend ALL of the flavors as a quick breakfast or a healthy snack!

review/summary: Yummy organic smoothies-- perfect for Kiddos on the go!
review/text: Our little one LOVES his yummy, organic fruit yogurt smoothies. One of the best additions to our routine!<br /><br />This is a perfectly healthy, portable and vitamin packed snack for toddlers. Generous portion, sized well for kiddo hands, and an easy snack that is ideal on-the-go or when you want to encourage independent eating.<br /><br />Each pouch contains a blend of organic fruit and yogurt-- which means vitamins, protein, and calcium. Fantastic snack!
