review/summary: Naturally Yucky
review/text: Almond milk has been considered a health drink... since the Middle Ages. If it's done right, it's delicious. Pacific Natural Foods' almond milk has a weird taste and a worse aftertaste. All the cocoa, sugar and agave syrup can't cover over its grossness.  It tastes manufactured, for something organic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WWLEWM">Nestle Nesquik  Ready To Drink Strawberry Shelf Stable Milk, Low Fat (1% Milkfat), 14-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> tastes A LOT more natural, despite the pink bunny on it. Oh, and it has a good taste. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002H062P8">Blue Diamond Almond Breezeï¿½ Chocolate Almond Milk, 32 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> is MUCH better. It's from the San Joaquin Valley, where most almonds are grown! Pacific Naturals makes better soups and broths--as well as a great hazelnut milk, because it's Oregonian.

review/summary: TOO SWEET!!
review/text: Bought this for my mother in law, who can't drink regular milk. She normally uses almond milk, and loves Almond Delight and Silk, etc...never had her say she had found one she didn't care for. She doesn't drink it, she uses it in cereal every morning. Anyway, she told me that she had opened the shipment of this almond milk and it is so sweet--she didn't like it. She said she will use it and just won't add any sugar or berries to her cereal, but she won't want any more of it. It is sad, because I wanted to buy her normal brand but Amazon was out of stock. So I thought I'd try this one, since it's organic, and at that, I paid a bit more for it, per ounce. Wish I hadn't. If you like your almond milk very sweet, you'll love this. If you don't, I'd suggest another brand.

Some of my favorites, which seem no longer available, were thicker and spread more evenly. I was slightly disappointed when I first tasted this product but am slowly converting and think that my original wanting of "thicker" was a mere prejudice that was only justified by limited prior experience.

review/summary: Great quality, high price
review/text: Five stars for the product. This is the nicest formulation for a 100% liver product I have seen (as opposed to the "liver flavored" treats with other, cheaper ingredients). The pieces are firm, easily broken into smaller bits and do not break down into a dusty powder like the freeze dried ones do (especially chicken livers). And they are buffalo instead of beef or chicken if that matters (due to food allergies and sensitivities, it might). The only issue I have is cost. These are $3.21/oz. The beef liver treats I have used previously range between $1.28 and $1.68 per oz.<br />If your dog can not eat beef or chicken, I highly recommend this product.

I got this product expecting the same thing.  I have to say, the chipotle is there but not quite as smokey.  It's basically regular chili powder.  Don't get me wrong, chili powder is one of my favorite spices and this product wasn't waste of my money.  While spices like cinnamon and pepper are great from anywhere in bulk, I will be getting my chipotle from Penzey's now.

(I experimented with different things until I settled on that combo.) It's pleasant then, but it's gone almost immediately, and then I have to go make a mug of regular tea anyway.<br /><br />It never occurred to me to have to check to make sure a tea is gluten-free, but this one isn't (has barley), as I learned the hard way.

review/summary: Good product but hardens over time
review/text: I am not experiencing any difficulties with dissolve rates with this product.  Ideally you would have both this little shaker canister plus the individual packets because when adding to a drink the packets are convenient but when whipping up some tasty dessert or, as I have been doing lately, making a batch of coleslaw dressing, being able to dip a half teaspoon into the canister is easier and neater than opening a bunch of packets.  If I could only have one though I'd have the canisters.  It's a great product that I am very thankful for.  Update - I have discovered a reason to buy the packets instead.  I found last night that the remaining powder in the canister I've been using has hardened to a solid impenatrable rock.  No amount of jabbing with fork or pointy knife will break it up.  The lid was closed tight so it wasn't because of that.  I suppose I could add some distilled water to see if it will make liquid stevia out of my petrified product.

review/summary: A True Replacement
review/text: A TRUE REPLACEMENT<br />After 60 years, I've broken my sugar addiction. Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added).  More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after 6 months of pure Stevia, it tastes like sugar to me, and I am again enjoying gourmet coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps more precisely, pure stevia is "as satisfying" as sugar for "cutting the edge" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar. However, it is not as intensely sugary-sweet, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month "desert" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream.  Caveat: I find Splenda to be taste better in lemonade.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO KAL PURE STEVIA EXTRACT<br />SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER contains the natural fiber Inulin as a bulking agent. KAL STEVIA POWDER does not.  The Inulin does not seem to affect the flavor nor leave a yucky residue (as do the nasty bulking agents in Truvia/Purevia).  Possibly due to the Inulin, SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier thand KAL STEVIA POWDER. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder</a><br /><br />CAUTION<br />Inulin is a polysaccaride sometimes used as a sugar substitute itself (for diabetics).  It has about 1/4 to 1/3 the sweetness of sugar, and about 1/4 to 1/3 the caloric content---which I interpret to mean the same calories for the same sweetness (however, in this case much of the sweetness is contributed by the Stevia).  Inulin is a current food fad, with the usual (probably greatly exaggerated) claims of benefits, including improving digestion, reducing cholesterol, particularly triglycerides, protection from intestinal cancer, etc.  On the otherhand, it causes digestive problems in some people.  I suggest reading the Wikipedia article.  If (like me), you don't have digestive problems with inulin, and it sounds as though the various benefits may be significant for your particular health problems---I suggest arranging for blood tests after a month of using inulin, and a month after not using inulin to compare.  I used Sweetleaf Stevia for 6 months, and noticed no benefits, and my blood tests showed no improvement.  Perhaps coincidentally, I did nave a digestive-related problem, and my liver function was worse.  So, I returned to KAL Stevia.  Perhaps coincidentally, after three months, the digestive-related problem has not re-occured and my liver function has improved (as measured by blood tests).  I don't know if the inulin caused me any problems, but I do not believe it was any benefit.<br /><br />EASE OF USE<br />SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER and KAL LIQUID STEVIA are easier to measure than KAL STEVIA POWDER, because the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER comes with a tiny spoon which I find works perfectly well for measuring stevia for my coffee.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is so concentrated that it is difficult to sprinkle over a sliced fruit dish.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W0G62E">Pure Stevia Liquid Extract - 4 oz - Liquid</a><br /><br />SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER.  That is not a problem for hot drinks, but SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER or KAL LIQUID are preferable for cold drinks, such as iced tea or limonade. I also find that unsweetened fruit cups etc. are just too sour for my taste---a few drops of the KAL LIQUID STEVIA makes them perfect.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />$15.22 for 2 4oz bottles of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER versus $18.44 for 1 3.5 oz of KAL STEVIA POWDER (the price at the time of this writing, both with free shipping on orders >$25) may seem a bargain, but the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  A 3.5oz jar of KAL STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 2381 servings.  A 4oz bottle of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 230 servings (= 460 servings for 2 bottles).  The economy of KAL LIQUID is probably similar to SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER.<br /><br />I use "3 servings" per mug of strong coffee, so 1 bottle (3.5oz) of KAL STEVIA POWDER = 600 mugs of coffee, to my taste; while 2 bottles (8 oz) of SWEETLEAF STEVIA = 153 mugs of coffee.  So, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is clearly the winner for pure economy, but even the SWEETLEAF STEVIA is far cheaper and superior to Truvia/Purevia.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />For coffee and other hot drinks, KAL POWDER is the most economical.  For cold drinks, fruit etc. SWEETLEAF POWDER (or KAL LIQUID) is more convenient.<br /><br />General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

review/text: We happened upon a remarkable, daily refreshment in "The Fat Flush Diet" book: a certain brand of cranberry juice sweetened with Stevia Plusï¿½. Over time we've found that we've drunk much less soda and other store-bought drinks, have had a much lower incident of flu and colds, as well as a healthy loss of weight. (So far, I've lost 25 pounds.)<br /><br />Why Stevia Plus ï¿½? It is herbal and the only recommended brand by author Ann Louise Gittleman. All other brands of artificial sweetener (and most store bought juices and foods), contain aspartame, which is suspected of stimulating the release of insulin. (Insulin is used by your body to conserve fat !!) Aspartame also suppresses production of serotonin, a natural neurotransmitter that helps control food craving. {More specific info and studies - page 172}.<br />Stevia Plus Powder 4 oz.

review/summary: A little goes a long way, not for baking
review/text: Stevia is sweeter than sugar, so you only use a small fraction of the amount compared with sugar. Like most non-sugar sweeteners, stevia does not taste exactly like sugar. It took me and my husband a week or so to get used to the taste. He now prefers it to sugar in his coffee. I have tried other stevia brands, but SweetLeaf has been my favorite. The addition of fiber helps to add some body to the powder, without adding things I don't want (some other brands use lactose). I really like that it is a zero calorie sweetener, yet is made from a plant, not a chemical.<br /><br />Because it is much sweeter than sugar and has a different consistency, I have not yet figured out how to accurately bake with it. Adding small amounts to sweeten pancakes or pasta sauce works fine, but baking cookies or cakes just doesn't work at all.

review/summary: My favorite brand of Stevia
review/text: This is my favorite because the bitter aftertaste is gone. Keep in mind that you should use less than you are used to, like 1/4, at first until you become used to stevia's sweetness and can adjust your beverage. This is NOT for baking. For that, you need <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FXQDFC">NuNaturals Morefiber Stevia Baking Blend Powder, 14.11-Ounce</a>, and  you might have to cut back the quantity there, too, tho not as much. Stevia is very sweet, but has no calories and is non-glycemic. It's great in iced or hot tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and many other things, but not everything. It's worth trying tho, for the sweetness without the health problems of sugar.

review/summary: Quaity Stevia product with good taste
review/text: SweetLeaf makes my favorite stevia powder. Although the healthiest version is a green powder in its most natural form, I tried several brands but they don't dissolve well and taste funny. Who wants green stuff floating in your coffee or tea? I have been a loyal SweetLeaf customer for a few years. I use this shaker at home and travel with the little green packets which are great! It dissolves well in hot drinks and not as well in cold drinks but it is a better alternative to the fake chemical sweeteners out there (think pink and blue packets). I'd rate it a 6 if they could make it green and maintain the same quality.<br /><br />Best Stevia product out there!!

review/summary: Sweetleaf Stevia Powder
review/text: I first tried Stevia at a health retreat in Canada a number of years ago, when it was not yet readily available in the US (at least I had never heard of it.) It was delightfully sweet, with no aftertaste, and of course, no calories. It is not a corn or cane sugar derivative, but made from the stevia plant. The SweetLeaf brand is mixed with a little natural soluable fiber to make it easier to use. I've tried several different brands, and the SweetLeaf seems to pour most easily from the shaker bottle. Some other brands are more loose and "dusty"--harder to work with than this brand. I've been using SweetLeaf Stevia for five years now, and love the taste and texture of this particular brand more than any other.

review/summary: Very Good Sweetener
review/text: I have used this sweetener for a couple years, mainly in hot tea.  A very small amount goes a long way and so this shaker lasts me a good 3 or 4 months or so.  I have noticed no aftertaste at all and find the sweet flavor to be similar to cane sugar.  The fiber part can settle out if I take a while to finish my tea so am not so sure how good that part is, but fiber is not why I use this product.  Have also used it in baking and sweetening fruit with very good results.  As for use with cold items, it does fine in cereal but that's about the only way I've used it cold.  Definitely would recommend this product as it seems to have many benefits and no downside.  Believe those who claim an aftertaste might be using too much.  Great product!

review/summary: a great product...
review/text: I have had hypoglycemia since I was about ten years old - nearly nineteen years later, I find Stevia to be a Godsend.  Stevia is actually part of the sunflower family, and is native to South America, Central America, and Mexico.  It has been used by the Guarani people, for centuries, as an alternative to synthetic sweeteners (long before Sweet 'n Low even existed). The plant's leaves, the aqueous extract of the leaves, and purified steviosides are used as sweeteners. Since the Japanese firm Morita Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. produced the first commercial stevia sweetener in Japan in 1971, the Japanese have been using stevia in food products, soft drinks (including Coca Cola), and for table use. Japan currently consumes more stevia than any other country, with stevia accounting for 40% of the sweetener market.<br /><br />I find that minimal amounts of Stevia are actually sweeter than sugar, honey or any other sweetener I have sampled.  It goes great in tea, and even as an added boost to smoothies - along with any fruit and yogurt. What's more, it does not further imbalance blood sugar levels, and I do not find it to really have the after taste that some people complain about, when using it.  As I said, I use it minimally. It does have an intense sweetness.

review/summary: Beware
review/text: I love stevia and am always making and buying healthy organic foods for our family. I gave up sugar 9 months ago and thanks to stevia it is going great! However, this product contains too much fiber. My husband and I have been having these terrible stomach aches recently ( never used to ), the only thing I can think of is my recent use of this form of stevia. While a little fiber is great, too much is bad for your body. I have been using it in everything; baked goods, pancakes, my homemade pasta sauce, even our tea and water. Now we are learning what over use of this product can do! My other problem with it is the fact that it "poofs!" when you bake with it. I am very careful but no matter what I do it all goes into the air and my lungs. It does not blend easy a bit. The only way it blends is if you mix it with hot boiling water first. Spend the extra and get the liquid stevia without fiber!

review/summary: Poor quality control in packaging
review/text: The manufacturer of this product needs to significantly improve their quality control of bottling this product. I received my first two jars of this yesterday and this morning as I opened the first jar the lid would not unscrew. When I forced it to open I saw that the stevia had not been properly sealed beneath the lid and the powder had filled the screw top and even spilled out into the plastic casing around it. Naturally since the seal had been compromised I was unable to use the contents of that jar. I opened the second jar and it was properly sealed and the taste of the contents was quite good. Unfortunately I will not be able to purchase this anymore because I have lost faith with the manufacturer's quality control and because it is a food product Amazon cannot accept returns. I am adding this note to tell all that when Amazon found out about the defective jar, they sent me an email informing me that they are mailing me a free replacement of the entire order and it has already shipped on the same say I notified them. Now who can complain about that?

review/summary: Sweetleaf stevia Powder
review/text: I was buying this product from a small store near my house until they discontinued it.  I started shopping for it at other stores and on line.  I went back to using the sweetener I had been using for years.  I started gaining weight!  No other changes but not using the stevia in my morning latte and tea.  I found the Sweetleaf Stevia on Amazon and ordered it right away.  It came on time and as soon as I started to use stevia again my weight dropped within the week!  Another benefit of this brand and size is you can order it on subscribe and save.  Since I will be using this regularly It's well worth having it sent at the intervals I select and saving additional money at the same time.<br />The shaker jars are very convenient.  They fit in any small corner of the counter/pantry.  On the top half is a shaker and the other half you can put a measuring spoon in.  If you haven't tried stevia this is a good brand to try.  The powder is smooth and not lumpy.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone who uses sweeteners instead of sugars.

review/summary: Ingredients not detailed in description. "Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener."
review/text: The first thing I did was check the ingredients because of all the different sweeteners  that claim to be Stevia but have fillers of some sort. I had chosen this brand because it's all natural, no chemicals, but unlike other pure Stevia sweeteners that I've tried, that have Stevia as the Main ingredient and Xylitol(to help with the caking) i.e "Ingredients: Stevia, Xylitol" this one reads, "Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener."  I was disappointed and thought you might want to know if you're looking for a real all Stevia sweetener. Amazon does not give refunds on grocery items, though they were gracious on this occassion to give one. I don't know about the taste, my main concern was that it was actually Stevia and then I can look into taste afterwards. One more thing, the description on the bottle label attributes digestive health to the inulin fiber not the stevia.

I don't know but I paid about $10 to give it a shot.<br /><br />To me it is not that sweet. I'm ok with tea not being that sweet but I like my coffee sweet.  To put the amount in that I would need to make it sweet, it would be horrible tasting because of the aftertaste.  And yes I tasted it.<br /><br />So this is a no go for me.  I have some Truvia which isn't that sweet either (although it smells like cotton candy) and has carbs so I may have to stick with my Sweet N Low for my coffee and some other stevia for tea and cereal.

review/summary: Not an extract
review/text: I have been using stevia for about a decade. I have gotten to the place white powder is mistakenly identified with extract. This bottle does not state `extract' and it is not an extract. If you are used to using stevia in cooking this will frustrate you - as it is not the typical sweet of extracts I've experienced. One benefit is there is very little after taste at all - so that is a plus. The store brand envelopes made for Sam's Club are stronger in sweetness and very little after taste too. I can't remember if the Sam's brand states `extract' or not, and don't have an envelope handy. The problem using envelopes in cooking is a pain. Stevia characteristically does not pour easy and is sensitive to humidity. This brand also pours easier than extracts. I think that will be the `new' marketing tool in the growth of stevia use will be similar to this product, the white powder associated with extract powder, there is less aftertaste than most extracts and it flows easier. But it is not the typical amazing sweet that comes with extract stevia powders.

review/summary: Add some blue agave nectar and the stevia is fine.
review/text: I've tried Stevia before and didn't like the aftertaste, but now I've been diagnosed as a Type II diabetic. I've been using Agave nectar, but then decided to make sure that it was the blue agave nectar (25 GI) and now I adding stevia to reduce the agave nectar I'm using. I totally love using agave nectar. Blue agave nectar is the lowest on the Glycemic Index (25) and with half to 3/4 of the sweetener being added to my coffee, chai, or tea. Great combination. Try it. I also use Silk creamer, and many times I make a Mayan Mocha with cocoa powder and cinnamon. YUMMY! I'm going to try adding cayenne pepper sometime. I also love margaritas. I've been making my own. I found a great inexpensive Reposado. I use the Partida Margarita recipe on their website. Four ingredients. Lime juice, water, agave nectar, and tequila. I use Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice and blue agave nectar to create a low GI version of a sweetened lime juice. I keep it in the refrigerator and then when I want a Margarita just add water and tequila. It makes a wonderful margarita. I still can't do this at mexican restaurants. I really dislike Splenda having added maltodextrin to sucralose (150 GI). Splenda (sucralose) was a great product (the baking version). [...]. I swear that the food industry is trying to make more diabetics. Get rid of the high fructose corn syrup.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting chocolate mints
review/text: On a recent trip to Norway, I bought a few containers of Nestle chocolate mini mints and loved them. Not being able to find the same product in the U.S., I bought a 12 pack of Irony mints on Amazon. They are not as flavorful as the Nestle but I do like them. Chocoholics probably won't be satisfied but I am.

review/summary: My favorite BBQ sauce at Dave's...now appearing in my fridge!
review/text: Of all five types of sauces offered at the table when you visit a Famous Dave's, this one's my favorite.  If you like your BBQ sauces sweet, then this is right up your alley.  While crossing the US last year, I found grocery stores in both New Mexico and Iowa carried Famous Dave's sauces on their shelves, but sadly, I haven't found that to be the case in Massachusetts.  Amazon to the rescue!  Now I can enjoy my Sweet & Zesty for the roughly the same price I'd pay for in a grocery store.

Moroccan Mint is THE best tea I've ever tried from any maker.  While not therapeutic, it is very welcome any time of day from that first cup in the morning to the relaxing last hour of the day.  That's why I subscribed to auto ship- so that I won't have to be without.

review/summary: Belly Fat??
review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

The tea is not organic, no really high points, no really bad points... again... average. The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.

review/summary: delicious.
review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/summary: Lemongrass and Mint
review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

review/summary: Unpleasant Grassy Taste
review/text: I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

It's not like drinking a mojito- but with a fresh slice of lime and some sugar, it's pretty darned good.  I drink it how, but the other reviewer suggested it over ice.  That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot.

The mint isn't harsh- which is what I like about moroccan mint.  And if you add lemon to it (and I add a little German rock sugar) it's just amazingly good.  The new Mojito mint by Stash is also great.  I don't like it quite as much as this one, but I drink a ton of tea, and have about 5 favorites- and this and the Mojito are definitely two of the 5 (I also love the Stash organic Chai)

review/summary: ITS ALL NATURAL AND IT TASTE LIKE IT....VERY HEALTHY THOUGH..
review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

review/text: I have tried many types of tea - from "the scoop your own, tea-shoppe, imports" to the "waiter swears this is the greatest one ever" - and never did I expect to find my favorite, bar none, in this simple unassuming little box. I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey.

review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Every year, my grandmother would receive packages of tea from her relatives in Japan - she would pass a package or two to my mother - I loved the smell and taste when my mother would make a pot of tea with the tea - when my grandmother passed away, the tea packages stopped coming - so when I saw this Stash Premium green/white tea bags, I was excited - I decided to order it through the Subscribe & Save program and am happy I did - I'm cutting back on coffee and find this tea fills the need for a hot beverage in the morning

review/summary: This green tea is for me....
review/text: I would, by no means, consider myself a green tea expert, but, I definitely appreciate its place in my life, and as part of my morning breakfast ritual. I find that I feel the antioxidants percolate in my head. What's more, I actually am one of those weird people who like how bitter it tastes, when you've brewed it to its full potential. Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint, in the antioxidant factor. What's more, there is a wonderful smoky quality, too. Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas, and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water......

review/text: We must have this tea now...keep a pitcher in the fridge at all times. It is a great way to get your green tea in everyday, and is refreshing with a heavy meal.

review/summary: Just What I Wanted!
review/text: I was recently turned on to the health benefits of white tea, so I decided to try it out. Apparently, white tea doesn't have much flavor on it's own, which are why there are so many flavored whites. As a daily green tea drinker, I immediately thought this would be a good combo for me when I saw it. Stash is a very high-quality brand and you can tell by the taste of the tea. It has kind of a fresh, grassy (in a good way!) taste that is really distinct of high-quality teas. And now I can get the benefit of both green & white in the same cup. Yeah!

review/summary: Good tea
review/text: This is very good tea, in a nice "split" teabag.<br />What more can I say?  Jasmine green tea, sweetened with a little stevia, is a wonderful drink.

review/summary: On second thought...
review/text: One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I "brew" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~

review/summary: Delightfully healthy!
review/text: This tea is just so so so so so so so goooddddd!!! Can't have enough of it. Bought it last evening and had a cup of it and was raving all through the entire cup. Today, I had two cups and I felt like I wanted to have more. This tea has no sugar (read up its nutritional info on net). I am a mint lover and I love mint in everything. But here, the mint is not overpowering (as other reviewers say) but it has been given a good balance. I add half a tsp of Natural 'Sugar in the Raw' (it has only 2g of sugar) to give a lil' more sweetness to this tea, and its OUTSTANDING!!!!! Highly recommended. I am going to order the 6-pack version from Amazon soon after my current box empties itself.

review/summary: The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.
review/text: The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).
