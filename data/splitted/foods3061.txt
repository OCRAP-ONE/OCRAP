review/summary: Delicate flavor, my favorite chai!
review/text: I drink a lot of chai, and while I switch between a few brands for variety, this one is definitely my favorite. Delicate balance of spices with notes of clove, this is a great tea if you like subtle flavor. Good with or without soy milk or milk, flavorful enough to stand alone without much sweetner, if any. The price in amazon is very good, much cheaper than what I pay buying individual boxes at my local market.

review/summary: Two Leaves and Blah
review/text: I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea.  I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try.  I have to say I am totally disappointed.<br /><br />No real flavor what so ever.  I was expecting a Chai Tea with a little bit of bite and I got quite a bit of nothing.  The description written up by the manufacture made the tea sound wonderful.  Again the 5 stars by the reviews sold me, the taste did not.<br /><br />I would never recommend this tea to anyone, and as for me I'm sticking with Tazo.

review/text: These are quite tasty--soy sauce flavored but not too salty, which is misleading since it does contain plenty of salt( you probably shouldn't finish all of the soup, for health reasons).  Another problem with these instant ramen is the lack of an expiration date on the package---I ordered Myojo's yakisoba along w/ this and had to throw most of it away.

review/summary: Salt for Today and Till Noon Tomorrow
review/text: I bought these on advice of a few other sites, aka why I would pay $2.60 for a bag of ramen noodles.  Starting with the bad, they contain 130% of daily recommended dose of salt, as well as: MSG, High Fructose Syrup and a ton of other industrial ingredients.  But, then again who eats packaged ramen for its health benefits...  They are really only Noodles, Broth and Oil with a very few little onion flakes, not the big chunks of vegetables or tofu some packs come with.  With all that said, they taste really good.  The broth has a very good flavor and surprisingly isn't supper salty.  The noodles themselves where good but didn't stand out as better then most quality fried noodles.<br />Because of the salt and the cost, I doubt I would buy them again, however I can't complain about trying them as they tasted great.

review/summary: Patak's Biryani paste
review/text: British friends of ours who are nuts about curries put us on to Patak's curry pastes. I thought it would be difficult to find in the US but voila, Amazon has it. Start by sauteing diced onion, add other ingredients such as garlic, red pepper, tomato paste, whatever to your taste. Then add a tablespoon or more of Patak curry paste. They come in different intensities and levels of heat with the Biryani on the lower end of the hotness spectrum.  "Mild" is less hot.  Madras is hotter, Vindaloo hotter still and then they have something they call "hot".  There you have it.  The secret shared by the Brits is to make the sauce a day ahead of time and let it sit and integrate in the fridge overnight. Next day, add veggies, chicken, lamb, whatever your choice might be and cook on the stovetop or in the oven then serve with potatoes or basmati rice and condiments such as raisins, coconut, pine nuts, and of course chutney. That's it. They swear by Patak -- why make your own curry sauce from all those spices and ingredients when Patak's done it for you?

review/summary: Sugar-Free Gumballs
review/text: These gumballs are colorful, and a nice size to go in a gumball bank Santa brought my daughter for Christmas.  I like that they are sugarless, but the reason for the 3 stars is because though they taste sweet at first, the sweetness and flavor only lasts a minute at most.  Every sugar-free gum and bubble gum I have ever bought no matter the brand, the sweetness/flavor lasted much longer than regular sugared gums.  As soon as one of these gumballs is chewed up you want to spit it out because it no longer tastes good.  I just think that for the cost, the gum's flavor could have been developed to last much longer.  I must say though that they look very colorful in the gumball machine and looking at them makes you want to chew one.

review/text: The description on the 16oz Carousel-Sugarfree Gumball Refill Ordered from Candy Crate Inc. reads it contains a qty. of 900 gumballs. This is a lie- when you recieve this product there are only 114 servings in a bag and the serving size is considered 2 gumballs- this is a total of only 228 gumballs. To get the quantity they are claiming you would actually have to purchase about 4 bags. The gumballs themselves are fine, but beware of the fake description. Hard to write a good review when I feel a little ripped off. When purchasing online all we have to go by are the descriptions - if they are not accurate what can we base our purchase on?

review/summary: Multicolored, but not multiflavored
review/text: I bought a Jr Carousel gumball machine for my fiance's birthday, and with it 3 pounds of .6 inch sugar-free gumballs. The Jr Carousel Gumball machine is nice, but I am here to review the gumballs. They seem to be lacking in the flavor department, and are also pricey. Yes, they are very sweet, but they don't have very much in terms of actual flavor. All you get is the artificial sweetness. The intense taste does not last long, but this is true with all gumballs, sugar free or not. Most commercial gumballs are brightly colored and each color gumball has a different flavor; the surprise of getting a different flavor experience every time is part of the allure of putting quarters into the gumball machine. Not so with the Carousel Sugarfree gumballs: while the Carousel sugar free gumballs contain a variety of bright colors, I have yet to detect any difference in flavor between say a pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or white gumball. No assorted fruits or mints, the only flavor present in these gumballs is simply the sugar-free sweet. While they do taste good, they lose their flavor quickly and get a little boring after a while.

review/text: I'm frequently on the go trying to make it to class or work or a meeting and sometimes I forget to make breakfast because I'm so busy. This just leads me to have a grumbling stomach later in the day or too tired to pay attention when it's really important. These oatmeal packets give me no excuse when it comes to having breakfast. I place around 1.5 - 2 packets in a thermos with some hot water and extra cinnamon (I have a sweet tooth) and I'm on my way. I sometimes add fruit slices as well. It super easy and best of all is that I'm not hungry until lunch. I also really like the apple and cinnamon product because there are tiny apple chunks in it, which add exceptional flavor to this seemingly bland meal. Lastly, as a New York City resident, Amazon's price cannot be beat. My local markets charge over $4.00 for one box of this oatmeal (when not on sale).

review/text: Okay, I don't EVER buy instant oatmeal like this, we buy bulk organic quick oats and add brown sugar.  I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better.  But this Quaker Cinnamon and Spice is a real winner.  I don't usually eat anything with more than 9 grams of sugar per serving in it so this is a bit higher than that, but then again I've never measured how much brown sugar I add on my own, so for all I know I am probably getting less sugar eating this Quaker stuff.  I was surprised at how relatively clean the ingredient list is too.  I really love the flavor on this oatmeal and I find it sweet enough that I am not at all compelled to add more sugar.  Definitely recommend this stuff.

Luckily in my area they usually have really good sales on them. My local Safeway just ran a buy 1 get 1 free sale at 3.39 per box, so I was able to get 2 boxes for under 4.00. They usually sell them in the area for 2.50, but they I usually stock up when they are on sale.

review/summary: Perfect quick breakfast option for kids and apple lovers
review/text: I usually buy the huge variety boxes with multiple flavors for myself. Whenever my kids see me eating oatmeal, they always want a bowl for themselves. As it turns out, this is one of their favorite flavors. Apples and cinnamon is one of the flavors that we all agree on.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- It's not the same as the non-instant version but it's close enough and it's a lot less work. I can make it in less than a minute.<br /><br />- You can "adjust" how intense the flavor is by adding more water or milk. I always use milk since I think it not only tastes better but also provides a little more nutrition in the meal.<br /><br />- I love how I can buy all one flavor. We went through the last case (40 packets!) in a few short months.<br /><br />- Perfectly portioned for an adult snack as well.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- If you're looking for authentic oatmeal with no artificial flavors, pass on this.<br /><br />- Since this is slightly sweeter than regular oatmeal, by adding more water or milk to offset the flavor, you will dilute the product and lose some thickness.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />It's instant oatmeal! It's exactly what I expect: a quick, tasty, and inexpensive way to eat oatmeal.

review/summary: Turkey Broth Concentrate
review/text: Our family enjoys turkey all year long.  It is almost impossible to find turkey bouillon these days, even around Thanksgiving.  After months of searching the internet I happily came upon Savory Choice Turkey Broth Concentrate.  It is absolutely wonderful. My Turkey Meatballs with gravy were a big hit at the neighborhood New Year's Eve party. Some might think that chicken broth, bouillon, or flavorings are adequate substitutes.  But let me assure you there is nothing like the warm, rich, authentic flavor of turkey that truly enhances the dish. Savory Choice Turkey Broth Concentrate is so delicious.  I'm so glad to have finally found exactly what I was looking for. Try it, you won't be disappointed.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L1MOOW">Savory Choice Turkey Broth Concentrate, 5.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>

And much cheaper that it used to be a Whole Foods, which by the way, does not carry anymore in my neighborhood.  Thank you amazon.com!

This is probably the best turkey broth you can get and what's great is that since it's a concentrate, you can just use however many packets you need and save the rest for later.  I thought a pack of 4 would be a lot, but I used 2 boxes for thanksgiving. I will save the other two for turkey pot pie and extra gravy for more thanksgiving leftovers.

review/text: The combination of excellent flavor and compact packaging is a real winner!  Unlike jarred concentrates, this does not leak or ooze in transit.  Also it does not require refrigerator space once opened, as each packet is separate.  The liquid squeezes out of the packets fairly easily, but it takes a bit of effort to get the last drop.  I've used it in soups and rice so far, and make sure to wait to add extra salt until after adding the broth concentrate.

review/text: This is a wonderful tasting turkey broth that is so convenient. It is very shelf stable so it's handy to keep around, the packaging takes up little room in a small kitchen. It will be great in stuffing and gravy and will save me the time of always having to make stock before having turkey, which I always do. As soon as it arrived I put a cup of water into the microwave to boil and then added the contents of the little packet to the water, the taste was more than I expected from a convenience product. With the addition of some fresh herbs, turkey drippings and flour, you'll be having everyone at the table thinking you're a gourmet chef! I'll be adding a few packs to the stock I make from the turkey carcass this year, it will only help intensify that great turkey flavor. I'll order this again in the future but for right now the amount I have on hand should last quite a while.

review/text: Good powdered creamer but geez Nestle ... have you heard all the negative buzz about hydrogenated oils?  While everyone is moving away from this toxic stuff it seems the Nestle execs are asleep at the switch.  As for D&B Nutrition who is selling this through Amazon - have you found someone actually willing to pay this price?  This 50 oz container sells for $5.99 ($4.99 with an often available coupon) at the big box stores.  How could this seller possibly think someone would pay 4x the price for the same size?  Why bother listing the item for sale at all at this price?<br />I love Amazon but I do wish they would remove 3rd party selling items priced such that they are little more then a waste of space and insult to the shopper.

review/summary: Amish Butter - yum, yum!
review/text: I first tried it in a now defunct specialty supermarket in the Pittsburgh area and was instantly hooked. The only butter that comes close to it in flavor is Cabot butter (no longer sold at retail) or imported Irish butter. Great on artisanal breads, rolls, Challah bread, italian bread or rolls, pasta, maple or cinammon rolls, pancakes, cookies, icing - or on any food or vegetable (especially asparagus, mushrooms or swiss chard!) where the flavor of butter enhances the taste. You will need to adjust the salt in your recipe if it calls for unsalted butter and you are using this one instead.<br /><br />One must be selective however. The roll butter is more flavorful than the 1 lb block which is more flavorful than the 1 lb sticks. And, certain times of the year the roll butter is very, very salty. I have not experienced this color/taste change with the blocks or the sticks. The saltier rolls are usually distinguished by an obviously darker yellow color. When purchasing on line or by phone ask for the lighter yellow color for the best, freshest flavor.<br /><br />All of these are available from their website ([....]) which is currently under construction. This is the 'butter of choice' for all of my holiday baking and cooking.  It freezes/thaws very well so, you can stock up over the summer months. Just wrap it in plastic wrap and foil first to keep out the odors of other foods and put it in the coldest part of your freezer. Their cheddar cheeses are wonderful as well...

review/summary: Outstanding, intense dairy flavor; too salty
review/text: This outstanding butter has an intense dairy flavor that spreads and intensifies on the tongue.  The taste is a revelation.  I've tasted some good dairy butter, but this is the best.  It will improve anything you put it in or on, from baked goods to ordinary toast and rolls.  I also like to saute vegetables such as brussels sprouts in it.<br /><br />It spreads smoothly even when slightly cold, which is a hallmark of excellent pasture-raised dairy (the fats in milk from grass-fed cows melt at a lower temperature, making the butter more spreadable).  The deep yellow color is also an indicator of a high-quality grass-grown product.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that this butter is way too heavily salted.  This is not a flaw of the butter itself, of course, but the makers do definitely need to use a lighter hand with the salt.<br /><br />The flavor of the butter is simply outstanding, so the heavy-salt approach is unnecessary to boost flavor as with lower-quality foodstuffs.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the oversalted quality.

review/text: This is the best butter in the world.  I don't know what they do to it!  I ran out and really want some now, but because it is summer and butter is perishable, the shipping charges are for overnight shipping and are therefore sky high.  Guess I'll have to wait awhile.

review/summary: Best butter I've ever tasted!!
review/text: The Amish roll butter is the best I've ever had.  It's great on toast, bagels and rolls; it's even better on a baked potato.<br /><br />Fortunately, I can buy it in a grocery store (County Market) in Punxsutawney, Pa. where there's a large Amish community.

review/summary: Heavenly Butter
review/text: This is great butter with a very natural taste. It is good value for money, considering I cut off what I want, and keep the rest in the freezer. I tried a side by side taste test with the popular Land O Lakes brand, and although this one might be a tiny bit richer in taste (it was barely discernible if there at all) they are identical in color. I love this, but if you want butter that rocks your world, KerryGold Butter from Ireland is the best thing on the planet. It is like no other. It is available here on Amazon, from a market in New York. Next time, I will spend my money on KerryGold.

review/summary: Watery and strange banana flavor
review/text: I was excited to get these syrups, as I have tried other brands in the past and was disappointed with the strength of the flavor. I like a strong flavor without having to add too much syrup, as too much makes the drink too sweet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the most watery syrups I have tried to date. They are only marginally thicker than water. Also, all the syrups have a strange banana-like smell. The pumpkin pie syrup specifically smells like artificial banana candies, while the other two, even the peppermint, have a distinct if secondary banana smell.<br /><br />They don't taste any different from their stated flavors, but the smell is somewhat overwhelming. Also, in order to achieve the desired flavor, I had to add so much syrup that the drink was way too sweet to drink. I was really hoping to be able to make my own coffee shop lattes, but these syrups simply do not have the strength or flavor to do the job. A dash of cinnamon adds more flavor than a few pumps of these.

review/summary: Good Sugar-free taste!!
review/text: This syrup is a good way to add flavor to your coffee or drink.  Sweetened with Splenda gives it the extra sweetness without the heavy sugar.  I have tried several flavors, and some have a strong distinct taste while others have a weak taste and require a good amount added to strong coffee to taste them.  If you like flavored coffee, use this syrup along with an identical flavored cream for that great latte taste.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WNGPD6">Da Vinci Sugar Free Pumpkin Pie Syrup, 750 ml</a>

review/summary: Crunchy, flavorful, large halves that aren't broken
review/text: Purchased four types of nuts from Bergin simultaneously to make large batch of trail mix for several of my brothers who frequently hike/mountain bike with a group. I do the easy work by making their trail mix; they do the hard work - the hiking and biking!<br /><br />First time purchase of these Bergin pecans, filberts (hazelnuts) and cashews; second attempt at their almonds. (First purchase of Bergin almonds was horrible; stale, sticky, gummy & chewy even though the 'flavor' seemed ok. They were just terrible. But that was months ago so I thought I give it another try).<br /><br />So far, the pecans, almonds (this time around) and the filberts are terrifically yummy. It is the cashews this time that are useless. Waste of money. All packages were sealed by folded over cellophane bags (like those cheap, holiday treat bags) and closed with an adhesive label listing nutritional values. Could not determine reason for stale cashews, but then again, I couldn't determine reason for stale almonds months ago either.<br /><br />So, some good; some not so good. Unsure if I'd purchase from this company again, even if on sale. Guess it is the luck of the draw.

review/summary: Excellent Product - been using this for years!
review/text: Titanium Dioxide is a very common food additive which is used as a white pigment. It's naturally occurring and about 4 million tons are consumed per year worldwide. The only research on it as a possible carcinogen deal with it being INHALED (breathed in), not ingested (swallowed) in plants which manufacture it, where workers are exposed to hundreds of thousands of times more material than what exists in food. I guess someone was too busy oiling their skin up to visit Wikipedia. :)<br /><br />As far as the pill itself, cut one open and you'll find exactly what you paid for - a little coconut meat and a lot of oil. I'm not real crazy about coconut, so being able to swallow a softgel pill is a lot easier for me.<br /><br />I've been using this product for years, and I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Great diet aid
review/text: I've been using coconut oil supplements to help my post-baby weight loss diet and I really feel like it's helped. Especially for those meals where my will power fails and my family is dying to eat out and I eat a little less than as healthy as I want. Usually I would put a little bit of weight back on after those episodes but with the coconut oil the fat doesn't hang out in my body and my weight stays the same. Also my hair looks and feels wonderful and my skin is softer. I take two with lunch and two with dinner rather than four at once also. Great product! Sometimes these types of pills smell or taste funky before you can swallow them or give me some indigestion. But not these. The pills are pretty large though.

review/summary: AVOID THIS - EAT COCONUT OIL!
review/text: This is the biggest waste of money and scam I have seen in a long time. Raw, organic coconut oil is definitely one of the healthiest additions you can make to your diet. (Ignore the claims that because it has saturated fat it must be bad for your heart - WRONG! Not all saturated fats are bad and coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids which means the fat gets converted in your liver into energy and is not stored by the body nor will it clog your arteries.) Anyway, in order to reap the benefits of this wonderful oil you need to eat about 2 -3 tablespoons a day, starting with 1 and working your way up.  Guess how many of these pill you need to take in order to accomplish that feat? Something like 40!!  Have fun swallowing that many pills and just think about all the yucky gelatin you will be consuming that comprises the coating of these things!  You are much better off purchasing raw, organic coconut oil and mixing it your oatmeal or drinks.  Use it for cooking and throw away every other oil you have in your kitchen, except olive oil, and you will be on your way to better health.  Research the benefits of raw organic coconut oil online and you will see that I am right about this.

review/text: I bought these to take by mouth, but after seeing the thick covering decided I didn't want to ingest that material--then decided to use the oil inside the capsule on my skin.  When cutting a small hole and squeezing out the oil, I noticed a small pellet that wouldn't melt on my skin in almost all the capsules.  Not sure what that material is, but am glad that I decided not to take them internally.<br />Also after doing some reading on Titanium Dioxide (listed as an ingredient)found that it is "Classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans" by IARC.  Now I plan to stop using it on my skin and throw away the rest of the bottle--should've done my research before buying.

review/summary: Not just for espresso
review/text: Getting good coffee beans in Japan involves paying a lot of dough and quality is inconsistent. Luckily I found a source of these Starbucks Espresso Roast whole beans, and am enjoying it as my morning pick-me-up. Ground and brewed in a normal drip filter brewer, it is a bit "darker" tasting than a French roast, tastes like an Italian roast (not surprisingly), and has plenty of body that stands up to the milk. I don't find it especially bitter and certainly not over-roasted. Beans are small, uniform, shiny, and grind easily and evenly. I might not know much about coffee but I know I like this stuff, especially at 1/4 the price of the locally-roasted coffee beans.
