review/summary: Do not take running
review/text: I would have expected more from Cytomax. I was looking for a drink I could use while running and this failed horribly. Even though this drink is meant to be taken during a workout, there's no way you can take it running. It foams up to the point where you can't drink it. Don't waste your money, stick to water and gel packs.

review/summary: Dissatisfied with New ACS Additive
review/text: Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Grape!
review/text: First I have to say that I have tried many products before Cytomax. But coming out of the gate, it was hands down a good value and a product that could keep me going for hours on my bicycle. I ride around 3500-4000 miles a year, and that isn't always easy at my age. I found this product kept me going throughout the ride and also helps with leg pains more than any other product I have tried. This summer I went on a 100 mile charity ride in 90 degree southern US temperatures and I was amazed at how well I felt at the end of the ride. My long quest for an energy supplement is done. I am about to order my third 4.5 pd jug of Cytomax. I prefer the grape above the other two I have tried (Lemonade, Tropical). I smell the grape before I drink and it makes me smile I think. I certainly drink more water because I enjoy the flavor and anything that helps to remind you to drink more while on the road is a good thing. One last thing that makes Cytomax a good value is that you can dilute the product on the not so hot days, like below 80, when you do not sweat as much. Thereby saving 50% costs of the product and still feel energized. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Love Cytomax
review/text: I've been using Cytomax for a very long time now and still love it.  I mainly use it for weightlifting and it keeps my hydrated and reducing lactic acid burn to allow for a better workout.  The taste of the different flavors is good enough since you're not using this for taste.  By no means is it bad or just tolerable, but if you want taste go for the more mainstream products out there (Gatorade).  I highly recommend this for weight training as it makes a significant different for me.

I tried numerous remedies including magnesium pills, potassium pills, bananas, other sports drinks, etc.  Since I started using Cytomax I have not gotten cramps, so now I use it all the time.  I've tried many flavors and like the Pomegranate Berry the best, not too sweet.

review/summary: Just try it- you'll never work out agian with out it!!
review/text: I tried this stuff oh 15 years ago when I was hiking, biking, climbing, anything outdoors all the time. I thought it was a great way to stay hydrated and avoid the soreness the day after a good work out.<br /><br />But now that I am in my mid 30's and 5 kids later...I HAVE TO HAVE it!! I make a bowl of oatmeal (using water) before my rides 3 x's a week and instead of adding more water or milk I just put a squirt of the lime citrus in with my water bottle (that is going with me on my ride) and enjoy my pre work out snack. Then I drink it on my 20 mile ride and I have yet to be sore. Not that my muscles aren't "tight" I can tell that I took on some hills, but not sore so I can't use my legs the next day.<br /><br />Just try it. You can always send it back, but if you are serious about working out, sweating, pushing past the burn and tired of FEELING the burn the next day. Just get some. YOu'll be a lifer like me!<br /><br />I ran a relay race last year with 11 other woman who I have hooked on the stuff. Yeah. 11 new Cytomax groupies:)<br /><br />I mix up two scoops in my 24 oz water bottle every ride. I don't like it cold, but my sister (who like the pomegrante something) likes it chilled. To each their own.  Read up on it. It's gooooood stuff and this is the best price I've found for the 4.5 lbs size!<br /><br />Enjoy your work out!!

review/summary: Fantastic healthy natural alternative to typical store-bought pudding mixes
review/text: My family and I discovered this years ago via a natural foods buying club when it was first introduced.  Once the kids were grown, we got away from buying it.  However, I decided recently to see if it was still available, and was thrilled to find Mori-Nu still made it.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with tofu or got turned off by it previously, try a packet of this with a package of tofu.  Unless you're a "super sweet foods" sort of person, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />BTW, Mori-Nu's own product works the best because it comes out the smoothest with the least blending.  However, other brands will work.  You just have to blend it longer.  You may also want to experiment with the amount of liquid you use per batch.  The recommended amount seems to work fine with Mori-Nu tofu, but you'll probably find you need to add more liquid with other tofu.

review/summary: Pleasant tea
review/text: I was first offered this tea at a conference.  I don't typically drink fruity teas but I was in a blueberry mood and decied to go with it.  When you open the tea bag, the scent of blueberries is very noticeable.  I prefer to avoid sweeteners (artificial and real) in my tea and this is a tea that is easily consumed without sugar or honey.  It is simple and unfussy.  The flavor notes are clear.  I've since purchased this tea a few times and find it to be a great breakfast tea.<br /><br />The description on the tea bag indicates a "delicate flavor" and I would say that is an apt statement.  The blueberry flavor is subtle but certainly present.  As it is billed as a "green tea with blueberry", I didn't expect the blueberry flavoring to be much more than it is. If it had been marketed as just a blueberry tea, I would be disappointed.  I don't think Bigelow makes this out to be more than what it is.<br /><br />This is a gluten- free product that is blended and packaged in the United States.

review/text: I haven't got mine yet, as I just ordered it.  But I am a huge fan of the Peach Green Tea from Bigelow.  That stuff is remarkable, it is simply green tea with real peach granules. That's it. No herbs.  No flowers.  No plants... ;  Just green tea and real peach!<br />I've heard people comment that the peach scent is so strong that you can smell it across a room.<br /><br />So I'm hoping that the Blueberry will be the same.  I've never really been disappointed by anything that I've tried from Bigelow, so I'm pretty hopeful.  If the Blueberry isn't that overpowering, that might be okay.  Blueberry can be really strong in flavor, so maybe the folks at Bigelow were just playing it safe - I dunno.<br /><br />But I'm looking forward to trying it soon.

review/summary: Extremely delicious, but not safe for Gluten Sensitive People
review/text: I was previously on a Sweet and Salty Caramel Bugles kick, when I decided to try these. My mom asked me why I was eating the caramel ones, because the package states "may contain wheat", but they were so good, I continued. The Chocolate and Peanut Butter Bugles are truly delicious! I could go through an entire bag in one sitting, if I didn't start itching halfway through the bag, due to the wheat, and my Gluten Sensitivity. Before becoming Gluten Sensitive last year, I devoured the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chex mix. If you like that, you will love these Bugles. They are so very good! Unfortunately, they do contain wheat, so if you are Gluten Sensitive, they will not work for you :-( I kept eating them, telling myself the itching wasn't that bad, but once I started itching within an hour of eating them, I had to accept they were not worth it. I highly recommend them to anyone and everyone who enjoys the combo of Chocolate and Peanut Butter.

review/text: I like Bugles, but I didn't like the overall result with this particular version.  I was put off by the rather icky pasty coating of chocolate and peanut butter that covers each Bugle piece.  I thought it detracted from the Bugle flavor and texture, and that the Bugle part detracted from the chocolate and peanut butter flavors (which are not that great to begin with in this product).  They don't taste bad, but the overall effect is sort of limp and rather off-putting, even in the appearance.

They are seriously the perfect PMS cliche food.<br /><br />Make sure you put the amount you WANT to eat in a bowl or cup and then put the rest back in the pantry or else you will be left with and empty bag and a stomach ache ;)<br /><br />FYI: I found these at the dollar store for a buck each.

review/summary: My favorite hot sauce.
review/text: I first had this sauce on honeymoon with my wife in Belize. There, it's on the table of every every restaurant, and with good reason, it's great! It's a little sour/salty, with just enough heat (and, as far as I can tell, not even a hint of bus station). I like it on eggs, and it goes well with beans and rice. No one shares the same taste, but this really is the authentic flavor of Belize. If you like Caribbean food, do yourself a favor, and check this out.

It's nice and spicy, enhances the flavor of the food, adds a good amount of heat, and the flavor isn't overpowering the way Tabasco sauce.  If you're not used to spicy food, I recommend trying just a drop at first, it's pretty potent. Love this sauce!

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

review/summary: BEST DOG FOOD FOR YOUNG AND OLDER DOGS
review/text: was in line at Petsmart and the man in front of me was buying Bil Jac dog food. That was about 6 years ago. I asked him about it because I had never heard of it. He happened to be a Scientist who had been on a dog food study team and said it was the best of all they rated. I have 12 toy poodles ( I use to breed them) and this dog food they all loved immediately. The best part is it is the only small kibble I have found that isn't so hard. I have tried so many of the more expensive, better brands and they always turned their noses up at it, but would eventually, reluctantly, eat it. Bil Jac crumbles more easily for these little guys. For Picky eaters as well. It works well with dogs who have teeth problems and older dogs as well as it does not hurt their teeth to break the kibble. In a pinch I have had to buy other food for them and they never like it. The other kind I had to soak in water before feeding them because it was so hard. I promise your dogs will love this food and it's so good for them too. I have always let my dogs "graze" ( I am a big believer of that) and leave food down all the time and they never over eat with this or get fat. Normal BM's too. Can't say enough good stuff about this dog food. Once your dog gets a taste of this, they will never want another brand! Oh, it is for big dogs too!

review/text: I still really, really enjoy the McCann's steel-cut oats so much (see earlier review) that I decided to order the six, large 72-ounce containers this time.  The packaging is not adequate for the weight of the oats.  The cardboard tubes crushed in shipping, forcing the seals and plastic lids to come off, so I had a box of half-filled containers and oats strewn all over the shipping box.  I called Amazon to report the problem, and they replaced the order (which I really appreciated their doing, since it was a grocery product that is not returnable in normal circulstances)...and, sadly, the second order came in the same crushed, disheveled condition.  I salvaged the oats left in the containers from the two orders, so feel like my order has been fulfilled with something I can use...but won't be ordering in this size anymore.

review/summary: Slowly Smoked Pork is Delicious
review/text: I buy Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin regularly at our local Hungarian grocer, and have found it delicious. It serves well as a quick snack, or as a sandwich fixing (with a little mustard or light BBQ sauce).<br /><br />Imagine the aroma of a nearby campfire, after pork has lingered on the grill, but not burnt. Somehow, that flavor, through careful smoking and salting, is infused into the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />I prefer it in thin slices, eaten cool, but it is also an ingredient in various Hungarian soups. It goes well in a kind of pigs-in-a-blanket crescent roll wrap. Take an uncooked crescent roll, place a thin slice of the karaj, and bake as usual. Very fun for parties -- something different in the midst of something familiar. We serve it guests when we need a quick, tasty snack.<br /><br />It isn't spicy even though it is packed with taste. Fans of BBQ joints and smokehouse steakhouses with find the flavor familiar.<br /><br />It keeps around six months unopened. I fully recommend the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

review/text: I just tried this product for my two Brussels Griffons who enjoy pizzle sticks. I am always looking for a safe alternative to rawhide, and was reassured that these were safe. They turn out to be very hard and brittle, and my small dogs, both missing about  half of their teeth, ripped at them and within five minutes had created sharp hard splinter pieces. I grabbed everything away from them within five minutes of having given them the treats. It was due to luck, careful observation, and quick action that they did not swallow any of the sharp shards which ranged in size from 1/4 inch to 1 inch.

review/text: I got several packages of this and I will never order it again. I put in my pantry and a week later started to notice a sour smell in there. I could not pin point it but when I went to make soup that afternoon pulled out one of these and it was all moldy! The seal had broken in shipment and another had been leaking. It was a terrible mess, even the one that was still good and sealed tasted bland and I was afraid to use it.<br />What a waste of money.

review/text: Contrary to the name of the product, this is not herbal tea. The ingredients are black Tea, orange peel, cinnamon, natural flavor. It has no herbs in it at all. I can't take caffeine and, because of Amazon's return policy, I am stuck with a $[...] bag of tea I can't drink. The tea smells delicious and if you want an orange scented black tea it is probably really good.

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas. I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally. In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a healthy habit. I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects. Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aids focus, and the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right. The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value. I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first. I'm on my second box of 100 from Amazon, and having recently discovered this listing that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  Previously this was an $.08 per day, $.02 per cup habit, but now it could be a $.05 per day, $.01 per cup habit.  How many healthy habits are this affordable?

review/summary: Very Fishy Smell
review/text: This product wreaks of fish.  When I first opened the package I thought I'd made a mistake in ordering because Nori (seaweed) is a vegetable.  I had to look at the package again to make sure I had the correct order.  Since I wasn't using it for shushi, my solution was to place one Nori sheet in a bowl and pour boiling water over it and let it steep (like tea leaves) for a few minutes.  I strained off the boiling water, rinsed and repeated the process.  The smell began to disappear after the second rinse, but the Nori consistentcy changed the that of chopped spinach.  Didn't taste bad, but I'm afraid I boiled off most of the nutrients.  I will not buy this particular brand  again.

review/summary: Quality Control Problems - Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline Included
review/text: As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident. Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks. I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets. This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below. Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill. I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..............................2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..................................2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed)sticks...~3/12/2011<br />Ate three Ostrich sticks.........................3/19/2011...7:00 PM<br />Initial heart burn.................................3/19/2011...9:15 PM<br />Illness begins......................................3/19/2011...11:00 PM<br />Full blown food poisoning symptoms......3/20/2011...1:00 AM<br />Full recovery.......................................3/22/2011

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I am 81 years old and get very, very dehydrated. I do not like water; the<br />reccommended daily allowance makes me queasy.  I had t hought for years that<br />Gatorade was really only for athletes and those that excercised constantly.<br />Until one day I had to go an Urgent Care FAcility and was advised to drink as<br />much Gatorade as I could. I like the smooth way it goes down making it possible<br />for me to get as much liquid as I need to avoid dehydration.  I will always have<br />it on hand. Price is also very reasonable. One problem I have with this product<br />and it is not with Amazon in any shape or form. The original company that<br />packages the bottles themselves have the bottles connected with heavy plastic<br />that you have to cut off.  Problem is alot of elderly people have to drink<br />gatorade and some of them dont have the ease of their hands as they did way<br />back so you end up with hoping you dont cut yourself on the plastic and then<br />the knife and scissors you have to use to seperate the bottles. I can understand<br />the need for the plastic as they dont want the bottles rolling around in the<br />box but there must be some easier way for the company to package them.
