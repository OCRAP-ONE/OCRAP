review/summary: my puppy loves these!
review/text: My puppy absolutely loves these treats!  In the product listing, it claims they are a good alternative to rawhide chews.  I definitely don't agree with that, as these last nowhere near as long as a rawhide.  Nonetheless they are an excellent occasional treat.  My pup goes nuts when she sees me opening the bag and can barely contain her joy once she's chewing on it.<br /><br />I have a chihuahua/dachshund mix--so quite "petite"--but she's a vigorous chewer and can polish one of these off in about 10 minutes or less depending on how elated she is.  I usually only give her half of a chew, to make the bag last longer and since I think a whole one is a bit much for a dog that weighs less than 10 lbs!

review/summary: my puppies love them!
review/text: I recently got 2 west highland white terrier puppies. I love the nylabone company, but was worried about the regular nylabones, or getting them rawhides during their teething stage.  I came across these at Petsmart. I am very concerned about what goes into their bodies, I always read the ingriedient list. I was very pleased that they offer flavors like lamb and apple and turkey and sweet potato that are better for their digestive system than bacon flavor, or roast beef, etc.<br /><br />They are only 2 months old and teething like crazy. I love that they prefer these to my toes and fingers :) They gobble these things up. Which makes me wish they had these available in the larger sizes. Also, they leave tiny bits behind. Maybe my dogs just like to chew it and not eat the little bits. They are also easy to twist in half so if you have two dogs, they can share it, instead of fight over it! Great Product...But kind of expensive. Less than a dollar a piece for the non puppy healthy edibles, but over a dollar a piece for the puppy version. But it is cheaper than having to buy new furniture, cables or shoes!

They do not seem to upset her tummy at all either which is great.  They are a little pricey but that isn't really an issue when it comes to the happiness and well-being of our little pup! :)

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: I am a Chaga lover and was looking for a pure product to enjoy.  I stumbled upon this tea while looking for pure Chaga drops and decided to try a box. When it arrived I brewed a cup and noticed one tea bag was strong enough to easily make two cups of dark strong Chaga brew. If you have used the pure drops before you can tell that the tea is a rich deep color full of Chaga, a powerful antioxidant.  I have been enjoying Chaga in pure liquid form for years but now love the tea even more.  The price is right for me because I get 40 cups from 20 bags. It's also very versatile for me because I make iced tea and drink it throughout the day. A huge savings over the drops with the same amount of health benefits. My sister tried mine and had to have it, and so did my neighbor, so of course, I have already ordered several more.  The fast shipping and excellent communication from Sayan makes it an even sweeter deal.

I personally don't add any sugar to it, I think it tastes better by itself. Overall - great buy, would recommend to others - it works as advertised.

review/summary: Bland flavor compared to other Cannellini
review/text: I found these beans to be nothing special. I found their flavor to be boring and bland compared to the best of other Cannellini beans I've purchased in bulk from health food stores. On the positive side, the beans were big, plump, and fairly healthy (many had crosswise deep cracks, which was not good) and seemed fresh (purchased 12/2009 and had "best by" date of 9/2011). They cooked quickly, which is a sign of freshness, and they tasted fresh.<br /><br />But their flavor was bland; some nice mineral notes, but just not very "beany." There were also some slightly off earthy notes, which I did not care for. I also found their texture to be a bit grainy and not very creamy.<br /><br />I cooked them once with an overnight cold soak in a salt brine (as recommended by Cook's Illustrated to tenderize skins, which really works) and once with a one-hour hot soak in brine (Cook's Illustrated's recommended quick method). One time I cooked them on a very slow simmer to keep the beans whole (which does sacrifice some creaminess), and once at a strong simmer to let the bean skins break open to maximize creaminess. But even this latter method failed to make them creamy -- unlike most white beans. I cook lots of dry beans and have many years of experience cooking beans, so how these beans turned out had nothing to do with how I cooked them. The best of other white beans I've had cook up wonderfully creamy and flavorful. These beans were just far from the best.

Saute onions, bell pepper, plenty garlic in olive oil or coconut oil.  Let them carmelize...then follow the package directions.  I added one pound of smoked sausage (Cajun Style) and let the beans cook for nearly two hours.  Serve over brown rice.  Good enough for a company meal. This is an Amazon verified purchase.

We change the water and wash the rocks every Monday. Also I recommend rinsing off and rubbing the stalk down under running water to remove the small build up of slime. This will keep the water from stinking. I also recommended putting a drop of liquid food in every month or as needed to keep them nice and green. They do take some weekly maintenance but they will live a long time and look great. Hope this helps!

Try to buy stalks from your local garden nursery and I bet you wont find them even close to that price!

review/summary: Wonderful Flavor, Unsure of Manuka Properties
review/text: This honey doesn't have a UMF rating for some reason. New Zealand is strict about how manuka honey is labeled, and Comvita sells other honeys that do have a UMF rating, so I'm uncertain why this one is labeled "certified" and "active" without having an actual UMF number or certification anywhere on it. That being said, this is probably the best testing honey I've ever tasted. I love to spread it on toast, as several others here have mentioned, or mix it into hot tea (PG Tips, of course). I'm not sure if this has helped with my mild GERD, but some of the GERD issues I have seem lessened since I started regularly consuming this honey. I also tried it as a mask for my face and I didn't notice any particular improvement, but maybe my skin was in better shape than I realized. YMMV, of course. Regardless of its purported magical properties, the taste is incredibly delicious and this could be a staple in many pantries. My husband at first said it tasted "mediciny" to him, but later grew to love it it. To me it tastes like a spoonful of heaven.

If this product (Comvita Brand) is no longer available then it should not be on the website, and if this other product is a substitute, then it should be properly wrapped for shipping. I do want to say  though that each time I called, the customer service reps were very kind and helpful and tried to handle the problem immediately without any hesitation.  It is one of the many reasons why I continue to do business with Amazon.

review/summary: Really Nice Honey
review/text: This honey has a very nice taste. It arrived in a somewhat crystallized state (more like spreadable honey paste), probably because the weather here is quite cold. I'm sure it will liquify if I put the jar in warm water. It's great just the way it is. Not sure if it has any of the health benefits Manuka is known for but I would buy this honey again.

review/text: I love this stuff. At first, the taste left me with a funny face, but I got used to it and now crave it every morning. My aunt recommended it to me and she gives it to her kids for cold symptoms and allergies, and it works for them. I found that it helped clear up my face a bit, too. I can't promise it will do the same for you as various reviews can tell you, but I found my acne came down to a more controllable level, making it easier to maintain my few breakouts. The honey isn't a a solution for every cold, allergy, or acne breakout, but in my case, it certainly helps a lot.

review/text: I first learned about manuka honey in the form of a hand cream.  I recently purchased a jar of this honey at a time that I was starting to get a cold and was also suffering from another bout of acid reflux.  I got up in the middle of the night and had a spoonful and felt immediate relief in my throat.  When I lay back down I felt less and less heartburn.  (Tastes a lot better than apple cider vinegar too)  I am even keeping a jar of it at the office.  It's worth giving a try.

review/summary: Not Comvita but still Manuka - but so what?
review/text: For some reason the company doesn't have their name on the label but on the side it says it's "packed by Arataki for Pacific Resources International" and it does seem to be a large well-known respected company. I bought this at Whole Foods knowing nothing about Manuka honey but wanted to see what it would do about a burn on my hand. It did improve it very much and I was sold. So I read up about Manuka honey and went and bought Wedderspoon 16+. that was LESS effective than this jar. However, then I tried some local raw wildflower honey and it was just as effective as this, and tasted better, and was a lot cheaper...<br /><br />The NIH tested four types of raw honey. They found that Manuka did have a higher level of antibacterial properties, but it was not as high as something called mountain honey. They didn't specify which mountain and also didn't indicate the level of Manuka. Also, ALL honey clears skin blemishes. Manuka may be better for internal problems as stated - I don't know about that - but I'm sticking with the local raw stuff for $10 a jar. I think wildflower honey is the best because who knows where the manuka bees go anyway? They probably go all over the place unless they are confined.

review/summary: Not an Acne medication, not a health medication just something for the sweet tooth
review/text: I purchased this raw honey, in hopes that it will do wonders for my health and my blemished skin, but my hopes were set up too high.<br /><br />The raw honey does have a unique taste at first but after half way through the bottle, the taste gets annoying. It's not as tasteful as the honey that is sold on grocery stores. This one is more thick and therefore makes it VERY hard to spread around your waffles or pancakes.<br /><br />I read many reviews stating that this honey is good for your health. Well ever since taking it, nothing really changed at all. I've had this honey for months and no significant health improvement of any kind has happen.<br /><br />I was mostly aiming at the skin issues that I have. I heard honey is recommended as a mask to kill bacteria on the skin that could cause blemishes. So with all of the health benefits that this honey was said to have, I trusted that it would not only improve my health but also help fight my acne. Well it sure didn't do a single thing to change my skin condition. Just hours of annoying thick honey on my face. No blemish was stopped, no quickness in fading away the red spots and absolutely no skin improvement of any kind. My skin didn't feel cleaner at all nor did it glow or changed a single thing. A simple soap sure left me more satisfy than putting this on my face day after day in hopes that it would help.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a good product if you are just using it as a substitute for sugar. It has that sweet taste for the sweet tooth. It's thick but if you have time you could warm it up in the microwave or in something hot.<br />THIS IS NOT A HEALTH REMEDY OR ACNE FIGHTING TOOL!!!<br /><br />So if your planning on getting this to help fight acne, I would recommend spending that money for a product that at least labels it self with the ingredients to fight acne. This is just for the sweet tooth!

review/summary: Changed their preparation - consistency issues?
review/text: UPDATE (12/3/2011): The food in the last case that I bought was substantially different from previous cases. The pieces were much thicker and of a tougher consistency. Because of this, my cat was only licking up the gravy, picking at a few pieces, and leaving the rest in the dish. I don't know if it was more difficult to eat or less palatable, but I ended up having to donate the rest of the cans to an animal shelter. Because of the wide variation in preparation, I had to stop buying this food for Moxie.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: My cat goes crazy for this wet food. When he was younger (about 7 months ago), I tried to give him the same brand dry food supplemented with this wet food, but we had vomit problems with the wet food. When I re-introduced this wet food about a month ago because I was concerned about only giving him dry food, it was like night and day. He gobbles it all up every day, and there have been no vomit issues whatsoever. He knows that morning time is when he gets his morsels, and he sits in the middle of the kitchen and cries until I give it to him.<br /><br />I like that this food comes in larger chunks rather than tiny shredded pieces. It reduces the mess the cat makes in and around his bowl. I also like that there are few artificial ingredients, just like the same version dry food. The cans are only 3 ounces each, which is small if this were the only food you're feeding your cat, but for our purposes of half a can supplement a day, it's perfect. I just feed half a can and put the other half in the fridge for the next day.

review/text: I was excited to find the "old" formula of this cat food on Amazon (at least that is what the picture is of). It was my cat's favorite canned food. The company has recently changed their formula. I received my case, opened 5 cans of it for my cats, and they all sniffed it and walked away. That is when I noticed that it said new and improved formula in small writing at the top of the can. So now I am stuck with 19 cans of food that my cats won't eat.  And Amazon will not let me return this item.  Even though I received something that was different than the description/picture.

review/summary: Ingredients are Very Good, and My Cats Like It
review/text: I mostly feed Blue Buffalo, and my cats have done very well with it. With rare exceptions, Blue Buffalo is the only kibble that I feed to my cats. However, my cats appreciate some variety in canned food so I look around for different quality foods that I can rotate into their feeding regimen. Among the things that I look for in any cat food are primary ingredients consisting of poultry, fish or meat, and an absence of corn, soy, wheat, or gluten of any kind. Two of my cats just turned twenty-two, a third will be twenty-two in a month, and a fourth is ten years of age, so I include canned food in their diet twice a day, to ensure proper hydration. While I rotate between the various Blue Buffalo canned food choices, I add other quality canned food choices to the diet plan, as well. My cats are satisfied with the same kibble day after day, but they get bored with the same canned food more than a couple of days in a row.<br /><br />The Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Feline Formula in Gravy was well received by all four of my cats, and I am very pleased with its ingredients. The ingredient list is my first test, and if I don't like the ingredients, my cats never get to taste the food. I happen to know that there are some pretty bad cat foods on the market that my cats will nevertheless like the taste of, so I don't leave everything up to an animal that is unable to read the ingredient list. The first ingredients are as follows: Salmon, fish broth, chicken broth, chicken liver, chicken, dried egg white, ocean fish, peas, modified potato starch, natural flavor, roasted salmon...<br /><br />I am always curious about listed ingredients such as "natural flavor" - natural flavor of what? But that strange ingredient is listed tenth from the top, so there's probably not very much of whatever it is. Other than that, everything in the ingredient list is recognizable to me as being either a natural food, vitamin, mineral or other necessary ingredient.<br /><br />In summary, the ingredients are very good and my cats like the taste, so Taste of the Wild is a go in this family. It's not the only food that I'll feed them by any means, and Blue Buffalo will continue to be my staple, as far as kibble goes, but Taste of the Wild has earned its place in my canned food rotation.

review/summary: A Better Diet for Cats
review/text: i switched my 3 cats to this on the recommendation of someone who works for a vet.  Since she wasn't a vet herself, I did some online research and found that, indeed, high protein diets are better for cats.  I talked to my vet about the diet too and was assured that high protein diets do not cause kidney disease but they do exacerbate them once a cat has the disease.  Anytime you change an animal's food, it has to be done gradually over a several week period so their digestive system can adjust to it and their taste buds.  I highly recommend this cat food. I've been using it for almost a year now and my cats look forward to meal times.  They do like to eat the gravy first and I pamper them a little by mashing up the solid bits of food into the gravy.  All cats will prefer junk cat food to quality cat food; however, like children, it's important to work with them to get them to eat food that is nutritious and good for their overall health.  Taste of The Wild is an excellent choice for a healthy diet.

Unfortunately my cats do not like this food - only one will eat the canned food and this same cat will not eat the dry, and oddly enough, vice versa.  The other cat will eat the dry but not the canned.  I have also noticed that their coats are not as silky as they were with another brand, which I will be going back to. I am giving it 3 stars as it is a good holistic food and conveniently available, just is not something my cats like.

review/text: I have purchased cans of the old formula in the past, but my cats won't touch this stuff. They don't care for it at all, even if I mix it in other wet food they like. This new formula=no good.

review/summary: recent change in consistency and gravy
review/text: My cat has been eating Taste of the Wld wet food (Rocky mountain) since he was a kitten, he is a year old now. It is the ONLY wet food he wll eat.  I had no problems switching him over to the "new improved formula."  However, the trouble began with my last case of TOTW.  The minute I opened the first can, I noticed that there was less gravy, the meat chuncks were smaller and the color of the food was a lot lighter. I gave it to my cat, he sniffed it and than looked at me and meowed. I tried to feed it to him for three days and he would not touch it-he walked away every time and ate nothing but dry food which I hate feeding him.  I called the company and they asked for a can to test.  They found that the color was lighter but there were no other inconsistencies and still within specifications.  So I got another case from amazon hoping that it was just an "off" case and I got the same thing happened! Lighter in color, smaller, and less gravy-the lot numbers are different for each case but they're expiration date is 2014 so I think this is all coming from  a new batch.  I found a few cans at a pet store-the last four cans they had, all with 2013 expiration dates and my cat devoured them.  He will not touch this new batch.  I have no idea what to do, he will not eat anything else and there is definitely something different in this latest batch of food. Anyone else find this to be the case?

review/summary: Takes A While To Catch On
review/text: I feed my cats a variety of wet foods and they have kibble available at all times. I like to keep some Grain Free stuff in their diet to keep them healthey and happy, though it costs a bundle and they have to get some cheaper stuff so I can eat too. As always with the grain free food, I find that it takes several tries to get them to eat it. I do not know if it is the texture or the taste or what. But, generally, I go on one of my one or two night stayovers and when I do, I leave them several cans of Taste of the Wild as their ONLY option of wet food. They always have kibble available. When I return, the wet food is gone and after that, when it is offered in their rotation of foods, it is always eaten. I know it is great stuff and great for them, but they just have a hard time catching on. Maybe they are like me. I prefer Chocolate, which is not always the best. At any rate, I give this a 4 star rating only because it is difficult to get the cat children tuned into it. Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdon, Mercy and Yellow Kitty all recommend it, but say it your kitty is not "grain only" it may take a bit for them to warm up to it. Nonetheless, it is heathful and all should have a bit.

review/summary: They eat it!
review/text: My cats were having some digestive problems so my vet put them on a special diet which eliminated the canned food they would anxiously await every morning. My sister recommended Taste of the Wild to me, raving about the improvement in her cats' health since they started eating it. I haven't noticed any miracle changes in their behavior, but they look very healthy and happy, they have lots of energy, and unlike a bunch of other "healthy" canned foods, they eat it up. Plus I feel better feeding them food that isn't just full of rice and other unnatural fillers.

review/summary: No Cats Meow....
review/text: This taste of the wild mountain feline formula is available at the local Tractor Supply company here.  I usually get my cat food and bird seed there, and decided on my last trip to give my kitty a treat with something special.  It's expensive as wet cat food goes, but I figured how could I go wrong with something with a name like this and a lion on the can.  I picked up three of them.  Unfortunately, my cat was not impressed by the price, or the label, for she sure didn't care for it to say the least.  I was really surprised actually, for unless we're talking about the very cheapest store brand of wet food, she usually isn't all that finicky a cat.  But this stuff didn't cut it with her at all.  Even after giving it to her again a couple of days later, and then leaving it out.  I ended up giving it to my neighbor who has three cats.  They ate it, but according to my neighbor they didn't act like it was exactly fine cuisine either. They ended up eating about half of it over a couple of days. I realize that a test with only 4 cats isn't all that comprehensive, but the consensus was the same nonetheless.  None of them liked it.  I suggest if you favor the idea of this stuff that you either try your local Tractor Supply and buy just one can, or better yet, forget it.  For the price you pay and test results around here, in my opinion it's nothing more than overpriced substandard fare in a flashy can...

I can't stop eating it and the quantity of the product is more than I expected too. I will be munching on this up until the holidays. Thank you so much! i will definitely be ordering more in the future. The Popcorn Palace doesn't sell the cinnamon candied one anymore and I get it much cheaper through you, so I am very pleased and will be coming back for me. :)

review/text: Regardless of what item(s) you purchase from Giftree just know that their customer service is TOP NOTCH!!!!!! :) Sometimes that is more important than the actual contents of a gift basket or what it is your purchasing. Years ago I was paying close to nothing for my mobile phone service but when it came time to contact them it was a nightmare!!!! It didn't matter if I called them or went directly into the store, it was the same. Eventually I switched carriers and decided to pay a bit more for quality customer service.<br /><br />This particular gift basket was purchased as a gift for my husband and he loved it. (I was the one purchasing it and found some of the contents to be a bit "small" in quantity but after posting my original review Giftree responded right away and made good with a $50 Gift Card!!!!!)<br /><br />I will be doing alot more business with this company.

review/text: I have ordered this before and it is very good chana dal, but not as black as the Kabuli chana dal. The only problem is remembering that you have to soak it 12 hours before cooking, and that is MY problem, not the merchandiser's problem. This chana dal cooks up fine; here is my favorite recipe:<br /><br /> * 1 cup chana dal, soaked 12 hours and rinsed<br /> * One large onion, chopped<br /> * 4 cloves garlic (or more, to taste), minced or pressed<br /> * 2 tablespoons olive oil<br /> * 1 cup bulgur wheat<br /> * 2 cups hot chicken or vegetable broth (can use bullion)<br /> * 1 teaspoon salt (or less, to taste)<br />  *  1/4 t. cloves<br />  *  1/2 t. cinnamon<br /> *  1/4 cup finely chopped parsley or cilantro<br /> *  freshly ground black pepper<br />Preparation:<br />Soak chana dal for 10-12 hours. Drain and rinse.<br /><br />Saut&eacute; onion and garlic in olive oil until soft (5-8 minutes). Add drained chana dal and bulgur wheat. Saut&eacute; for about 3 more minutes, until bulgur wheat is browned (it will begin to smell heavenly). Add all remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, and lower heat.<br /><br />Simmer, covered, for about 35 minutes. At this point, check to see if the chana dal is tender enough for you. If not add a quarter cup more water and simmer another few minutes or until you are satisfied. Turn off heat and let sit, covered, for at least 10 minutes.<br /><br />Makes about 6 cups.

review/summary: Pretty good.  Lots of unwrapping, though.
review/text: Just posting to note that a) these exist and b) are pretty good, actually.  Cranberry and blueberry are two of my favorite flavors, so I raced to pick these up when I learned Tootsie Roll was expanding their fruit-flavored line.  The cranberry flavor tastes suitably sweet-tart  -  with just enough bitter tang to distinguish it from, say, lemon  -  with a muted berry flavor as the base.  They're not revolutionary, they don't stray _that_ far from the typical Tootsie Roll easygoing sweetness (I'd like to see a higher-end, more daring candy company take on this combination with more tang and fruit juice)  -  but in the meantime, they beat the heck out of cherry.<br /><br />Complaint, though: like the other new Tootsie Rolls, these come only in huge 360-piece bags.  While it's nice that Amazon has them for cheap, I wish there were a more convenient way to sample the new flavors.

review/summary: Much better than pills
review/text: One of our dogs whom we adopted as an adult had torn cranial cruciate ligaments in both back legs and a really difficult time getting around.  We opted for surgery on one leg to see if it would help, but the repair did not improve her mobility.  After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!

review/text: I have a 10 1/2 year old chow-shepard mix... a big girl about 95 pounds.  She started showing some signs of something hurting her as she laid or sat down and then when getting back up.  She didn't have a lot of energy to play or to go for a walk.  The Vet said she's getting arthritis we should try to give her some supplements.<br />We came across these at a mega-pet store and bought a package.  I've followed up with two more and about to buy another to be the fourth month of this experiment.<br />Does this work?  Well, for our dog, she no longer moans as she's lying down or getting up.  She's running around the house again, running in the yard after the squirrels and if we get anywhere near her leash, she's trying to get it off the hook for us to go, go, go.<br />Miracle?  Maybe.  Right product at the right time for my `pup'?  Yes indeed.<br />Do I recommend?  To every dog owner I know; and tell them Amazon has the best price too.

review/summary: No false claims here!
review/text: My dog has just turned 10 and we noticed on long walks, especially in the winter, she would get a little sore and limpy. While she's in pretty good shape and in excellent health, we were concerned about her joint health.<br /><br />My husband found these products at a pet food store and picked up a small package. For one week's worth of these treats, the total cost was $9.99.  I was skeptical as we'd tried a few other joint suppliments and not really seen any results.<br /><br />When I opened the package, I did appreciate that each day is labeled. When you have more than one owner in a house, knowing if the dog has had her daily dose can be an issue. This eliminates that problem entirely.<br /><br />We tried out the week's worth of treats and there was a small but noticible difference. Our bed is low to the ground and she had a much easier time getting up without straining and she wasn't limping after her walks.<br /><br />I decided to purchase a larger amount and saw that Amazon had the 28-pack for over $5 less than the store was selling it for. This made the decision for me and the treats arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Now, I have a dog who not only looks forward to her walks even more than normal but always is happy to hear the words "joint cookie" when she gets home from them.

review/summary: Pet Loves Them!
review/text: I got a one week supply-pack at the farm and feed store 4 days ago for my 8-year old, 65-pound black lab. She has had trouble with her hips a lot this last year. I assumed it would be like other treats and she would turn her nose up at them, but she LOVES them! I haven't given them to her long enough to claim that the glucosamine & chondroitin helps any, but if it helps pets as it does humans, then I assume they will do her good. Because she loves them and they have the glucosamine in them to help her joints, I will buy them for her again! This bigger box on Amazon.com this time!

review/summary: SMOKE Flavor - Note the tag!
review/text: Nowhere did it say "SMOKE" flavor in this ad - except in the little image - now I see it on the bag - just to the right of the logo, that faint beige spot. Urk.

review/summary: Great for bad knees!
review/text: My little toy poodle takes a 1/2 of one every day.  They really help with her bad knees.  Hopefully they will work for a long time.  Otherwise she will have to take prescription medication or have surgery.

review/summary: Joint care is very important
review/text: Joint care is very important for your dog, and you should start it early!  Once the symptoms appear - it helps, but you can ward off the symptoms longer if you start joint care early in your dog's life.  Ask your vet!

review/summary: Greenies Joint Care
review/text: I am so glad to have found this product.  My dog had a problem on walks when he would have to pull up his rear leg and hop.  As a puppy he was operated on with little success. The Doctor said it was common in Yorkies and there was nothing more they could do.  Now he is 4 years old and with the addition of Greenies Joint Care I rarely see him limp. He LOVES the taste, he can't wait to get his daily "bone"

review/summary: Really seem to help
review/text: They really do seem to help. Our 13 year old dog used to growl at the younger herd members. After starting these daily she seems a LOT more agreeable to their puppy ways.  We can't ask her obviously, but we've seen enough of a difference to keep giving them to her.

review/text: We dont know how old she is and she was having trouble getting up and down and our vet didnt help us at all so we wasted over about $200 on our dog when all we needed to spend was $20 on these.
