review/text: This is very good sushi ginger. It's not restaurant quality - it's not tinted pink and the slices aren't transparently thin. But the taste is excellent and I like the fact it doesn't have additives. I like potent ginger; this might be too strong for you if you prefer mild. (In which case you might like the Eden ginger instead. I found that to be too bland.)<br /><br />The ingredients are: ginger, rice vinegar, sugar, salt, water, and potassium sorbate. The label says there are zero carbs in a one-tablespoon serving - obviously there have to be carbs in it, but it must fall below what has to be listed.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: I am a pickled ginger fiend. By that I mean I eat it on its own, once or twice a day, only stopping when my mouth is on fire. This is strange, but it also makes me exceptionally qualified to rate this stuff. I ordered Roland Sushi Ginger from Amazon because pickled ginger is hard to find locally and relatively expensive (and it's that awful pink wel-pac stuff with the really chemical, salt taste). This brand is by far the cheapest I've been able to find. I was initially turned off by the taste because it's made from "shoga" (mature ginger) instead of "shin shoga" (young ginger). Shoga has a woody, crunchy texture and a spicy kick, while shin shoga is smoother in texture and flavor. But after a few days of noshing on the Roland stuff, my palate adjusted to the difference. Now that I am out of the Roland brand and about to reorder, I have realized just how disgusting the Wel-pac stuff is since picking up a jar at the grocery the other day. What I love about Roland is that it is all natural, and the ginger is not overwhelmed by unnecessary chemicals and additives. 4 stars for price and purity, minus 1 star due to the maturity/woodiness of the ginger and the wildly varying thickness and size of the slices.

review/summary: Good flavor, BUT ...
review/text: These packages, there are SIX  1 lb ones of them in the box ( I will be eating on them for a 3 or 4 years if I don't give away half) have very tasty pickled ginger.  It has just the right amount of spiciness and "heat" to me.<br /><br />  However it is very lacking in two other key attributes of sushi type pickled ginger.<br />*  First, a good bit of the slices are TOUGH and made from it seems very large, overly mature ginger root.  (It does get "woody" when large or older.)<br />*  Second it is very thickly sliced, whereas quality sushi ginger is very thinly sliced.  I can therefore only give this product VERY average acceptable rating.

review/text: Pickled sushi ginger should have some sweetness and be a little spicy.  This ginger is too spicy, the pieces are often too thick and tough and requires a lot of chewing which spreads the hot spice throughout your mouth.  This product is not tasty, is very hot compared to other brands, and packed in bags that do not re-seal.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: Not exactly natural
review/text: This so-called natural sushi ginger includes the preservative, potassium sorbate, which is a synthetic preservative.  That's not exactly "natural" in my opinion and had I know that this product contained that preservative, I would not have purchased it.<br /><br />You will notice that the photo of the package does not include the term, "natural," on the package itself.  That term is only in the title and write-up here on Amazon.  I don't know who is responsible for these write-ups but I would suspect it is the specific vendor/provider of the product and not an Amazon's employee, but I don't know.<br /><br />You will also notice that the ingredients are not listed in the "information about product" area, unlike the other Roland sushi ginger product, which does list potassium sorbate as an ingredient. For those of us who seek out foods without preservatives, the product information provided here plus the use of "natural" is misleading, at best.<br /><br />Clearly, this product should not be touted as "natural."  To be clear, fundamentally, potassium sorbate is non-toxic and is regarded as safe. However, its synthetic characteristic is not looked upon favorably by many nutritionists and health-conscientious consumers.  Prolonged use of the preservative could lead to allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea and nutrient loss in food. Toxicity of potassium sorbate is equivalent to that of table salt.<br /><br />Given the large amount of sushi ginger that you will receive if you order this--a total of 96  ounces, you will indeed consume it, and its preservative, for a prolonged period of time.<br /><br />Unless you toss it out, like I will be.

review/summary: Excellent dog food; especially good for dogs with health problems
review/text: We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.

review/summary: Healthy choice for dog w/ food allergies/sensitive stomach
review/text: My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!

review/text: I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.

review/text: we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!

review/text: Our dog has tried several foods, including expensive vet brands, and has been treated for ear infections, skin infections, and was constantly scratching and licking. We even tried other limited ingredient foods, only to have it upset her stomach and cause new problems. I bought this at the store thinking, "Okay, salmon and rice. This seems safe!"  I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.

review/summary: Solved our skin issues
review/text: Understanding not all skin issues are alike, this food seems to have solved our issues.  My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet.

Our pet sitter recommended we try a dog food without known allergens, so we tried Wellness Rice & Salmon.  It really works! Our dog still gets some redness but she is so much better.  The only negative is that apparently the food doesn't taste that great. Our solution is to mix it with a very small amount of canned cat food (about 1 tablespoon of our cat's Newman Organics), and our dog gobbles it right down.

review/summary: Low Residue
review/text: My dog loves this food and I like it because it's low residue and doesn't upset his tummy.  Less waste when he goes makes it more comfortable for him and easier to pick up for me.  The only complaint (besides the price!) would be the smell of the food if you sniff it.  It doesn't make his breath smell.  I may try the lamb one next time (to compare smells), but I definitely recommend this food.

review/summary: Excellent! My dog's skin looks amazing and he loves this food!
review/text: I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love! The cat food kibble is the size of a small pea. To good health and happy feeding! :)

review/summary: Revised opinion
review/text: Update 11/12/11: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb & Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted.  I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />"Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."

review/text: I started a LID for my dog when after a regular yearly check up, my vet noticed that her paws were tinged a redish color. The vet said that it was probably an allergy to something in her food and suggested a limited ingredient diet. We have been using this food for about 4 months now and we have noticed remarkable results. She no longer constantly licks her feet and they are returning to their normal color. Worked perfectly for our dog!!

review/summary: Great for Dogs with Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products. It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations. My vet prescribed a dog food that is only available from vets but after 3 months I saw no improvement.<br /><br />Finally I researched on my own and tried Wellness Simple Solutions and after 3 months I noticed that her ear problems subsided. I supplement her evening meals with the Wellness Simple Solutions dry food and she loves it.<br /><br />Compared with the stuff the vet prescribed, which looked like a waxy tube coming out of the can, the Wellness Simple Solutions canned dog food looks and smells like real food. It contains no wheat, corn, soy, dairy, or eggs and yet is high in nutrients.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the back of the can is duck and it states " This is a naturally preserved product". Considering that, I am very happy that the best by dates average about 2 years out because I keep extra dog food on hand in case of an emergency.

review/text: Wellness is an incredible food.  I have used it for both of my dobes for almost 7 months.  They were shedding before I switched to this brand but no more.  Since the switch almost 7 months ago, their coats are amazing - like silk and I have no shedding at all.  I have one dobe with a sensitive stomach so switched him over to this formula when I saw it came out.  He loves it - sure, its a little pricy but so worth it - no loose stools, no throwups and no shedding - I get comments on them all the time about how beautiful their coats are!

review/summary: Good food for sensitive dog
review/text: I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.

review/summary: not much better than I the salmon flavored one.
review/text: Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.

The high grain content triggers allergic symptoms and causes him to have bad dog breath.<br /><br />On the recommendation of friend that has tried tried several premium dog foods and determined Wellness to be a superior brand, we started to to feed VitaHound the rice and duck formula.  VitaHound's bad dog breath disappeared and his allergic symptoms reduced to manageable.  I believe the few extra bucks is a good investment for VitaHound's dog health.

review/summary: It's a sweet thing.
review/text: Wanting to cut back on sugar my family tested practically every artificial sweetner on the shelf and decided to go with Sugar Twin. We like it because it is sweet without a bitter after-taste and because it is inexpensive ( at least though Amazon ). The box says it can also be used in baking, but if too much is used ( one cup say ) some bitterness can be detected. To counter this we use a 1/2 & 1/2 mix with sugar and all works well ( cutting sugar intake by half so we can enjoy my wife's cakes is, well, okay by me and the kids ). The box says Sugar Twin will work in baking and for the most part it does. Run some tests though and taste your results.<br /><br />  To those who are going to purchase Sugan Twin for the first time it is packaged in a pliable cardboard box. For ease of use we use one of those quick seal lid containers for the kitchen and simply fill this by sqeezing the box which forces the product to flow very quickly. To measure and dispense from the box itself is somewhat messy because of Sugar Twin's very fluffy texture.<br /><br />  As to health concerns about using an artificial sweetner ( there's always someone with a health concern ) I simply say we like the cost, the taste and the versatility of the product without reservation. Looking for a sweetner for your coffee in the morning that leaves a minimal amount of after taste? This product is worth a try.

review/text: Fee Brothers nail the summer tiki staple (a more flavorful simple syrup) often used in fruity drinks.  Makes fine zombies, hurricanes and various other tiki style drinks.<br /><br />For fruity summer drinks this stuff is at least as good as falnurum from I've made from scratch (and cheaper when you add up all the time and ingredients).  In drinks that ask for a winter falnurum (which is usually darker with a more mollasas flavor) this is not what you're looking for, but can be used as a substittue in a pinch.<br /><br />Unsure what to do with it?  Try my curried tequilia receipe:<br /><br />1 agave tequilia blanco<br />1 falernum<br />.5 cynar<br />.5 lime juice<br />mint spring and LARGE ice

review/text: I have truly enjoyed this tea.  I drink it most every day and it helps me to relax.  It is not meant to be a weight loss tea, but since I have started I have noticed great changes in my body weight and inches.  It has a great chocolate taste and with that taste helps me not to go for foods that are chocolate and not good for me.<br />I will definetely order this product again.  It give me lots of energy too.<br />I do wish for my next order the shipping not to be so high, it really defers me from ordering with the way the economy is these days.<br />Thanks D.G.

review/text: I like a lot of the Gloria Jeans flavored k-cups, and I typically love french vanilla coffee, but this one is not so good to me.  The vanilla taste is almost like a chemical, as if they made a cup of coffee and shot some cheap vanilla syrup flavoring into it.  As far as vanilla k-cups go, I'd stick with the Van Houtte or Timothy's.

review/text: I am a great fan of the k cups and have tried many flavors. My husband encouraged me to get this and I am not sure what I expected but it was definately not for me. Had a harsh bitter taste and was only made better by adding sweetner. I had orginally ordered it on subscribe and save hoping it would be a winner. Cancelled the subscription immediately. Coffee is such a matter of taste and one should not be put off trying something new becasue someone did not like it. Others giving reviews loved it so it is a very subjective thing. One reviewer stated it had a chemical taste to it. I may describe it the same way but the bitterness came through strong for me. To each his own... Try it you might like it. The hazelnut is so much better!

review/text: If you're reading this review, then you already own a Keurig Brewer so I don't need to sing the praises of Keurig.  This particular blend of coffee is mild with a pleasant aroma.  Unlike many flavored coffees, the aroma really is a promise of how the coffee tastes with a bold vanilla flavor to complement the milder coffee flavor.  We drink it with a little cream and add a little sweetener.  My teenage son prefers this to almost any other flavored coffee.

I drowned it with syrup pumps. I used coffee mate till it was pale NOTHING HELPED!<br /><br />I havn't thrown away the k cups yet but i cant figure i will ever use them... unforgeablely i moved all the kcups from the original box once i got them so i never tried to return them<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PLAVOR..

review/text: To say I enjoy vanilla would an understatement. When I purchased a sample packet of other products from Gloria Jean I was pleased so I figured that something marked as French Vanilla Supreme would be a winner. This was not the case. The flavoring was minimal and had an aftertaste that was not too pleasing. One other reviewer used the term CHEMICAL taste and I would have to agree.<br /><br />While the Gloria Jean line may have some shining stars in its lineup, I would have to say this particular one is not it.

review/summary: Odd "vanilla" flavor.
review/text: I love vanilla coffee and after reading reviews of the various options for use in my Keurig Mini, I decided to give the Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme a try.  The "vanilla" flavoring is a bitter almost chemical flavor.  Although it smelled good while it was brewing, the taste could not be helped much even by adding milk and sugar.  Very disappointed in this one.  Next time I will definitely order in a sampler pack before getting such a large box of one flavor.  So far the only other vanilla I have tried was Timothy's which seemed a bit better. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV6I">Timothy's World Coffee, French Vanilla for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: We got the Kahlua and Gloria Jean's Vanilla coffee pods to try. I drink the Kahlua; my wife the vanilla. Both are mild blends with no bitterness. I get a hint of the distinctive Kahlua taste more from the coffee's smell than its taste. It has become my favorite. While I can't speak to the qualities/characteristics of Gloria Jeans' vanilla, I've noticed it has become my wife's favorite.
