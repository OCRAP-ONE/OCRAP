review/summary: Individually wrapped, delicious green tea
review/text: I'm very picky when it comes to green tea, Bigelow is the only brand of bagged green tea that I like. I can't stand the packaging that the Bigelow organic green tea comes in at the supermarket - they're for some reason bundled in bags of 4. This particular item is not only a fantastic deal, but the bags are individually wrapped! I don't have to worry about the tea losing flavor from air exposure. I hope they never discontinue this packaging as I'll be buying this twice a year!

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: I purchased this to serve during my birthday party, which was done with a Doctor Who theme. I had a TARDIS cake, jammie dodgers (stored in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VQZOLS">Doctor Who Tardis Cookie Jar Lights and Sounds</a>), and a bowl full of these jelly babies. They arrived quickly and displayed well on the table of snacks.<br /><br />These are kinda sorta like gummy bears, but not really. Each candy is about an inch long, and nicely thick. It's got a dryer, tougher texture on the outside, and then soft and moist on the inside. They're very tasty - especially the green, red, and purple ones!<br /><br />The bowl of jelly babies was nearly empty by the end of the party. Everyone loved them and the bowl got passed around the room a good bit. :)<br /><br />Perfect addition to any Doctor Who-themed gathering.

review/text: I had used these smaller jars of honey while on a trip in France a few years ago. They were in the hotels with the breakfasts.

The flavor is not too intense and the size is perfect for my use. Plus, they bring back memories of a wonderful trip I took to a country where I grew up.

Then we bought those cute wooden honey stirrers (small ones) and used clear small elastic bands (like the kind for teeth or small ponytails) to secure the stirrers to the back on a tilt.  We got lots of great compliments and the honey itself tasted delicious.

It just doesn't pack the same punch when the sugar is coated around the whole biscuit.<br /><br />Still not a bad cereal, but I don't reach for it on the shelf quite as often now.

review/summary: Trying these instead of Frosted Mini-Wheats
review/text: I'm a big fan of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats, but I decided to give Shredded Wheat a try because Amazon is offering it at a really great price for four boxes.<br /><br />When I poured myself a bowl, I first noticed that Shredded Wheat is a lot smaller than Frosted Mini-Wheats.  These are closer to Chex in size and shape, but each piece is a dense brick of shredded wheat lightly covered in sugar.  Biting into them, they definitely felt harder and crunchier than Mini-Wheats too.  They also tasted a little more toasted and slightly less sugary, even though both products contain 12g of sugar.<br /><br />After having a bowl of Shredded Wheat, I think I still prefer Frosted Mini-Wheats.  Shredded Wheat is a little too dense and crunchy for my taste, but it's not a bad cereal.  I'll happily finish my four boxes, but I probably won't be buying them again.

review/text: We love the smaller sized shredded wheat. Other brands have a big air pocket in it. My kids especially the little 16month old I babysit loves to suck all the  milk out of the middle of the cereal pieces and then chew it up.<br /><br />Great value when they were on the subscribe and save. Now that they are not, I may have to find it elsewhere.<br /><br />We have compare them to Generic Target brands and to other name brands and we like the Post brand best.<br /><br />One box would be gone in a morningn for my family. My boys eat 2 bowls a piece.  But to feed a family of 5 for less than 3.00 a meal is awesome.

review/summary: LOVE IT! WISH IT WASN'T SO HARD TO FIND
review/text: When I first decided I wanted to start eating a frosted shredded wheat cereal, I didn't know which one to choose, so I bought both brands - all our grocery stores carried both at that time. Initially, I thought I preferred its competitor, but then I came to decide otherwise. Additionally, right around that time I had my annual check-up and was told to cut my sodium intake, so I then took a look at the labels of all the cereals I had previously eaten for my health looking for sodium content. What I found was that Post Frosted Shredded Wheat was the only cereal to have ZERO sodium! ...The thing is, all of a sudden, I can't find it in any of our grocery stores. They don't even have a space for it anymore. All they carry now is the other brand. So I've had to resort to purchasing it on-line in mass quantities - constantly afraid that Post will discontinue making it. (Or maybe they have already and what we're buying is all that's left...)

Even then, it's only 12g--much less than many cereals on the market.  I think the 4g protein and 5g fiber more than make up for it.  On top of that, every box has a coupon for a free Fruit Naturals fruit cup ($1.59 value at my local grocery store).  Very good value, overall.

review/summary: Definitely Not Frosted Mini Wheats, But Okay
review/text: Post's Shredded Wheat isn't really what's pictured on the box.  Instead of a block of wheat with one side frosted and one side not, it's a block of wheat that's very lightly frosted all over.  This isn't necessarily bad, but because the layer of frosting completely surrounds the block, it makes it more tough/crunchy than what I'm used to.  The shreds of wheat are also a little more compacted than Frosted Mini Wheats -  it's a little harder to chew if you're eating it plain without milk, but will stay crunchy a little longer if you eat it with milk.  Despite the full coating of frosting, it isn't overly sweet.  All in all, it definitely wasn't bad, but I probably won't buy it again in the future.  Try a box before ordering the pack of 4 like I did!

review/text: Post shredded Wheat in the Lightly Frosted Cereal flavor is our FAVORITE cereal! It is 100% Whole Grain certified with the stamp on the side of the box to let you know for sure. It has a finer texture that is not so rough on the inside of your mouth. It also does not tend to leave residue leaving you feeling like you are "snacking" on it for an hour after breakfast! It is not overly sweet and has a nice vanilla type flavor. It is amazing for gastric health if you know what I mean!<br />It is also tasty in warm weather put into warm milk to make a hot cereal.<br /><br />Our local stores all stopped carrying this cereal. Because I take a lot of medications that can make my digestive system sluggish it is an important part of my diet and more satisfying than a glass of medicine. When our store couldn't get it in Post had a link to Amazon.com. With FREE shipping and cost Lower than what I ever paid in any store it was an all around great buy!<br /><br />Shipping was MUCH faster than they told me it would be. Packaging was great and secure for a porch drop of.<br /><br />I am 100% happy. I think I will go eat some now!

If you like the fresh breath sensation of eating one wintergreen lifesaver and inhaling w/ your mouth open, well you will need to eat 3-4 of those for a similar sensation. Still I will continue to buy this flavor although the ginger mint flavor may become my favorite due to its intensity.

review/summary: Very nice tea - But this is not a good deal!
review/text: I have enjoyed this tea for some time, and as I am British, I know my tea. I highly recommend the tea.<br /><br />I usually buy this at World Market (Cost Plus), and they used to sell it at about $4.99 for the 80 bag size.  My local store is currently out of stock as I believe Williamson Teas in the UK are changing the packaging (and perhaps the price?).  Anyway, you can see that this is not a good deal even if the shipping was free, but these people (not Amazon) charge over $10 to ship from FL. USPS Priority Mail is $5.55 across the country for a 1 lb package (package of 80 tea bags plus packing is &lt; 1 lb.). Outrageous! - they are marking up their shipping as well as the tea!  Most of their (again not Amazon) other British products are also over-priced.<br /><br />I recommend you look elsewhere.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I love this tea. But there is a problem. Once you start drinking Lifeboat, nothing else measures up. It can be hard to find. And when you have to make due with something else, you quickly realize that you have become another Lifeboat addict. The World Market used to carry Lifeboat, but I have not seen it there in some time. The Amazon prices are are a good bit higher. But there is no choice but to pay them. Lifeboat is just not an option any more.

review/summary: One of my favorites
review/text: This tea isn't like a revelation, or anything.  I like several blends from Taylor's of Harrogate's just as much, and those are easier to get a hold of (at the local grocery store, and online).  But when I see this one at a good price, with FREE SHIPPING on Amazon, then I'll often get it.  A nice (but not at all dramatic) change of pace.  If I had to choose between just Yorkshire Gold or Lifeboat, though, I'd go with YG.<br /><br />(And, I should mention, I first got this as a gift and ended up liking it so much I started getting into black tea again.  So, it's a good one (I like it a lot more than Twinings), but part of the attraction for me might be sentimental or something, at this point.)

review/summary: Finally, Lifeboat Tea is Available Again!
review/text: I discovered Lifeboat Tea about four years ago--first purchased it at Trader Joe's and then they stopped carrying it, but I found it at World Market.  Then World Market stopped carrying it, but I found it at Amazon for a reasonable price and ordered four boxes.  The price for the tea at the one shop at amazon.com was high, so I started drinking another brand of tea, but longed for Lifeboat.  Now I see that Lifeboat Tea is available again and the price is reasonable.  I love the tea because it is fairly strong,  yet mellow, smooth and not bitter at all.  I am very picky about tea and Lifeboat is my favorite.  There are many expensive teas but none better than Lifeboat!

review/summary: Lifeboat: You need this tea. So do I.
review/text: I've been drinking tea for fifty-some years now, ever since I was a wee shaver and my dad led me down the path, and since becoming an adult, sometimes I like my tea strong enough to stand a spoon up in.<br /><br />Lifeboat fills the bill.<br /><br />When you read an Agatha Christie novel where some poor soul is about to collapse from nerves, and Miss Jane Marple offers them a strong cup of tea to buck them up before she goes and solves the murder, it's surely LIfeboat she's pouring. When Prince William gets back from diving off a helicopter to save some poor sod who was drowning off of Wales, and Kate shares a restoring cuppa with him, that'd be Lifeboat. It'll put hair on your chest, a gleam in your eye, a song in your heart, and in no time at all you'll be off looking for a grizzly to rassle.<br /><br />Lifeboat is also lovely and relaxing on those blustery cold evenings when the wind and rain smite the windows, and my wife and I are curled up in front of the fireplace.<br /><br />Not to mention, a chunk of the money goes to support a fine charity, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.<br /><br />I can't see a thing wrong with this tea, and that's something you can't say about much in this world.

On the other hand, I do prefer teas with a lot of flavor, like a good Assam, so maybe that's why I differ so much from the other reviewers, or maybe I got a bad batch.

review/summary: Delicious tea
review/text: I have been drinking Lifeboat tea for years -- every afternoon without fail. I've made converts of my family. It's a delicious tea with a rich mellow flavor that does not get bitter. It makes delicious iced tea, as well, as it holds up to the ice and lemon. Most of us don't steep it too long, but I have friends who like it that way, too. I just delivered a few Lifeboat teabags to my British hairdresser, who gave it her approval, as well. I give Lifeboat tea to all my tea-drinking friends with hopes they'll enjoy it as much as I do. A percentage of the price you pay is always donated to families of fishermen in Great Britain who've been lost at sea. Those of us living in the fishing communities on Cape Ann -- Gloucester, Ma -- understand the perils fishermen are up against.

review/summary: Outstanding cup of strong black tea
review/text: I love a very strong, unsweetened (though I live deep in South Eastern Sweet Tea territory) cup of black tea.<br /><br />I love this tea because you can brew a very strong cup if you like - but without any worries about over-brewing bitterness and such (such as with Typhoo et all) It also doesn't "stack" poorly. I.e. I brew 6-8 bags in my kettle and cut it half to the fridge container (so figure 4 bags per pot) and the extra strength from multiple bags as well as extra time it still comes out very clean strong tea.<br /><br />As in drop the bags into your kettle and in five minutes you're done. Forget and leave them in for 60 minutes? No problem - barely a difference (I'm making iced tea so I don't hover over or immediately pour after normal steep time).<br /><br />All in all - an outstanding cup of black tea. And as strong and you like it. Buy it by the 12 pack as it's somewhat variable in availability.<br /><br />12 pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAZEWA">Lifeboat, Tea, 80-Bag (12 Pack)</a>

review/summary: Slurp-factor
review/text: Experiments in Japanese cuisine will inevitably lead to soba (buckwheat) noodles. This brand is available locally, but at far greater expense. The flavor is nothing spectacular or intrusive. The texture and flexibility are the selling point. They have been used in Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, yakisoba and stand-alone hot or cold in dipping sauce with excellent results. When properly cooked, the noodles have a wonderful texture and flexibility. It is Japanese-polite to slurp your noodles (suck them in). Regular pasta will not allow that technique, I've tried. These wrap around the chopsticks just right and slurp just fine. I like the ingredients, just wheat and buckwheat flour. The less expensive brand uses wheat with barley etc., that's regular all-purpose flour, ugh. Just a personal preference.

review/text: The first recipe I tried with these noodles was a complete disaster.  I tried just throwing them into a soup I was making and they completely dissolved.  They don't cook like wheat pasta.  I've used them several times since then and we love them.  I cook them now and rinse in cold water for recipes.  I've used them for sesame noodles and tofu spinach soup, with wonderful results.  I can't find soba noodles anywhere at local stores, so these were nice to find on Amazon.

review/summary: pricey but worth it for me
review/text: actually, the price on amazon is very good, though i can't remember how much my local grocery listed it at. but when compared to other soba noodles, this brand is insanely expensive, but since this is the only organic and unsalted soba noodles i heard of, i'm paying for it.<br /><br />given how salty regular soba noodles are already, then you add more salty ingredients into it, i wanted to cut back on the amount of sodium. i guess getting unsalted noodles is like not adding salt to your typical italian pasta, though adding salt to your pasta probably doesn't add as much salt as the soba noodles you normally find at grocery stores. but having unsalted noodles is that your dish may not taste as "tasty" due to the lack of salt - you've been warned.<br /><br />my main reason for purchasing unsalted noodles was to cut back on the saltiness, so this works out great. but if you're out to impress with a soba dish, you may notice the missing salt.

They do seem a little salty, and apparently that is just how they are based on another review, so be careful adding salt to the water when cooking.  We use them in a beef and pepper stir fry with a homemade sauce and they are a perfect match.<br /><br />We use one package, 1 lb beef, 2 peppers, 2 onions and that makes 4 dinner servings to give you an idea of how much is in one pack.  Cook as directed and add them in at the end of the cooking to heat through.

review/text: I've been getting most of our soba from a local Vietnamese grocery store and although we've gotten some great stuff there, it seems hit or miss with the brands they carry so I thought I'd try good old Amazon for soba.  This one has a much better consistency than some we've had, but it is paler in color and the flavor is not quite as bold as what we remember eating in Japan, and what we've sometimes been able to get here.  Sooo .... it was good; we enjoyed it; but it's not quite the soba I'm looking for:  I'd probably try a different brand next time.

I served the noodles for dinner and in the middle of the night my fianc&eacute; woke up with a splitting headache that went on for hours. The ingredients are organic wheat flour (70%) and organic buckwheat flour (30%). Shame on me for not reading the teeny tiny print but also, shame on these companies who intentionally mislead consumers with false labeling. Don't call something "buckwheat noodles" when they are, in fact, only 30% buckwheat! Also: Japan's favorite is made in Australia? Go figure.

They don't take long to cook, are healthy, and have a neutral flavor that works well with any type of broth or sauce. The ones I purchase from the store are buckwheat AND YAM. I think the yam and buckwheat taste better and are more fulfilling. For some reason I thought that's what these were but I didn't read carefully. I am very happy with my purchase. Delivery was horrible. They delivered the package on a bright sunny day but the box was so wet that it disintegrated when i tried to pick it up. WTF? This is not Amazon or Hakubaku's fault. I've searched for the one with yam but can't find them on amazon.

review/text: If these are "No. 1" in Japan as the label says, maybe it's because children there like the blander taste. I think noodles need a little salt; other soba brands vary quite a bit in sodium content but zero is not enough for best flavor.  I haven't tried the Annie Chun - from the picture they seem darker in color and that might indicate a bit more oomph.

review/summary: YUMMY and HEALTHY dog treat!
review/text: My 2 medium sized dogs absolutely love these garlic-veggie biscuits!  The treats are nice and solid (not crumbly messy) but are also easy enough to snap in half to make them last longer (a whole one is also fun to stick in their toy Kong and watch them figure out how to get it out).<br /><br />And since these treats have all healthy ingredients (no gluten or by-products or dyes or anything else unhealthy), it's a treat you can feel GOOD about giving your pet.  I haven't tried the honey or bacon-cheddar flavors yet, but definitely will.  My dogs give these 2 paws up! :)<br /><br />Ingredients: rye flour, oat bran, spinach, carrots, broccoli, celery, garlic powder, canola oil, eggs, baking powder.

review/text: My puppy does NOT like these! And well, mom doesn't like them either! The smell of garlic is so overpowering, I tossed them a week ago and I can still smell them! I think if your dog likes strong flavors these are for you, but they give my little guy diarrhea!! I would recommend the same brand in the Peanut Butter and Honey flavor, much gentler on tummies and my puppy can't get enough of them.

review/summary: Now only mildly spicy
review/text: Planters has reformulated these peanuts to greatly reduce there hotness and spiciness. In Amazon's product image above, the peanuts appear thoroughly coated in chili pepper; but, in the image I uploaded, you'll see that the peanuts now only have a light dusting of pepper and salt. So, be advised, before spending a fairly substantial amount for 108 packs of these peanuts, you should first buy a smaller quantity -- because they may not be what you expected.

They are awesome and addictive. I enjoy one pack every day. Only two things to be aware of - keep a napkin handy as the seasoning sticks to your hand and also make sure you know that it is 290 calories with 220 fat calories. These are the only two cautions. If you can stop at 1/2  pack, it is great.  It is an excellent snack and I have put myself on automatic reorder so I never run out of it. I love it and my guests love it too..

review/summary: Delicious Snack at a Great Price - Read My Updates!!!
review/text: May 26th: New update I just received a new shipment of these nuts but they lacked the chili pepper to make them hot. Fortunately, Amazon is making it right but I am saddened by this problem with planters.<br /><br />Jan 8, 2012: Update, for a while in 2011 there were bad patches of these nuts where for some reason the hot chili pepper was missing making the flavor subpar - there are several reviews mentioning this and I have personally experienced a few of these packs which I could not enjoy. Anyway, last week I received my latest Subscribe and Save order from Amazon and I am pleased to report that the tried and true recipe was used for that batch - dated best by 7-31-12.<br /><br />My favorite snack is nuts, particularly pistachios, almonds, cashews and peanuts - Yes, I know peanuts are not nuts but a legume. This particular variety of planters nuts are my favorite and can be hard to find, especially now that they have all these new designer flavors, most of which I just don't like at all. Chipotle has an aftertaste I don't enjoy and the other new flavors are too strong or too salty. The regular, honey roasted and heat nuts are the only varieties I enjoy. Heat nuts are not too hot, but certainly not mild. The hot spices heat up the taste of a roasted peanut instead of masking it.<br /><br />Nuts are far more nutritious than potato chips or pretzels which are mostly empty calories. Nuts are also loaded with fat, good fat, which makes you feel full instead of spiking your insulin levels like non-fat snacks do. But keep in mind a few nuts contain plenty of calories and it is easy to just keeping eating your way to the next size pants. The good news is that each packet, about 300 calories, makes for good portion control. Eat one pack and stop. Amazon has a great price and free shipping. If you like nuts and like hot and spicy, you'll love Heat Peanuts.

review/text: I have enjoyed Planters "HEAT" Peanuts for years but was unable to find them locally anymore.  I was so happy to find them and purchased a whole box.  Unfortunately the recipe must have changed because they are hardly hot at all. The hotter version seemed very popular because they were always sold out in my area even when they were sold in the large gallon size cans (can't find them that way anyomre either).  I doubt I will purchase them again unless they come out in a hotter version again.

review/text: I was looking for Vegan energy bars when I stumbled upon BumbleBar, a company with a conscience. I immediately placed a subscription and await for the bars with great anticipation after reading all the positive reviews. When the bars do arrive, I tasted one and I did not like the taste. However, I would like to emphasize that taste is a very subjective matter, what is tasty to one might not appeal to another. It is filling though and would serve well as a supplement diet in the busy work life of a city dweller.

review/text: I love my French Press, and am always searching for the best coffee beans to press -- this one is easily my new favorite. (It also seems especially apt for espresso.) For me, this coffee is similar to Jamaican Blue Mountain because it has a sort of mellow and silky presence, a sweet flavor and a low acidity. I only try to buy Fair Trade, and since Puerto Rico is part of the US, these beans are homegrown, yet they possess the exotic flavor that you can only get at high altitudes in the Caribbean islands (e.g. Blue Mountain). Fellow coffee lovers definitely need to try this one.

review/summary: Healthier than the mainstream brands
review/text: BACKGROUND:<br />When we got our cat from the Humane Society (which was a great place with great people), we were told to keep her on a prescription diet for the rest of her life because she had a surgical procedure that removed a portion of her intestine caused by Intussusception. She is perfectly healthy now other than having a slightly faster digestive cycle for obvious reasons.<br /><br />When we took her to the vet for a regular check-up, our vet recommended a web site [...] concerning litter box tips as well as cat food information. We learned on this web site how most pet food brands and even some that claim to be natural and healthy are actually very unhealthy and are the root cause of obesity, diabetes and other issues cats suffer that become quite costly to treat. We decided to seek out a healthier alternative and this web site had Instinct as one of the recommended raw food options for cats. We plan to transition our cat over to their raw meat option eventually (or at least incorporate it into her diet), but in the meantime, we found that their canned food options were healthier than the mainstream.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Our cat's prescription diet was the d/d Duck and Pea and we were happy to find that Nature's Variety offered a Duck Formula as well. She had no bad side-effects transitioning over to this food and took to it immediately. She actually loves this food.The fact that it's 95% meat with only %5 vegetable and grain free is rare to find compared to other canned foods which pile on grains and fillers. We also only feed her canned food, since we read that most dry foods contain way too many carbs which leads to obesity and can dehydrate cats causing urinary tract infections, whereas canned foods with substantial moisture provide way more water to them naturally. Not to mention the addictive chemical most companies add to dry food to make cats crave it (Note: I have not purchased or looked into the dry food option from Nature's Variety, so I have no idea if it is as bad as other brands).<br /><br />We are happy to have found a healthier alternative and hopefully by paying a little bit more for this food now, we can save a little money later in her cat life from expensive bills related to health problems.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I do wish they had a traditional 24 pack (less packaging than ordering 2 packs of 12). It is also slightly more expensive, but worth it in the long run, hopefully.
