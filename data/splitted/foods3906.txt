review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I've tried several kinds of fruit and nut bars, and these are my least favorite.  Mostly dried fruit (which is rather intensely sweet)with a few nuts which have been encased in the bars long enough to lose their crunch.  I wouldn't reorder and will probably try to coerce the grandkids into eating this box.

review/summary: Smelly and Melty but Tasted Ok
review/text: I am a person that if my food smells off, I probably won't eat it. When I opened the wrapper, I got this funny whiff of odd sugary something... I know that is not the best explanation, but it was hard to pin down. Everything was stuck to the wrapper so maybe it gives off an odor when heated. Just a guess. In regards to the natural ingredients, I appreciated that they made sure to use as few fillers as possible. I would try another flavor anytime.

review/summary: Product Arrived in Poor Condition
review/text: These bars taste fine but there is a problem with the condition of the product sent. The back of the bars are stuck (perhaps melted?) to the plastic wrapper and can only be removed by scraping off small, individual pieces. I ordered these Cranberry Almond bars along with the Kind Apricot Almond and Mango Macadamia Nut bars.  The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money.

review/summary: My Favorite Bar of All
review/text: I saw this amazing combination in a healthy bar at Starbucks.  I am a mango fanatic so ANYTHING with mangoes rule!  I was not disappointed!  Mangoes, Macadamia nuts and coconut in 1 bar?  Heaven!  I turned on several of my co-workers to these and plus they have folate and calcuim, which were not in the bars prior.  I fell in love with this bar first and eventually, it became popular because at one point, the Starbucks I used to frequent could not keep this flavor in stock!!!<br /><br />My kids do not like the flavors I ordered but there are some that I am sure that will sway them over!<br /><br />Thank you amazon for bringing these in at such great prices!!!

review/summary: Probably the best nutritional bar I've had thus far
review/text: KIND bar is little like fine dinning, they don't give you a huge portion, and its quite expensive compared to others, but the portion they give you is so good. This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well.

review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a nutritional bar. Following a gluten-free and low-allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants varieties as I follow a blood type diet and also do not love foods that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/summary: Almond cashew + omega 3 Snack Bar
review/text: This is a nice snack.  It looks fairly healthy.  It's tasty and filling, especially with a cup of tea.  It is pretty chewy and loaded with nuts.  The almonds are on the hard side, in case you have trouble chewing.  The bar is mostly nuts with some cranberries and something that tastes like a date paste holding it all together.  It tastes a little on the sweet side but not too bad.  The wrapper claims 50 % each of vitamins B3, B6, B12 - 500 mg Omega 3, all natural, gluten free, wheat free, 4 g fiber, non GMO (sorry, don't know what that means), no trans fats, 150 calories per bar/80 from fat.  Total fat 9g, o sodium, o cholesterol, 190 mg potassium, 16 g carbs (I think--wrapper hard to read), 14g sugar, 4 g protein<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent snack for you or your children's lunch box, here ya go.

review/summary: Hard to believe it's good for you
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)

review/summary: it's a sugar bomb
review/text: I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a "Low glycemic" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption.

review/text: These taste really good!<br /><br />The primary nut is almond, although there is a background of peanuts, and occasionally cashew. The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum.

review/summary: TO SWEET
review/text: May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]

review/summary: Why would anyone buy these?
review/text: I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like "gluten free" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.

Best fruit/nut or granola bar I've found. Downside, a little on the pricey side and a little high in saturated fat. But the perfect sweet "healthy" natural treat, and gluten free, a wonderful plus. You can really taste the mangoes and the macadamia nuts. A nice balance of both. These bars have calcium added but you cannot taste it, they just taste delicious.

review/summary: price v. value: five stars, even with the peanuts
review/text: UPDATE: The five stars are for the almond-walnut-macadamia bars, peanuts and all. I gave the cashew-almond-omega3 bars a try later and was somewhat disappointed with them. Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price.

review/text: Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.

review/summary: Damp & chewy
review/text: I purchase Kind bars from my retailer every day and was trying to save a few dollars. These bars arrived in a damaged carton that appeared to have experienced excessive moisture. The bars had a weird "melted" texture and were not up to standard. I would absolutely not reorder them from this source.

review/summary: Very delicious
review/text: I was really surprise about the taste. It was very delicious. You can really taste the pomegranate, blueberry and pistachio. No kidding. I love each one of those and to be combined in one great snack, that's so KIND :) Oh! The antioxidants is a plus. The reason I only give it four star is because it is high in calories and sugar. Other than that, I definitely would buy this again and recommend it. I just ordered another flavor too.

review/summary: A Nutty Brick
review/text: Taste is a personal issue so I won't comment on that.  Just be advised that compared to the Fruit and Nut variety which, if you hold one sideways, will actually slowly fold over, these are thicker and MUCH more solid.  If you have sensitive or loose teeth or maybe dentures, be forewarned.  You should take your bites with your molars or break off a piece by hand just to make sure your chompers can handle it.  I apologize to any dentists financially harmed by this review.

review/summary: Delicious & Healthy!
review/text: I have tried a number of the Kind bars at this point because I have basically fallen in love with their line of products. It started with a Cranberry Almond one from Starbucks and since then, I have started buying several boxes every month. I don't like dark chocolate very much but thought I would give the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar a try this time around.  I'm glad I did! Delicious and not at all bitter like I expected. It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.  Strong excellent flavor and loaded with healthy grains, nuts, etc. Overall, I have been very pleased with Kind and will continue to buy their products as long as they remain available.

review/summary: KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Bars
review/text: This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only....these are so good that I had to quit buying them so often because I would eat the whole box in 2 days! These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of "healthy" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!

review/text: I have tried almost all of the Kind bars.  They are all very delicious<br />and filling.  They are low in sodium and a lot the fat they contain<br />is the good kind (from nuts).  My husband is not crazy about nuts in<br />food but loves this Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew,which I think is much<br />better to satisfy his sweet tooth than a candy bar. Hope Amazon continues<br />to sell them because I can not find them in the store.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: The flavor of these is definitely what stands out immediately to me. Most healthy snack bars have either an unappetizing or bland flavor. The flavor of these is bold and the textures are great. The chewiness of the cranberries mixed with the crunchiness of the whole nuts makes for a great combination. They also are healthy for you and pretty filling. Great snack to give you energy for exercising while also helping you keep your food intake down.

review/summary: Balanced, satisfying, and not too sweet!
review/text: These bars are great if you are sensitive to sugar. I have a hard time eating things that are hight in carbs with very little fat or protein. These bars are very well balance for an energy bar and I've never had a problem eating them. They taste very fresh and not as processed as most bars. They seem to be made of whole ingredients that you can see in each bite. They aren't too sweet and won't make your blood sugar hit the roof only to crash shortly after. They provide steady hunger relief. The flavors are wonderful. I love the peanut butter chocolate and the dark chocolate cherry cashew.

review/summary: New and NOT Improved
review/text: I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste "off" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(

review/summary: Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste
review/text: On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.

review/text: I heard about this bars on QVC thought I could get a better price on Amazon & I did.  These taste so good, I like that they are all natural, they are so chewy.  While I was eating one,they were so fresh that they started bending in my hand.  I gave them to some of my co-workers to taste & they already want to order some.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy if you like a chewy, great tasting bar if you want something less chewy try the blueberry, pomagranite pistachio.  I'll be ordering more

review/summary: All natural and all fun!
review/text: Kind bars are not only all natural but gluten free as well! They are a great tasting snack (can be a meal replacement), that are filling and available in a variety of flavors. And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!

Because it is the perfect all-natural combination of proteins and fruit, is gluten free, and delivers 50% of the DV Antioxidants Vitamin A, C and E.  Oh, did I say it's delicious?!  I also carry one bar in my purse for low blood sugar when I'm away from home.  This bar certainly has my vote, and my loyalty! ~ And you can't beat Amazon's subscription prices anywhere -- with free shipping to boot!

review/summary: Not as good as the almond coconut
review/text: I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite

review/summary: The best KIND bars!
review/text: This is far and away my favorite of the KIND bars. They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

review/text: I bought a box of the Mango Macadamia KIND bars from Amazon, since I had not seen that flavor at the stores.  They have a really delicious fresh fruity tropical sort of taste.  You can actually recognize what you are eating.  There are whole macadamia nuts in the bar.  They really do not taste like any other gluten-free bars that I have tried.  The KIND bars are so much better!  My absolute favorite is the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew!  I buy several of those every time that I go to Kroger or Whole Foods.  I highly recommend these snack bars!

review/summary: Dark Choc is the dominant flavor; lots of crunch and chewiness
review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!
