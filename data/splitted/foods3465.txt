review/summary: Why I Like These Better Than 90% of K-Cups
review/text: I like strong coffee. I should get that out of the way first, because I know not everyone appreciates deep, dark coffees. Aside from Dark Magic and Mahogany, this is better than almost every k-cup I have tasted.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the filter-like bottom of these pods over the k-cup for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I've noticed no difference in freshness compared to the Nitrogen-filled, sealed k-cup.<br /><br />2. I don't have to waste filtered water and keep a paper clip handy to unclog the coffee grounds that get stuck in the needle of the Keurig because of pressure and temperature differences between where the k-cup was sealed and where it gets punctured.<br /><br />3. When brewing with these One Cups, the kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee, an aroma I had missed when using k-cups.<br /><br />4. (And I realize not everyone will feel this way) - warning, nothing but complaining ahead:<br /><br />I had begun resenting being beholden to Keurig. I dutifully sent them money each month for k-cups and each month they found new ways to make me regret it. (Not shipping the k-cups out at all, allowing my package to sit in their warehouse for a week while they assured me it was on its way, consistently being out of stock of the k-cups I wanted and most of all, whenever I called or wrote to point out a problem, issuing a coupon code for free k-cups but then repeating the problem the following month. Their customer service dept is structured in a way that they repeat problems and never resolve anything.)

review/summary: Great coffee, less waste
review/text: I was a little hesitant about ordering these after reading multiple reviews that talked about the foil breaking and spilling the grounds everywhere.  But I'm glad I went ahead and made the purchase.  The coffee tastes great and after getting almost completely through the first bag (12 "pods" in each amazon frustration-free package) I have been very happy.  No spillage and a great, strong and flavorful cup of coffee.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review/text: For the past year, I have had a monthly shipment of the Diedrich French Roast sent to my house.  When they discontinued the subscribe and save for that product I was very disappointed and had to find a new french roast.  After reading the reviews I decided to give the San Francisco Bay a try.  I was a bit skeptical about the package and I am very picky about taste, however, I just brewed my first cup and I love it!  It has a really rich flavor that seems to have more of the natural oils that you would find in a french press.  Sounds crazy, but it seems to be true!  The aroma is wonderful as well.  I haven't gotten to the end of my first cup quite yet so I don't know if there is more sediment, but hey, I like french press so a little sediment won't kill me.  I plan to make this coffee my new subscribe and save.

review/text: I love the beans, but this design of the cup is not good-- the cups are not sealed all the way and after the first few cups, the coffee starts to get stale unless you vacuum seal the k-cups.  I would say hold off on purchasing these unless you go through them quickly or can find a way to store them.

review/text: So nice to get a cup of coffee on my Keurig B60 that isn't watered down like what I get with my K-cups, especially on the large setting. I love the fact that they cost less than K-cups and are more environmentally friendly. My coffee came in 3 sealed packs of 12. I brewed one cup and put the remaining 11 in a quart-sized ziploc bag. Only complaint--not enough flavors. I would like to see flavor variety packs, and other flavors like my favorite... pumpkin.

review/summary: good value for good coffee
review/text: These coffee pods work great in the Keurig Brewer, and if you like the flavors available these are a good value, but at our local warehouse club (BJ's New England) we got a box of 80 for around $28.00. This is way less than here at Amazon. I hope they create more flavors. As for the "off taste" other reviewers are complaining about this coffee is a branch of Peets Coffee. They roast a lot differently than Green Mountain Coffee, the people who bring you the Keurig brewers. I find the coffee to be robust and a lot less bitter than Starbucks, but more bitter than, say, a Dunkin Donuts coffee.<br /><br />I would buy these again and again, but as I said, our local warehouse store had them for even less. Shop around!

review/text: I like strong coffee...I LOVE strong coffee and drink it black. This coffee is not really strong but it is quite bitter and has an odd taste to it. Reminds me of 8 o clock French Roast which I also do not like. If you like 8 o clock French Roast you will likely like this one. I like San Franciscos Fog Chaser much better and make it on the stongest setting of my brewer.

review/text: I'm somewhat of a dark coffee snob and have tried MANY dark roast pods.  These are both dark and flavorful and work great in a Keurig.  I usually like to slightly sweeten dark roast coffee, but this really doesn't need any sweetner.  Not at all bitter but still robust even on larger volumn setting.  Order by subscription and it's less than $15 for 36 pods which come vacuum packed in bags of 12 each.

review/text: Our favorite coffee is Donut Shop by Coffee People and we were curious with this new type of Kcup. Although not the same as Donut Shop this coffee has a wonderful flavor. If you like a strong full bodied flavor use the middle setting otherwise the 10 ounce setting will still give you a very full bodied coffee without being watered down. All in all we will definitely be ordering this again. The best at .44 cents a cup this is a great value.

review/text: I tried this coffee because of the price being less than most k-cups here on Amazon.  It's very strong coffee using the largest setting on our B-60 (I think it's 9.25 oz.).  Taste is not full-bodied but rather ashy tasting and flat; it smells and tastes like cigarettes and coffee.<br />Also, I have to hold the machine closed while it's brewing.  The strange non-k-cup pod will not allow the machine to close properly.  The pods need to be stored in a ziploc or other airtight container.  I'd have appreciated knowing they were not standard k-cups in advance.<br />I won't re-order despite the savings.

review/text: I purchased this product because the pods looked like they were made in a more earth friendly way. There's no hard plastic cup involved. We break down our cups after use. We compost the coffee and recycle the foil tops. The plastic cups end up in the garbage.<br />This product arrives in several heavy plastic bags for freshness. The filter pods are synthetic so they can't be composted and the tops seem to be made of plastic, not foil. The only thing I can keep out of the garbage is the coffee itself.<br />The coffee tastes good.

review/summary: Compared to other dark or bold brews...
review/text: Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning.

review/text: This is a heads up for those who like strong, fresh, French Roast coffee... It will not be found with these K-Cups.<br /><br />Freshness. The coffee in each individual K-Cup is not sealed from air. While other brands have a plastic cup and a sealed top, the base on these Cups is the coffee filter. Secondly, all of the K-Cups are packaged together in a single plastic bag. Once that bag is opened, the unused K-Cups become exposed to air. I placed my remaining K-Cups in an sealed container.<br /><br />Coffee Quality. The taste is good but the strength is less than Starbucks French Roast. While the packaging indicates a very deep roast, I did not experience that strength. If a mild French Roast brew is desired, then this coffee should work fine.

I saw it at Costco (80 k-cups for $25.99) and chose it over the Paul Newman and Starbucks brands that were 10 bucks more for 56 k-cups.  They do look different than the regular k-cups but may be more earth-friendly because the lower part is not plastic. To me, the coffee is robust and the aroma totally fills the house.  So glad I chose this over the higher priced brands.

review/summary: My favorite coffee!
review/text: This has been our favorite coffee for a couple of years now.  Used to buy the 3lb. bags at Costco and was so happy to find it in kcups for our Keurig brewer.  I also love that you have eliminated the plastic "cup" portion itself, eliminating more unrecycleable plastic to go to the landfills!

review/summary: Great value and good taste
review/text: Like many Keurig users, I have been frustrated by the lack of choices in K-cup vendors. That is, while there are many types of coffees available, only Green Mountain can make the K-cup because of their patent.  Pricing has been held fairly high and steady. It would be nice to have a choice and better pricing.<br /><br />The SF Bay coffee appears to be a good alternative. I have used it for 2 weeks and it seems to be compatible with the Keurig machine. The coffee taste is good. I prefer a stronger taste and am ok with it a bit more bitter. As a frame of reference, I find the average 7 oz cup too weak and use the 3 or 5oz setting.<br /><br />As others have noted, the coffee comes in small bags of 8 "pods" each. You have to put the open bag in a ziploc bag for storage because the coffee in the pods is exposed in the filter.<br /><br />I really like the price of the SF Bay coffee. It is good value and feel like I have a choice.<br /><br />I am not a SF Bay employee or shareholder. I just want reasonable pricing and choice.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks French Roast!!!!
review/text: Great coffee at a better price. I like this much better than Starbucks kcup french roast.  This is smoother with less bitterness than Starbucks.  I am sold. This is now my 2nd order. I love the design of the kcups better. There is so much less plastic which results in a better taste. They have a top and the remainder is paper filter. Just pop them in like regular kcups. Better for the environment while cutting down on the harmful effects of plastic absorbtion in your body.

review/text: I bought this at a local HEB in Texas for $6.99 and was skeptical but alas! this is great in my Platinum Keurig. I had decided not to use k cups anymore because the price is over the top but these will keep me going until Keurig prices come down! I brewed on the 10 oz setting and is VERY bold for me, I wwas even able to add more water through it because it was too bold for me. Love that it doesnt use all the plastic too...

review/summary: Better than I Expected!
review/text: When I opened the packaging for this coffee, at first I was concerned that they don't look like the normal Keurig K-Cups.  They have a mesh bottom instead of the plastic cover all around.  I tried them in my Keurig coffeemaker, and the cups work just fine, just as it says on the advertising.<br /><br />This is absolutely THE BEST cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  Great flavor, but no bitterness.  Usually with the Keurig, the coffee cup isn't always full, even at the highest setting.  Sometimes, the K-Cups produce a less than full, too strong cup of coffee.<br />Not this coffee!  It is absolutely wonderful and the aroma is nice also while it's brewing.  My husband came home from work shortly after I made a cup to try.  He too, was really impressed with the aroma and taste.  We will continue to purchase this with the "Subscribe and Save" feature Amazon offers.  Wonderful coffee!

review/summary: Only  Marginally Compatible as a K-Cup
review/text: Coffee is fine.  But I won't buy again.  As another reviewer reported, this is not a standard K-Cup design.  Simply a paper filter below a plastic collar.  Shorter than a K-Cup, so doesn't come in contact with the bottom punch.  Water flows through the filter and into the cup . . . albeit at a faster rate than being forced through the small bottom hole of the standard K-Cup.  Do not attempt to brew a large cup, it will be too watery.<br /><br />Twelve servings come packed in a vacuum packed plastic bag.  When you open the bag, all twelve containers are exposed, so you'll need to repackage them in a zip-lock bag if you want to keep them fresh.  They do not fit in the standard K-Cup carousel.

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: This review is from: San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 36-Count (Grocery)<br />As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: My new favorite
review/text: I like these for a couple of reasons.  First, the coffee is very good.  I like a dark, rich roast and if I put this on the smallest setting for my Keurig brewer, I get a cup comparable to when I go to my favorite local coffee house.<br />Second, I like that they are little pouches rather than the k-cup - less plastic, less waste.  And I've never had one leak coffee grounds.<br />The one drawback, as some have commented is that they may go stale faster.  They are sold in boxes of 12 (Amazon sells you 3 of those boxes at a time), so as long as you just open one at a time and you finish the box within two weeks, it is not a concern - at least I have had no problem with staleness!<br />They are also less expensive with the Subscribe and Save - a win-win all around!

review/summary: There are other ways of saving money with a Keurig machine!
review/text: Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!

review/summary: Rip Off, version 2
review/text: The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly. But even if used quickly they are weak and watery. Actually, more like dishwater. They should come with a warning label. I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design.

review/summary: wonderful!
review/text: I ordered this because of the price and when it arrived and the box said "fits MANY keurig brewers" I was a bit worried.  But the pod fit perfectly in my B70 and the coffee that it made was outstanding.  I understand the concern about it not being "airtight" but storing it in an airtight container works and I like that it is a little less plastic being put into the trash.  This, and my Ekobrew refillable k-cup, are my favorite things for my Keurig.

review/text: When I first got these K-cups I looked at them in disbelief. They had nothing in common with the regular K-cups. It looked more like just a plain coffee filter in a shape of a K-cup, sort of a look through contraption. But in the end they worked well and I have to say made one of the best cups I ever brewed in my Keurig machine. Better than Newmans and Tullys, for sure.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: I was a bit skeptical about ordering this coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's very good and the cost is a fraction of what other K-cups are going for these days. I paid less than .50 per cup. I have a Keurig Platinum Edition brewer (from America's favorite home shopping channel:) and the cups work fine in my machine. I prefer a medium roast flavor so I brew the 8 oz cup and it does not taste watered down. If you prefer a light tasting coffee you could even brew the next size up; someone who enjoys a darker flavor may want to use the smaller cup setting. The cups do fit in my Keurig carousel display holder. However, the coffee is essentially contained in a thick paper filter so if you won't be using the pods quickly then you might want to get yourself an airtight container to store the unused pods/cups to maintain freshness. They arrive in a vacuum-sealed package that is not resealable. If you're on the fence about whether or not to try this brand, go for it - you'll be glad you did.

review/text: This is right up there with Green Mountain Revv for bold, dark flavor. For packaging, it's genius. They figured out how to eliminate more than half the plastic waste involved in making and using K-cups...and without any loss of coffee quality. I end up throwing very little into the garbage by first emptying the grounds into my compost. My only suggestion for San Francisco Bay Coffee would be to use a zip-lock bag to help preserve the freshness of unused K-cups. Give this a try--its great coffee!

review/summary: great alternative to traditional kcups
review/text: I have been using kcups for a few years now and recently discovered these. I was sceptical but decided to try the SF Bay French Roast, Fog Chaser and Rainforest blends. I generally like strong, dark blends like emerils or dark magic. Overall, all 3 of the SF Bay blends are really good. The French Roast is my favorite though. It is strong and has a rich flavor and is not bitter. The fog chaser is STRONG and a bit bitter. The Rainforest is a bit less strong and has a slight bitterness. All are good strong blends but I like the richness of the French Roast. Overall these are really good and are much cheaper than "traditional" kcups which is an added bonus.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks!
review/text: I was fascinated by the description of these new K-cups and decided to take a chance after reading the reviews.  I am very pleasantly surprised at the wonderfully flavorful coffee that they made!  I am very particular about my coffee and like only very dark flavorful roasts.  I had not really been pleased with any of the K-cups--some of course were better than others--and had pretty much settled on Starbucks Verona as my favorite, but these are better!  (And--MUCH less expensive!)<br />My Keurig Platinum is at my beach home (only weekend usage and not every weekend at that!) so I was a bit concerned about this style K-cup staying fresh once the individual bag was opened.  A bag ended up staying very fresh for several weeks--of course I resealed the bag with a couple of clips as well as I could--so this is no longer a concern of mine.  I will be a regular consumer!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised...
review/text: After an awful experience with those vile tasting Grove Square wannabee Keurig cups, I was very hesitant to try anything but authentic 'K-Cup (tm)' coffee portions.  I had been eyeballing these San Francisco Bay brand here on Amazon for awhile, but hadn't purchased them.  When I saw them at Costco (by the way, they sell them in a box of 80 for about $25), I decided to take the plunge.  And they're not bad.<br /><br />As mentioned by others, the 'cup' design is essentially a paper filter filled with coffee grounds and then attached to the underside of a plastic ring which fits into the Keurig brewer.  The top is sealed off with the traditional thick foil which is pierced by the top needle of the Keurig brewer.  The bottom needle which pierces the bottom of the standard K Cups does not even come into play with these as the water is forced into the grounds.  The coffee passes through from the filter and then directly out the bottom of the  k cup holder and into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Like every traditional K-Cup these are a bit on the weak side, especially as you increase the cup size on your brewer, but I usually brew at the 8 oz setting and I thought these were acceptable.  It does have the (for lack of a better word) 'burnt' French Roast flavor which is surprisinly absent from most so-called 'dark roast' K-Cups and that is much appreciated.<br /><br />My only issues with these cups are the freshness issues.  Since the coffee is basicaly hanging out in the open air (only the paper filter separates it from the outside world) they will change taste very quickly.  I saw someone mention that the Amazon package has them in individual bags of 12.  The bos from Costco has them in individual bags of 8, so of course the manufacturer is aware of the issue of them going bad more quickly.  I personally would prefer they be bagged with quantities no more than 4 or 5 - the quantity I would use up in 2 or 3 days.  I don't have one, I think they look tacky, but if you have one of those 'Carousels' on your counter to display your k cups, I think this product would be completely incompatible with it.  My other issue is that since this coffee drips directly from the filter into the k cup holder on the machine, the holder will have to be washed regularly (probably daily) lest the coffee oils build up and change the final coffee taste even more..<br /><br />I'm generally happy with this product though, and probably will buy it again. with proper storage in an airtight container, I think the economical price evens out the freshness issues.

review/text: I drink Starbucks with my own grinder on the weekends, but during the week, due to convenience, I use a Keurig.  I have tried the Starbucks pods, and they are ok, but not as good as some of the other coffees that I have had.<br /><br />This is a strong roast.  It came in 3 bags with 12 "pods" in each bag.  They do not use the plasic cups on the outside, but just use a little coffee filter attached to a plastic disc which still fits in the keurig pod hole.  The needle in the Keurig Machine is not touched by the SF Bay pods.  This eliminates those stray grounds from finding your cup of coffee, or potentially clogging up the your brewer.  The filter bag with the coffee in it is not firm before it is used, but the grounds swell during the brewing process and the bag has a much firmer, fuller look after it is brewed.<br /><br />The coffee itself is pretty decent.  I think for the price, I would much rather pay 13 for a pack of 36, than 13-18 for a pack of 24 any day.  After the bag is opened, I put the unused coffee pods into a zip lock bag and have not had an issue with freshness.  I actually tried a green mountain donut house from a previous order, and when compared with the SF Bay, I prefered the San Fran Bay French Roast.<br /><br />EDIT: 29 Mar 2012<br />I usually leave the pod in the brewer until I brew again.  Recently noticed that the SF Bay pods have been dripping a little coffee after being brewed.  Not enough to make a significant mess, but it has been getting on the bottom of my mug and I notice a ring on my desk occassionally if I have 2 cups in the morning.  Nothing that a wet paper towel can't take care of, but just something to note.

review/summary: Good, strong, coffee (But keep in zip-lock for freshness)
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the .60 cent K-Cups I had been buying previously and I'm glad that I did. The coffee is good, aromatic, and strong. So strong that I can usually squeeze two cups from a single K-cup. It's also environmentally friendly due to the packaging containing a filter at the bottom instead of plastic. This is a double edged sword though because it tends to result the coffee losing flavor after extended periods (2-3 weeks if left out and open).<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for coffee that costs $.30 cent per cup, this is a good choice - just be sure to put open bags of it in a zip-lock for freshness.

The coffee is rich and full bodied and I like the fact that they are a little more environmentally friendly that the regular plastic cups.  I will and actually have ordered them again.  I normally use my adapter for my bagged coffee, but when I am in a hurry (or for my husband who would rather not fool with the adapter) I use the occasional K cup, or this kind now that I have tried them!

We've always enjoyed SF Bay Coffee and these pods are wonderful.  The quality of the coffee is SO much better than anything else we've tried.  Not sure about those negative reviews--nothing watery or dishwatery about the cups we are brewing.  I like the packaging much better as well, I don't want things I consume touching all that plastic that is getting heated up.  The French Roast is perfect in the morning and the Rainforest Blend is wonderful too.  The Company has also made a big commitment to the communities where their coffee is grown, including fair trade and sustainable ventures.

I like very strong coffee and San Francisco Bay French Roast delivers - rich flavor, delightful aroma... yes, due to the unique pod design (which works perfectly with my Keurig brewer) you have to store them in an airtight manner, but it's totally worth it. The only improvement I'd suggest is making their shipping bags - which have a valve like on a regular bag of coffee - zip-top, so I can use them without a rubber band after opening. But I expect that my have price implications, and I prefer the lower price over a better bag.

review/summary: Great flavor, but not as strong as other brands.
review/text: I just recently tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee one cup for the Keurig and instant brewers. I was a little leery of trying them as many people have been but decided to give them a try. They were a little less expensive and I figured if I liked them it would be worth it. I love the flavor. I don't mind the way its packaged at all. And they work great in my Keurig machine. The only difference I find is because of it being a filter holding the coffee rather than the plastic cup with a tiny hole - after the coffee is brewed it drips a while longer because of the open filter. Not a big deal - just something to mention. The other thing about the SFBay French roast that I bought - compared to the other French Roast varieties - when I use my largest cup setting on my Keurig machine (mine has 3 sizes to choose from) it is not nearly as strong. If I use the small setting, which is about half the amount - it is the same strength as other French roast K-cups. So for me - wanting to save a little money by trying the San Francisco Bay cups - it really isn't working out that way as I use 2 K-cups on the small cup setting to fill my big coffee mug. So price wise - it comes out about the same as what I have been paying for the others. But it is excellent - strong and good flavor. I kind of like that they come packaged in individual plastic bags of 12. And it is no big deal to put them in a little jar or container by my machine. I do that with my regular coffee maker - so this is no different. Not sure why others feel that is a problem. Hope this helps anyone who is considering buying this brand. I would definitely recommend it - and would give it 5 stars on taste - but just did 4 because of it not making a large mug as strong as I like.

I ordered 80 k-cups which is a great value.  I have no issues with the "cupless" k-cup. I also do not find the flavor "burnt" or "bitter" which I read in other reviews.  I find it to be a full bodied bold coffee.  It works great in my Keurig and the coffee strength is perfect.  Flavor is robust and I look forward to having a cup.  I would recommend this coffee to others who enjoy the French Roast bold coffees.

review/text: I found that not only was keeping these pods fresh by keeping them in zip locks bags a pain, but that this roast was really too bold for me.<br />I can't get anyone at home or work to drink these.<br />I will stick with Green Mountain Nantucket blend in the future.

review/summary: My complete review for all San Francisco blends is at Rainforest
review/text: Please see my complete review for all the San Francisco blends under the Rainforest blend.  Except I forgot to mention the Fog Lifter<br />I would put in the little lighter than this French Roast, which I believe is the best Bold I have tried.<br />San Francisco Brand is the only K-cup brand we purchase now that we have found all the PLUSES!

review/summary: Great coffee, reasonable price, compares well to other brands
review/text: I purchased "San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast" about 2 � weeks ago. Since then I've compared it to "Green Mountain Nantucket Blend", alternating between the two with an occasional "Tully's Italian Roast" mixed in.<br /><br />My wife prefers the slightly bolder blend of the Tully's; I prefer the Green Mountain. Both of us have found the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast" to be a good blend that's robust while not overwhelmingly bitter. It may well become our coffee of choice.<br /><br />Personally, I find the "Tully's Italian Roast" and "Newman's Own Special Blend" to have a bit of a biting after taste that I don't experience with the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast".<br /><br />I have friends who only use K-cups. I've given them samples of the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast". Their taste runs more to the bolder coffees. Both of them love the coffee.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented about the sediment left in the bottom of the cup from the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast". I agree with them, there is sediment; it's just like I experience with the "Tully's Italian Roast" and "Newman's Own Special Blend". That seems to be typical of some of the bolder blends and especially the darker roasts. It may also be that the beans are ground finer on these blends to extract more flavor in the brew cycle.<br /><br />These are not traditional K-Cups but they'll work just as well in your Keurig coffee maker. I actually think I get better water flow through the coffee with this new design. My only complaint is the need to keep them sealed rather than in the carousel where I normally store my K-Cups. The cups are packaged in a very heavy plastic bag, which is properly vented for storing coffee. I cut the top enough to remove one cup at a time, then fold over the top and put a clip on it. We drink enough coffee that the 8-cup bag only lasts a couple of days. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />Should you try it? Probably.<br /><br />I enjoy good coffee, even more when it's reasonably priced. I'm not a "coffee snob" and I'm willing to try new things. For me, the "San Francisco Bay Coffee" has been a good experience. I'll probably try some of the other blends as well. And, although I bought an 80-cup pack for this first try, I'm happy I have the choice of 36 or 12 count packs to try on the other blends.

review/summary: Fog chaser is better!
review/text: The San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count was a great value. This is my second time buying the SFB brand. I like the Fog Chaser much better and will stick with that one next time!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: The trouble I find with a lot of the Kuerig cups is that I like my coffee strong and most cups aren't strong enough if I want a full cup of coffee without using two cups at a lower volume. With these, I get the strength I want with just one.
