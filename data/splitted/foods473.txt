review/summary: awesome  rpoduct
review/text: i think i've tried all teeccino flavors and except for the chai one i pretty much LOVE them all.  the maya caffe doesnt taste like coffee but it has its own charm and it did help me to quit coffee. it has the same color and thickness like dark coffee and it gives the same warming feeling that coffee does. i add a little stevia and a little coconut cream...yum. i think the vanilla nut and chocolate mint and almond amaretto are a tiny bit better. overall its way more dramatic than tea :) and its a great way to start the day without the adrenals-exhausting-coffee-stress. also i prefer to use the  coffee drip machine over the french press. overall highly recommended :)

review/summary: Happy with Earthborn!!
review/text: We have had our youngest Pug on Earthborn since we got him (10 weeks.) We recently switched him to this to get him off the puppy food (which we recommend as well). We've always been very happy with Earthborn products. Our Pugs coats are so soft and I know it's because of this food. Our older Pug before was on a different brand and we recently put him on this now too and his coat transformed! :) The only reason I give this food 4 stars is because it gives our dogs HORRIBLE gas. Pugs are gaseous anyways, but this makes it sometimes seems lethal. We may be switching to another flavor of Earthborn because of this, but either way we are sticking with Earthborn!<br /><br />*update* after a couple weeks of daily stink episodes with the Pugs they have calmed down a lot and I feel as if the food is no longer effecting them in that way :) We did give them half their old food/half new food for most of that time so maybe that played a role too, so in other words... Earthborn is the best! I feel confident they are getting what they need in high quality and it shows!

review/summary: Best food for sensitive tummies
review/text: Since we first got our dog, a Siberian Husky named River, she always have reactions to everything. She first had a reaction to the chicken in the puppy food. Salmon was good for a while but only a certain kind. We've always had her on Blue Buffalo and our other dogs as well but it was causing too many issues. We found this brand and slowly introduced it into her bland diet per the vet's instructions and no problems yet! She only poops about twice a day & our other 2 dogs (corgis) are about to be switched to it since they poop 4-5 times a day! On the plus side as well that it's cheaper than Blue Buffalo!

review/summary: Great holistic food if your dod can't have CHICKEN
review/text: We adopted our 1.5 year old dog- Lady Pippy Waffles - from the local Humane Society last June 2010. We were told by lots of friends that WE HAVE TO find a holistic dog food because the dogs poops less, and its more solid- sorry for the details! When we first brought Lady home, she was on Science Diet. She had constant diarrhea. I finally did some research and learned that dogs can have a allergy to chicken- which caused the pooping problem- ugh. So we initially put her on another brand- which was great too, but about $15 more a bag. We have found that for the money- EARTHBORN was a great choice for Lady!  Be aware that when you open this bag of food, you will smell nothing but fish- but our dog loves, loves, LOVES IT!  Plus she only poops once a day, and has a gorgeous coat- (just not gorgeous when its all over my couch)!  Thanks!!!

review/summary: Crack for Dogs
review/text: Like others on here, I got my first bag of Lean Treats for our Shih Tzu, at the veterinarian and he loved them. He knows them as his "treats."  The bag says it is only available from veterinarians, but as I suspected everything is available on Amazon and at less than the $4 a bag the vet charges. A rattle of the bag gets him to come in the house when he is being stubborn.  He'll do anything for them.  I actually break them in half so I can give him a "treat" more often.  But these are relatively good for him....that is why they are "lean" treats.  I think it is amazing how he loves them, and clearly other dogs do too.  You can't go wrong giving your dog these.

review/text: I got a bag of Lean Treats for my dog at his last visit to his Vet and he loved them. He was hooked. The bag said available only from Veterinarians, not so, I found them on Amazon. I bought more and my dog is in gluttony heaven now. He actually shakes all over when I pick up the bag to give him one. Giving him his pills is no problem now since the treats are soft and a pill can be pushed into it and it's down his throat before he can taste his meds.

I've served this to many people without telling them there's anything out-of-the-ordinary about it, and the usual comment is "what is this pasta, and where can I get it?". Not kidding. It really is that good. I'd recommend any of their pasta styles; I typically keep at least 3 on hand - Linguine, Penne, and Bucatini. For some reason, the Bucatini seems to be a really big hit with everyone.

review/summary: Great taste, I was surprised it was this yummy!
review/text: The taste of this kettle corn is mildly sweet, not overpowering & not at all artificial-tasting.  I'm wondering if the other reviewer tried a totally different product, because this product has clear white kernals of popped corn, and there is not the first hint of yellow residue anywhere.<br /><br />The best feature:  94% fat-free!  Although I am a bit confused and uncertain over what the actual fat content of a bag is (read the label of unpopped kernals v.s. popped corn--whaat?); as near as I can tell it is 2g of fat per popped bag, which yields approximately 3 cups of popped corn.  Excellent!  Since this is kettle corn, it is a great fix for a sweet tooth that also wants a crunchy snack.  I was pleasantly surprised, & will have this in my cupboard 24/7 for those snack-attack moments without guilt.  Definitely give this one a try!

I was afraid that Dynasty had discontinued it.<br /><br />When I lived in California, I just picked this tea up weekly, at the grocery store. A while back I moved to a very rural area of the Missouri Ozarks. Nobody carried this particular Dynasty tea, which has always been a favorite of mine.<br /><br />I refused to use the last 2 bags I had... until my Amazon shipment arrived. Just in case I had a tea emergency. I cannot list any specific health benefits of this tea, I just know how it makes me feel. It makes me feel better, when I am coming down with something... and it cheers me up, when I am sad. The mild blend, and the soothing aroma, can be the best part of a very rough day. It is so good, I drink it ICED in the summer.<br /><br />Please continue to sell this tea. It is GREAT!!!

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Sugar
review/text: If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/summary: Needs more specific information in the description
review/text: I try to buy organic products whenever possible; so I decided to try this. I usually do not use milk quickly enough to justify buying a gallon of fresh milk; so this sounded good. I cannot find it in any of the stores in my area and Amazon is easy to deal with so this seemed like a good choice. Organic Valley should be a bit more forthcoming with specifics about this product; since many of us may not be familiar with it. I have used a lot of other nonfat dry milk products, but this is quite different. Although the actual product description does not state that it is "non-instant", if you enlarge the picture, you can just barely read it on the front of the package. The mixing instructions on the package tell you that you can stir or shake to mix the milk, but your blender or an electric mixer are probably your best options. Stirring produces a very lumpy, undissolved mess. I called Organic Valley and spoke with a very complacent woman who informed me that she puts the dry milk and water in a jar and shakes it vigorously to mix it. She also informed me that since it is not an instant product, once it is mixed, you will need to stir or shake it again if it is not used immediately; because the mix will begin to settle. Once it is actually dissolved, the taste is wonderful: it tastes absolutely fresh.

review/summary: Quality and convenience
review/text: I do quite a bit of baking, and when a recipe calls for milk, I usually add dry milk powder to the dry ingredients and then add water for the liquid. Over the years, I've tried many different dry/instant milks. This is the best!<br /><br />The convenient pouch is resealable, and easy to open wide enough to insert a measuring cup. To me, that is preferable for measuring over a small pour spout. The milk powder itself is silky in texture, and dissolves quickly. It doesn't seeem to lump and clump like many do. The flavor is excellent, like all Organic Valley products.<br /><br />While I don't personally reconstitute dry milk for drinking by the glass, for those who do, this could be a good choice due to the ease in dissolving and the fine flavor.<br /><br />Because the seal is quite secure, it is also more shelf stable than most. This has earned an ongoing place in my pantry.

review/text: The 4-pack of dried milk is a great way for a very small family to use powdered milk without worrying about it losing quality before it is all used up (once packets are opened, they begin to "age").  And this is organic!<br /><br />I add several tablespoons to the milk in yogurt making, to thicken the yogurt, use it as creamer in my coffee while traveling, and enjoy drinking the rehydrated milk if I run out of milk before my next trip to the grocery store.  It doesn't all dissolve instantly, and that is normal and healthy (if it did, it would not be the real thing).  But it dissolves quickly enough when I use a spoon to stir it and press any lumps against the side of the container.  A blender might work, but I don't use one.<br /><br />Ordering was easy, the shipment arrived in good condition before I expected it.

review/text: Once mixed the milk is quite good.  I use it to make yogurt also.  However, it is such a fine powder it takes a blender and warmish water to get it to dissolve, and with a blender it foams up so much it overflows. And clouds of milk powder can float around the kitchen!  I also wish the package had amounts for making quarts, as well as just cups.  Yes, I can do the math, but having it there would help.  I also looked for recipes on their website, such as yogurt, using their dried milk and there were none.

review/summary: Good for baking (with a little trick)
review/text: I use Organic Valley Nonfat Dry Milk Powder for baking bread regularly. However, there is one simple rule you have to follow every time you bake with it. You need to always mix it thoroughly with other dry ingredients before you mix in the wet ingredients. Otherwise, you will get little hard lumps of dry milk that will never dissolve no matter how long you work on it. The consistency of the lumps is almost like raw rice that has been soaked in water. So, regardless what you bake, just remember to mix the milk powder with the rest of the dry ingredients very well. Even a little mount of milk powder that's missed in the mixing will give you some hard lumps. Mixing it in advance with water or other wet ingredients is not a good answer either. That's what happened to me when I tried to reconstitute it to the equivalent of a cup of liquid milk when I used it for the first time (my recipe calls for liquid milk). I ended up throwing 3 tablespoon of it and started over. I can't imagine how some people can use it for drinking or in coffee without having to chew or swallow lumps all the time. I can understand it for shakes or smoothies. If you have tips of how to reconstitute it free of lump, please share it.

review/summary: Only organic powdered milk I've found yet
review/text: Our family has decided that it would be wise to store a year's supply of food as a hedge against inflation as well as preparation for food supply disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters. Rather than just toss a bunch of mysterious items in the basement that would get thrown away in 20-30 years, I've been buying bulk grains from my local natural food store and cooking with powdered milk and eggs and such.<br /><br />The local big-chain natural foods store sells this product in this size package, and I've been buying it there. Organic Valley's website says they make a 25 lb bag, but I've never seen that offered for sale. Amazon's regular price is a tad higher than my local store, but the Subscribe & Save price will save me about 10% off, so I'm signing up.<br /><br />We are not drinking powdered milk or using it on cereal, but we've had zero taste issues incorporating it into all of our cooking. If anything, the meals I'm making have improved dramatically since I'm making so much from scratch using freshly ground flour, etc.

review/summary: organic dry milk
review/text: I wanted organic dry milk and was unable to purchase it locally. I had to adjust to using it, but love it now.  Less of the product is required for the same amount of milk than in the regular dry milk product to which I am accustomed. I have also discovered that it is best to put the dry milk at the bottom of my cup, rather than stir it into hot liquid.  I also mix unsweetened dark chocolate powder with the dry milk before pouring in hot liquid (coffee).  Pouring the dry milk into hot liquid makes it clog together.  Before I realized that it would mix well if I scooped the milk in first, I ordered a little smoothie mixer and that is the best way to go, but it really is not needed as long as one remembers to put the milk in first, then stir in the hot liquid. This makes an inexpensive, low calorie mocha-type drink that is often better than the real thing.

review/summary: Best nonfat dry milk powder ever consumed
review/text: When one reconstitutes this milk powder with purified water to remove the herbicides and other pest controls building up from Genetically Modified herbicide tolerant crops, they will find this tastes just like the fresh milk from Organic Valley's family of small farmers across the country.<br /><br />Reconstitution means a good job blending in a blender, not just stirred, because this is non instant powdered milk. It will take a bit longer to prepare, but the taste is worth it.<br /><br />I will not purchase herbicide tolerant crops for my family.  Yet, the USDA and the Obama Monsanto Administration has deregulated soy, corn, cotton, canola, sugar beets, and alfalfa (the latter of which needed no herbicides previously) to be incessantly sprayed with Roundup and other dangerous weed killers.  This means that the crop fed to dairy cows, horses, and other livestock will be contaminated with foreign organisms (not plants unlike hybrids) to make a patentable plant which Monsanto owns for the purpose of forcing farmers to spray more Roundup, so more money can be made by Monsanto.  Less than 7 percent of all alfalfa had been sprayed with herbicides previously. But, all that will change if the dairy industry purchases GMO seeds for alfalfa.<br /><br />Our potable water supplies all over the country are becoming contaminated, although studies have been blocked by Monsanto.  Where studies were done in other countries, like Denmark, it was found that extremely high levels of Roundup (or Glyphosate, the trademark for the active ingredient) were building up in the potable groundwater.  AND, they are not planting GMO seeds, unlike the USA. Because of their studies, they have instructed the Danish farmers not to spray with Roundup for at least 3 years.  But, in the USA, farmers are instructed to read labels and are taught to use chemical intensive agriculture; studies are blocked from being published, and even physicians are not given the right to know.<br /><br />In Taiwan, a study was done on 93 persons who tried to commit suicide by ingesting Roundup. The symptoms were very much like gastrointestinal reflux disease that has affected people all over the USA who have consumed heavily sprayed Roundup Ready (and GMO) crops.  Even babies have GERD and the causes are unknown because studies have been blocked by Monsanto.<br /><br />Monsanto's presence has been at the USDA, and Michael Taylor, first a lobbyist, then the company's Vice President, was appointed to the US-FDA by the first President Bush and has been there ever since. Myriad Monsanto employees are at the FDA and EPA making policy and their policy only benefits their company, not our health or the health of our children.<br /><br />Where studies have been done outside the USA, researchers and physicians have found growing levels of new allergens, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems with GMO plants.<br /><br />Organic Valley is committed to growing the best alfalfa for their cows and for that reason, and since organic agriculture prohibits use of GMO seeds, I'm buying all the Organic Valley powdered nonfat dry skim milk I can find with its long shelf life.  I will not give my family GMO milk. We will stop drinking and eating dairy products, once all milk contains GMO's because pollinators carry them from crop to crop or the wind blows the pollen well beyond the six mile limit claimed by the USDA.  We will buy Organic Valley but not heavily sprayed herbicide tolerant GMO alfafa fed dairy products.

review/text: If you haven't tried powdered milk in years, this is worth a new try. It tastes fine. Plan on using a blender to make it easiest and fastest. Great if you are somewhere fresh milk is hard to find. Good for adding to smoothies as a protein booster. Has many uses.<br /><br />I'm taking off one star because the packaging is nearly useless once it is opened. It has a zipper plastic bag closure which does not function well with a fine, powdery substance. The "tracks" clog and becoming un-closable almost at once. The bag also has an envelope shape that tends to flatten, making scooping powder out difficult.<br /><br />Plan to dump it all out into a wide mouth canister or container with a tight lid. It is efficient packaging for travelers however, as it is light weight and takes up the least possible space. Great product for camping/travel, but you will probably still need to double bag with ziplock bags after opening because of the seal problem.

review/summary: What I expected
review/text: It is impossible to find organic dried milk and we are 100% organic in our house.  I use this milk for making bread and in my pancakes.  It isn't instant as other people have noted so it would take some work, most likely a blender, to mix it up.  But for what I use it for it is perfect and the price is good.  I find that I increasingly turn to Amazon for Organic dry goods (flour, oil, sugar, etc.)  They have a better selection and much better prices than the local Natural Foods store or even the grocery store which carries some organics.

review/summary: Best Non-Fat Dry Milk on the Market!
review/text: I am a very picky person when it comes to non-fat dry milk.  I specifically ordered this product for a dry cocoa mix or hot chocolate mix I was making for friends during the holidays.  This Organic Valley Non-Fat Dry Milk makes it taste just like milk!  My mix turned out perfect - tastes just like Carnation or Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate Mix when you add water to it.  Thanks for offering this product!

review/summary: Great for coffee and strawberry Quik while camping
review/text: We car camp with a tent and a bunch of coolers, so keeping food chilled is always an issue.  I am currently pregnant, and with a camping trip coming up, I was concerned about drinking the calcium I needed.  I came across this product and we gave it a try during our 5 day beach camp.  It was perfect!!  We used it as the creamer in our coffee, and I also brought a protein shaker bottle and strawberry Quik for a tasty drink that only needed water.  It was sooo nice to have this option!  It didn't need to be refrigerated, and packed very easily.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the powder sticks to the side of the pouch, so when you scoop the powder out, it tends to stick to your hands.  The pouch makes it easy to pack, but I will likely look for a hard sided container to store it in to make it easier to dispense.  The bag is only halfway full, too, so there's no avoiding sticking your hand in there unless you pour it out.<br /><br />This powdered milk is now a camping staple for us.  It tastes great, is organic, and gives us yummy beverage options.

review/summary: Terrible texture, difficult to use
review/text: This is unlike any dry milk I've ever used.  It's a super fine texture, so that when I add it to something it turns into glue.  I have always used dry milk in my coffee; unlike half and half it doesn't go bad, and unlike instant creamer it's not artificial.  But this stuff is terrible.  I wish it wasn't so expensive or I'd just toss the bag.

review/summary: A bit difficult to mix
review/text: Like most people who routinely buy organic products, I'm accustomed to mark-ups in the 10% to 50% range. I usually think it's worth it to know what I'm ingesting. Thus, I would overlook the price of Organic Valley Organic Nonfat Dry Milk Powder were it not for the fact that getting the powder to dissolve in water is nearly impossible. Per the instructions on the package, I used cold (chilled) water. I tried shaking it vigorously - again, per package instructions - to no avail. "Put it in the fridge for a while so it can dissolve," I thought. Bad idea. When I took it out, the undissolved lumps of powder had formed a crust the exact consistency of Spackle on the surface of the water. "Ah, a whisk! That'll do the trick," was my next bright idea. No, the lumps of Spackle adhered to the wires of the whisk with a large mass of partially dissolved powder stuck accumulating in the center. I thought of taking a pitcher of water and milk powder to my local paint store and asking them to put it in the gadget that shakes the living heck out of paint, but that seemed like too much trouble and they might not appreciate my not buying any paint. I did get satisfactory results with an immersion blender, finally, so if you happen to have one on hand, by all means give Organic Valley Organic Nonfat Dry Milk Powder a try. By the way, if you do buy some and find a way to make it dissolve in water, please let me know. I look forward to hearing how you did it.<br /><br />P.S. Once it's mixed, the milk is good, but a little on the sweet side.

review/text: I normally did not buy dry milk for anything because it could not compare with the regular milk. However, I changed my mind after trying Organic Valley non-fat dry milk. It is good to prepare deserts but it is also good to use as regular milk. If you have a blender of any kind and you add the proper amount of water and dry milk it mixes very well even in cold water and you can make the best cappuccino ever!<br />Another plus...it does not go bad as fast as regular milk....!

review/summary: EXCELLENT Source of Calcium!
review/text: Processing from fluid to dry has little impact on the nutritional value of nonfat milk, contrary to the last reviewer. It contains ALL the protein, vitamins, and minerals found in fresh fluid, nonfat milk. This is a major ADVANTAGE, not con, of this product. My background is nutrition but you can look it up: about 300 mg per serving calcium is an excellent source, and a great way to boost protein & calcium without the added fat. The extra effort in mixing is well-worth the product's benefits. I use it to make my own plain, nonfat yogurt--works great.

review/text: If you are looking for a high quality dry milk product then this is it. This dry milk is organic which makes it free of pesticides, antibiotics and all the other mess that we find in regular milk today that isn't good for us. It mixes out very well with warm water. I did not find it to be too powdery at all it was just right. I bought this to take with me overseas on my 2 week vacation because I only drink organic milk and I wanted to be sure that I would have it for tea/cereal /etc. I was very happy with the dry milk I mixed a cup every morning with warm water and it was delicious in my tea. This product states non-instant but it really don't take but 5 mins. to prepare a cup of milk with the dry milk. How much more quicker could it be? Buy this product if you are looking for high quality great tasting dry milk!

review/summary: Organic Valley contains NO GMO's
review/text: This product tastes like fresh milk but it needs to be well blended for the milk powder to get into solution. I use purified water, which  is healthier than the increased herbicides and other volatile organic compounds in tap or bottled waters.<br /><br />Organic Valley is that this is a cooperative of small certified organic farmers who care about the quality of grasses and alfalfa feed their cows receive, because healthy cows create healthy milk for healthy consumers.<br /><br />The Obama Administration has given into the demands of the mafia of the biotechnology-pesticide industry and has deregulated all herbicide tolerant genetically modified alfalfa so Monsanto can sell more petrochemical herbicides.  USDA Secretary Vilsack acknowledges that this will put organic farmers out of business in the Environmental Impact Statement.<br /><br />I'm buying all the Organic Valley non-instant milk powder I can obtain for the health of my family, which I only drink in emergency situations. And, when organic farmers cannot keep their feed being contaminated from wind blown or pollinators carrying genetically modified organisms, it will be an emergency!<br /><br />GMO's are created by scientists in a laboratory who do not test for safety of the animals or the people who may eat their seed crops. They have isolated the DNA of  a foreign gene from bacteria and shot it into the seeds with a gene gun or a vector for the sole purpose of selling more toxic herbicides. Scientific, peer-reviewed studies have been blocked on GMO seeds, which manufacturers claim are safe. This action does not denote safety. To me it says the biotechnology-pesticide industry wants to keep Congress and the American people ignorant!<br /><br />I trust Organic Valley nonfat milk because they protect the health of their cows, feed crops, and ultimately our health. I will only buy organic.

review/summary: Kid tested, husband approved!
review/text: First I have to say that the reviews here have been helpful in understanding how to make this milk powder delicious. The trick to lump free milk is too let it sit over night. I use a recycled glass jug that once held organic juice. add the powder first to the jar, 3 tablespoons for each 8oz of water (more if you like it a little creamier) then add the water. Make sure your container will hold the powder plus water with enough room to shake it up. Put the lid on tight and shake shake shake!<br />Leave in the fridge overnight, and shake before using. No lumps, no problem! Use within 3 days after mixing. This came in handy during all the winter storms we had and were snowed in. Didn't have to put up with the rush on milk, we had the ability to "make our own" as needed.<br /><br />We love to have this on hand when we are running low on milk. In cereal, the kids can't tell the difference. My husband and I can drink it as we would any other skim milk. He was pleasantly surprised at how good it tastes.

However, since Amazon has a No-return policy for grocery items, they refunded my account, and I kept the coffee pods.  I will say, I did cut some of these open and used the K-Cup "use your own coffee" thing, and tried this coffee.  It is very good.  Other than the hiccup with the purchase and it not being for use with the Keurig machine, it makes a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Inconsistant
review/text: I've used a lot of WP coffee pods, and this is my least favorite. It made a weak cup of coffee, and was inconsistant from cup to cup. Some were weaker than others.<br />I would not buy it again.

review/summary: wolfgang puck columbian coffee pods
review/text: This is very good coffee when used in a coffee maker designed to use it.  In reading these previous reviewers comments, I cannot believe that someone would give a poor review on a product based solely on their own stupidity and inability to order the correct type of coffee for their make of machine.<br /><br />It is one thing to give a poor review if you don't like the taste, you should review the product with your honest opinion.<br />Don't blame the product because it wasn't made to fit your coffee maker that is just wrong.  Keurig and Senseo are designed to use a specific means of brewing coffee and thus require a specific type of container to hold and brew the coffee correctly for that particular machine.<br /><br />Very few pods besides Senseo work in their machine, and Keurig does not take pods at all without the use of and adapter which doesn't work very well either, they use K-cups.  If it wasn't designed to work in your coffee maker, it probably will not<br />taste right either.  Read the instructions with your coffee maker and use the product that is designated to use in the machine.<br />If you try a different brand, don't blame the manufacturer of a product that was not specifically made to use in your machine, it is not fair to the manufacturer.

review/summary: Doesn't fit Senseo machine
review/text: These only fit if you use one pod in the 2pod container, they are too large for the Senseo  machine and almost broke it.<br />Coffee is weak also.

review/summary: not tasty
review/text: I'm sorry to report that this coffee is just not tasty!!  It has a sour taste!!  Not sure if this is "right" but I really don't like it.  Also, it's really hard to use these pods in my Sense machine.  I usually use 2 pods in the larger basket to make a large mug of coffee.  2 pods are too big for the large basket, so I've had to use 1 pod in the smaller one, and make 2 small cups to equal my large mug.  Pain in the neck...  I'm really sorry I ended up with 3 BOXES of this stuff!!  At least they're individually packaged, so I can save them for "coffee emergencies".
