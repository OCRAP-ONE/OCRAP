review/summary: Received a batch with different taste
review/text: I am a fan of these chocolate milk and a subscriber on Amazon. After stopping my subscription for a few month due to moving, I receive a 12 pack box in March. The packing has changed slightly that the place where to straw goes in has become a small hole just big enough for the straw.<br /><br />However, the most important thing is it taste different now. It seems to be less sweeter, but I don't like it. It taste more like Costco's Kirkland version.<br /><br />Otherwise, by mistake, I also receive another box of 18 from Amazon, and these have the same packaging as I used to get. The milk taste just as it used to be. I continue to order the 18-pack boxes and they have tasted the same so far. So I am not sure why the 12-pack taste different.

My kids prefer the chocolate milk best cold, so I keep some in the fridge, too.  It's a great way to get them some calcium and protein on the go.

review/summary: The Chocolate is His Favorite.
review/text: We have a three-year-old toddler. He's a somewhat picky eater and it's always hard to tell just what he might like at any particular time. One thing is certain, no matter what food mood he might be in he will almost always accept milk. Of the various milks available, he likes the flavored varieties best and chocolate milk is his first choice. At first we were buying it in large containers. Then we switched to these small Horizon 8-ounce aseptic cartons. They're just about the right size for a serving. Plus, they're easy to store. Furthermore, I can easily transport them about for a snack on the spot. Just today, for example, we took him to a restaurant and, as you might guess, he would have none of it. Well, I reached in my pocket and pulled out a chocolate milk for him. That solved the lunch problem. We like the size and the convenience. The kid just loves the product, especially the chocolate. Having them around makes for a great snack for the rest of us too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Converted My Husband to Chocolate Milk
review/text: After decades of never touching an ounce of chocolate milk, Horizon converted my husband to chocolate milk so intensely that he now goes through his carton in the fridge faster than I go through mine.  I have had to resort to putting my name on one container and his on another so that he doesn't drink mine too (I am a lifelong chocolate milk fan and this is my favorite brand).  This size, by contrast, is ideal for him to carry to his work fridge or alongside him when he is going elsewhere. Although the sugar content may be high, I've discovered this milk pretty much eliminates the need for both of us to wolf down chocolate bars.  So we are both getting a lot more calcium and protein, plus reduced fat, than we were with our chocolate bar binges.

review/text: I love St. Dalfour's.  It is lighter than some other morning black teas, but the doesn't detract from the complex flavor.  As an organic black tea, it doesn't turn acid in the stomach, nor does it get bitter when you leave the tea bag in the cup.  I also like the fact that they do not use metal staples in the bag, tag or string.  No tainting of flavor, better for my compost and no sparks if I (gasp) microwave it.

review/summary: Complex yet pure.
review/text: I agree with all the previous reviews. This tea is by far the best black tea I have tasted. Even though the manufacturer's recommendation for steeping is 1 - 3 min upon personnel preference, it won't get bitter if you leave the bag in the cup for longer. (Since I like my tea strong, I often leave it there for 10 min or even just forget about it... ) I absolutely love the rich flavor! First sip usually brings complex notes of fruits and spices. I personally feel it's less astringent than Twining Dajeeling. It has a subtle lingering aftertaste which is never bitter or rough. So I feel it kinda deserves an extra star for this. It's hard to describe a tea that is this rounded yet complex. Since I am no pro, I am not sure if this complexity is achievable without blending teas from multiple origins but the net result is great. I like it with or without milk. Both are so delicious that sometimes I just gulp it down...

review/summary: Excellent tea for Kombucha
review/text: We have been using this tea to make our batches of kombucha, and it turns out delicious, and slightly bubbly.  We are pleased with it as well as reassured that it is certified organic by several organisations instead of just one.<br /><br />It also drinks very well as a traditional breakfast tea.  It seems to have a bit less of the bitterness of standard black teas, espcially if one accidentally lets it steep a little too long.  The cost is reasonable, since you get more bags per box than with some of the other gourmet teas.<br /><br />By the way, they have this nifty way that they have attached the string that encloses the string in the bag and it is attached in the bag's seal.  You just gently pull the tag, it is pulls out of the bag - no staple to hold it in place, therefore no metallic taste or residue in the tea.  Very nice:)<br /><br />Subscribe ans save will be an excellent way to keep this regularly coming to the house.  Thanks again, amazon!

IMHO the sun does nothing for the tea, it is just the slow brewing process with warm, not hot water which makes sun tea taste so good.<br /><br />The use of boiling water brings out the worst in tea...the brew gets cloudy and will develop a film on the surface.

review/text: I use to be a bigelow tea drinker, but was getting tired of the increasing amount of cloudy stuff coming off the steeping tea bag. I noticed the more cloudy the tea bag the worse the taste. Also, couldn't steep it for long before it'd develop a raunchy taste. None of that w/ this tea. This tea can & needs to steep for several minutes...otherwise it's a bit weak..but, it will steep to a nice full flavored tea. I brew 1 tea bag in 1 cup water, let it steep 15 min., then pour it over a big tall glass of ice..perfect ice tea. This tea is crystal clear, never cloudy, & doesn't develop the "raunch" no matter how long it sits out.

review/text: I am the mom of a 5 year old celiac, so it is very important to be able to make cut out sugar cookies and have them be decent. I have tried MANY gluten-free sugar cookie doughs. I have labored in the kitchen for hours mixing my own flours only to suddenly not have enough energy to actually bake something once I've finished.<br /><br />This mix is quite the blessing!! It makes a dough that is actually very easy to work with (not sticky at all like with other mixes). Mix it up, and don't even bother putting it in the fridge for hours! I roll it out between two pieces of parchment paper, make my cut outs (even the more detailed cutters work!), peel up the dough between the shapes, slide the piece of parchment paper onto a cookie sheet, and minutes later I now have the perfect cookies!! We roll ours out a little thick because we like them soft, and even then, the details of the cutter remain.<br /><br />And for the cookie artists out there, this mix works well with the cookie craft books, which I also highly recommend....<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580176941">Cookie Craft: From Baking to Luster Dust, Designs and Techniques for Creative Cookie Occasions</a>

review/summary: Scrumptious Gluten-Free Cookies!
review/text: This is the third product that I've tried from the "Gluten Free Mama" company; and boy am I pleased!<br /><br />Tonight I made this fairly easy cookie mix for the first time.  It actually needed a little more milk than the recipe called for (2-3 TBSP).  I think it ended up being around 1/2 cup or a tad over.  I didn't use an electric mixer, so maybe that would have made the mixing easier than it was for me.  Instead of just grabbing a TBS of mix and putting the round ball on the cookie sheet, this recipe actually tells you to roll out the dough and use a cookie cutter.  Because I didn't have one, I ended up using the mouth of a plastic champagne flute.  I guess you're supposed to have 15 cookies (depending on the size of the cutter), but I had a few more.  You also might have to put it on for a couple of minutes more than what is said (12-14).  Make sure that the bottom doesn't overly brown- even if the top doesn't look like it.<br /><br />The cookies are mouth-watering on their own (by the way, there's also a "snickerdoodle" recipe on the back); or you can make a little homemade frosting/glaze.  I made a lemon frosting for mine (powdered sugar, milk, lemon flavoring, lemon juice).  ...I absolutely love the ingredients of all the "G F M" mixes I've tried!  There's no corn meal, or anything to make it have a gritty texture (like some gluten free mixes).  I had really favored the "Betty Crocker" Gluten Free Chocolate Chip mix before I tried this.  Now while I still love the "B C" GF mix; I'm leaning more towards this mix!  The mix is so versatile, that if you wanted chocolate chips in it, I don't see what harm it would do by adding some!! (I'll have to try it next time, and update my comment..)<br />I really hope that Amazon will start selling this mix soon!<br /><br />  By the way, the previous 2 products from "G F M" that I've tried (and love) are the "Pancake & Waffle Mix", and the "Coconut Flour Blend".  The pancakes are the absolute best that my family and I have tried, and the flour blend is so versatile (we've used it in sweet breads, & a cake mix)!  I actually first started using it as an alternative to dusting my chicken pieces before I fried them.  It doesn't have any weird taste; in fact the unsuspecting taster would swear it was normal flour!

review/text: This mix is easy to use and delicious.  I added ground chia seeds (grind in the coffee grinder) to up the nutritional value and put colored sugar sprinkles on top to up the fun for the kids.  My gluten free daughter and non-gluten free son both love these.  I have tried some not so fabulous mixes and this is absolutely wonderful!

review/summary: Very good but watch out for sodium content
review/text: I like this tomato soup a lot. It's smooth and has a sweetness to it that is very pleasant. I can't say it tastes or looks very much like tomato soup I've had before, but it's still very good. The color is more orange than you might expect, making it look like carrot soup. The third ingredient is evaporated cane juice, which is unusual.<br /><br />Hot or cold, this soup tastes good. The carton is made of paper (environment-friendly) and has a resealable lid. The rectangular shape is easy to store in the fridge, although the spout isn't the best design for pouring. Some of the soup dribbled down the side after I finished pouring a serving into my bowl. Sodium content is a bit high, at 26% of your recommended daily intake per serving. They are counting 2/3 cup as a serving, which is not realistic for a hungry person. There are 6 servings in here. 1 serving is 70 calories (20 from fat).<br /><br />The only ingredient I didn't recognize is disodium inosinate. Everything else is natural, like tomato paste, salt, water, garlic powder, corn starch. Much better than Campbell's Tomato Soup. Definitely give it a try. Made in NJ.

review/text: I buy this at local grocer but it has been out of stock lately. Since my one outdoor cat is fussy he will eat nothing but this food. Not even the other flavors, has to be the grillers blend. SO, I had to find it online and while Amazon was the least costly of the options its still too high. I pay roughly $12 for the large bag at the grocer. The 9 pounds in this 3 pack were a couple dollars more. Even with prime shipping its too much. Buy at Walmart or grocer.

review/summary: He Loves This Grillers Blend, and All Other Cat Foods.
review/text: I have two cats, both neutered males. One has to receive special prescription food because he has a tendency to develop little crystals in his urinary tract. The food is expensive. The other cat is not at all finicky and will eat anything that is presented to him and beg for more. Well with him I just buy the available foods on the grocer's shelves and I try to rotate the brand and type around from time to time. Actually, I don't think it makes a bit of difference but I do it anyway. How would you like to eat exactly the same thing day after day? Well, this time the grocer had a couple different kinds and one was Friskies Griller Blend. A small tab says it's made by Purina. Hmmm. I always thought they were two different companies. Friskies, Purina, Whatever, The cat just loves it! Of course, he loves all cat foods so I guess it doesn't really matter and he always seems to keep in perfect health.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I have been on this journey to find healthy alternative(s)for quite some time.  I was reading in a book about flushing the fat and this was the only substitute recommended; so I went to whole foods the next day hoping that they carried the product "stevia plus".  Although, the label did not specify that it was the "plus" version - I took a chance to purchase it.  Now, I'm so glad that I did.  I'm very impressed by it's flavor.  I had tried a few other stevia products but the taste was unbearable.  This is my first review, so I hope someone can appreciate this recommendation.

review/text: After a lot of trial and error I have decided that Stevia is the best substitute sugar product for me.  SweetLeaf is a good product because the Stevia is still in the powder form, not changed to a granulated form. Reading about stevia I found out that the basic powder or liquid form is better for your health and I find the taste just as good.<br />In our house we use SweetLeaf for coffee and tea, of course, but also cereal, oatmeal, fruit desserts and plain yogurt.  We have not missed regular table sugar.

review/summary: Only one I use
review/text: I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention. They've perfected Stevia a great deal since the early days when I would dip a toothpick into the bottle and still use too much. It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.<br /><br />I grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.<br /><br />There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.

review/text: This is a great sweetenr. Pleasant flavor, just enough sweet to satisfy. I will say, though, that prior to lessening the sugar in my daily intake, this wouldn't have been enough, and it would have tasted bitter. I tried Stevia a year ago, and I couldn't take the bitterness. But now that I use very little sugar, this is perfect. I use NO other fake sweeteners of any kind, and add only real honey and maple syrup to my baking.

review/summary: Does ALL stevia have a bitter aftertaste?
review/text: I bought this at my local health food store some time ago because it was on sale.<br />After tasting it, I understand why it was 50% off.<br />Ugh!<br />It has a somewhat bitter aftertaste which you can avoid by just using less. Of course "using less" would defeat the purpose of using a sweetener in the first place, wouldn't it?.<br />This stuff also made me gaseous.<br />I will, however, use up the box because I must admit, this is not the worst stevia I've ever tasted. Some stevias I've tried were so nasty, I HAD to throw them away.<br />At this point, I've not found a stevia that actually tastes like sugar.<br />My search (for a sugar replacement) continues!<br /><br />Edit: 9-18-12<br />I've been using this product for about a month, but recently started using it on a regular basis, thus my review above.  I just discovered something which may interest those of you reading this review.  This product contains "inulin", which is a soluble fiber.  How convenient is that?  Fiber in a sweetner!<br />:>)<br />Edit: 9-21-12<br />I am upgrading this product from 3 stars to 5.  I'm using MORE Sweet Leaf instead of less to get the sugary flavor I love.  Once you get used to the aftertaste (which is NOT as bitter as others), this is actually a great stevia.<br />I will repurchase.

(It even makes my Thursday Night Spaghetti border on gourmet-ish when I also include a little fresh Parmesan.)  I've tried some other blends from our supermarket, but nothing else tastes as fresh or balanced as Drogheria & Alimentari.  It's not too hot for my youngest, (she's 8), but it has a enough kick for the rest of the clan.<br /><br />Having said that, a little of this goes a long way.

review/summary: Drink Everyday, by it by the Case!
review/text: I love green tea, have been pleased with many of the Bigelow Tea flavors.  My favorite, by far, is the Green Tea with Peach.  It is not overpowering peach flavor, but you can definitely taste it and smell the delicate aroma.  It pairs excellently with green tea and I religiously drink it EVERY morning when I wake up.  I do not find a need to sweeten it, although if I make iced tea with it, I will sometimes add a touch of light agave nectar for a little change.  One tea bag, properly steeped, is a highlight of my morning and because of the individual tea bags (which are packaged so as not to get torn or damaged by the elements) come with me in my bag and I drink it at work and throughout the day.  I drink this tea so much that I have been subscribed to receive my Bigelow Green Tea with Peach, by the case (yes, the pack of 6 20-ct boxes) every few months.  It's inexpensive, much more economical (due to my level of consumption) than anywhere else I might try to purchase it.<br /><br />I definitely recommend to anyone who loves a nice aroma and pleasant tasting green tea.

review/summary: This is the best green tea I have tried

review/summary: The BEST peach tea available!
review/text: I've been drinking tea since I was a little boy and am very picky when it comes to fruit flavored tea as most taste artificial and even chemical. I've had every peach tea known to mankind and none of them compare to Bigelow's It's a delicate, yet satisfying blend of green tea and natural peach essence and bits. Less is more when it comes to most tea and Bigelow has perfected the blend. I'm not a fan of most of Bigelow's teas, but this one somehow stands above the crowd. As a fellow peach lover, I'm sure you'll appreciate the intricacies of each delicious sip.

review/summary: The BEST! Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: I find this Peach Green Tea to be the BEST and I do not tire of drinking it everyday...usually 4-6 cups daily. Some green tea is overly bitter and trying to drink it everyday gets to be a chore rather than a pleasure. But not this Bigelow tea. There is a perfect balance of the tea and peach flavor and it is easier on the stomach because the green tea flavor is fresh and delicate rather than astringent and overbearing. Bigelow has good quality control because every cup is equally yummy and there are no grassy or fishy flavors some other manufacturers' teas have. You can be confident that this is high quality tea and very enjoyable. Drink it by the case as I do...it tastes great and it is good for you to boot!

review/text: This is one of my favorite flavors of green tea, and I was very happy to find it on Amazon when my local Walmart stopped carrying it.<br /><br />It's got a nice "peach skin" essence flavor to it (easy to taste the peach flavor), and the green tea can get a nice strong flavor if you leave it in there for quite awhile.<br /><br />The tea bags are also individually packaged in foil lined packages, which probably keep the tea fresher, longer (with no light or excess air).<br /><br />It's a very nice, enjoyable green tea with a little honey!

You can read the full review at [...] about this tea. This tea is must a try for all peach flavor lovers.<br /><br />DO NOT Steep the bag more than 2.5 to 3 Minutes else you will start having strong over boiled green tea (little bitterish) like after taste.<br /><br />I wanted to give 4.5 but as I can't do that so I gave it a 4.

review/text: Choice Classic Green is one of my favorite green teas, the other 2 being Haiku Sencha Green Tea, and Numi Gunpowder Green Tea.  These teas are all pretty robust which I like, because I add raw honey and Edensoy original soymilk (for creamer) to make a nice rich drink.  These are super quality teas, and they are pretty expensive when you buy them at any store, especially the Numi and Haiku.  Quite a bit cheaper here, with the free shipping especially.

review/text: I bought a pack of these some months ago and ran out.  When we couldn't find them in the grocery store we came back and bought them again here.  What I like best about this tuna is that it is more natural than most of the other brands.  Suddenly they all seem to put soy in their tuna--this one does not.  It is also in water, not oil, and has less salt.  Best of all, my kids will eat it when I mix it into the mac and cheese.  My daughter hates tuna but will eat this and not even notice.

review/text: Not quite as hot as Tabasco, and not at all a sweet hot sauce, such as Lingham's.<br /><br />Its strong vinegar base makes it the perfect hot sauce for Buffalo wings and a good choice to spice up ketchup. It becomes a lot milder if mixed with melted butter, which goes nicely with steamed lobster and chicken scallopini.<br /><br />To make a quick fra diavolo pasta sauce just mix spaghetti sauce with a spoon or two of Frank's.<br /><br />TIP: Even though they can be kept at room temperature after opening, hot sauces taste better when refrigerated.

review/summary: YOGI TEA THROAT COMFORT TEA BAGS === A +++++
review/text: Yogi Tea Throat Comfort Tea is what I consistently tote with me for Karaoke singing. This Yogi tea box talks about this tea supporting the respiratory system and soothing mucous membranes in the trachea, refers to it as a healing formula made with Slippery Elm Bark and Mullein, and talks about the herbs in this tea helping to form a protective slippery coating along the throat's mucous lining which the box says can be especially important for singers and public speakers, and mentions inclusion of Black Cherry Bark for soothing effects and pleasant cherry flavor. Prior to my finding this tea, I would sometimes experience rasping sensations following singing my all into certain songs. Now, I drink 2-3 tea bags into a cup (or 3-6 bags into a thermos) of preferably hot water prior to singing, and my throat no longer becomes raspy after enthusiastically belting out my favorite songs. I have gifted fellow karaoke disc jockeys and fellow karaoke singers with this tea, and many have reported back to me the same positive results. So far, my throat seems to really love this tea, and I am a very happy camper !!!

Hot tea always helps to smooth the throat regardless, but I was sold after I drank two cups of this tea and by the afternoon of the day, my sore throat disappeared.

review/summary: Great for a diabetic singer
review/text: I am a classically-trained singer with Type I diabetes, and I recently finished up a year learning a little about singing in contemporary styles. Over-singing suddenly became a big problem. I used to use honey in hot water to sooth my irritated throat, but that spiked my blood sugar, which in turn dehydrated me and my vocal folds - and that was completely counterproductive.<br /><br />My voice teacher turned me on to Yogi Throat Comfort, and I haven't gone back. Granted, honey tastes better; this tea has a very strong licorice taste that is almost unpleasant. It isn't anything I would reach for if I wanted to enjoy a cup of tea. However, it soothes an irritated throat EVERY BIT as well as honey, and even though I've stopped studying contemporary styles and don't have to worry so much about over-singing anymore, I still turn to this tea at the first sign of a scratchy throat. I've had colds that dropped my speaking voice more than an octave or left me essentially unable to speak, and this tea is an important part of a regimen that enables me to keep singing anyway.<br /><br />Have one of those now, in fact, which is why I'm back here to order more. :)

To me, it tasted like warm black licorice.  I used only 1 bag for 24 oz water and by the time I got about 8 oz of it down, my belly started to bubble so I poured the rest out for fear I would see it again and I threw the rest of the box in the can.<br /><br />It is a 100 % natural herbal tea, just not for me. It is also USDA certified organic.<br /><br />If you like the taste of warm black licorice, it may be useful to you.  I will go back to my chamomile tea for soothing the throat.

(Quite a distance.)  3 lb bags of beef or non-organic chicken usually run about $14.00.  Me thinks that who ever set up their on-line Amazon account put the price for the next largest size bag.  I certainly hope that they are not trying to gouge the customer with  such an enormous mark up.

review/text: I have tried a number of MREs now, and the others may have better snacks, but this one has the best meal. If you haven't tried one before, go with this one and avoid the ones like omelette.

review/summary: Don't bother!
review/text: Hershey's sugar-free chocolates are the worst of all the sugar-free chocolates I have tried.  Don't bother with these or any of the other Hershey sugar-free products.  Not only is the flavor poor, the texture is horrible.

review/summary: Orange Mango has replace my long time addiction to Coca Cola
review/text: I found this product at a local store and then discovered Amazon's program to deliver to my home monthly.  I signed up for home delivery and received a partial order.  Now it's out of stock.  I do hope this is only a temporary situation.<br /><br />I tried other Ice flavors but none appeal to me like the orange mango. I've tried for years to find a replacement for Coca Cola in attempts to get off sugared drinks and been unsucessful until now. Ice has good carbination, appealing flavor and no sugar although it does have sucralose, an artifical sweetener, also known as Splenda.  At this time, sucralose appears to be less problematic than high fructose corn syrup in soft drinks so I'm sticking with Ice.

review/summary: I'm Swigging It As I Write This
review/text: I'm drinking it warm because my new order just arrived and there wasn't time to chill it.  I think I'm becoming an addict.  What else can I say, just please see my review of the Pink Grapefruit flavor.  Ditto on all of that except it doesn't taste like the last precious drops of a pink grapefruit.  That would just be wrong.  But love it for what it is in all its orange-mango-y goodness with zero calories.  I'd love it even if it were fattening but I'd drink it maybe once a year.

review/summary: Love Sparkling ICE Brand (Stay away if you're sensitive to Splenda)
review/text: The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.<br /><br />The Orange Mango flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P00PGQ">Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FUL4AE">TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>) but it is delicious all the same. I think it comes across as being more mangoish than orangish as well.
