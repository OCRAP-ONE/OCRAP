review/summary: Quick and Easy
review/text: First off, I hadn't had Shake n' Bake since I was a kid and it was always kind of fun to help in the kitchen when "help" meant shaking a bag of meat and bread crumbs like a wrapped package at Christmas.<br /><br />It was really very easy to make and a quick process.  Preheat the oven, shake-shake-shake, stick them in to bake and while it's baking see if I can get the side dishes fixed before it's ready to come back out of the oven.  Mashed potatoes, green beans, salad, applesauce etc. all go great with the breaded pork chops.  It's a quick and easy way to get a healthy mid-week meal that everybody wants to eat.

review/summary: Easy weeknight meal
review/text: I haven't used Shake n Bake for years. I decided to try it again, and I'm glad I did. It only took 15 minutes in the oven, and it tasted pretty good. It was nice and crunchy without any frying. I made it with a box of Stove Top stuffing and some green beans. I had dinner on the table in less then 30 minutes. My 18 yr. old son had two helpings. He told me to make this more often too. I'm going to be buying this more often now, because I forgot just how easy it was to use Shake n Bake, and the chance to try it again brought back old memories.

review/summary: Great on Chicken.
review/text: They say this is for pork, but I actually like this flavor on chicken. It's a bit less salty than the traditional chicken flavor and goes well with chicken.  Just toss in bag, and bake according to instructions. It is very tasty, easy meal.

review/summary: As good as I've come to expect from other Shake 'N Bake products...
review/text: Our family eats a fair amount of chicken, and most of it is either grilled or baked. When we bake it, we typically use a Shake 'N Bake mix with it or something similar. Prior to using this product I requested from amazon Vine, however, we had never used a Shake 'N Bake product with pork. In all honesty, I absolutely love pork, whether it be pork loin, bacon, baked ham, deli ham, pork sausage, shredded BBQ pork, pork ribs - whatever. It's my favorite meat, bar none. Why I never thought to try something like this before surprises even me. Maybe it's because pork doesn't need a lot of help to taste good. Unless I'm eating BBQ pork, I don't like to put a whole lot of "stuff" on the meat, because I like the natural flavor of it. Fortunately, this mix adds just a bit of zest without drowning out the natural flavor of the pork (in this case, it was pork chops I was fixing). I liked it well enough to try it again, and my kids thought it was good enough to eat again, too. Not fantastic, but a good thing to try once in a while.

review/summary: A bit bland, but tasty.
review/text: While I had not tried the pork variety of Shake N Bake in years, I wasn't really expecting anything too different from what I remembered. Therefore I was neither surprised nor disappointed when it was basically just as I had remembered.<br /><br />For whatever reason, the pork variety of Shake and Bake seems to have very little taste other than mildly salty.  That is why we generally use the Chicken variety of Shake N Bake on both chicken and pork, even that we tend to blend and doctor with other coatings and herbs.<br /><br />As it stands by itself it makes for a decent coating mix and if your pork is good and you like it crispy, this will do the job.

review/summary: Still Tasty!
review/text: Quick review:<br />Rinsed Bone or Boneless pork chops go into a plastic bag or bowl to be coated by the Shake N Bake mix.  Place them onto a baking sheet for the required cooking time and temperature.  When they come out of the oven, you will have some of the tastiest and juiciest pork chops that you have had in a long time.  If I did not have to share with other members of the household, I could easily eat the 5 or 6 pieces that were cooked.<br /><br />I have tried bread crumbs and other brands of a similar nature, but neither of them seemed to have any flavor.  They only seem to provide your pork with a texture and leave out any seasoning.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying Shake N Bake, just pick up a box at the market for a couple of bucks and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Easily 5 stars!

review/summary: An old favorite becomes a new favorite
review/text: I always loved Shake and Bake for pork when I was a kid, but for some reason, I hadn't had it in many, many years. I'm not sure how today's formulation of it compares to it in the 1960's, but it's every bit as good as I remembered it. The instructions called for 1/2 inch chops that were to be cooked 15 minutes, which didn't seem long enough to me, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did get done all the way through and were still juicy and wonderful. I think most people over-cook pork trying to be careful and end up ruining it. The coating was crunchy and perfectly seasoned. This will be a regular at our dinner table now that we've been reintroduced to it. The package said it was enough to coat 6 chops, but it's really only enough for 5 at the most.

review/summary: Good Old Shake and Bake - Tastes Great and Easy to Make!
review/text: I love Shake and Bake - it's easy to prepare (shake it in a bag and toss it in the oven...DONE!), tastes great (and not overly seasoned), and clean up is easy (toss the bag...DONE!).  Like the Chicken Shake and Bake, the shaking bag is no longer included, but it's easy enough to use a Ziploc bag or put the Shake and Bake in a dish and coat your pork with it.  It bakes up quickly and keeps your pork fairly juicy.  To get the whole pork chop crispy, bake on a wire rack or crinkle your foil before putting the pork chop on top - if you place the pork chop directly on the pan, you may end up with a soggy bottom, due to the juices leaking out.  Still as "yum yum good!" now as it was when I was a kid!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Breaded Pork
review/text: I've never used any Shake n Bake product so I didn't know what to expect. The instructions said to use 4 pork chops about 1 1/2" thick and to cook at 425 degrees for 15 minutes or until done.  The instructions didn't tell whether to cover the pork or leave it uncovered.  I chose to leave them uncovered for about 20 minutes and when I saw that the pork chops weren't yet done I decided to cover with a sheet of foil to keep the heat in better.  Big mistake.  10 minutes later when I checked the pork, it was cooked all the way through but the crispness that was on the pork chops before had disappeared.  They had turned soggy.  I wish I had given it longer (maybe 35 minutes) uncovered to see the results, but I'm afraid the breading might have burned at that temperature after so long.<br /><br />Despite the sogginess (in other words, juiciness, LOL) the FLAVOR was actually pretty good.  My husband and kids loved it and I thought it was "okay."  I'm sure it would have been much better if it weren't soggy.  I would be willing to give this Shake N Bake a second try.  I deduct a star for not giving better baking instructions.

review/text: Gotta love Shake N Bake, not only is it consistently simple and delicious but it has been with me since childhood.<br /><br />The pork flavor is definitely my favorite, I love the way it keeps porkchops from drying out and gives an even crunchy crust. I also prefer to use it for chicken as well. It might just be me but the pork has more flavorful spices than the chicken Shake N Bake. Dunno why, just love it.<br /><br />This is also one item that my celiac father really misses. It would be really neat if they could come up with a decent gluten-free option.

review/summary: Multiple Uses
review/text: I've loved this product for a long time. The chicken variety too. It's a great, crispy alternate to frying. You can use egg to coat, or my suggestion is water/milk--same effect. This can be a tad expensive to buy in stores, depending how often you use it, and there are genererics like "Oven Fry." This can also be used in meatloaf, or a substitution for breadcrumbs in any recipe. The product is good and tasty on it's own, but for chicken I suggest mixing with garlic powder or other seasoning. For the pork, I suggest seasoning salt or other seasoning for taste. Alone, the meat with Shake N Bake coating is a bit bland.

review/text: Want an easy dinner fast?  Than this is what you need!  I bought a pack of pork chops, threw them one at a time into a ziplock bag with the mix and in 5 minutes had 6 chops ready to bake.  This package does say it will make 6 pork chops, and it did, but the last one was pretty skimpy in coating and I had been very careful to not overdo the other 5.  I would suggest that it does 5 or use 2 packets to do more.  The flavor was light, but good.  If you want a lot of flavoring you might consider using 2 packets, also.

review/summary: Pretty up Your Pork Chops
review/text: I remember the Shake n Bake commercials from when I was a kid, but I don't remember my mom ever using it. In fact, my mom fried pork chops so much when I was younger that I stopped eating them. I will cook them for my sons occasionally.<br /><br />Now I am no chef, never wanted to be. I am a quick and easy crockpot kinda girl. I always bake chops, not because baking is healthy but because it's lazy..I don't like standing over a stove thank you very much!<br /><br />What I like about the Shake N Bake is, it added a nice flavor to the chops and didn't dry them out. (my main problem when cooking pork chops..dryness) So it was a pleasant surprise to bite into one and not get the feeling I was eating a brick of sand.<br /><br />I'm also not a health nut, so I can't tell you about calories and the such, but I can tell you this. It's easy, simple and tasty. good enough for me.

review/text: Shake and Bake has always been a staple at our house. We love the different varieties they have for chicken, so I was quite happy when I was offered a chance to review their recipe for pork chops! I wasn't disappointed.  Both my husband and I and our 9 year old daughter really enjoyed this product. I worried about the chops getting soggy, but they came out nice and crisp. The chops stayed nice and juicy. A wonderful dinner when paired with a nice salad and simple side dish. We will definitley be purchasing this product in the future.

review/summary: A nice surprise and something new
review/text: I think I might have tried Shake 'n Bake once when I was a kid. I didn't remember whether it was good. I was expecting this to be terrible. Suprisingly, it's actually very good, and a nice change of pace from the plain pork chops that we usually fry without seasoning. The Shake 'n Bake breading is pleasantly mild, not overly salty or strongly seasoned as I expected it to be. Just be sure you bake the chops enough. We had to bake them an extra five minutes, otherwise they came out somewhat soggy, although they still tasted fine. Putting the Shake 'n Bake on the chops is easy. You dump the packet of S&B into a large ziplock bag, lightly wet the chops with water, and then shake each chop in the baggie. Then you put the chops in the oven for 20 minutes (15 was not enough) and don't turn them, leave them on one side. The pork comes out nicely cooked and the breading is tasty. Shake 'n Bake is a good product and an inexpensive way to introduce variety to your suppers when you use pork chops and cutlets. We will probably try the S&B packets for chicken and other meats too.

review/summary: Quick and Easy Way to Spice Up a Meal
review/text: For anyone who wants a quick and easy meal or to doctor up a plain piece of pork or chicken, Shake 'N Bake is a classic. For me, it's the fastest, most reliable way to bake a pork chop or piece of chicken and not have it come out of the oven looking either like beef jerky or a leather jacket.<br /><br />Yeah...not really known for my culinary abilities.<br /><br />No fuss, no muss, no bother baking is what Shake 'N Bake is all about. And it tastes good, too. This classic was like a blast from my younger years, and it left my bone-in chops just as juicy and moist as I could hope for them to be. The flavor is bold enough not to require further seasoning - and for a salt lover like me, that's saying something - and the breading mostly stayed nice and crisp throughout. I was completely satisfied by the Shake 'N Bake pork, and glad they've revived the old classic. I have every intention of adding this one to my dinner rotation.

review/text: A true blast from the past,Shake 'N Bake promises to do for pork what it does for chicken, make a quick, convenient and tasty supper.  I am not a big pork fan, but purchased some chops to test this product.  Just pop moistened meat in a plastic reclosable bag with the Shake 'n' Bake crumb mixture and voila, you have a meal ready to pop in the oven.  The coating was nice and crisp with a mild flavor.  I was most impressed  by the meat inside.  It was moist and juicy.  I was not enamored of the spice, I prefer more assertive flavor. Can you do it yourself with seasoned breadcrumbs and a zip lock bag? Sure.  But for a quick,  kid pleasing meal that is retro fun to prepare, this can't be beat.

review/text: I have tried Shake N Bake for chicken but this was the first time I tried it with pork.  I normally bread my pork chops the hard way with flour, egg, and breadcrumbs.  Shake N Bake for pork was much easier.  Just wash your chops and stick them in the bag and shake!  I don't have to clean up flour and breadcrumbs all over my counter anymore.  The taste of the seasoning was not over powering and it makes for an easy and fast dinner.  Obviously this is not as good as home made but if you are looking to make a quick dinner for the family this definitely works in a pinch.

I use and egg and water mix, and put the contents of this pouch in a large, plastic bag and add an equal amount of panko bread crumbs (for added crispiness), and several other spices of my own liking.<br /><br />The results are very good, but I can easily do the same with adding flavored bread crumbs to the panko ones, spices, and continue as described above without getting  all of the added sodium, "dextrose" and carbs in the packet of Shake 'N Bake.  So can you!  :)

review/summary: I remember it tasting better
review/text: This was a staple in our household in my youth.  Pork was our favorite flavor, too.  Perhaps it is my aging taste buds but I felt it lacked something.  It is still a light, mild coating mix and a fast way to prepare a main dish.  Next time I use it I may add a little more spice to the mix.  I used 2 thick pork chops for this review, and will use the thinner ones next time.  They didn't get crispy enough for my preference and took longer than recommended to reach the 160 degree temp required (per the package for done).  Also, by that time they were dry, not moist inside.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned she wished it had a resealable bag.  My Amazon-Vine-sample did not come with any bag, but I want to caution any user about saving any of the mix that has had raw meat immersed in it.  It is a health hazard to keep it and even the box indicates it should be thrown away.  I just shook a small portion of the mix into a shallow bowl and just used enough for the 2 chops.  That way I was able to save the unused portion for another day.

review/summary: Tasty quick pork chops
review/text: I remember growing up with pork chops done with Shake N Bake and they were the best!  We don't do pork very often so when I saw this I had good memories of my childhood kitchen and tasty chops.  We had 4 pork chops just shy of half an inch and used about two-thirds of the package.  So, it should be able to cover up to six pork chops as the instructions state.  One thing I have to admit, unless you cook them way longer than stated, you'll have juicy, tender, pork chops with Shake N Bake!  As expected, they were juicy, but the flavor isn't as wonderful as I remember.  Not sure if that's because I have an adult's palate now or if the seasoning is lacking in the newest version of Shake N Bake.  I have made it other ways in the past for more flavor (brush with brown mustard and add rosemary to the shake n bake) and may try it again.  But, it's still a great quick meal for those nights that we're in a rush.

review/text: Organic India Tulsi tea is, to me, the absolute best tea I've ever had...both in terms of taste and effects.  I have tried several types and have found that I enjoy Chai Masala and India breakfast the most (I enjoy them separately, but also, 1 bag of India breakfast and 1 of bag of chai masala makes a perfect iced chai.)<br /><br />Black tea will give most anyone an energy boost, but Tulsi tea is unique to me in that it truly does (as the manufacturers claim) leave one feeling both energized and relaxed (perhaps "centered" or "focused" would be the best word).  Tack onto that the purported health benefits of tulsi, and you've got yourself one fantastic tea!  There are a number of non-tulsi teas I enjoy, but Organic India's Tulsi Tea is the only tea I purchase on a consistent basis and that I always have on hand.  Also, it is the one type of tea I am frequently recommending to friends and family.  Give it a try!

review/summary: Tastes great
review/text: I looked into how to duplicate how they make Chai's at the coffee shops, and I had no clue how to do that.  I found Oregon Chai mix at a local grcoery (then later I found a cheaper bulk 3-box pack at a grocery warehouse store), and I tried it. It can't be compared to a professionally made Chai (at least the way I make it), but it totally satisfies my requirement to be able to make it at home anytime I want.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I use Rice Dream instead of real milk, but it still qualifies as something that I can call a decent Chai drink conveniently made at home.  Extremely easy to make: you use 50% of this mixture and 50% of whatever kind of milk you use. And heat it up.

review/text: If you enjoy Chai at the coffee shop, just buy some of this mix and make it yourself at home for a fraction of the price.  Most coffee shops I have visited actually use Oregon Chai, so you will be getting the exact same thing.  However, the liquid concentrate version is much better than the powdered form (coffee shops use the liquid version) so unless you need portable packets for work, get the liquid.<br /><br />One other thing - not too long ago I ran into a box of packets that wouldn't dissolve correctly.  I sent an email to Oregon Chai and within the SAME DAY they shipped me a whole new box!  Outstanding service from an outstanding company.  These guys really care about making you happy and they will go to any length to do so.  After that experience they have a loyal customer for life.

review/summary: Grainy residue
review/text: The taste of this chai isn't all that bad, considering it's instant. I wish it were a little heavier on the spices. However, of all the instant chai I've tried, this was the best. Which is why I'll be sticking to brewing my own. Because as convenient as this product is, there are major drawbacks:<br /><br />1. It has a strange aftertaste. It coats your tongue a bit (sort of like a fat compound that was cheaply processed). Reminds me of icing made with shortening...a slightly waxy residue remains after each swallow.<br /><br />2. The powder never fully dissolves. A big issue. And we're not talking about a slight residue. You can see the granules floating as you stir and stir and stir. When you get down to the bottom of the mug, several millimeters of powder have accumulated into a brown sludge. The only time I've been successful with getting this to fully dissolve was by bringing it to a boil and sustaining it for several minutes. Even then, there was residue at the bottom of the mug. My coffee and cocoa don't do this, so I'm wondering why Oregon Chai mix does.

review/text: I bought a box of Oregan Chai not expected big things from it as I haven't been happy with these types of packaged drinks before. Anyway, the first time I tried it I used only half of the package as I do not like things too sweet and added some milk to it. Let me tell you, it was awesome. It's creamy and comforting and tastes like real chai, not Starbucks chai.  I have also mixed it with the Starbucks Via coffee, again using only half the package, and it also tasted great. I will totally buy this product again.

review/text: I ordered this and the Big Train Sugarfree Vanilla Chai Latte to try them since I wanted to save money from buying chai tea latte's at Starbucks or Panera.  At first I didn't think I liked this as much as the Big Train Vanilla Chai, but then I read the ingredients and realized the Big Train had a lot of additives and for some reason, I developed a taste for this over the Big Train.  I love it.  I actually put it in a thermal mug and add more water than it calls for and still love it.  My son is a Marine in Afghanistan and I included a box of this in his care package.  He loved it too, so I am ordering more to send him and am also ordering the Oregon Vanilla Chai Latte mix.

review/text: I really enjoy this tea.  I still don't understand their spicy version though as I think the original is richer and just as spicy. This is a dehydrated form which you only need add hot water.<br /><br />  There is also concentrate that comes in a 1/2 gal jug which you can add to steamed milk.  That is much more cost effective for home use.

review/text: This is the best Chai Tea Latte I have ever found.  I use skim milk instead of water, although water is fine, but I find that the skim milk give it the Starbucks taste.  I also use 2 cups of milk instead of the recommend 1 cup as it is to sweet for my taste with only 1 cup.  The tea latte taste is still there but I think it's the milk that makes it.  I would recommend this to anyone as I have not found any better

review/text: Ok, so I'm sure this isn't authentic Chai to everyone. But for a person, like myself, that lives in a rural area with very few coffee shops this is perfect. I can't afford to buy a single latte for the same price I could pay for a box of 8 packets. And why should I? This mix is wonderful and I don't even have to add milk! Just heat some water or pour in the packet. Instant goodness.

review/text: Note that this is a powder mix, not a liquid, as some other reviews currently seem to be implying...  Personally, I strongly prefer the powder mixes to the liquid mixes, since you just have to mix with hot water for the powders, as opposed to mixing with milk and heating for the liquids.  Among the powders, this is my favorite, but as it's all about taste, and taste can vary, that may not mean much to anyone else...  Add a little vanilla creamer, and this just can't be beat!

review/summary: Nirvana by the Cup
review/text: While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea bags are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I never heard back from them as to whether the tea had caffeine or not.  So beware if you want Decaf as this is confusing.  I had hoped for a peach tea with a hint of spice, while this is so spicy, you can smell the spice thru the plastic bag in the closed box.  I did use one bag with several regular decaf bags for iced tea and liked that.

review/summary: There definitely is an odor, BUT...
review/text: I want folks to know that this ear cleaner definitely has a distinct odor, contrary to what the other review says. However, I am buying lots more of this great stuff, as my kitties don't mind it at all and I find it to be very gentle, effective and it really is natural, with only 4 ingredients. Plus it's alcohol-free, so I have peace of mind that it is safe for my babies and not harsh in any way. And I found it for the cheapest price on Amazon - the key is to buy several bottles for lower shipping & you may as well, since it only comes in a 4 oz size! Stock up now!

First, the shipment arrived in 2 days which is much faster then the last time I ordered a wheatgrass kit which was from another company that took 2 weeks to arrive. The package was organized perfectly and the instructions were clear with there business card attached to it. Also they included a hand written note thanking me for my business and insisting me to call if i had anyway questions about the growing process. I did follow up with questions and they were very polite and helpful. It is a fantastic service and I think anybody who is looking to order a wheatgrass should consider purchasing this particular wheatgrass kit from rejuvenate forever. It is all organic by the way.

review/summary: Excellent, but rare
review/text: These are the best K-Cup coffee I've tasted, but every time they show up on Amazon, they're sold out within a week. I run an affiliate site, and it's like rolling dice every day to watch the product link change from available to unavailable.<br /><br />So, if you can get your hands on these, and you have a K-Cup brewer at home or at work, I seriously recommend that you try these out. They're a dark roast, which is my only problem with them (darker roasts have less caffeine because it breaks down under the heat of roasting). The fact that they're organic AND fair trade is a huge bonus as well. I'm glad that I don't have to wonder what chemicals are put on the beans and that I know that the farmers were paid fairly for their goods. Sustainability means a lot to me, in the environmental AND human sense.<br /><br />The flavor is heavy and rich but smoother than you would expect. There's just a hint of acid bite in the after-taste that I associate with all of the K-Cup coffees. I drink it black, but it's certainly full-bodied enough to handle even heavy cream. If you take sugar, it will probably bring out the woody flavor that this coffee has. It might even hold up to honey or fructose for the diabetics in the crowd.

review/text: I would describe this coffee as medium to dark flavor.  No sharp taste, no acid taste.  It is very smooth and can be easily consumed with minimal creamer.  If you like a strong bold roast, this may not satisfy you.  I use the TImothy's Rainforest Expresso for my morning wakeup (which is the best bold coffee I have found), then I switch to Newman's Own Extra Bold Special Blend later in the day.  Overall, it is an excellent cup of coffee with great flavor.  Definitely worth 5 stars.

So I get to drink coffee and help someone at the same time.<br /><br />It's not as good as the Green Mountain National Wildlife Blend K-Cups, which I have also reviewed.  But it's good and I'd buy it again.  Hope this helps those of you who don't believe a pod coffee can measure up.

review/summary: Not Decaf - comes up in decaf kcup search
review/text: I like this blend and the fact that it is organic and fair trade, but I want to make mention that this is not decaf coffee.  My husband drinks decaf and it is getting harder to find good decaf at the big box stores so I hopped on Amazon and searched on 'decaf kcup organic' and this item comes up.  As I was loading up our carousel I noticed how the label looks exactly like the ones on "my" level of the carousel (caffeinated)...yep, it is indeed NOT decaf.  And I certainly get it a lot cheaper at my local warehouse place. Lesson learned to read the description forward and back several times before adding to my cart.  Hopefully this review will save someone else from this mistake. I'm also going to try to report the discrepancy to Amazon if I can figure out the proper channel for doing so.

review/summary: Not As Bold As I Prefer
review/text: I have a Keurig B130, the machine you'll find in hotel rooms and commercial installations. The reservoir holds 8 oz. of water to make one cup of coffee. I prefer to put fresh water in a brewing device for every cup of coffee and use bottled water, exclusively, to brew. I like a bold, strong cup of coffee. This Newman blend lacks body and strength. I compared it with using a Solofill resusable K-cup,<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Solofill-Refillable-K-Cup-Keurig-Brewers/dp/B004CXG07S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1334324776&sr=8-2<br /><br />filled with Cafe Oquendo,<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Cafe-Oquendo-Espresso-Coffee-Cubano/dp/B005IBV69K/ref=sr_1_2?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1334324953&sr=1-2<br /><br />and there was no comparison. The Solofill and Oquendo was far superior in flavor and strength. Needless to say, using the Solofill and Oquendo is also substantially less expensive.

review/text: I love coffee and I drink three or four brands of k-cups depending on my mood. This coffee is strong but not too strong. Let me tell you, this is coming from someone who cannot drink coffee on an empty stomach, from someone who has trouble digesting a Starbucks mocha (i.e., it can be painful). I will put the water level on high and fill my travel mug and to me that's plenty strong. I don't go for the french roasts, etc.<br />As for Amazon...brilliant, fast service. It's more convenient to buy k-cup coffees online than to find the types and flavors you want in the store. Most stores have limited k-cup offerings.

review/summary: The perfect k-cup for those who are a fan of the basic house blend
review/text: -------------------Update 08/20/2012------------<br />I'm still drinking this same k-cup on a daily basis.  It is still my favorite<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I got to say that I was initially not a huge fan of the idea of k-cups.  I didn't like the "pod" coffee and I thought it would just be a passing phase.  When I saw Keurig machines and K-Cups, I immediately snubbed them and marked them off as silly waste of counter space and could not hold a torch to the tried and true drip coffee maker.<br /><br />I could go on for quite some time about why I purchased a Keurig, but you aren't here reading these reviews because you want to know if you want one, you already got one and you are now searching for a strong-solid cup of day to day coffee.  No "french vanilla" or "tiger mint" or whatever, you just want a cup of black stuff that would make the Marlboro man crack a smile and say "Damn, that's a fine cup of joe you brewed Mr."<br /><br />I brew this on a small cup setting (standard cup size), no creme or sugar, and usually have 1 a day on my way to work and 2 on the weekends.  I don't know how well it tastes with sugar/creme but it tastes fantastic without.  If you aren't sure what to expect, think of what a house-blend would taste like if McDonald's coffee and Starbucks coffee beans were mixed together.  There is no aftertaste but it still has a thick bite to it.  Hard to explain.<br /><br />This can be found for a relatively good price, I buy them at roughly .41cents a cup which is fine with me, only spending $200 on coffee a year is a great habit in my opinion.  I was paying more each year on beans by the bag.  I could have spread the beans out more but I never had good luck with brewing small cups on a drip coffeemaker.<br /><br />.41 cents vs. going to a coffeshop and spending well over twice that = win, plus it tastes great =D<br /><br />Definitely add this k-cup to your collection if you are a fan of house blends

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I have a problem with getting my coffee strong enough with Keurig makers when using commercial K-cups.  I make 7oz brews with ex. bold K-cups.  Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold) is the first brand I have found that IS strong enough AND tastes/smells good also.  I normally use the aluminum caps to recycle the cups and refill with excellent Viet Namese coffee that I grind as needed. This brand (Trung Ngyuen) can be bought through Amazon. This works well but the cups can only be recycled so many times and you need a source of replacements. Also, because of sleep fog, that FIRST cup often needs to be faster than the refill version-- these work admirably.  The commercial K-cups are soaring in price and they are MUCH more expensive than refilling with your favorite loose coffee or fresh ground beans.

review/summary: Great coffee, very pricey
review/text: I don't know why these are so expensive here, but they cost much less on Keurig's web site, or you can get a really large box of with twice as many at costco for the same price as Amazon. Usually Amazon has great deals, but this is really surprising! These are my favorite of the k-cups....I keep coming back to them.

review/summary: Smooth and powerful
review/text: I first tasted this coffee as a sample with my new Keurig.  It wasn't available locally, so I tried Emeril's.  The Newman's own is really just as strong, but MUCH SMOOTHER.  It's delicious, and by far the best I've tried so far.

review/summary: Awesome Coffee
review/text: Having tried a number of extra bold K-cup coffees, I rate Newman's Own the very best. I am not a coffee aficienado and am not conversant with the terminology that gourmands use, but this coffee beats them all in taste, strength and body. Awesome stuff and worth the extra $$ methinks.
