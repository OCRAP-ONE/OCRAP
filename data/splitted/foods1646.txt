review/summary: It works
review/text: The only thing that matters is that this trap got a mole the first night I had it set up; that makes me happy. It is mostly made from cast iron so I expect a long life from it. I had to bend the sear for proper engagement, but that will not detract from my 5 star rating because it worked.

review/summary: Best Mole trap I ever used
review/text: I have a big place I caught 40 mole one year. I used every trap I know of. These are the best I ever used. The spring or strong. They are a little hard to set but that what it takes to hold moles. Mole are hard to kill with some traps. No traps work well in tree roots. This Victor 0631 is the one to use. The easy set model might work? I used the Nash, Trapline, victor stab type, This victor 0631 is one I would recommend.

review/summary: Here moley moley!!!
review/text: I have tried to get rid of these buggers for over a year now. I have tried everything from chewing gum, insecticide for the grubs, flooding them with a garden hose ( I ran the hose down a main tunner for 8 hours before the water appeared out of another hole 20 feet away), mole poison, looked into a cosstly mole servicewithout any guarantees, and even considered a little gasoline at one time!<br /><br />The Mole Trap arrived yesterday April 19th 2012. I read the reviews and using the instructions from the reviewer (Thanks G Klos), I set the trap following the reviewers instruction and warned all of the family to be aware of the trap and to keep away from it. Shortly after 6 pm today Aprill 20th I found the trap sprung and there in the jaws was the critter that has wreaked havok on what was once a flat smooth front yard.<br /><br />Tomorrow I move to the back yard.<br /><br />This trap is incredible.

review/summary: Works as promised
review/text: I have had the trap in my fescue lawn for about 2 weeks.  I have moved it twice now.  The first location did not get anything but the second one caught my first mole after being set for 3 days.  I definitely recommend this style over the kind with the spikes that sit up above the ground.  The name is a little deceiving as the trap is not completely out of sight but it's fairly low profile and the part that could do the most damage to little hands and feet is already underground when it is set, so I feel that the kids are in very little danger playing in the yard nearby.<br /><br />The toughest part is identifying active runs.  The thicker the grass, the harder it is to identify where the runs are.<br /><br />The hunt continues...

review/summary: I caught a mole with it.
review/text: Took a few days, but the mole finally got caught. The trap is fairly easy to set up. I think some of it is luck if the mole heads into the trap. But it did work for me, check out the pic of the catch for proof. I didnt want to kill the little guy, but he was really tearing up the lawn and he wasn't moving out.<br /><br />Probably the major con with this trap is it does take a lot of strength to open. If it was a little easier to open, I probably have given it 5 stars.

review/summary: Really Hard to Set!!!
review/text: I previously bought a similar kind of trap in Europe, which was effective (don't buy mole bait-that does not help), but I needed more to catch all moles in our garden.. This trap however does not compare to the easy one I had already. You don't just need force to set it; you need an awful lot of it! Ladies beware, using this trap is a man's job only!!!<br /><br />On handling, beware to wear gloves, so you don't touch the trap with bare hands. Moles might be sensitive to that..

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: Forget everything else and just use this simple product to kill your moles. Getting rid of their food source or trying to chase them away through other ways just will NOT work. You have to kill them! I bought a new home with 5 acres to mow. There were so many mounds and tunnels it looked like I had over a hundred moles in there. You literally could not step anywhere without stepping on a tunnel. I tried everything while the simplest and cheapest way were these traps. Don't make the same mistake I did trying to kill grubs and using spore etc, etc,---just get these traps and use em and your done. I put 4 of these traps on 5 acres and in three weeks I got 5 moles and that was all I had! Moles can tunnel up to 80 feet in one day. that is why it looks like there must be hundreds of moles. It has been 2 years now and you can't tell there was ever a mole problem here.

review/summary: the only one that works
review/text: I have a big yard with sandy-clay soil,pretty soft ground in sc.the moles used to be a big problem.spent aproximely a month buying traps,seeing how this moles destroyed my yard with no results.I will save you time:trapline and cinch traps are good products but don't work.the moles feel the trap inside the tunnel,it's a no go.loop traps work somehow,but after many trips I realized that they are way too wide for the mole.I ended up buying this one.I own and used 2 trapline,2 cinchtrap,2 choke mole nash trap and only one victor out of sight.so far I caught 2 moles and guess what,both with the victor out of sight.the last one I caught I set the 2 trapline first in the beginning of the run,the cinch after that,the choke,and then the victor and then the chocke.went to check 2 hours later.found the tunnel deviating both the traplines and the cinch,tripped the chocke one...I knew that after the fence the victor had to do the trick...and I was right.my second one with the same trap!.I own all kinds of traps but only this one had work twice and fast.the secret?I believe is the fact that is not as wide as other traps,the trigger is very sensitive,the blades are curvy and push the animal inwards when closed...very fast and strongly...any trap that goes inside the tunnel is doomed to fail in my yard.the moles feel it and avoid it alltogether.the choke is fine idea,just too wide and won't catch the thing that probably stays in between the choke while it closes...this is my story.don't spend 80 dollars like me.buy one of this,find the run that goes straight around your fence or house,set it on top of the tunnel,don't dig nothing,just spade a slot where the blades will sit,press the tongue-trigger in the middle and enjoy the sweet revenge.I just wanted to share my experience.I have 7 mole traps that don't work.save yourself some money.

review/summary: Caution - Safety loop maybe faulty
review/text: I received the traps that I ordered and was glad that I had watched several videos on setting them as there is absolutely nothing in the box that really helps figure out how to set the trap effectively.  I am fairly literate when it comes to reading instructions and therefore, I consider the enclosed instructions only fair.  You can figure it out but that is exactly what you have to do is there is nothing in the illustrations that is all that helpful.<br /><br />So far I have not been successful in actually trapping a mole but still trying.  However, I am writing this review to caution the reader of something that could have been disastrous to me from using this device.  As I was checking one of the traps, I decided to move it so I set the safety loop over the bar as it is designed to be done.  AS I moved the trap, and I am still not sure what happened, the device sprung and instead of the safety catch stopping the action, it actually came off with great velocity hitting me in the forehead about 2 inches from my eye.  The wound is small but none the less, hurt like crazy and bled profusely.  I hate to think of it hitting me in the eye or mouth!  As I said, I don't know really what happened but still have not found the safety catch - maybe a mole will return it!  Be careful and I suggest wearing safety glasses when setting.

review/summary: This food is awful!
review/text: I had been feeding my cats this for several years. Both of my cats became overweight on this product and one developed a bladder stone that was very costly to remove. I've switched their food, bladder stone cat is on prescription food and other cat is on Purina Pro Plan Weight Loss. It is worth the extra money, both cats prefer the new food to this junk and they are losing weight. Even aside from that, both their fur coats have become softer and they are much more energetic. The recommended amount on the bag to feed is also much too high. The vet said they only should get 1/4 to 1/3 C. twice daily. Purina would have you believe they need twice as much, and your cat will eat it. They are in the business of selling food, not caring about your pets well-being. I wish I realized all this years ago! Stay far away from this food!!!

review/text: I ate a lot of biltong as a child since we lived in Africa. We also tried making it ourselves at one point and we had friends who made it on occasion. It tastes a lot different from the overly salted beef jerky you can buy in America. I was amazed that this product is made in America since it tastes exactly like the biltong I remember from childhood. Since I ordered some other products along with this biltong I was only charged $4.41 for shipping instead of $9.99. However I'd willingly pay the higher price just for the taste of truly good biltong.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great for my nine-month-old
review/text: My 9.5-month-old son loves every food we've given him. When he reached 9 months we added these yogurts to the menu, and he absolutely adores them. I love the fact that they don't have to be refrigerated, so are easy to toss in the diaper bag, use when we're out and about, etc. I wish they didn't have any sugar in addition to what naturally occurs in milk and fruit, but they're still better than pudding (that's why I didn't rate them 5 stars). I'm so happy to see them available on Subscribe & Save because our local grocery store charges $3.49/four-pack and we go through a four-pack every week. The only thing I wish they'd make is a variety pack so that I didn't have to get six four-packs of all the same flavor. Oh, and I hope Amazon will start carrying the pear flavor, too. (Can someone explain to me why the peach is 25 cents cheaper per four-pack than the banana?)

review/summary: All the taste, none of the bad for you stuff!
review/text: I was buying these 2 boxes at a time at the grocery store for my children's lunch (2 in their bag each, one in my mouth!  We like these so much, as well as many of the BTN products, that we finally signed up for Amazon's S&S.<br /><br />I, too, grew up dunking Oreo's and washing it down with crumb-licious milk.  I think the BTN has taken everything good about an Oreo, left out all the bad, and ended up with a great cookie.  The sweetness is definitely a little more mild than an Oreo, but not so much that you are left wondering if you got the Lite version!  The cookie part is more crumbly, less dense, not hard and overly crunchy.  Because it is less dense, the built in advantage is a shorter wait time - it goes from milk to mouth much faster than an Oreo!  The creme, to me, is perfect.  Your mouth is not left with that sort of thick, slimy coating that often results from the finger-fed Oreo creme.  Oreo's have always been a milk-only cookie for me, but these actually go great with  milk and coffee (so when you are packing your kid's lunch in the a.m., they make a great breakfast! LOL).  Enjoy!

review/summary: Better than Oreos
review/text: This is the first time I've ever written a review about a cookie and this is why--this one far outshines Oreos in my opinion.  Looks like there are some who agree with me and some who don't.  I say, give them a try and see for yourself.  Personally, I hate the waxy artificial taste that Oreos leave on the roof of my mouth. Sure the original cookie is yummy, but once I tried these, I'll never go back to the "fake" tasting ones.  Added bonus is that you can pronounce all the ingredients and they look like what you'd use if you were to attempt to make your own.  I can only hope that this manufacturer gets a loyal fan base of all the products (I've been pretty happy with all we've tried from cookies to crackers) so they will continue to make a fairly priced alternative to the major manufacturers who fill the food with chemicals and preservatives galore.  Btw, my kids like 'em and are old enough to know when Mom is switching junk stuff out with healthier options.  Now if only someone could make a healthier twinkie...

review/summary: Don't taste anything like Oreo cookies
review/text: So I had a feeling that these cookies were not going to be all that great judging by the fact that there was no smell when opening the package.  There is always a smell from cookies but even when I put one up to my nose there was nothing.  I took one bite and the flavor of chocolate is very weak.  I think because I am so use to Oreo cookies trying these for the first time I was taken aback by that lack of flavor.  Don't expect these to taste like Oreo cookies because they dont at all.  I would not be buying these again.  I just wish that the chocolate flavor was stronger.  I love Back To Natures Chocolate Chunk Cookies, and the Peanut Butter cremes are so delicious.

review/summary: The best!
review/text: My new favorite cookie. I have been buying these for a while at the store and though they are a little bit more pricey than Oreo's, the taste makes them worth it. They are sweet, but a more natural tasting sweet. The texture is also a little different from a classic Oreo, but I still think they are better. Since they are GMO/HFC free I feel better about letting my son eat them, and he never turns them down. I recommend them to everyone.

review/text: I've tried a few of the Imagine organic soups and I've enjoyed two different flavors (tomato and mushroom). Today, I tried something new. I boiled up a mixture of organic baby carrots and celery slices and included a thinly sliced Italian sausage. Added to it were a chicken bouillon cube, some black pepper, four bay leaves, some garlic salt and a sprinkling of dill weed. I boiled the mixture until ready to eat. It tasted quite good in itself. Then I added about 8 pounces of the Imagine creamy Butternut Squash soup to the mixture and heated it up again. Oh my, what a nice soup! This stuff was just terrific! I'm sure you could make up a lot of your own mixtures equally good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

My boyfriend is not quite as much of a pepper belly as I am; I love the heat that for sure!

I don't know if the food had a lot to do with it.  We stayed with this product because of its availability online and because it's way better than what we were feeding the girls before (Beneful).  It's a little pricey, but the dogs are getting older, so we think it's worth it.  They still eat grass.

review/summary: AWESOME dog food.
review/text: This stuff is THE food for our Great Dane.<br /><br />It contains the right amount of protein/fat ratio's needed for our fast-growing beast dog. Very healthy & high quality. It's expensive, but definitely worth the investment. We were originally using a different flavor & I wanted to switch to a more bland one or grain-free food & I found this one. Also, the kibbles are double the size of the normal kibbles which really slows down our dogs eating habits! Anyone with a Dane or dog the wolfs down his food & can get bloat... or just get sick... will love the benefit of the larger kibble!<br /><br />We had mixed the other Natural Balance flavor (Venison & Lamb) with Purina Dog Chow, about half & half lately (he's been eating & growing like a weed!)- what a terrible decision! Our Dane has the smelliest gas & behind- YUCK! After mixing in this food & making the "switch" between flavors, the Natural Balance is about 80% to the Purina Dog Chow now again... and WOW major difference. I had no idea that lower quality dog food could impact our dog so dramatically. Lord, we could smell him laying across the room. We will keep the 80%-20% ratio for good & never stray from Natural Balance.<br /><br />Anyway, AMAZING five star product. Who wouldn't wish it was cheaper, but I will NEVER sacrifice money-saving when it comes to our Dane now!

Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten "red apples" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with "red apple" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this "red apple" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this "red apple" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD.

The vet did tests and couldn not determine a reason for the reversal in health.  She has eaten dry food her whole life and turned up her nose at wet food until she ate this formula of Pro Plan.

review/summary: A quick meal solution
review/text: I have used this Skillet Toss with lots of different add-ins for a variety of dishes---sausage bits ,mushroom/onions, olives and extra cheese.<br />You might want to try it with other forms of pasta, too.  Works well.<br />Good choice for a hearty meal that doesn't really seem that "last minute".

review/summary: delicious New England-style baked beans!!!
review/text: We absolutely love these traditional baked beans and adore having them in single-serving cans.  My husband loves them enough to eat them cold out of the can, so he'll take them to work for lunch and sometimes have a late night snack (better for him than potato chips or candy bars!).  We also use them as a side dish for pork and sauerkraut meals.  In addition to just microwaving them in a bowl (or eating them out of the can!), here are 2 other great ways to cook them:<br /><br />1)  Put in an ovenproof dish and bake alongside anything else in your oven.  They'll only get better.  We put pork and sauerkraut in one open dish and these in another and leave them both in a 400 degree oven for about 50 minutes with excellent results (try putting sliced sweet onions misted with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper into a third dish for an awesome vegetable side!).<br /><br />2)  If you cook pork chops, hot dogs, sliced ham or kielbasa in a skillet, add these beans to the skillet around the pork and let the flavors mix as both are browned and heated.<br /><br />These are also available in full size cans and are almost indistinguishable from a slightly different version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W08VRK">B&M Grandma's Recipe, with Molasses, 16 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, which tastes just as good and right now is even a little cheaper.  Which brings me to the third great way:<br /><br />3)  To feed a crowd, get the full-sized cans, heat contents in a slow-cooker, add your choice of flavorings (onions, celery, carrots, brown sugar, mustard, ketchup, garlic, diced tomatoes, etc.) and/or meat (chunks of ham, hot dogs, kielbasa, whatever), and bring on the hungry hordes!  Can leave on keep-warm in the slow cooker literally for days -- great for feeding a work crew that's cleaning up storm damage or running a charity event.

review/summary: Cheaper; decent pasta
review/text: Ener-g macaroni is cheaper than other GF pastas; unfortunately it also suffers from texture problems that Tinkyada & Glutino have managed to solve.  I found that the macaroni tubes started to split into little noodle fragments even before they had gotten to the "al dente" stage.<br />A decent GF pasta solution, although the wheat-eaters in your life may not care for it as much as other brands.

review/summary: My Favorite Gluten Free Pasta for Years
review/text: I found it a little difficult to rate this pasta, as I think preferences in gluten free pasta really differ according to taste. People who have recently transitioned into a gluten free diet often really prefer the grainier brown rice pasta of Tinkyada, and I have to admit I like Tinkyada too. My non GF husband far prefers Tinkyada or Mrs. leepers corn pasta to Ener-g foods. However, this was my favorite gluten free pasta for many years, and I still like it for its light, inoffensive flavor that doesn't dominate the dish. It makes a lovely macaroni and cheese where you can really taste the CHEESE rather than your pasta, and is also a very nice pasta for a summery tomato sauce. I usually use the healthier brown rice pastas now, but I have to admit, I miss my white rice Ener-g foods pasta sometimes. If you're experimenting trying to find a good GF pasta, why not try a box (not a case!) of this along with the others, especially if you don't care for brown rice pasta or corn pasta, which can sometimes dominate a dish. Young kids may prefer this pasta as well- at least I did!<br /><br />-Nostalgic pasta reviewer

review/text: I've been giving these - 2 a day - to my dog for a long time now.  She loves them.  After our morning walk, she runs to the kitchen to get her two Pedigree treats and one milkbone.  She sure knows the rouine!<br /><br />Problem is, my Wal-Mart doesn't carry them so I've been getting them at Kroger, but yesterday they were on closeout sale and I was told Kroger's vendor won't be carrying them anymore.  So I will have to start ordering them on-line.<br /><br />Anyway, your dog will love these!

review/summary: Dangerous for Some Dogs
review/text: My dog is an older dog, and I bought these treats for her in order to perhaps help her with her stiff joints. Within a few days of giving her these treats, my dog started having seizures. At first we weren't sure what might be causing them because she had never had a seizure before. The seizures increased, and we took her to the vet. The vet couldn't find anything wrong with her that might be causing the seizures. About two months after beginning the treats, I determined that this was the only variable as the seizures had started soon after. We stopped giving them to her as soon as we made the connection and the seizures stopped right away and she hasn't had one since. I don't know why these treats affected her this way, but I would strongly suggest that people stay away from these treats. Seeing your beloved pet go through something like this is very upsetting, but it is even more upsetting knowing that it happened because of something I gave her. Stay away from these treats, please.

review/summary: Sweet and Flavorful!
review/text: I've tried a lot of different stevia products, both powdered and liquid, and this is my favorite.  Stevita is carb-free (I wrote the company for confirmation, and was suitably impressed with their quick customer service), which the powdered stevias aren't (Truvia has 3 carbs per packet).  Stevita is fantastic for anyone on a low-carb diet, or trying to cut back on sugar or fake sweeteners.<br /><br />Stevita doesn't have the aftertaste that is so common with fake sweeteners and even other stevia products.  The Peppermint Stevita has a nice peppermint flavor, and just a few drops gives you a nice sweetness with a distinctly peppermint flavor.  It's perfect in a mocha, to give you a peppermint patty taste. When I use sugar-free syrups like Torani or DaVinci, I tend to use a shot in a cup, with this, I'm using 3 drops.  I'm hooked!  I've ordered all the other flavors too, and am excited to try them.

review/text: I bought 3 flavors, peppermint, vanilla and chocolate. We have used them to flavor our lattes. I was surprised at how well just a tiny bit, 4 drops per cup, can flavor coffee.

My husband loves the chocolate and I love the peppermint.

review/summary: Makes the perfect mango ice tea in seconds
review/text: My family (including myself) is addicted to ice tea made from Monin mango syrup. It really makes the best tasting mango ice tea I've ever tried. Another great thing about this syrup is that you don't have use a whole lot of it to make your ice water taste wonderful! It is very economical. My only problem (jokingly) with it is that it does not last long enough (we love it so much we just go right through the 4 bottles of syrup, especially over the summer). I know for a fact that restaurants use this syrup as well and sell a cup of ice tea for like four dollars per mug, you can usually get a free refill during your meal, but compared to that the price here on Amazon is really right. It's well worth it!<br />Oh, and one more thing if you look at the label it lists no weird or potentially harmful ingredients.<br />It is made of pure cane sugar, water, mango flavor (don't know what that's made of, but oh well), concentrated lemon juice and potassium sorbate (as a preservative). It has 24g of sugars (25g of total carbs) per serving (1 fl. oz).<br />I can definitely recommend the Monin mango syrup for anyone who likes a refreshing and great tasting mango ice tea on a warm day!

review/text: My mother sent me these when I was in Iraq. They made my day. What could be better than going into the chow hall with a couple of these gems in your cargo pockets? Everyone is sitting down to breakfast and you pull a packet of Nutella out and calmly spread it over a croissant and eat it. Everyone is now staring at you in slack-jawed envy. What are you eating?? Nutella. Got it in a care package. :D<br /><br />These are seriously perfect for care packages. Double bag them of course in case the whole package gets squashed, but even in hot weather, they should arrive fine and be no worse for the high temperatures, since Nutella is supposed to be semi-liquid anyways. If you have a loved one overseas, or if you are involved in a group that sends troops care packages, I highly recommend you throw in a pack of these. They will make a young GI's day, like they did mine once.

review/summary: Threw away 80% of the shipment
review/text: The packets were pictured in a display box, which is how I wanted to receive them. Not only did they come without the box, but they were also busted open, I assume due to a change in air pressure during transit. Because I couldn't trust that, though, I had to throw most of the order away.

review/summary: Better Product Package
review/text: I thought this would be a good idea for travel, but I was wrong.  When I received the Nutella several of the individual packages had opened and were leaking.  I tried to pack some in lunch boxes and the same thing happened.  It makes a mess!  I would not buy the individual packages of Nutella again.

review/summary: This is not an actual case - Loose sachets were delivered in a postal box
review/text: I ordered quantity 2 of this item.  The Nutella sachets came loosely packed in a postal box.  There were 72 of them (2 cases worth), but I had to count them all to determine whether I even got what I paid for.<br /><br />I thought I was ordering two cases as illustrated in the photo but my shipment did not include the Nutella branded box which appears in the photo.
