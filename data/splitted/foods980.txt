review/summary: Good Keemun Congou tea
review/text: This is a very good tea, in my opinion. I am no tea aficionado but I was a big tea drinker in my days. The flavor is nice and not overwhelming and there is a subtle aftertaste which I like a lot. I recommend this tea for a quiet Friday summer afternoon in a back yard watching the sun go down.

review/summary: Tea I can't mess up
review/text: Since our mornings are very busy it is not unusually for me to leave the tea steeping too long or for me to have to reheat my cup at least twice. Somehow this tea still comes out tasting good.  It has a smokey flavor that is enhanced by just a bit of milk.  But is also very good plain or sweetened and chilled.  This is my households favorite tea.

review/text: Could not find the Crystal Lite decaf iced tea in grocery stores.  Had a wild thought about possibly finding it on line and was surprised to find that it was available on line.  Feels a little weird to order this online.  Product arrived in timely fashion, and is as fresh as if I just brought it home from the grocery store.  I anticipate that the next product I will seek on line is Crystal Lite's fruit punch.

However, I personally like the Lipton flavor more; it tastes more like "real" tea.

Ritter Sport's Nugat (not to be confused with Nougat) has a wonderful hazelnut-cacao (sort of Nutella-type) taste, melding on your tongue, and is not too sweet (I find US or UK chocolates really too sweet); it goes perfectly with black tea or coffee ..

review/summary: Best Homeopathic Dog Food Out There!
review/text: I had to write a review for this wonderful brand of dog food when I saw that no one gave it the credit it so richly deserves. Natures Variety Instinct is completely grain free and made from 95% meat and 5% assorted oils (like olive oil and fish oil), vegetables, fruits, and vitamins/minerals. I was a loyal follower of Canadie dog food for years until they decided to change their formula and increase their amounts of grains being used. Then the reports came in stating that so many dogs were getting sick over it. I was at a loss until I came across this line of dog food from a small manufacturing group. The reviews I read online were phenomenal and I decided to try it. I have a baby long-haired Chihuahua that absolutely loves this food. It doesnt give her an upset stomach, nor does it make her stools runny. She only has to eat a very small amount because its so nutrient packed. Her coat looks lustrous and her eyes sparkle. I decided to use the chicken meal formula because it offered a higher protein intake compared to the other instinct dry food options., but all of them offer the same fat intake and omega-3&6. It may not have the fancy commercials and the marketing campaign of more well known dog foods like Purina, but it more then makes up for it by making a product of exceptional quality.

review/summary: The best food you can give your dog
review/text: I struggled with my Rhodesian Ridgeback Mix Muriel and the allergies and sensitive stomach that she inherited.  We tried other premium brands such as Wellness, Canidae, Inova and even made our food until we found Nature's Variety.  It was actually recommended to us by a vet who specializes in dogs with allergies.<br /><br />Since we started feeding this fantastic food 4 years ago Muriel no longer gets hives, upset stomach or ear infections.  Her coat is glossy and she is as energetic as a puppy even though she's almost 9 years old.  We also feed Nature's Variety to our 2 cats and our other dog Gilbert (English Fox Hound Mix).  They love the chicken instinct but we rotate through the other flavors available and add Nature's Variety Canned and Raw frozen food (Available in a variety of flavors: Rabbit, Salmon, Duck, Beef, Lamb, Bison and Venison).<br /><br />I'm Lucky enough to know the owners of some of Muriel's Litter Mates and am Happy to say that I have made converts of some of them. Their dogs no longer need allergy shots or suffer from hives and upset stomach. As for the ones I haven't converted, I'm still working on them.<br /><br />But don't think this food is just for dogs with problems, this food has changed the health and lifestyle of all our pets.<br /><br />A word of caution this is a very nutrient packed food, no fillers. So you feed about 1/2 as much as you would of many other dry dog food.  See the Nature's Variety Feeding Chart at [...] to figure out how much food your dog or cat needs.

review/text: I purchased this food 1)for the ingredients and 2)for the convenience of Amazon.com delivery. With 2 small dogs, 13.2 lb. was the best size bag. Our older dog, with no digestive issues, just loves this food, gobbles it up, and she is a picky eater. She has no problems digesting the food. Our second dog has had digestive and allergy issues and had problems with the food. He loved the taste, but the result was loose watery stools, and we had to stop feeding immediately. Perhaps it was too rich for his system - we have since put him on a vegetarian diet with great success.

review/summary: Instinct Grain Free Chicken Meal Dry Dog Food
review/text: I have an 8 year old 8 lb toy fox terrier. With other dog foods he gains weight and eats a lot more at a time than he does with this Instinct dog food. I researched dog foods and tried to find ones that were the best and this is one of them.  I feed him and he eats the right amount of this daily and maintains a more healthy weight.  This dog food doesn't have a strong "dog food smell". It will take some time for him eat this size bag but the bag shelf life is good for this brand and it has a good tight bag sealer on it.  I put enough for a week in another container so I don't have to open this large bag very often.  I also have this on a quarterly automatic purchase with amazon and will save even more by buying the larger bag.  A 4.4 lb bag averages $16 or $17 and the 13.2 lb bag averages $32.53 but if you do the automatic plan, it is $30.90.  The information on the front of the bag under Chicken Meal Formula "says it all".

review/summary: Looks good on paper but my dog never stopped being sick.
review/text: We used Nature's Variety (non Instinct formula) for a while, but when we moved to our current location, the closest we could find was Natural Balance, so we had to switch.  When NB put out their grain free Alpha Dog, I tried that out and was amazed at how my normally very smelly Boston Terrier suddenly didn't seem to have any gas at all.  This got me searching for reviews, where I discovered the NV's Instinct line was rated much higher than NB's Alpha dog.  When I discovered the Amazon subscriptions, and how inexpensive that makes it(relative to what I pay at the pet store for organic pet food), I decided to give NV another try.  For the first week, I mixed the last of the old food with the new to get him used to it.  He had diarrhea and the worst gas EVER for days.  Now it's been a week on just the NV food and the sickness has not stopped.  I though maybe he was suffering from seasonal allergies and that's why he seemed so blahhh lately.  Last night I put it all together and realized it's the food.  I really wish I could get a refund, but at least I stopped the subscription in time not to get another.

review/text: Life without Duke's is hardly worth livin'. When I lived out in Los Angeles, my parents use ta' send me care packages from the blessed South, which always included Mrs. Duke's savory prescription. It is by far the best they is! I placed it in a movie that I was shooting in LA last year and when it arrived on set (much of the crew was from the South) it was welcomed as either an old friend or vessels of ambrosia. In short, I highly recomend Duke's, even to our friends from the colder side of the Mason-Dixon (as all of us in God's country are well familiar with it). It is great on a sandwich with peanut butter and bannana. Bon appetite!

review/summary: Loved by my picky eater!
review/text: My mixed terrier is very particular about her treats. If she doesn't like it, she'll take it, then drop it. If she likes it (rare), she'll take it and eat it right on the spot. If she loves it (very rare), she'll take it, hide it, and then act paranoid that you saw her hide it. So then she'll go get it and re-hide it multiple times until she's satisfied that you're not spying on her with a secret wish to devour  it the moment she blinks. Then she'll sneak it out once most of the family has gone to sleep so she can savor it in peace. So I can't really tell you where today's Lamb Trachey Chewz treat went, but I can be certain she loves it! Thanks to Clear Conscience Pet for producing a healthy, greatly desired treat!

review/text: This is a mild but nicely balanced curry. The price is great, and if you buy lots of curry, the shipping stays the same. The only cons are that the containers have no shaker top, and they are filled so that lots of curry becomes lodged in the threads of the lid so that when you open one, curry gets all over everything. They should improve this, but I can't complain much, since the price is so good, and the quality is very nice.

review/summary: In search of a good pizza sauce.....
review/text: We were looking for a nutritious and flavorful sauce for our homemade pizzas and stumbled onto this one. Glad we did. All healthy ingrediants and a pleasant flavor. After trying it, I then ordered a whole case. We tried several others and while healthy, the flavor didn't touch this product. Very pleased to have found it.

review/summary: Excellent Sauce
review/text: My husband and I have made homemade pasta sauce from Roma tomatoes we grow in our garden for the last 30 years. Last summer, due to weather conditions and blight on the plants, we didn't have enough tomatoes to make large batches of sauce.  I am Italian-American and have fairly high standards for pasta sauce.  I read online reviews and tried a few jarred sauces, only to be disappointed.  Since I frequently shop on Amazon, I searched for a pasta sauce with good reviews, and found this Eden sauce.  The ingredients were impressive and the price was very reasonable, so I decided to give it a try.  The flavor is very close to my homemade sauce, but the consistency is thicker, which makes it ideal for pizza.  I am very pleased with the quality and taste of this sauce.

review/text: This sauce is great for a base pasta sauce.  Many flavors can be added onto these already pure ingredients.  I buy this one for piece of mind, the flavor on its own is pretty good too.  A good company, plenty of other canned products they make are tasty also.

review/summary: Wonderfully Versatile Sauce
review/text: I started buying Muir Glen Pizza Sauce to make homemade pizza and absolutely loved it. On a repurchase, I accidentally ordered the Eden Pizza/Pasta Sauce and loved that as well for pizza. One day my husband wanted spaghetti but I was out of my usual base sauce, Classico. I always use a base and then add my own ingredients such as ground meat, garlic, diced tomatoes, herbs, etc. I took a chance and used the Eden Pizza/Pasta Sauce for my base and my husband loved it. This is a paraphrase but substantially what he said. "I know you have been making spaghetti sauce for me for thirty years and this can't possibly be the best, but it sure tastes like it." I had been concerned that it would taste more like pizza than spaghetti but it did not. I can't speak to how this sauce would taste over pasta without the amendments I made, but as a base it works beautifully. I have made lasagna, baked ziti and even eggplant parmigiana using this sauce and it always produces a delicious dish. This has become a staple in my cupboard. Thanks Eden Organic!

review/text: Serving size is just 2 ounces.  If I remember correctly, 2 ounces of sauce has 150 mg. of sodium.  That's over 1,000 mg. of sodium per can.  One serving for me is half a can, so that'a a lot of sodium.  I would only buy this again if the sodium was reduced further.

review/summary: All Homemade Pizza DeservesThis Sauce!!!
review/text: Okay so my family and I moved about 25 miles away from our fave pizza place which left me on a quest to find good sauce and this is definitely the one, single best canned pizza sauce. In my honest opinion second only to Don Pepino's which is also a good sauce but seems a tad more commercial(more like the stuff in the cheesy pizza spots, not sooo much authentic and not organic like this one). It is a thick sauce but not as thick as some other organic sauces I have tried (which seem kind of like marinara sauce with a pizza sauce label on it, lol). So this is my sauce of choice, I sometimes use as is or add some nice spices to it, fresh basil, sometimes dried hot peppers, whatever we're in the mood for :-) and this price is is better than my local whole foods.<br />If you're takig the time to make pizza at home (but no time to make sauce!) this is what you need!!<br />OH AND IF YOUR PUTTING PIZZA ON THE GRILL, IT'S THE ABSOLUTE BOMB :-D

review/text: I bought this tea for the health benefits, and although I am not the biggest fan of tea, I knew that this tea was extremely overbearing and is very hard to drink. This team smelled like perfume, as well as tasted like it. It left my mouth smelling like I drank a bottle of perfume and it just wasn't pleasant at all. I can usually handle things that taste bad, but this was an exception. If you can get over the strong taste, however, I'm sure you'll be fine.

review/summary: Worst Green Tea Ever
review/text: This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be "organic" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad.

review/summary: Good taste, but very hard, even sharp
review/text: I really wanted to get these as take away snacks for my kids that would not "rot" in my bag if I happen to forget it was in there. And for that it works great, we can have fresh fruit at any time and I even leave a few in the glove compartment for snacking myself. However, while the flavor is fantastic, they are very hard, almost the consistency of hard candy (not quite, but almost) so much that a few times I got a few cuts on the roof of my mount from a sharp piece. Needless to say my kids were not fans of these as they were used to the softer ones that melt in your mouth from Trader Joe's. I would totally up my review if they were not so hard. I ended up eating most of these myself, which like I said was not a torture as they were delicious, but I will not be ordering again, unless they can make them less sharp (literally).

The last couple orders of Indus Organics and Spicy World cinnamon I bought from Amazon had all the flavor of hardwood flooring (these are much more expensive products). I love to boil or pressure cook 6 or 7 sticks and mix with black tea for a killer batch of ice tea. The only reason I dogged Amazon a star is the fact you can often buy the same 8-oz McCormick cinnamon sticks at Costco for half the price. Still, great stuff and I'll be back for more.

review/summary: Great gift for the foodie in your life!
review/text: Last year I gave this along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125">Salt: Cooking with the World's Favorite Seasoning</a> to my foodie friends and family. They all loved it! The salt tubes were well packaged and I ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes. The package also came with salt samples which I really appreciate. I have Collection Sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit.

review/summary: First class company, wonderful offerings
review/text: I purchased the Old World collection directly from the Spice Lab as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  The item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule. A small wooden salt spoon, sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference/index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included. Brett was responsive and helpful. This is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices. I will definitely make a future purchase and refer the Spice Lab to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered.  The first time I used one of the salts, I was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top. The tubes should not be so fragile so I sent an email to that affect to Brett, the owner. Despite answering my initial email about how much I loved the gift and where could I post a positive comment, he has not responded with regards to the breakage. Good customer service would be to follow up.....

review/summary: Excellent starter set.
review/text: What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.<br /><br />I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.<br /><br />This is an excellent product.

review/text: This is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating.  It has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of salt in the collection.  In other words, each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker.

review/text: Purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends - It is great and attractive! A note to purchasers: we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns, if you contact the seller directly they will work with you. The seller send me a replacement vial (very quickly) and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it.  Will definitely get this set for others (maybe even me) in the future.

review/summary: Review Correction
review/text: On Sept.12 I posted the following seller review:<br />  3/5 stars:<br />  "I'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage. On the top front edge of the rack there is what I would call a dent, but it's also rough. From the way it was packaged I would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box. I intended this as a gift, and I don't have time to return it, so I'll just try to sand it down so it's at least smooth."<br />  Jammies, September 12, 2012<br />Later Amazon added:<br />  Message from Amazon: "This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience."<br /><br />Shortly after I posted it, I received an email from The Spice Lab Inc. offering to send a new block. I sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area. They sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order. The replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter-in-law.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have contacted The Spice Lab before I posted the review, so they could have had time to resolve the problem. I had jumped to the conclusion that I'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement, which wasn't the case.<br /><br />Since it's a gift, I can't speak to the quality of the salt, but I can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive, and the little spoon is a charming addition.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the efforts of Brett at The Spice Lab, and I would happily buy from them again.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no breakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price.

review/summary: Vegeta's The Best!
review/text: I use Vegeta in everything savory! I'm a vegetarian and not using beef or chicken broth for bases is a real challange. A little goes a long way which makes it so much more economical than a lot of spices and flavorings. It's awesome on steamed vegetables, in soups and casseroles and just about anything you want a delicious flavor boost! I use to buy it locally in a Ukrainian market but since they have closed I have to buy online, but I don't mind. I can't cook without it!

review/summary: I wish I had found this earlier
review/text: I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer.

review/text: I've tried McCormick's (too bland) and Lawry's (the runner-up) and a few other brands that I can no longer remember, but this is by far the best guacamole seasoning mix I've used. It's surprisingly peppery (a sweet red smoked pepper flavor) and has a good onion taste, too. It comes very close to tasting like the guacamole from the local Mexican restaurant, which is fairly authentic. It's still guacamole for gringos, but barely- it's good stuff.

review/text: This is an incredible product.  First, Erewhon is a highly respected company for bringing quality ingredients to our grocery shelves.  For those of us who can't eat wheat or prefer not to, this is the cereal brand of choice.  Brown Rice with just simple, natural ingredients.  I love them all, but this Cocoa Crispy one is my favorite for the whole family.  My nieces, 5 and 6 love this cereal so much that I send them boxes every month.  My college aged kids love it because it fills them up and it is highly nutritious for the beginning or even end of the night snack.  With all the junk they can eat in the cafeterias, this cereal really is a welcome food!  I love it for my chocolate fix.  This with almond milk is the perfect snack!  Great company, great tasting food!

review/summary: Tasteless
review/text: I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.<br /><br />I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.<br /><br />I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).<br /><br />It is cheaper than granola.  When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola.  I also have envirokids to try next.
