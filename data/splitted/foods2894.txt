review/summary: Best Coconut Oil
review/text: I love the versatality of this oil. It is good coconut oil but not to strong. I use it on my skin, hair and had a teaspoon or 2 in my cocoa tea and it works well in all. I am not certain about the usage on my face though - my skin started feeling a bit dry after a few applications at night. So I am still looking into that. All in all it is a good product for a good price!

review/summary: Outstanding and Delicious
review/text: I ordered on January 9th and received it on January 11th.  Amazing : )<br />I've never purchased or used Coconut Oil - organic or otherwise - but I've been checking out some of it's health benefits.  After reading the positive reviews and seeing the great low price, I had to try it.<br /> I've been battling dry mouth and thought I'd coat my tongue and gums before I go to bed.  Maybe it will help "seal in" the moisture.  Who knows.  If it doesn't, it's a delicious mistake.  It's REALLY YUMMY!<br />I'd definitely recommend it -

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great product, tastes great. I mixed this with some banana cream pudding and it was heavenly. The coconut flavor and smell it gives is incredible. I also add 2 tblsp to my green tea with honey and it gives my tea that extra yum factor. Will be reordering this product and i am currently actively trying out new recipes for this. I bought 2-16 oz jars, but i can quickly see that will not be enough as i will be using it on skin and hair. This is the real deal, it is not the refined oil you find in grocery stores. Refined vs Unrefined, i'll go with unrefined.

review/summary: Very strong coconut flavor
review/text: This seems a good product, but, if you are using it in the kitchen, be sure you like a strong coconut flavor. I previously had used the Whole Foods coconut oil, and it does not have a pronounced coconut taste, so I was unprepared for the strong flavor of this product. I'll keep what I have left for moisturizer and conditioner.

review/text: I've had this product for a total of 48 hours and I'm raving about it already, it tastes AMAZING you can literally not go wrong with this product. Don't like the results on your hair? Try it on that dry patch of skin you have. Not healing it quick enough? Put it on a piece of toast. Coconut flavor too strong? Bake with it as a substitute for other butters/oils in recipes. And statistically, how can one person not be happy with at least one of these options that coconut oil offers? Honestly, this is the smartest purchase I have ever made, I will never go back to putting butter on toast, the coconut flavor is absolutely delicious. The texture is much lighter and it just smells so.amazingly.GOOD. I love how the subtle taste infused into my sunny side up egg, and although I haven't tried it in other foods yet, I'm REALLY looking forward to doing so IMMEDIATELY!!

It brought my blood pressure down from 150/80 to 126/62. My skin soaks it up and looks younger. I eat it with my meals. It has a mild, pleasant coconut taste.

Anyway, both myself and the squirrels love it!  It tastes great just on its own...I'm looking forward to trying it as a spread on whole wheat bread.  I recommend this product very highly...it's delicious!

review/summary: EXCELLENT Hair Conditioner - Blonde Hair
review/text: I LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR!  I am caucasian with blonde highlighted hair. My hair strands are fine but I do have a lot of hair and it is relatively long. My scalp is also naturally a little oily. My hair is healthy, but I do need deep conditioning though as I expose my hair to a lot of elements. (I give all of this detail in case someone is making the decision for themselves as identifies with my hair profile.)<br /><br />My Hubby is a hairdresser / salon owner and because of this I get to try all kinds of hair products.  I've even had expensive caviar shampoo and conditioner (As I roll my eyes). I've used other oils in my hair and most require several washings to get the oil out.  Not this Coconut Oil.  I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap a satin wrapping cap around it while I sleep.  (available near the relaxer s in the hair care section of the store) When I wake I shampoo an condition like normal and my hair looks amazing! I use it twice a week now!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Nothing and I mean nothing has made my hair feel as silky and look as shiny as this Coconut Oil.<br /><br />The oil starts out think like crisco but melts in your hands when rubbed together quickly.  This consistency makes it super easy to apply.<br /><br />It isn't runny or drippy.<br /><br />Amazingly "repairs" hair after too much sun, surf, chlorine etc.<br /><br />When washed it does not leave a fragrance behind.<br /><br />No Chemicals! 100% Organic and good for you!<br /><br />THE TRICKY<br /><br />It smell of the coconut is rich and luscious and I love it -  but it was hard to ignore it when I woke up or turned over in the night.  It only took about two applications though for me to get used to it.

review/summary: SOOOOO DAMN TASTY
review/text: I originally purchased this to use a something to give juicyness and flavor to plain meals such as chicken breast and spinach. I ate some of this with coconut cookies and couldn't stop until I accepted that it is oil... so I can't be eating insane amounts of it. Very nice that it has good fats in it as well. I used a bit as  moisturizer for my face after it was quite dry and my face was supppppppper hydrated and moist after, so make sure you barely put as much as the size of this 'O' on your finger tip.

review/summary: I like the product
review/text: But there is something strange about the packaging.  My home is constantly over 76F, so it is always a liquid.  When it arrived, the box was partially soaked with coconut oil.  I can't find the leak and the bottle and inner seal seems to be ok.  Since I only use it for hair and skin care, I am keeping it.<br /><br />The smell is really nice and not overwhelming.  Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.  But whether it does anything to the skin long term is another story.<br /><br />BTW, many other oils are near odourless.  This oil is the exception that have a faint coconut odour to it.

review/text: Just recently purchased this product, having never used it as a stand alone product.  Usually use products that contain coconut oil.  I found this to be a great moisturizer for both skin and hair, and it smells wonderful.  Both my young nieces use it for their skin and also love it.  One of my nieces thinks it smells like pound cake!  It is an oil though, so it's hard to use as a moisturizer right out of the jar, so I put it in a spray bottle.  Much better.  I recommend this for a good moisturizer.

review/summary: best beauty product Iv'e ever used
review/text: I just bought a second jar of coconut oil because I'm almost done with my first and I don't want to run on E. I use this as a skin moisturizer, hair deep conditioner, I sometimes eat a spoon from my fridge stack ( cuz it does taste good.) I love the smell  too. I even use it as a makeup remover and I use it as a lip balm mixed with Shea butter lips feels so smooth. I have people complement me on my skin tone and how smooth my skin is. I don't tell too many people about it because those who are not aware of any oil benefit automatically assumes its like corn oil or any other cooking oil and are put off by it.  Not me I've read plenty about it and I am never going without it again.  I haven't used used another brand of coconut oil but I will say that the best type is cold compressed coconut oil and organic extra virgin.

review/text: I recently moved to Colorado, where it is always dry. Moisturizing body lotions alone just don't cut it for me. A friend introduced me to Nature's Way Coconut Oil and I fell in love. I mix it with my regular body lotion before applying it. My skin stays moisturized, feels baby soft, and does not feel oily. I have a problem with fragrances in general, and was at first worried about smelling like a coconut. However, that is not a problem at all; there is no scent. I've ordered this product twice so far and will continue to do so.

I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how good this taste.  I even eat small amounts right out of the jar.  I must say, not all coconut oil is the same.  I ran out so I bought more coconut oil at a local grocery store.  It is not the same, I am so disappointed.  The aroma isn't there.

review/text: First of all, the fragrance is subtle and heavenly and I love it. I noticed an immediate improvement in my skin. It's softer, and not just on the surface -- it feels healthier deep down and the tone is more even. I use it on my face as well. I prefer natural products, so I read up on the benefits of virgin coconut oil and then checked out the reviews here on Amazon. I completely agree with all of the positive things customers have written about this product. It's wonderful and has so many uses that are healthy and beneficial. It smells good, tastes good and feels good and I can't imagine being without it now. I'm hooked for good -- a lifer!

If you are protein sensitive i would not recommend using this but my hair loves protein so this is another products i will use for life. I don't use it on my scalp because my scalp starts to itch when its on my scalp so its only applied to the length on my hair.

review/text: I use this oil daily and get a subscription from AMZ. Normally it comes to my home ok. But in the summer, the oil turns from solid to liquid (above 78 F ambient), and sometimes the seal on the jar does not hold. This is what happened recently. AMZ happily replaced the shipment, but the real problem is with the manufacturer, who needs a more dependable seal.

review/summary: The best there is...
review/text: I have been using coconut oil as a body/face/hair moisturizer for about a year now and it has made all the difference in the world for my health. After doing a bit of research, I chose this product in particular due to the description, reviews, pricepoint, and the fact that it is a brand I have seen in many stores and am familiar with.<br /><br />The non-processed nature of this oil meets my skincare and haircare needs, but also makes it perfect for cooking as well. I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines.

review/text: I ordered this after having a facial where they used a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil and tamanu oil. My skin felt so wonderful, I had to try it for myself!  She recommended just getting coconut oil.  I actually really like that it solidifies so that I can just rub a little in my palms to heat it and apply it to my face & body.  It does feel a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely and my skin has never felt or looked better.  (I'm also using diluted apple cider vinegar as an astringent.)<br /><br />Now I need to try some of the other uses for coconut oil!

review/summary: great for my hair, but causes acne
review/text: Hello! am a 17 year old teenage girl and I bought product because I have very damaged hair from straightening. I also have mild acne.<br /><br />I am VERY satisfied with how my hair looks only after one deep conditioning treatment with this. You seriously only need about 1-2 teaspoon and my hair is about 1 and 1/2 feet long. My hair was SO soft! My sister eventually asked why I kept running my hands through my hair all day (I'm still doing it right now :D). And the reason for that is because it was softer and silkier, but MOSTLY it helped keep my hair tangle-free.<br /><br />Before I purchased this, I read some other reviews that claimed it was great for acne. I don't know why but it did not work for me. I only use a teeny bit on my face after a shower and the next day, I had a few whiteheads. At first I thought, "well maybe its supposed to be like this before it gets any better".. But it has been 5 days and it keeps getting worse. I am VERY disappointed. I don't know, maybe it is just my skin type.. I have dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />So overall, I give it a 5 for hair treatment and 1 for "skin clearing".

review/summary: Coconut Oil user for Life
review/text: I originally purchased this item because my mom has been using Coconut Oil for years and her skin is always so soft, smooth and flawless.  She told me she uses it on her hair and it worked wonders.  So after researching it's benefits on the internet I decided to purchase some.  This brand had the best reviews.  I used it as a leave in conditioner on my transistioning hair (I'm afro american) and it gave me a new head of soft hair!  My hair was damaged from dying my hair after a relaxer and it started breaking and shedding extremly bad.  After using the coconut oil one time my hair is moisturized all the way to my ends, no shedding, shiny, non greasy, and just plain beautiful.  I've also decided to use it in cooking too.  I HIGHLY recommend trying some, you won't regret it!! And it tastes and smells wonderful!!

review/summary: It conditions your hair.....and you can eat it too!
review/text: In my never-ending search to find odd, unusual and inexpensive beauty products I have finally found "COCONUT OIL"!!!<br /><br />I read a beauty book recently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892349">Can You Get Hooked on Lip Balm?: Top Cosmetic Scientists Answer Your Questions about the Lotions, Potions and Other Beauty Products You Use Every Day</a> that claimed that natural, organic, cold pressed coconut oil was the only oil that could actually penetrate the hair shaft. It seems all other oils, including mineral, olive, and sunflower can only coat the hair, at best a temporary cure.<br /><br />What makes coconut oil special? Its about 90% saturated fatty acid which contains about 40% lauric acid. Among it's almost mythical and magical properties it is "reputed" to cure a host of maladies including high cholesterol, obesity, infections,(all highly doubtful)and dry hair and skin (believable). It is also a food product that can be used as a butter substitute a shortening and a frying oil. My interest, however, is hair, just hair.<br /><br />Interestingly, coconut oil solidifies at temperatures under 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an air conditioned home in a temperate climate, this oil will be solid most of the time. I decanted a few teaspoons into a small container from the wide jar the product comes in. I keep the original container in the refrigerator and the small one in the bathroom where it is usually much warmer than the rest of my house.<br /><br />When liquefied, this oil is fairly thick and milky looking. It smells deliciously of coconut. To me it tastes of .... coconut grease....but not in a totally bad way.<br /><br />To use this as a hair conditioner one needs to start slowly and experiment. Although my hair is thick it has a fairly fine texture. The first few times I used the oil I over applied it and my hair became flat and greasy looking.<br /><br />As a hair conditioner, it is recommended to coat your dry hair and scalp with the oil, cover your head with a towel and let it penetrate for an hour or two. Using non-conditioning shampoo, apply a small amount to your dry hair and rub it in without adding any water at first. Then, after the shampoo has been rubbed in, add small amounts of warm water until you build up a lather. Rinse, then shampoo again normally. Your hair will be very soft and smooth.<br /><br />As a hair dressing, use only a very tiny amount unless your have thick, very curly or kinky hair. I gave a friend with long thick curly hair some of the oil and she is completely in love with it.<br /><br />A little of this product goes a very long way. A jar should last a very long time. Besides, if you don't like it as a hair product, you can always eat it!

review/summary: Love this EVCO!
review/text: I love organic coconut oil and feel it is a must in our diet. I just couldn't stomach the $16 price tag from Whole Foods anymore for the exact same product. I received it today, it has the exact same exp date on the package (I know that is an issue with some items on Amazon, products being too close to the exp date and maybe that is why you got it at a bargain price).<br />Came well packaged with the seal intact, no problems. I will buy it again from this seller. And with Amazon Prime, it makes it a super bargain!<br />Also, if you are doing your research on the many amazing properties coconut oil possesses, you know that it is anti-bacterial. I discovered almost 3 yrs ago that I was allergic to antiperspirant/deo. My armpits would itch and I would scratch them almost raw. When I stopped using anti/deo, the itch stopped. Looking around online, this happens to many people. What to do? Well, I went to Whole Foods and bought plenty of natural deos that did not work AT ALL! Good for me they take back anything, including used deo. I researched and found a recipe for coconut oil deo. It has cornstarch, baking soda, and coconut oil. I followed a recipe, (google coconut oil deodorant recipe) formed it into an old deo container, and what do you know? It works like a charm! NO ODOR! It does not stop sweat, but guess what folks? You are supposed to sweat under your armpits, it is your body's way of detoxifying itself. Sweat smells when the bacteria from the skin and the perspiration meet in a dark, warm place- the armpit. The EVCO inhibits the production of bacteria. You have a serious amount of lymph nodes there that need the freedom to move toxins out of your body. And we wonder why women get breast cancer more and more these days. When I have important social events or meeting I use a regular antiperspirant, but 90% of the time I use this. Keep in fridge in warmer climates, it melts at 76 degrees F.<br /><br />Coconut oil is truly amazing stuff, give it a try. Can't hurt.

review/summary: I enjoy the many uses of this product
review/text: I love coconut oil for everything. There are so many use for this. I use it for a hair and skin conditioner. I cook with it as a healthy oil not for flavor. It doesn't really have flavor. I love that it is organic and extra virgin. It was shipped promptly and it did not leak at all. It has a safety seal on it so it can't leak unless it was already opened or perhaps busted. I add this to my smoothies. It helps keep you regular if you use it on a daily basis. I will be ordeering this again. I like what this product do for me. I am on a weight management program and I use this as one of my tools to help me. You do not need to refrigerate this unless you want it solid. I store mine in the cabinet I don't mind it being an oil form.

review/text: Great price if you suscribe. I use this product for cooking. It adds a light coconut flavor to less flavorful foods, like tofu. I also use it  on my skin, and I use it on my hair. It is a good moisturizer and does not leave my skin or my hair greasy. It is quite the versatile product. I have not seen all the benefits touted by advocates of coconut oil, but I've only been using the product for a month. I would  recommend this product for anyone wanting to try coconut oil.

review/text: I didn't know what to expect from this product.  Others speak of using it on their hair, skin, & etc...I chose to use it for cooking.  This Coconut Oil has to be the cleanest tasting, delicious product I have ever used to fry with.  I cannot eat foods that have a lot of grease, so this product is perfect for me.  It does not taste oily at all & the taste of your foods come through, not like other cooking oils.  I will absolutely continue to purchase more.

review/summary: First try with virgin coconut oil
review/text: I recently started with the coconut oil.  I tried the Louana product I got at the local Kroger.  No flavor, but it was a start.  After reading the various reviews, I thought I'd try this since this seemed such a reasonable price.<br />I am quite happy with it.  The coconut taste is fine and definitely different than the Louana, so I mixed the two to make it go further and make the Louana more flavorful and economize my use of coconut oil.

This one has a much more coconutty taste.  Plus this one is Extra Virgin so it is healthier than the Expeller pressed that I used to buy.  Better price and better quality.  I love this coconut oil.

review/summary: Great for smoothies!!
review/text: I bought this and another brand to try and both are equally as good.  I do like the clear container that this comes in though better so this is the brand I will stick with.  It comes in a clear plastic container and I don't notice any plastic taste as others have commented on coconut oil in general.  I just put a big spoonful in my magic bullet when I make smoothies!  So yummy!!  You can eat this straight out of the jar if you want to also.  It is good!  When I first got it (shipped in the winter), it was pretty firm and I had to scrape it with a spoon to get it out..like candle wax.  But once it warmed up a bit..just room temperature, it is very soft now.  It still is a solid though, but easier to work with.  It is similar to the inside of an Almond Joy candy bar at room temp.  I can't comment on health affects since I am a relatively healthy person with bloodwork that shows great results..so far, but am only 34 yrs old.  I love coconut and hope it can help with brain function, memory mostly..lol.  I hope if I start taking it now, it will help long term. Once I run out, I will be getting the largest jar for my money!  My husband and kids love the smoothies made with this! It's not overpowering either..just the perfect hint of coconut among the other fruit and veggies. I made mango, pineapple, banana, and coconut smoothies that were just awesome!! Even all blended up well, you can still see the tiny white coconut flakes within the smoothies. Just yummy!!

review/text: This is so wonderful that I have to put it on the saver program with Amazon.  I use this for everything, from cooking to putting it on right after the shower to putting it in mine and my children's hair before I condition wash our hair.  I even put it in my Chai tea and it's wonderful on toast, infact it's so great that I don't need any other type of spread like mayo or anything, it's absolutely delicious.  My youngest doesn't like the smell but what does she know, she's only 9, everyone else in the house loves it.  My first jar lasted about a month, but I had to split some of it up so I'd have some in the bathroom and the rest in the kitchen.  I like that it doesn't liquify until you put in on your skin, it only liquified once(it was over 75 degress where I had it) and I put in the frig, however; when I took it out it was too hard.  You'll be very happy when you purchase this and needless to say it came very quickly, I'm on the prime membership so I rec'd it in 2 days.  I love it so much that I'm having a fit because I ran out. Just another note for this (3/12) this stuff cleared up my eczema, I mean it's gone and my skin glows.

I was a little concerned because it smelled kinda sweet, so I wasn't certain if it would alter the taste of my savory dishes. It made them taste better than butter ever did! After doing a little more research I found there are SOOOO many other beneficial uses. So, I have taken to using it on my hair and skin. In fact, I had a little eczema episode on my wrist that the coconut oil healed in less than a week and it has not returned. Highly recommended.

I can eat it plain, but one of my favorite ways to eat it is with some mini chocolate chips sprinkled over a spoonful of it. Yum! I also like to cook french toast in it and top my sweet potatoes with it. My only complaint is that it's a little grainy. I don't notice it so much when I eat it, but I do when I'm using it as a moisturizer. It's not that big of a deal though. And to be fair, this is the only coconut oil I have ever bought so I can't compare it to any other brands. I love it so much, though, that I have no reason to try any other brands.

review/summary: Ease into if you're not used to it, pure quality product
review/text: You can taste the coconut. It's slightly sweet. I took about a generous tablespoon in my first ingestion attempt. Mind you, I've previously used other coconut oils before, but I would have to say the were greatly inferior to this product.<br /> I felt ill to the stomach within 30-45 minutes of consuming the tablespoon...I did what every American does, I googled. Turns out that it's common for those who have an overabundance of yeast in the system.  I drink tons of beer, well Belgian wheat ale to be exact, and the coconut oil reportedly acts as a detox according to some holistic opinions. I'm willing to give it a  further try. I think it's best that you ease into coconut oil therapy vice gobbling a juicy tablespoon of it. I will update this review in a few months, but few on people  on Amazon report experiencing any malaise from consuming coconut oil and I had to do a quick search to learn how common it is.<br />Otherwise, I concur that this is a superior product and if any true benefit would be redeemed from ingesting coconut oil, this would be one of the key ones to try.

review/summary: Dotties Coconut Oil
review/text: This is a good & refreshing product. You don't need much to use in a fry pan, But the only thing I noticed is that it is like wax.  I thought it w/be like how it is explaned on page, "An Oil" ~ Oils pour out, and this doesn't ~ you have to use a knife or hard spoon to get out.<br /><br />BUT, I MUST TELL YOU ~ I did like how it tastes as long as it's cooked w/something.  I broke up pieces of 1 flour tortilla in just a regular frypan frying till I liked it ~ chrunchy crisp.  Then put on paper towel to absorb any extra oil, then powdered......Mmmm, it hit the spot.  It made such a simple item into a great tasting snack for my cravings.  Haven't used long enough to tell if it's a energy booster.  ALL IN ALL, EXCEPT FOR THE WAXINESS OF IT, IT DOES FRY THINGS GOOD.<br /><br />DOTTIE T., ERIE
