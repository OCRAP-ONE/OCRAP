review/summary: Chewy Deliciousness
review/text: I opened my Big Nut Bar to see what appeared to be a rice krispies treat coated at the bottom with peanut butter.<br /><br />After taking my first bite, I realized that the texture was far chewier then a rice krispies. This wasn't surprising, as dried peanuts are a bit tougher then rice krispies.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that the peanut bar was pretty tasty. However, it was a little to chewy for my taste. This should be avoided by all people who wear dentures, as one bite may take your teeth right off.

review/summary: This is a yummy snack!
review/text: When I received these Planters Big Nut Bars, I had just brewed a strong pot of coffee and it happened to be the time that my four kids usually have their afternoon snack.  Overall, we thought this was a great snack.  My two daughters, who each love to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, said:<br />13-year-old daughter: "Ummm, this is good!"<br />10-year-old daughter: "Really, really good!  Tastes just like peanut butter with a ton of nuts."<br /><br />My two sons, who don't usually opt for the PBJ sandwiches but do like to have granola bars for snacks said:<br />14-year-old son:  "It's really peanut-buttery.  It's okay." Then he ate it all.<br />8-year-old son:  "I kind of like it.  I don't love it, but it's pretty tasty."  He finished his, too.<br /><br />  The bars are blocks of peanuts with a soft layer of peanut butter on the bottom.  They taste great with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. They have no trans fat, 7 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and 220 calories, so I felt like I was giving my kids (all of normal weight, active) a filling and healthy afternoon snack that would hold them over until dinner.

review/summary: Pretty tasty even if you're not a granola fan
review/text: Because I'm always looking for ways to get my son to eat more protein, I thought I'd give the Planters Big Nutty Bars a try.  I'm not a fan of granola OR peanuts but I thought these were actually pretty tasty!  They're not dry like some granola bars are (this doesn't mean they won't make you thirsty).  They reminded me more of a candy bar, maybe because of the layer of peanut butter on the bottom.  I kept the wrapper on while eating it (rolling it down as needed), avoiding any sticky hands or mess.  I'd recommend this as a filling snack that's easy to keep in your purse or backpack.  It didn't earn 5 stars because though it's made of whole grain oats, it also has a bunch of  oils and fructose (which is probably why it actually tastes good).

review/summary: Satisfying peanut-buttery snack
review/text: If you like peanut butter, and chewy-yet-firm, sweet candy bars, you'll probably love these.  Although the taste and texture remind me of a candy bar, this is actually a much more healthy snack.  The first ingredient is peanuts, so you get 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  The total sugar count is a reasonable 12 grams--less than half what you will find in the most popular peanut/chocolate candy bars.  To me, this means I'll get a longer lasting boost of energy and be able to satisfy my sweet tooth without having too much sugar.<br /><br />In summary, love the taste, and think these are a great balance of sweetness and nutrition.

review/summary: Perfect on the Go Mega-Snack
review/text: The most important thing to know about these bars is that they are filling.  They could probably replace a meal for hungry eaters.  I should also add that they are delicious--a nice blend of sweet and salty.  Think a Pay Day dipped in peanut butter and you are on the right track. Make no mistake, these are pure junk food, but they do provide a nice boost of energy.  Another convenient surprise is that they do not melt in the summer heat.  These bars are the perfect in the car, on the go, or at the beach hunger catch-all.

review/text: These bars are actually pretty good. They have a layer of big peanut chunks and rice, and then a bottom layer of a peanut-butter-like substance.<br /><br />Not only are they fairly tasty, I grabbed one for a quick breakfast and it filled me up more than a bar usually would.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are a bit sweeter than I would prefer. Otherwise, I was pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Planters Big Nut Bar - Very good and filling
review/text: 46 grams, 220 calories, and 110 fat calories. The bar is a mix of peanuts, rice, and granola on a layer of peanut butter. I kept the bar in my shirt pocket for about an hour before eating and it made the peanut butter melt a little and stick to the wrapper.<br /><br />Taste wise it was delicious. Saltier than I would have liked - 160 mg sodium. Wrapper claims it is 30% bigger, and I did feel that the bar lasted longer. It was filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I found it interesting that there are only 5 bars in each box. There is room for the sixth one, but why would you put only 5?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the product. I feel it could have been made bit more healthful. I am sure I will enjoy the remaining bars.

review/text: I jumped at the chance to try these peanut bars because I'd tried and really liked the Planters Big Nut Triple Nut bars last month, and I was hoping I'd like these Double Peanut bars just as much.  Although they are good, they aren't as good as the Triple Nut bars.  They are not as soft, and it's much harder to chew these.  Also, there is a layer of peanut butter on the bottom of the bar, and I just found that to be a bit of overkill.<br /><br />They were good, better than other peanut snack bars, but my heart belongs to the Triple Nut bars.

review/summary: Bitter sweet
review/text: These bars start out sweet when you first bite into them - almost like you're having a peanut butter sandwich. But then they leave a bitter after taste. On the plus side, it's really very nutty! But that bitter after taste is the main the reason why I don't like this product. And if that matters to you, I wouldn't buy this.

review/summary: 30 Miles Per Bar
review/text: Despite the fact that they are nutritionally not much better for you than some candy bars, I really enjoy the taste of the Planters Double Peanut Big Nut Bars.  A little bit salty and a little bit sweet, their flavor is similar to that of a Payday candy bar crossed with a spoonful of super-chunky (and I do mean SUPER chunky) peanut butter.<br /><br />My order arrived in the middle of a hot Texas afternoon, and the first bar I ate was a bit of a gooey mess.  But after a night in the pantry, the peanut butter on the bottom of the remaining bars had re-solidified, leaving them slightly sticky but firm enough to eat with my fingers.  I had my second one right before setting out on a 30 mile bike ride, and found it to be a good source of sustained energy.  I normally eat an energy bar in the middle of a ride to refuel my body, but the Planters Big Nut Bar stuck with me through my entire exercise.<br /><br />Comparing the Big Nut Bar to a regular sized Snickers, I noticed that the Planters product has less fat, a lot less sugar, and more protein than my favorite candy treat.  I can definitely state that I will purchase this product in the future and enjoy it whenever I feel deserving of a special guilty pleasure.

review/summary: Will beckon you with it's evil sweet, salty, creamy goodness. Dang it.
review/text: So I got my pack of the big nut bars...I had, coincidentally, just eaten a Weight Watcher's "sweet and salty" snack bar. It was not yet dinner time. My craving had already been crunched...but there that box sat, on my car seat, taunting me...<br /><br />...Mr Peanut smugly snickered there on that blue box amidst a background photo of a nutty bar. And as if that wasn't daunting enough, that photo depicted the bar being pulled apart to show a creamy smooth peanut butter topping...a real double-decker-o'-sin. right. there. in. my. car.<br /><br />Yet I countered my objections thinking how bad a sin could it be with only 12 grams of sugar? Not bad for a treat, per se. Couldn't I justify the indulgence by the fact that peanuts are a healthy, filling food, full of protein and actually the good monounsaturated fats... and there were hidden whole grains within it's creamy crunchy sweety salty nutty bits before me?<br /><br />I looked away.<br /><br />"Come hither" it continued to beckon.<br /><br />Hating myself and my loss of self-control, I hung my head, shunned my values, tossed aside my diet, and told myself I'd allow myself just one small moment of sin...one tiny piece of rapture...a taste...but no more.<br /><br />I opened my lips...freshly painted with tulip shimmer lip gloss (as I had no intention of peanuts crossing them mere moments earlier.)<br /><br />And, alack and alas...Dang it.It was good. Soft yet with a mellow crispness from crisped rice and granola and that rich peanut heaven that so often goes hand-in-hand with sinful indulgences--just beaming it's taste throughout.<br /><br />I closed my eyes and shuttered in shame.<br /><br />I filled my mouth with all 220 calories.<br /><br />And I have no regrets.

review/summary: Bland and hard
review/text: These things are advertised as "chewy", but they are actually pretty stiff.<br /><br />They don't taste so great either.  The peanut butter on the bottom is not especially good, and the rest of it lacks flavor.<br /><br />The nutrition content is not much different from a Payday, which is a good combination of salty and sweet (and also softer).  Both have similar calorie totals, similar calories from fat, similar saturated fat, and similar sodium.  Both also have peanuts as the first ingredient, followed by 2 forms of sugar as the 2nd and 3rd.  The Planters bar has only a single extra gram of fiber to show for its meager dose of oats.<br /><br />I wonder if the only reason planters included an insignificant amount of oats is to qualify as a "granola bar" instead of "candy".  But if you check the nutrition label, there isn't much reason to choose this unsatisfying lump.

It tastes good and seems to be of good quality as you'd expect from Mr. Peanut.

review/summary: Not Nutty Enough For A Peanut Nut
review/text: The binder ingredient in this large snack bar is crisped rice so it tastes like a "Rice Crispy Treat" with peanuts inside. The crispy rice forms the dominant texture of the bar.  An occasional peanut is not enough to give the rich meaty crunch of a handful of roast peanuts which I was expecting from the picture on the box.  The dominant flavor comes from the coating of sweet peanut butter on the bottom of the bar.  Because the sweetening is corn syrup, the bar is sweet but the flavor is not remarkable or distinctive.  Certainly the "Double Peanut" marketing implies one thing, but I find the bar disappointing and the peanut butter undercoat is messy in warm weather.<br /><br />However, there are worse snacks!  Each bar offers 100% of vitamin E, no cholesterol and no trans fats.  There's a reasonable amount of sodium and 7 grams of protein per bar.  A decent energy snack and a quick pick-me-up when the blood sugar is running low.

review/summary: Okay for a quick peanuty snack, but...
review/text: If you're craving a handy peanuty snack, then this will likely suit your tastes.  However, I found it a bit too sweet for the 'salty' I was looking for.<br /><br />While the package highlights 7gms of protein, don't think this is 'lean' protein.  With 13gms of fat per bar, you're packing away 20% of your RDA.  I was surprised at other contents as well.<br /><br />Pleasantly:<br />Sodium is 160gms (7%)<br />Carbs 22gms (12%)<br />Fiber 3g (12%)<br /><br />I expected all these numbers to be higher, so this swayed favor with me.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm not keen on the inclusion of corn syrup (though not hydrogenated) as an ingredient, but was happy that most of the rest of the listed ingredients were 'natural' in that I recognized the names. However, I'd hardly call this a 'granola' bar, as is listed on the packaging.  The 'granola' element is barely noticeable between the nuts and the peanut butter.<br /><br />I wouldn't plan on one a day to supplement my diet, but as an occasional quick and peanuty treat, it's not bad.<br /><br />My 3 year-old 'picky eater' niece enjoyed it too :)

review/summary: If you are in the mood for peanuts...
review/text: These are perfect for the peanut fan in your life - basically what you have is a ton of peanuts held together by peanut butter.  Now true they threw in a bit of granola and some fake honey like stuff to kick it up a notch - but 95% of what is in this bar is either peanuts or something made from peanuts.  Needless to say that the fat content is pretty high, but you DO get some protein in the mix.<br /><br />I don't know of many people who could eat more then one of these - maybe my youngest - but most people will need a full beverage because much like bar peanuts, these Big Nut bars are salty.  The good news is that they are filling.  So if you are stuck in a long meeting at work and your stomach rumbles while the lunch hour looks to be sneaking farther and farther away - one of these should do the trick.<br /><br />Though they probably won't be a regular buy in our household (I mean, where's the chocolate REALLY?) they are most likely something that we will pick up now and again for road trips or to keep an extra one in the desk drawer at work.<br /><br />***Adding to the review - apparently not ALL of the bars are salty - the first one I ate was.  A few days later on a road trip I had another one and it was far sweeter then the first.  Perhaps the batch my box came from wasn't fully mixed - either way they were good sweet or salty***

review/text: This is a very large, tasty and filling bar.  Normally, when I eat a granola bar, I eat TWO granola bars.  These are so much larger and more filling than normal granola bars that one is a complete snack by itself.  As to taste and texture, they remind me more of Rice Krispy snacks than peanut based snacks - the peanut taste is not overpowering.  They do make you thirsty though, so have something handy to drink.  Overall, a great snack - or even a small, quick meal.

review/summary: Peanutty candy bar disguised as granola?
review/text: Don't get me wrong- I like peanut butter. I like peanuts. I like granola too, but nowadays you have to read the labels to see if what you are getting is really healthy or not.  Many folks think that if the word "granola" is on something, it must be healthy for you.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I compared the nutritional label on these Big Nut Bars, to that on a Reese's Peanut Butter cup:<br /><br />Big Nut Bars:<br /><br />Calories = 220<br />Fat Calories = 110<br />Carbs  = 22g<br />Sugars = 12g<br />Protein = 7g<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cups<br /><br />Calories = 230<br />fat calories = 120<br />Carbs = 23g<br />Sugars = 20g<br />Protein = 4g<br /><br />So you will get more protein from a Big Nut Bar, and there is less sugar in it than a Reese's Peanut Butter cup, but I wouldn't go so far as to say either is healthy!<br /><br />Health issues aside, this bar is a conglomeration of peanut butter, peanuts granola, and what tastes like Rice Crispies. Not sure.<br />It is messy to try and eat (you'll get peanut butter all over your fingers, etc.) but if you like those ingredients, you'll like the taste of this bar.  The picture on the front of the box matches the look of the actual bars really well.<br /><br />Pretty straight forward, but not going to win any health awards.

Anyway, I won't be ordering anymore because of a somewhat uncommon (and thus not specifically warning labeled about) food allergy.<br /><br />I'm extremely allergic to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXO0IU">Canola Oil</a>, also known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7L6C">Rapeseed Oil</a>, which in me produces severe hives and swellings in the throat.  Fortunately, my allergic threshold is relatively high so that small amounts usually produce no reaction.  However, caution induces me to check labels and avoid it whenever I can; labels reading "may contain one or more of the following vegetable oils:" are the bane of my existence, asking me the question, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE">"Do I feel lucky?"</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, near the end of the ingredient list, near the end of the sub-list for granola is my old nemesis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXO0IU">Canola Oil</a>.  Consuming no more than a single bar per day and that not on consecutive days spared me any allergic reaction, but I will take no further chances when I am NOT obliged to write a review.

review/summary: Just "Okay" -- Definitely Big
review/text: These Planters Big Nut Bars are just so-so.  They're not sweet enough to be super-yummy, and not boring enough to be just normal peanuts.  They're right in between.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the sweeter taste of some of the other bars on the market such as the Nature Valley line.<br /><br />The size of these bars is pretty big, though, and certainly bigger than their competitors.  Too big?  I wouldn't say that.<br /><br />Size aside, they could have fit 5 extra bars in the packaging if they just turned them a different direction.  Odd.<br /><br />One complaint: the wrapping around the bars is difficult to open without: 1) tearing it into shreds, and 2) getting peanut butter all over your fingers.  I don't seem to have this problem with other bars of a similar nature.<br /><br />And as other reviewers have noted, these are far from being a "healthy snack"... unless your alternative is a Pop Tart.

review/summary: BIG On Peanuts! BIG On Taste!
review/text: My family & I tried Planters Big Nut Bars for the first time.  My 15 year old daughter absolutely hates any type of granola bar and/or those so-called "health" bars - associating their products to an icky blend of what she'd imagine cat litter blended with sawdust would taste like...so I figured of any of us, she'd be the really picky one to judge Planters Big Nut Bars.  Watching her take the first bite, I literally held my breath, waiting for the inevitable "ewww" to follow.  Guess what?  Not only didn't she say "ewww", she ate a second bar immediately after the first!  She loves Planters Big Nut Bars & because of this, it's now a frequent staple on my weekly grocery list.  Personally, I love the mix of salty & sweet (one of the main reasons I still mix M & M's with popcorn at the movie theatre!).  Easily I could see parents offering this as an alternative to the less healthy candy bar as a treat or an energy boost.<br /><br />:)

review/text: Planter's Big Nut Bars are basically bars of peanuts, sugar, granola, and crispy rice with a layer of peanut butter on the bottom. They're very chewy and pretty good, but I can only handle half a bar at a time.<br /><br />These "healthy" snacks are pretty high in calories, and I sometimes found them to be too sweet. I have a serious sweet tooth, but for some reason I couldn't really take all the sugar in these bars. I don't know if it's because Planters wants me to think that this is a healthy alternative to granola bars, and so my mind was rejecting the sugary sweetness, but I definitely could not finish a full bar in one sitting.<br /><br />I'm kind of impartial to the Big Nut Bars; it's definitely something that I won't go out of my way to get at the grocery store, but if it's on sale I would probably pick up a box.

When I Think "Granola Bar" Which these are falsely labeled as, I think of something that isn't an almost exact equivalent of a 2 pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMG8GU">Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</a>, which nutrition wise, these are, give or take 10 calories.<br /><br />It's pretty much just a bar of peanuts with Corn Syrup and peanut butter. I'd say Stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMFXHU">Planters Original Peanut Bar</a> or Snickers Munch or just plain Peanut Brittle. Those pack more of a great Crunch.<br /><br />Tasty Treat, which is why it gets 3 stars But Labeling it as a Granola bar - False advertising.

review/summary: Great
review/text: This the best of the nut bars I've sampled.<br /><br />I'm a nut guy: make my own peanut butter, eat handfuls as a snack and always order Thai food with peanut sauce. I know nuts! So trust me on this. This one is gooood.<br /><br />While it's not rated as a nutrition bar its contents are as good as some bars that claim the title. There's a healthy dose of protein, the mono fat is higher than the other fats (which is a good thing) and the carbs are fairly high for that workout boost.<br /><br />Good stuff.

review/summary: Tasty, but high in fat and calories
review/text: I really like the taste of these -- but that taste comes at the price of a bar that is very high in fat, sugar, and calories.  Each bar contains 220 calories, 110 of which come from fat, and each one also has 12 grams of sugar, which is very high for a bar this size.<br /><br />Also, when my husband tried these, he wasn't too keen on the taste.  When I asked for his opinion on them, he just said that they were "Meh."<br /><br />Bottom line?  These are tasty, but certainly should be eaten in moderation.  Since I'm a health nut, I won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I like them, and so has anyone I have offered them to.<br /><br />I like planters, they have a good reputation. I also often eanjoy the "Nature Valley" nut bars. The Planter's bars taste very much like them, so I would buy whichever seems to be a better value at the time. I would not consider either to be a `healthy' snack, but somewhat better than most alternatives. I think they would be good to have in vending machines.<br /><br />They are very sweet and nutty. They also somewhat resemble Kashi `go lean' bars (that do have more protein), but somewhat easier on the teeth. But they are still pretty crunchy because of the excellent Planter's nuts. I would place them more in the realm of energy bars than in healthy snacks (i.e. low carb, low fat, organic ingredients etc.) as they do have a bit more salt, so if you are out on the trail but have plenty of water, they might be a good choice. I think they are nothing like a "Payday" bar. They are filling. They have a bit of frosting on the bottom that wa kind of melted, but still good!

review/summary: Very tasty, but not very healthy
review/text: This is one of the better peanut bars I've tried.  The bars are quite large, filled with peanuts, and very tasty.  I tried one soon after getting the box out of the mailbox, and it was gooey since it had sat in the heat for a while.  Gooey from the heat, or eaten after storage at room temperature, they are a great snack.  One of my sons loves them and has since claimed them for himself.  The only drawback is that it's a little high in calories (220 per bar), so it's not for someone who is dieting or looking for a healthy snack.  If you're just looking for taste and love peanuts, this is a great choice.

review/text: I actually prefer the Triple Nut version of this bar better despite the fact that I really like peanuts.  I think it is just a little bit too much like a candy bar for me to actually want to eat it too often and when I had one in my pocket for a few hours it got really messy because the peanut butter melted and got all over the inside of the wrapper and made the bar sticky and not that attractive looking, in fact it was a hot day when these were delivered so they were already pretty messed up before I even got them.  They do taste pretty good, so if you like things sweet, like peanuts and peanut butter and don't mind that they can get kinda messy, you would like this bar.

review/summary: hunger satisfying sweet nut bar with big peanut taste
review/text: Planters Double Peanut Chewy Granola Bar is delicious and filling.  The wrapper states that it is "30% bigger than the leading nut & granola bar" and it contains 7 grams of protein.  It also contains 220 calories, half of which are fat (6 grams), 3 grams of fiber and last, but not least, 12 grams of sugar. It is delicious in the way too sweet candy is delicious.  I eat one of these mid-mornings instead of breakfast and lunch.  It leaves a sweet pleasant aftertaste in my mouth. This is definitely not diet food, but a hunger satisfying nut bar with big peanut taste.  The bar is made in Canada, features Mr. Peanut on the wrapper and is a Kraft Foods Global, Inc.  product.

review/text: These bars are GREAT as a hefty snack. You want something more then a handful of chips, but it's not yet lunch or dinner time...grab a Big Nut Bar! There are TONS of peanuts in each bar, and I thought them to have a perfect amount of salt (some may think them too salty, but I love a lot of salt). I'd definitely recommend these for peanut fans, or people who eat a lot of 'snacks-on-the-go'. Planters certainly didn't skimp on the nuts...very tasty!

review/summary: Nutrition & Ingredient info...Almost as tasty as Snickers!
review/text: Basically a chewy granola bar, but not as sweet.  Lots of peanuts packed in and then a thin layer of peanut butter on the bottom.  Fairly healthy (for a granola bar, which I guess isn't saying that much)  High in fat due to the peanuts, but the fat from peanuts is monounsaturated.  Not a lot of ingredients I don't recognize.  I ding it for using corn syrup and "fractionated palm kernel oil."<br /><br />Very filling due to the peanuts.  Definitely healthier than a Snickers and almost as tasty.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't list nutrition info on their food items so here it is:<br /><br />220 calories each bar, 110 from fat, cholesterol 0, 160 mg sodium<br />Total fat 13g, Sat. 3g, trans. 0, Polyunsat. 3.5, Monounsat. 6g<br />22 g carb, 3 g fiber, 12g sugar, 7g protein<br /><br />100% Vitamin E, 4% iron, 2% calcium, other vitamins 0<br /><br />If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!

review/text: Salty is the only word I can use to describe this bar. My husband found the taste of it to be cloyingly preserved due it tasting nothing like peanuts but for me the saltiness of it alone was enough that I had to drink 3 glasses of water to rid my mouth of a horrible dry feeling. I actually had to drink some water during eating, because I couldn't get the entire bar down.<br /><br />Planters' touts on the package that you're getting 7 grams of protein but the trade off is the high fat content. I wouldn't eat this more than once a week and I wouldn't give this to my kids as a healthy snack. But if they wanted to do a little brick and mortar work these'll do just fine.

review/summary: Tasty but not that healthy
review/text: FLAVOR<br />As everyone else agrees, this is pretty tasty. It is full of delicious nutty flavor. But, it barely has a hint of granola (in my opinion). Also, it is very filling. I only ate half of the first bar I tried because I was full thanks to all the nuts. Nuts, in moderation, are a good source of good fats.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL INFO<br />The bar is indeed big; about 30% bigger than regular granola bars. This 46 gram bar has 220 calories, no trans fats, 3 grams of saturated fats, 160 mg of sodium, 22 g of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, 12 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein, a negligible amounts of calcium and iron, 100% of you Vitamin E daily value and 10% of your daily value of Phosphorous. It has no other vitamins. It also has 3.5 grams of  polyunsaturated fats and 6 grams of monosaturated fats.<br /><br />All these fats are not unhealthy. As I mentioned before, nuts are a good source of healthy fats. But, this bar may just a be too big for a regular snack.<br /><br />COMPARISON WITH A SIMILAR BAR<br />A single Planters bar is 220 calories, almost as much as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RDOC">Clif Bar</a> (240 calories), but not as healthy. Why? The Planters bar has 110 calories from fat which equals to 13 grams of fat, 20% of your daily value. It also has 3 grams of saturated fats, which is not the best heart healthy choice. Whereas a Clif Bar has 7 grams of fat, 11 % of your daily value and 1.5 grams of saturated fats.<br /><br />Also, Clif bars are made with organic ingredients. Two of the first three ingredients of a Planters bar are: sugar and corn syrup. Doctors, nutritionists, exercise and health experts all tell you to avoid or reduce food items that have sugar and corn syrup in the first five listed ingredients.<br /><br />It also has artificial flavors AND more sugar (brown sugar, dextrin, fructose, evaporated cane juice, etc.). Yes, I know that Clif bars have 21 grams of sugar, but at least they are natural and organic based. Moreover, the Clif bar is full of vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Further, the Clif bar is recommended for people doing high intensity sports or requiring sustained energy: hiking, rock climbing, or any other sports.  This Planters bar being advertised as a snack.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />Is such a big bar truly necessary, especially for a snack? This bar makes me think of the McDonald's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVBO">Super Size</a> idea. But, bigger is not necessarily better. A snack should not be so substantial high in calorie and fat content, unless you are about to go on a 8 mile hike or you are replacing an entire meal with this bar. As a snack, it is too much. I do not recommend as a regular snack.<br /><br />Full nutritional info below:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts - 1 bar - 220 calories, 12 grams of fat, 1.5 grams of saturated fat, 0 grams of trans fat, 3.5 grams of polyunsaturated fat, 6 grams of monounsaturated fat, 0 milligrams of cholesterol, 230 milligrams of sodium, 23 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, 13 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein, 2% calcium, 100% vitamin E and 10% phosphorus.)<br /><br />Ingredients: Peanuts, Corn Syrup, Sugar, Peanut Butter (Roasted Ground Peanuts), Crisped Rice (Rice Flour, Sugar, Malt Extract, Salt, Caramel Color, Mixed Tocopherols (to Help Protect Flavor)), Evaporated Cane Juice Invert Syrup, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Fractionated Palm Kernel,  Oil, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Brown Sugar, Whole Grain Rolled Wheat, Coconut, Canola Oil, Wheat Bran), Partially Defatted Peanut Flour, Salt, fructose, Contains less than 1.5% of Sodium Caseinate (From Milk) Soy Lecithin, Resistant Corn Dextrin, Natural Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols (to help protect flavor).

The flavor isn't much different than eating peanuts, but the cost is a lot higher.  There is no sweetness and not much saltiness either.

review/summary: Far too much junk
review/text: The reviewer who said "It is probably a half way decent choice for an snack" is, respectfully, wrong. This stuff is FULL of junk! What's "decent" about it? That it doesn't have rat poison?<br /><br />Too many ingredients to list fully, but a quick review: A ton of corn syrup and other sugars, plus terrible oils. It could be a list of what to avoid from a health conscious book. Want to know what to avoid eating? Look at the ingredients on these things!<br /><br />That being said, if you are not health conscious and don't mind a snack once in a while that is full of unhealthy stuff, it taste pretty good. Although another downside is, like another reviewer said, it is messy. You can't just grab it and eat it on the go - you will need a cloth, if not water, to clean up the mess on your hands!

review/summary: nothing special, you are better off eating an apple
review/text: Planters, the company, behind tin and glass boxes of peanuts, has decided to diversify their portfolio and to begin making snack bars that capitalize on their tasty nuts. Sounds ideal? Hardly.<br /><br />I found the taste of these nut bars awkward and preserved. One feels bloated and full (at 220 calories per bar, it's hardly surprising!) after eating one of these bars but not satisfied. The peanutbutter backing serves the purpose of underlining the flavor, but there is no flavor to speak of, and thus nothing to highlight.<br /><br />Planters, do everyone a favor and stick to producing peanuts. Leave the snack bars to Clif Energy Bars and other companies. And the consumer will be better off getting tastier morsels of nutrition elsewhere.

review/summary: Big Nut Taste from Planters
review/text: Planters Big Double Peanut Nut Bar is a newer granola bar from a company that knows a few things about peanuts. I have been enjoying Planter's peanuts for as long as I can remember and when I heard about these granola bars, I was anxious to give them a try. With Planter's peanuts and granola, it sounded like a winning combination.<br /><br />Planters Big Double Peanut Nut Bar, like the name suggests, contain plenty of peanuts. Looking at these granola bars, one can clearly see the peanuts, along with added oats, brown sugar, and other ingredients. Other granola bars contain peanuts, so this is nothing new. But few come close to matching the amount of peanuts used in Planters Big Double Peanut Nut Bar. The peanut- enhanced flavor will bring joy to the taste buds of peanut lovers everywhere. This, balanced with the great taste of granola and other ingredients, make these nut bars better tasting than most competitors in the granola/breakfast bar market.<br /><br />These granola bars offer a nice balance of flavors. They do tend to make one thirsty, but one surprise is that each individual bar contains only a small amount of sodium. Based on the taste and the tendency to heighten thirst, I would have guessed the sodium content was much higher, but Planter's managed to keep this ingredient under control, and this is certainly good news for the health- conscious. However, some other facts about these granola bars could make them a questionable food option for certain diets and nutritional concerns. First, there are thirteen grams of fat in each bar. If you are the type who usually eats two or more bars at a time, these numbers can add up quickly. Second, there are a few less-than-desirable ingredients. The majority of the ingredients are natural, but there are some that could raise a few eyebrows. Nutritionally, however, these bars are better than most. Each serving provides seven grams of protein and one- hundred percent of your daily allowance for Vitamin E.<br /><br />I enjoy granola bars and I enjoy the taste of peanuts, so Planters Big Double Peanut Nut Bar is a product to which I have taken an instant liking. These bars are a little more costly than some and there are only five bars in a standard box, so they aren't likely to last very long. But they are still a product worth trying. The great taste of peanuts, peanut butter, and granola combine to make a very good- tasting snack for morning, noon, or night.

review/summary: These are very chewy
review/text: Both me and my son liked these bars very much. They have a burst of peanut flavor with every bite, because they are LOADED with peanuts. When I first received them, I thought they would be more like the peanut brittle, but I was pleasantly surprised. Now I do love the peanut brittle as well, but these were REALLY good. The crunch in this bar comes from the peanuts, not a hard candy, which makes it more like a granola bar, only very peanutty.<br /><br />Now I buy all kinds of breakfast and granola bars to keep as a run out the door snack, because my son is 16 yrs. old, and to try to keep him inside the house to sit down and eat something has been a job in itself. Well after he tried these, he didn't hesitate to load up his back pack with them, and run out the door. Not something he normally does with the other bars that I have bought. So now these are on my grocery list next time I go shopping. Thanks PLANTERS!

review/text: When I received my box of PLANTERS DOUBLE PEANUT BIG NUT BARS, I immediately passed them around to my family.  Everyone, including the 4-year-old who can be picky and stubborn when she feels like it, declared these bars "super yummy!"  Made with peanuts, peanut butter, crispy rice, and rolled oats, PLANTERS DOUBLE PEANUT BIG NUT BARS contain 7 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, 100% of your daily allowance if vitamin E, and NO cholesterol or trans fats.<br /><br />PLANTERS DOUBLE PEANUT BIG NUT BARS are very tasty, with a big, slightly sweet peanuty taste.  Peanuts are the number one ingredient listed (good for you, Planters!), and these bars are chock full of peanuts.  The layer of peanut butter on the adds to the peanut punch and helps hold these soft, chewy bars together.<br /><br />At 220 calories per bar and full of protein, PLANTERS DOUBLE PEANUT BIG NUT BARS are a nice snack for my kids after a sporting event or a dance class.  They are individually wrapped, making them easy to throw in a purse or sport bag.  Add a bottle of water or a box of juice, and this snack makes a great energy booster and a satisfying snack after a good workout.<br /><br />The one drawback is that the PLANTERS DOUBLE PEANUT BIG NUT BARS box contains only FIVE bars, instead of the typical SIX found in most snack packs.  That makes the price per bar a bit more expensive than some of the other choices out there.  For that, I am deducting one star.  (Come on, Planters, you can make a six-pack, too.)  But overall, PLANTERS DOUBLE PEANUT BIG NUT BARS are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

review/text: These nutty bars are huge compared to the average granola bar.  They actually taste pretty good too. They are definitely not a healthy type bar, more like a candy alternative.  The thing is covered with a peanut butter like coating on the bottom of the length of the bar which tastes great.  There are only 5 bars in the box, so I guess the large size is supposed to offset that.  I am a little on the fence, as they do taste good, but they aren't something I would normally crave for.  I do think they should be eaten with a drink nearby as they are a little on the dry side.

review/summary: Not as great as they look
review/text: Sure it sounds good and looks yummy on the box, but this is one mess of a "candy" bar. First of all, the peanut butter is all over the bottom (or is it the top?), so it forces you to use the wrapper or else. The flavor is a little more bland than I had expected as well. Overall, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rush out and buy any in the future.

review/summary: Don't Forget to fix the Jug of Water While You Are At It..
review/text: If you choose to have this salty/sugary snack bar, which is basically a candy bar, fix yourself a jug of water, you will need it.  I love Planters peanuts, but I prefer the old fashioned peanut bar, the real old fashioned one.<br /><br />My question is this:  Is it a granola bar, a nut bar, a candy bar, and I'm inclined to believe with the ingredients of 13 gms of fat, which is certainly not as much as some candy bars.  Then, there is a layer of peanut butter spread on the bottom.<br /><br />So, I don't think I would buy these if I had a hankering to fix the sweet tooth.  For the healthy side, no;  it's too sweet, too salty.  ...Rizzo

review/summary: My 88-Year-Old Dad Loves These!
review/text: When the box arrived today I had my dad try them and asked for his opinion. He LOVED them. Said they were crunchy and chewy at the same time which seemed to leave him awestruck. I ate one, too, and really enjoyed it but probably not as much as dear old dad. It was crunchy and chewy and I really loved the lower layer of peanut butter. They weren't too salty and they weren't too sweet. What they were was delicious tasting. I'm not certain how healthy these are, but if they bring such pleasure to an 88-year-old man who really gives a crap?! Maybe they should start giving these as the top BINGO prize at the Whispering Pines Old Folks Home. I highly recommend Planters Big Nut Bars and will purchase these as long as there is someone willing to eat them.

review/text: First up, no this is not a DIET bar and should not be judged as one. It is a great snack, especially if your next meal is going to be late. Everything in the bar is good; Peanuts, peanut butter and granola, a good balance. My one complaint is that it is a little messy & sticky since the peanut butter is on the bottom of the bar. Maybe if it was in the middle.<br /><br />But other than that, if you need a boost between meals (or if you have skipped a meal), this should keep you going till the next one.

review/summary: Peanut fans - this is the one to buy
review/text: If you're a fan of peanut snacks and peanut bars, don't pass up the Planters Big Nut Bars. There are plenty of peanuts and peanut butter to keep you happy. I liked the triple nut variant of the Planters bars (tested in another review) but found the almonds and cashews to be overpowered by peanuts in a good way. These Double Peanut bars just capitalizes on the peanut taste and makes it even better! The bars are very large but they only come in a box of 5. I wish they'd squeeze in maybe 6-8 bars per box.<br /><br />Pros: Nutty taste, large servings<br /><br />Cons: Only 5 per box.

review/summary: Great tasting, but it's more of a meal than a snack...
review/text: I recently got a chance to try the new(ish) Planters Big Nut Bars from Kraft Foods and I have to say that they're pretty darn good.  If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.<br /><br />As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.<br /><br />There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.  At 13g of fat per bar (3g saturated), these really are in the category of meal replacement, and not snacks.  If you're looking for a healthy snack I'd stick with a more basic granola bar.

review/summary: Sweet Peanut-Topia!
review/text: This is one big bar full of soft sweet granola and peanuts on a bed of peanut butter. My kids thought the bars were simply delectable. Not having a big sweet tooth myself, I would have preferred more salty nut and less sweet granola and peanut butter. That said, the bars were fresh tasting and everyone else seemed to think they contained plenty of nut.<br /><br />With 220 calories per bar and 13 grams of fat, this is obviously not a diet food. It is probably a half way decent choice for an snack; after all sometimes a celery stalk really won't do.

review/text: The taste of this product is very good.  It has that peanut buttery taste along with real peanuts for crunch.  The only thing is that it needs a bit more work.  1st of all, 220 calories!!!!  110 from fat!! Yikes.  For all you health nuts, this may not be the product for you.  2nd and most of all, you can't really eat this without getting your hands full of the peanut butter.  The bar is made up of nuts on the top with an underlayment of peanut butter on the bottom.  This means you can't eat the bar without the wrapper otherwise your fingers will melt the peanut butter and get all messy.  It would be better if the bar had the peanut butter "sandwiched" between two layers of peanuts.  Less mess and you won't need the wrapper.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I really wanted to like these nut bars.  My mouth started watering as soon as I ordered them.  Unfortunately, the reality didn't live up to the anticipation.<br /><br />The first thing I wanted to know was the nutrition information, which I was unable to find anywhere online before ordering.  Each bar contains 220 calories, 13 grams of fat, and 3 grams of fiber.  For comparison, that's 5 Weight Watcher's Points(tm), where most granola bars I eat come in at 2 points.  This wasn't far out of line with my expectations, since this bar is primarily made of nuts, and a tasty snack is occasionally worth it, but it does keep it from being an every day snack for me.<br /><br />The taste of the bar was okay, but way too chewy, with a sliver of peanut butter spread across the bottom that adds mess without adding much to the taste.  It was less messy when eaten upside down, but my jaw still hurt by the end from working so hard to chew it.  I was also expecting the bar to be either sweet or roasted salty, but this was neither.  Unless you are a huge fan of practically raw peanuts, give this nut bar a pass.

review/text: For those that have a peanut addiction like I do - toffee covered, plain, cinnamon etc. This is the perfect snack. Twice as much as their ordinary peanut snack bars, they still could use more. The provide the right amount of runch, saltiness, and sweetness, making it one of the best treats around. If you are on a diet though you won't be happy. They simply don't make grade. High in fat and sodium they can easily send a diabetic or high blood pressure candidate over the edge. They pack a wallop though and the boys loved them in their lunch. Planters has done it again.

review/summary: Payday with a little something extra
review/text: This product reminded me of nothing so much as a Payday bar--the candy bar that is essentially skinless peanuts embedded in a caramel core bar. The difference with this bar, and what makes it marginally a snack bar, is the addition of crisped rice to soften and texturize the chew just a bit. I found it to be tasty and satisfying, though the peanuts did not taste quite as fresh as I would have expected from a Planters-branded product. The "Big Nut Bars" name is obviously intended to appeal to young hungry men, and I'm sure it will satisfy.

I love peanuts and anything made from peanuts (peanut butter, YUM!) and these did not disappoint.<br /><br />Some people have commented that they aren't healthy.  Well, they don't purport to be healthy.  Nothing on the box seems to indicate that they want you to believe that.  If you are looking for health, this is not the way to go.  If you are looking for something to snack on then give these a try.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the price is so I can't comment on the value of these bars.  Anything less than $8 a box should make this a good deal.<br /><br />One last note: don't have these shipped to you in the middle of summer if you have an out-door mailbox.  They sat in mine in 110 degree weather for half a day before I got to them and they were quite toasty when I got to them. Either meet the mail carrier at the mail box or pick them up at the store instead.

review/summary: Yes it's messy..but like a good hamburger messy
review/text: I am a nutrition nut and these won't be any different than basically any candy bar out there as far as health. However, for a good snack that needs to quench a sweet binge, these will do nicely albeit with some napkins of course. Yes they are messy and chewy and flimsy but how many times have we caught ourselves with a half melted candy bar as we handle it in disgust only after eating coyly thinking "Hey this wasn't bad at all!". Maybe even we secretly wish candy bars were a little bit more mushy, although we don't like to lick our fingers after eating one.<br /><br />They pack a lot of peanuts and they are filling, so that's a plus side. You don't have to keep eating these to get your sweet urge relinquished. It seems to me they are made simply so that you only have to buy one at a time instead of "2 Snickers and a butterfinger".<br /><br />This candy bar is like eating honey roasted peanuts stitched and held together (well until you get it wrapped up in your fingers) by soft honey. So get a paper towel ...or two and give these bars a try. Your peanut loving self will thank you.

review/summary: Not Bad, But Definitely Not the Best
review/text: Planters, of course, is the granddaddy of all peanut purveyors. They have been around forever and still put out the finest plain peanuts around.  I would have thought that their forays into the niche market of nut bars would be more successful.  Not so.  These Big Nut Bars are tasty, quite good, but honestly cannot compare with such products as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOCDA">Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars, Peanut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>, to name one. As I try to put my finger on the difference, I think it is this--the Planters product is just too big. If you want a lot of peanuts, this is for you. If, however, you want something a little smaller but with a more nuanced taste and palette, go with Nature Valley or one of the other competitors.  Good luck next time, Planters.

The bars are soft and chewy (and if shipped in the summer, maybe a bit melted) and have plenty of peanuts, packed into a fudgy base. While  a bit sweet for my personal tastes, I found that it balances nicely with a cup of coffee for a quick sugar, protein, caffeine fix in the morning. One caveat: the bars are gooey so if you're eating in the car, you may want to have some wet wipes handy to unstick your fingers!

For some reason, I did a comparison of a Planters Nut Bar with a Snickers.  Planters had less calories, way less carbs, and more fiber.  And I'm serious when I refer to it as "candy bar good".  I'm a sucker for nuts and peanut butter anyhow so I gave one of the bars to a friend of mine.  All I told him was that it was a new granola bar I was trying and what did he think.  He loved them also--but almost didn't believe it was intended as anything other than candy.  Will I buy any at the store?  The only reason I wouldn't is because they're addictive.  Yummy!

review/text: I really, really love peanut butter, and could just eat it by the spoonful.  Too many snack bars just mix peanut butter in with other things in order to hold the peanut butter together and keep it from gooping all over your hands.<br /><br />These bars were just what I needed.  Peanut butter on the bottom, with a bar of peanuts on the top.  It ends up tasting just like some extra super chunk peanut butter with the peanuts crunching in your mouth while the oozy goodness of peanut butter clings to your tongue.  I think Planters snuck some other grains and such in there, but you wouldn't know it from the flavor.<br /><br />I haven't checked out the fat content on these bars, and I can only assume they are bad for you, like most delicious things.  They might be a notch up from your average candy bar in terms of health, but I really don't know.  What I do know, is that they are delicious, and if you are a peanut butter fan you will find this a little bar of heaven.

review/text: These things are definitely big, definitely have peanuts and peanut butter, and they're chewy. But they're also rather boring. You REALLY have to like peanuts to be able to work your way through one. It feels like something's missing -- a little sweetness, a little salt -- not sure what it is, but something would help. I asked the techs on my production crew to test a couple. Bear in mind that they'll eat anything from a craft service table, but they also found them lacking in some essential ingredient.<br /><br />The bars also get a bit mushy to the point of being messy when warm.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of peanuts and peanut butter and that's all you want, then these bars are for you. If you need a little variety in your treats, then maybe go for something with a little chocolate or other added flavors.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings, Mr. Peanut.

review/text: These are what we have all come to love about the Planters products.  Fresh peanuts with rich peanutbutter and other grains make this a delightful snack that actually leaves you feeling satisfied.  Each bar is a really good size and sooooooooo tasty.  I just love peanuts!!  We had a family cookout this weekend and I passed them around for each of us to try and the the overall vote was fantastic.  A great product from a great company.  I think the fact that the peanuts weren't ground up to small pieces added to the richess of the product.  The peanut size in the bars was half a peanut and there are loads of them.  Planters didn't use a pea shooter to put the best of their product together.  Some products will stress a certain item only to have very little in there.  Not so here.  This is a must have snack for anyone who loves or likes peanuts in its best forms.  YUMM!

review/text: These Double Peanut flavor of Planters Big Nut Bars make for a soft, chewy, and overall nice treat for any occassion.  A little too salty for my tastes, but overall the Big Nut Bars are a tasty treat that anyone who enjoys peanuts in general will more than likely enjoy regardless.

review/summary: A good combination of size, flavor, and energy
review/text: Planter's "Big" double peanut bars are good.  They provide a great combination of energy (220 calories), protein (lots of peanuts), and flavor.  Each bar has a firm peanut butter-like base and lots of peanuts.<br /><br />The consistency of the bar is a cross between that of a nut-roll and a snicker's bar.  There is some substance there, but it's different than just a bunch of peanuts rolled around a nuget center...there is no nuget center in these bars.  The nuts (and there are plenty of them) are held together by a matrix of material that is tasty but not particularly sticky.<br /><br />This is a good snack to take along while hiking, fishing, etc., when products that contain chocolate would be likely to melt and make a mess.<br /><br />A solid four-star product!

review/summary: Not for diets, good on taste
review/text: After receiving my box of Big Nuts bars from Amazon Vine, I eagerly tore into the box to get my first taste of this treat.  Expecting something more along the lines of a candy bar, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste: peanuty, definitely, with a slight sense of the granola bar that it is meant to imitate. They are not overpoweringly sweet, but the second and third ingredients in the label are sugar and corn syrup. At 220 calories a pop, they could easily be diet killers, including the 22 g of carbs each medium sized bar provides. Would I purchase these in the store? Probably not. Granola bars aren't my favorite thing. It was worth a taste, however.

review/summary: A peanut lovers delight. They won't last long in your home.
review/text: The quick and dirty of Planters Big Nut Double Peanut Bar: It's so good that it won't last long in your home if there is a peanut lover in your home.<br /><br />That's exactly what happened in my home. When I got a box of Planters Big Nut Double Peanut bars home, I took one for myself immediately, because I figured there wouldn't be any left if I waited. Sure enough, hubby polished off the rest of the box before the day was over. He loved them!<br /><br />As for me, the non-peanut lover, found these bars to be tasty and find myself going back for another bite - even though peanuts are not my favorite nuts. The bars are peanut packed sticky bars with the bottom being a thin layer of peanut butter. The bars are a sticky mess to eat because the peanut butter melts too quickly. Keep a napkin on hand if you plan to nibble on the bars for any length of time.<br /><br />Pro: These are not peanut candy bars. These are super peanutty snack bars.<br /><br />On the con side: Planters Double Peanut Big Nut bars are so good, you'll want eat more than you need to.

review/summary: Great savory-sweet treat
review/text: I enjoyed every bite of this tasty peanut bar.  I knew that it had to be good when I ordered it because who better to make a peanut treat than the market leader Planters.  I am a fan of savory-sweet treats and this bar did the trick.  Some of the other bars on the market are just too sweet for my liking.  I also am not a big fan of chocolate in the morning.  This bar has just the right balance of nuts - salt and sweetness brought out from the peanut butter layered bottom.  The peanuts were crunchy and large - they did not fill the bar with broken pieces.<br /><br />My only heads up on this product is the calorie count - 200 per bar.  I try to keep my energy treats around 120 so this was a higher than I would like - I have to make choices in the day to manage this higher level like more celery in the afternoon - it is worth it in the end.  Enjoy!

review/text: Peanut lovers will love this granola snack because the peanut flavor is overwhelming!  The bars are a nice size too.  I assumed that these bars would be fairly small when I ordered but was pleasantly surprised when I saw the pack.<br /><br />Not as crunchy as you might expect with so many peanuts and that may disappoint some.  I looked for a little more crunch based on the picture on the package but the flavor is smooth and strong and is enough to overcome the need for a crunchier snack.  Definitely would use these snacks again.

review/summary: Nice Alternative to Sugary Treats
review/text: Granola bars tend to fall into two categories: dry and tasteless or overly sugary and sickly-sweet.  Luckily, this peanut granola bar doesn't fit into either of those categories.  It's overflowing with peanuts and peanut butter, so it definitely has a strong flavor, but it isn't too sweet.  It was chewy but not dry, and it didn't leave my fingers sticky or oily, like so many snack bars do.  My only complaint was that the crisped rice part of the bar seemed to taste a little funny, but I'm not a big fan of crisped rice at the best of times, so it's probably the normal taste.  With 220 calories, 110 fat calories, 7g of protein, and only 7 g of sugar, it's not a treat that will make you feel guilty or unhealthy for the rest of the day, but you probably wouldn't want to down 4 or 5 of them in one sitting either.

review/summary: Planters BIG  Double Peanut  chewy granola bar
review/text: These Planters Double Peanut Bars are good...at least that's my family's consensus. Although I like them, I think they're a bit high in calories.  Each bar is BIG, 1.62 oz,  filled with peanuts & coated with a bottom layer of peanut butter. (The bottom layer is not pure peanut butter but a peanut butter mixture. The coating isn't sticky like peanut butter & not  overly sweet). The generous size accounts for the 220 total calories in this bar.  One-half of calories in this bar (110 fat calories) are fat calories. The fat calories are high because peanuts are high in fat. As a comparison, an ounce of Planters Redskin Spanish peanuts contains 170 total calories of which 130 are fat calories.<br /><br />This is a fairly healthy snack for the days mealtime is delayed or you could grab one for breakfast when you're running low on time.  Each bar contains the following percentages of your daily requirements: 12%  fiber, 7%  protein, 7% sodium, 4%  iron, 100%  vitamin E, 10% phosphorus, & 2% calcium.  Because it is mostly peanuts, it also contains 20% of you total fat limit for the day (saturated fat 3 gr, trans fat 0gr,  polyunsaturated 3.5 gr, monounsaturated 6 gr). For those of you that count carbs, each bar contains 22 gr of total carbohydrates. The 12 grams of sugar in this bar would equal about 3 teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Peanuts are a rich source of protein &  significant source of resveratrol, a chemical studied for potential anti-aging effects and also associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced cancer risk.<br /><br />Ounce for ounce, peanuts contain almost 30 times as much resveratrol as grapes.<br /><br />Roasted peanuts rival the antioxidant content of blackberries and strawberries and are richer in antioxidants than apples, carrots or beets.

review/summary: What one might expect
review/text: Basing this review on what one might expect when buying a pack of these bars, I can say that they do not disappoint.  I think they even taste better than what I expected thanks to the bottom layer of peanut butter.<br /><br />These bars are essentially a cluster of peanuts bound together with some kind of glaze on top of what seems to be a delicious white "chocolatey" peanut butter substance.  Let's face it.  If you buy a product called "Planters Big Nut Bars", you're expecting something like what I just described.<br /><br />So, when it comes to that, these bars are excellent.  They have an airy crisp to them as if there are puffed balls of rice mixed in with the peanuts to give them a more pleasing texture.<br /><br />As far as nutritional content, they're actually pretty good.  220 calories.  7g protein. 3g fiber, only 12g of sugar, but 13g of fat.  Compare that to a Clif Bar at 240 calories, 10g protein, 5g fiber, 22g sugar and 5g fat, and it's probably a smarter move to go with the Clif Bar.  But the Big Nut bar is no slouch.  It's certainly a viable option when competing with other typical energy bars on the market.<br /><br />So, if you like peanuts, and you want to try a new energy bar, I would definitely recommend giving these a shot.

review/summary: 220 Calories
review/text: I think that 220 calories is a little higher than you really need. The bars have 230 mg of salt, also a little much. The sugar content is 13 grams out of 46 grams, about average for this kind of product, although unfortunately some of the sugar comes in the form of corn syrup.<br /><br />As to taste, you have to like peanuts. The bars taste a lot like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but without the chocolate. The texture is crunchy. The surface is sticky at room temperature, but ok if you keep them in the refrigerator or carry them in your pocket for cold-weather activites like winter hiking or skiing.<br /><br />Altogether, I think that these bars are ok in taste and texture, but high in calories and salt. However, they can be just right in calories if that is what you need at the moment for a strenuous activity.

review/summary: Good new nut bar in the Planters Bug Nut Bar Series
review/text: Planters certainly wasn't lying when they have the word "chewy" on the label.  These are very chewy, which I prefer but others may not.  While these bars have been criticized for their high calories, they are bigger than other "granola" bars and can be a meal or snack and leave you feeling fairly filled.  You may save calories since one of these will do it while you may end up eating two normal granola bars.<br /><br />They have a good peanut taste combined with a nice chewy peanut butter layer on the bottom.  Pretty good combination, kind of like a peanut butter sandwich with a layer of whole peanuts on it.  Obviously salty but that's to be expected.<br /><br />These have been criticized for not being healthy for you, and they probably aren't, but again their fat content, salt, etc. is comparable to other bars that advertise themselves as healthy, organic, etc. and don't have any trans-fats.  So if you like them eat them, life is short, treat yourself.<br /><br />The Planters Triple nut bar has a more distinctive flavor which I prefer so you may want to try it.

review/summary: Tasty but I liked the Triple Nut bar better
review/text: If you like peanuts, you'll love this bar as it's basically all peanuts (peanuts with a little granola in the bar, along with peanut butter on the bottom of the bar). I'm not sure why they call this a granola bar - it does contain granola but the peanuts hide any taste (or texture) of the granola. Taste-wise, it is good although if you're not use to sweets, this bar would probably seem too sweet to you. I wouldn't recommend keeping one of these anywhere where it could get hot and melt - I would think that the peanut butter bottom could cause a mess on a hot day.<br /><br />I also tasted the Triple Nut bar by Planters and of the 2 bars, I like the Triple Nut bar better - while I do like peanuts, I liked the addition of almonds and cashews better than this bar.<br /><br />All that's missing is a chocolate coating and this could be called a candy bar. Considering the nutritional value of these bars, eat one as often as you would a candy bar. This is not a healthy treat, but it is tasty.

review/summary: THE PEANUTIEST BEST !
review/text: First off, I absolutely love peanuts and these bars are chock full of them.  Further they taste crunchy and fresh, not at all softened as the nuts in some bars are.  If you like peanuts, this bar's for you!<br /><br />  There are 220 calories in a bar, and I wish there were less.  Nonetheless, they're great for a quick snack when you're on the run or traveling.  One caveat they do soften if exposed to high temperatures.  I carried one in my purse in hot Texas weather and it was a bit sticky to eat (but worth it).<br /><br />  The bars are a good size - 4 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide.  The price is reasonable for a box of five, and I'd recommend them to all who like peanuts.

review/text: This is the first time that I've tried Planters Big Nut Bars but I found that I thought they were pretty good. They have good flavor, I especially like the peanut butter on the bottom of the bar. I also liked how chewy it was. I hate when granola bars, or bars like this one, just crumble when you eat it. One thing though was that I got thirsty after eating it. I owe it maybe to the peanuts and the salt that comes with it. The calories are a bit high at 220 but it's true that any granola bar like this is usually higher in calories.<br /><br />Planters Big Nut Bars are a perfect snack or addition to your lunch.

review/summary: My New Theatre Candy
review/text: Planters Big Nut Bars, Double Peanut, are chewy, crunchy and delightfully delicious with lots and lots of peanuts.  I love to eat them as a snack while watching a movie.  In fact, I love to eat anything with peanut butter while watching a movie.<br /><br />  I grew up on peanut butter.  I spoon it right out of the jar and put it in my mouth.  When there was the recent recall on peanut butter because of salmonella poisoning, I continued to eat it.  "I don't care if I die," I joked to my parents, "at least I'll die happy with the taste of peanut butter on my lips."<br /><br />  Whenever I've gone to the theatre, I've always sneaked in single serving size bags of Planters nuts.  (I don't care if I get caught; it`s not like I stole them.)  Now, I'm going to have to sneak in these delicious Planters Big Nut Bars.  Only problem, you must keep them stored in a cool place because the extra layer of velvety smooth peanut butter will melt onto its wrapper.  These bars are highly addictive and highly recommended for anyone who loves eating peanut butter and isn't counting calories.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Do you Like Peanuts? Then here is a tasty snack
review/text: My fingers stick slightly to the keys as I type this. I made the mistake of taking the Planters big nut bar out of the wrapper. The layer of peanut butter on the bottom makes it messy. That however is what wrappers and wet naps are made for.<br /><br /> Next to me is a full cup of liquid with ice because this is a snack that requires a drink. Coffee tastes wonderful with it by the way. It is peanuts, with more peanuts and then peanut butter. It's no wonder that a drink is needed. So why am I willing to have sticky fingers and a slightly dry cotton mouth (sans drink), because they are sooooo good.  It is a pleasure to chew these tasty treats.  If fact the only think I would like to see is a layer of chocolate on the bottom, personal issue I know but the creamy peanut butter taste reminds me of that not to be named peanut butter cup.<br /><br />  Reading this you might think that all the ingredients are peanuts. That is because it's all you really taste. That and a little salt (tastes may vary). In these gooey bars are crisped rice, whole grain rolled oats and granola. Those ingredients along with a size larger than most snack bars would explain why the planter's nut bar is so filling.<br /><br />But are they healthy? That seems to be the question in some of the reviews.  First I see nothing from planters or amazon at the time of this review saying Healthy, low calorie or diet. That said. Yes these bars have 13g of fat. Most of that is healthy fat, the kind that has been found to reduce heart disease.  There is no Trans fat in these bars. Zero. That is because I have finally found a product that does not have Hydrogenated Oils in it. At the time of this review there is no hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oil.  Yes it has 220 calories but they are filling calories with iron, Vit E, good fats, calcium, fiber, and protein. Sounds good? Now the not so good news, the ingredient also has 6 different kinds of sugars in the bars, a whopping 17g a serving.  40grams it the daily recommended intake.<br /><br />Pros - The chewy peanut butter taste. They are really filling; one is all you need at a sitting. They are not empty calories. No Hydrogenated oils.  Good at work or on the go.<br /><br />Cons- A lot of sugar, Need to have a drink with it, have to keep the wrapper on.<br /><br />In conclusion if you like peanuts, have a drink can don't feel compelled to rip the wrapper all the way off (or have wet wipes) then you should enjoy this tasty treat. While it's healthier than most processed foods, it's not replacement for fruit. It is a sometimes snack.  A delicious one.

review/text: Tasty, and healthier than candy bars, but a health bar it ain't (after peanuts, the next main ingredients are corn syrup and sugar).  The bars are currently a little over 50 cents a piece, which isn't bad for something to quench your hunger, which these little bars aren't too bad at.  That said, this deal is for about 5 lbs of peanut bars.  5 pounds of dry roasted, unsalted peanuts (which would be healthier than these bars) would only be a quarter of the price of these.  Maybe the convenience is worth it to you though.  Be aware that these bars do not do well in warm temperatures: the peanut butter they're smeared with gets melted very quickly.

review/summary: Big peanut taste & calories
review/text: Planters Big Nut Bars, Double Peanut, 8.1-Ounce Boxes:<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the calorie count. 220 is a bit high for a snack/granola bar. At 13G fat, it's no lightweight there either. There's no sat-fat and salt is relatively normal at 160mg. OK, this is not a health bar so it better taste good. It definitely has a big peanut taste. The combination of peanuts and peanut butter layered on the bottom assure a big burst of peanut flavor. You better keep the Mylar wrapper on because it can get messy. The peanut butter on the bottom will stick to your fingers if left unwrapped.<br /><br />The overall taste is pleasant to me, I like it. The size is fairly large too, so you should get any hunger pangs satiated. The chewiness, to me is about right. You feel like you're eating something substantial, which it is. Overall, if you like peanuts, I think you'll be happy. Enjoy.

review/text: These bars have big time peanut flavor.  Incorporated into the mix is peanut butter, crisped rice, sugar and peanuts (plus a box side of other stuff).  By using the peanut butter and crisped rice, Planters has allowed the big taste to remain, while cutting back on the peanuts.  But even so, the total fat count is 13g per with 3g saturated.  Total calorie count is 220.<br /><br />However, I loved these things.  Bravo, Planters.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but I had to subtract 1 star for not being as crispy, crunchy as I thought it should be.

review/text: Don't let words like "chewy granola bar" or "7 grams of protein" fool you into thinking that Planters Big Nut bars are any healthier than a candy bar.<br /><br />Check out the ingredients:<br />(in order)<br />1)peanuts<br />2)corn syrup(a sweetner)<br />3)sugar<br />4)peanut butter(roasted ground peanuts)<br />5)crisped rice(rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, carmel color, mixed tocopherols)<br />6)evaporated cane juice invert syrup(a sweetner)<br />7)whole grain rolled oats<br />8)fractionated palm kernal oil<br />9)granola(whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain rolled wheat,coconut, canolaoil, wheat bran)<br />10)partially defatted peanut flour<br />11)salt<br />12)fructose (a sweetner)<br />13)soy lecithin<br />14)resistant corn dextrin<br />15)natural flavor and mixed tocopherols<br /><br />Thats a lot of sugar when you add it all up with each 46gram bar (which really isn't that big) weighing in with 220 calories, 110 calories from fat, 13grams of fat, 22grams of carbohydrate, 3grams of fiber, 12 grams of sugar and 7 grams of protein.<br /><br />Inspite of all the sugar, I would have given a slightly better rating based on taste alone if I didn't get the impression Planters was trying to promote this product as something "healthy" instead of just another candy bar.  Consumers already have a difficult enough time wading through all the hype when trying to make healthy choices at the supermarket!

review/summary: Baraw Crow Bamas' Review: Planters Big Nut Bars
review/text: Are there healthier choices for a snack bar? Yes. Are there better tasting choices for a snack bar? Yes. Is there a snack bar with more of a peanut taste? Eh, maybe. I wanted to suggest these for when you go hiking. However, with 220 calories, and 110 of those being fat calories, I'm not so sure I would suggest these for hiking. Factor in the 160mg of sodium, it seems counter productive. Health wise, I would suggest countless other bars. Taste wise, I don't see these bars replacing Blueberry Trio Bars in our snack drawer. As for peanuty taste, it's a toss up between these and a Payday bar. I would give the edge to the Planters Big Nut Bars just on the healthier factor.<br /><br />All in all, if you love peanuts, not worried about indulging, and don't mind a heavy feeling snack. Then by all means, this is a good choice for you.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: I'm not sure that these bars are really all that different from a candy bar -- they're pretty sweet and not exactly low-calorie. However, they are quite tasty.

review/summary: crunchy, flavorful and generously sized
review/text: Each bar is 1.62 ounces and absolutely packed with peanuts!  Contains corn syrup, sugar, milk, and soy, but no hydrogenated oils.  Very peanuty tasting and a hit with all ages. 7 grams of protein and 12 of sugar in every bar.

review/summary: Tasty but too high in calories
review/text: To begin, I definitely think that the taste of Planters Big Nut Triple Nut Bars is very good.  I like roasted nuts and these are very nutty.  The dominant taste is that of peanuts, but as we know, Planters is known for their nuts.<br /><br />The label states that these "big bars" are 30% larger and therein lies the problem, from my perspective.  They are also 30% higher in calories.  Also, because of the larger size, there are only 5 bars per box versus the usual 5.<br /><br />I would much prefer that they reduce the size by 30% and give me 6 nut bars per box.  This would cut the caloric content from 220 down to about 150 calories per bar, lessening the guilt factor and giving one an extra bar to enjoy.<br /><br />So the product itself is pretty good, but I think that the portion is too large.

review/summary: If a Payday & a granola bar could have babies....
review/text: These are GOOD!  If you like Payday candy bars and/or peanut butter granola bars, this is the snack for you.  It satisfies salty, sweet, and crunchy snack cravings, and is PACKED with peanuts (#1 ingredient).  With 220 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and 12 grams of sugar, this snack bar eats like a meal.

review/summary: Salty & Sweet
review/text: These are nice large sized peanut nut bars, with an excellent flavor, both sweet and salty, neither overpowering the other. They have a well rounded flavor that is very satisfying. These are an excellent anytime snack bar, but my one complaint is the peanut butter goo on the bottom can be a bit sticky and messy. It tends to stick to the inside of the wrapper and to your fingers more than it does to the Planters Big Nut Bar. Overall an excellent snack, just be sure and have napkins at the ready if you plan to eat them on the go!

review/summary: Excellent Protein Snack
review/text: I liked the Planter's snack bars.  Basically it is a larger and higher calorie version of a regular granola bar with the added joy of having fat planter's peanuts on top.<br /><br />As other have said, it is not a diet bar and is probably a bit messier than your average granola bar which are always nice to have in the car.  However it is tasty and sweet and depending on what you are looking for in a granola bar (did I just type that) this should satisfy both your sweet and salty cravings.

review/summary: Really Good--now if only they had chocolate!
review/text: I have to admit, when I want a snack bar, I usually choose chocolate.  But, I wanted to try these, because I like nuts, too.  These bars were surprisingly good!  And my kids liked them (huge surprise to me!)  They aren't big nut fans in general, but they ate these bars right up.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is pretty good.  They do have corn syrup as the second ingredient, but no high fructose corn syrup which is what I really try to stay away from for my family.<br /><br />The bars are a nut bar with a thin coating of sweet peanut butter on the bottom side.  If you took these to a warm outside event, that coating would definitely be melty and messy, but on a regular day, these would be great bars to take a long for a snack!<br /><br />Now, if they'll only make them with a chocolate coating... =)

review/summary: Sweet and messy
review/text: I was expecting something a bit more on the salty side, but these bars are definitely sweet. The peanut butter layer was on the bottom and after spending the morning in my postlady's truck was very melted and very messy. I would not recommend storing these in a warm place or in a lunchbox unless they were near an ice pack as the melted peanut butter coated the inside of the wrapper and made my fingers very sticky.<br /><br />As a nutritional snack they don't make the cut with 220 calories and 13 grams of fat per bar. They were yummy and filling, but I'd prefer a bit more salt flavor to offset the sweetness. I might pick them up on sale, but I can't see this being added to my pantry as a 'must have' item.

review/summary: Big Peanut Taste
review/text: If I could describe these bars in one word it would be: meaty. Yes, because they're big, thick and filling.  They have really big peanuty taste and the nuts on top are large and plentiful<br /><br />They remind me of another granola bar, the Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut bars. Those too are coated with peanut butter and have big peanuts on top. These bars are very similar to those and to be honest, I really couldn't find a difference between the two. One pro I did find was that the peanut butter coating did not start melting while eating. I did not find myself needing to get a napkin to wipe sticky fingers.<br /><br />While these bars are filling, it's also due to high calories and fat. This would scare someone from eating this as a snack everyday but they are good for a meal replacement if you're busy and can't take a break for lunch. In fact, one bar is much more filling than eating a Slim Fast meal replacement bar.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy these bars. They are tasty, filling and portable to carry around.  If possible share with a friend, for maximum enjoyment.

review/summary: Tasty but only 10 calories less than a Payday candy Bar & will melt in summer heat
review/text: I really enjoyed the taste of these bars but it's probably because I love Payday candy bars.  I compared the caloric intake and was surprised to find that your normal 1.85 ounce Payday bar was only 10 calories more than this product which promotes itself as a "healthy" snack.  I'll grant them this - the Big Nut bar is better for my dental work since it doesn't have the chewy nougat filling that a Payday has but beyond that, there's not much of a nutritional difference.  I found that the Big Nut bar satisfied my need for a snack in the long stretch between lunch and dinner and since it din't make me worry about my bridgework, I'd probably keep some on hand for snacking.  The taste was very similar to a Payday bar and I liked that.  It was a little less salty and slightly less sweet.<br /><br />Here's the downside - like a lot of the tarted-up granola bars of today, The Big Nut Bar has a sweet coating on the bottom of the bar that melts easily.  The day ours were delivered it was only about 85 degrees out and that coating was liquified.  These bars would have to be kept in a cool place to be properly enjoyed because once that bottom layer melts, it's a big ole mess and no fun to eat.  Also, the wrapper was somewhat difficult to open.  I have to use scissors each time.  I didn't mind doing that but I'm a grown-up.  I can't imagine giving this snack to a kid and expecting them to deal with the wrapper without trying to tear it with their teeth!<br /><br />In summary - nice taste, virtually same calories as a Payday bar, melts easily and wrapper is hard to open.  I liked them and would buy them on sale because they taste like a Payday without having the Payday's problem of sticking to your dental work.

review/summary: Payday candybar/granola bar hybrid
review/text: I am a HUGE fan of Payday candybars.  I also love granola bars. The Planters Big Nut chewy granola bar is the perfect combination of two of my favorites.<br /><br />It is the same size as the Payday but with less calories (WOOT!).  It is also more filling than a granola bar. I have to admit, I rarely eat one granola bar so the calories of the Planters bar are pretty close to two granola bars. The bonus is there are no granola crumbs from the Planters.<br />With fiber and protein, this bar will be a new work snack staple for me! LOVE IT!!

review/summary: An OCCASIONAL Treat
review/text: When used as an occasional treat, or as a quick filler when a meal is delayed, I think this bar is a good choice.  It does have some protein, but the high caloric and fat contents mean you should not eat one every day.  The bar is a bit messy since the peanut butter is smeared along the bottom, so I do not think it is a good option to keep in your purse as a "quick-fix".  Living in San Antonio, I can only imagine the horrific goo that would greet me after a day inside my purse in 100+ degree weather!  Though it might make the bar more expensive, it might have been nice to put the peanut butter inside, layered between the peanuts, rather than on the outside to stick to the wrapper and to fingers.
