review/summary: The Absolute Best!!!
review/text: I have searched high and low for the best of hot sauces, and Hunterdon Hills blows all the competition out of the water.  I use it to enhance all my favorite dishes.  It has just the right amount of heat and is full of bold and stimulating flavors.  I highly recommend this product.  I guarantee you will be coming back to buy more.  A+++++++

review/summary: Finest Reusable Bag I've Ever Seen!
review/text: They are just a bit smaller than classic brown paper bags and well stitched for enough strength to carry anything you can fill them with. Inside the top are two small loops to hang the bag open on the checkout filler rack. Unlike so many other reusable bags these are made from canvas rather than a woven plastic. Plastic bags aren't always easy to clean. These bags will survive numerous machine washings. I expect each bag to last longer than several woven plastic bags, making the canvas far more cost effective. I bought the short handle version which is perfect for me. The handles are long enough to easily grip them together when the bags are full and, unlike long handles, don't drag on the ground. Most of us probably don't put much thought into shopping bags, neither did I, but Turtle Creek certainly has with this excellent and superior design. And did you notice? They are individually handmade in America! I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

review/summary: These are what I was looking for
review/text: I had bought some other bags that ended up being shorter than advertized. When I first received these I grabbed one out of the 4 and quickly measured on the outside from the creases: 12 1/16" W x 7" D x 15 5/8" H. Good enough for me. I've only used these once so far but they seem very well made and I like the short handles. While the checker at the store started to fill the second bag she commented, "These bags are wonderful". I wasn't paying that close of attention but I think what she liked was how easily they open up. I'm very happy with these so far and I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Dog/Owner loves them
review/text: My dog has a really sensitive stomach and gets sick off of a lot of treats.  She loves them!  They're small treats.  Perfect for small/medium dogs and/or training puppies.  There are a good bit of treats in each bag and they last a lot longer than the bags purchased in stores.  I saw these being sold locally for $6.50 a bag.  If you look, you can get the bags individually or bulked together.  One way or another they normally have a great price on them on Amazon.  Give them a try.  You won't be disappointed.

Very happy with how these are packaged for freshness too (with resealable top).  I just ordered more since they have a long shelf life & there is an assortment of flavors Fruitables has.  The ones that we ordered and our Schnoodle has already tried are the Pumpkin & Cranberry and the others are Pumpkin & Apple.  I highly recommend this product and am very pleased so far!

review/summary: Good quality for low price
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with this oil. It has a rich flavor. I found the spout to be easy to use; I simply place my finger over the hole and leave a small space for dripping tiny bits of oil onto the food. This oil is for flavor, it is not a cooking oil, so it is sprinkled rather than poured. Because it is the first truffle oil I have tasted, I don't know how it compares to the more expensive products. I like the way it tastes and perhaps if I develop a real snobbery for truffle oil, I will spend more. But for my current status as a newbie to using such oil, this product fits the bill perfectly.

review/summary: In the bread machine
review/text: By using two cups of Jovial flour and one cup of King Arthur Organic, Unbleached Bread flour with my regular bread machine bread recipe, the loaf doesn't stay too low or sink etc.  The bread is easier on the stomach than the bread made with the regular bread flour.  I wasn't able to get a good loaf using 100% Jovial flour though.  It's too expensive but the price may drop if more of it is used by more people.  I may try it for a cobbler and see how it acts.

review/summary: Not super Rosey
review/text: I've always used Rose water in my recipes, but wanted to try something a little more potent.... well, it was a flop.  I love it that Berry farms doesn't use the artificial flavoring and coloring... that is wonderful;  but at the same time, I was expecting something with a little more rose flavor.  It really just tasted like maple syrup with the tiniest hint of rose.  I couldn't really smell the rose either, and I've got a great snout!  Like said before, I've never used a rose syrup, so maybe they're all this faint.  But the product tastes pretty good.  If you're wanting something where the rose is highly detectable, opt for a rose water, or a different syrup.  Thank you Berry Farms for not adding the junk!  I definitely will use this on pancakes and waffles.

review/text: I want to get some rose syrup for Pierre Herme's Ispahan Loaf Cake. Bought this after comparing with many other rose syrup (including Monin recommended by Pierre Herme) and found this is the ONLY one without artificial coloring. The smell of rose in this syrup is great and it tastes wonderful. The baked cake turned out not as "pretty" looking because it lacks the pink color but it taste and smells great! And what's the point of home baking? You want something natural and healthy for your family right?<br />I add this to milk and waffle too and it is amazing.<br />Can't recommend more and I will only buy rose syrup from Barry farm. I love Barry farm and would look into more of their products.

review/summary: Opposites Attract
review/text: If you like dark chocolate combined with the sweet peanut butter taste, you should enjoy these miniatures. To my taste the dark chocolate exterior acts as a foil to the peanut taste inside and accents it better than the milk chocolate. Bought these for the holidays and my sons and friends liked the chocolate also. They disappeared quickly. Dark chocolate is healthier for you than milk chocolate.  It would be helpful to know what percent dark cocoa the coating of these are as nutritionists recommend above 70%.  I didn't see the amount listed on the package.  One of these miniatures is about 45 calories and I was content with one.  It's a great after-dinner or mid-afternoon treat.<br /><br />If you like dark chocolate and you like Reese's peanut butter cups, you should enjoy this tasty combination.

review/summary: Adventurous White Tea Experience
review/text: *****<br /><br />I enjoy Numi's Moonlight Spice Orange Spice White Tea. It has a distinctive orangey taste and a light spicy taste (from the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger), sort of like a light, subtle, orangey chai tea. It is different and unique and all of the flavors are much more subtle than a chai-type tea, quite adventurous. It brews for a lengthier time (7-8 minutes) and is worth the wait.<br /><br />Moonlight Spice is kosher, certified organic and contains amazing ingredients: organic cinnamon, organic orange peel, organic cloves, fair trade certified organic Pai Mu Tan white tea, organic hibiscus, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic schizandra berries, organic lemongrass and dried lime. The schizandra berry is a major tonic herb in Chinese medicine used to assist the body in dealing with stress, to improve memory function, and to assist with many various physical issues.<br /><br />There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many teas; it is also sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi's Orange Spice White Tea is like no other. We use an abundance of all natural, organic ingredients for an authentic cup, without using oils or flavorings. This sublime tea ingeniously blends premium Organic White Pai Mu Tan tea with orange, citrus, and spice. Pai Mu Tan is exclusively the top two leaves and a bud of the tea plant and can only be picked the day before the buds unfurl. White tea is the least oxidized and processed of all teas, making it supremely healthy. Smooth and delicate, Moonlight Spice balances citrus notes of orange, schizandra, Numi's own Dry Desert Lime, and luxurious spice for the most divine experience. Transcend into a peaceful moment through its luminous hue and enchanting fragrance."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but enjoy white tea, this will probably be one of the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

review/text: So i went to Red Lobster and had their Alotta Colada.  Which is basically a double size Pina Colada.  And im soo glad i got this drink.  After that i went sampling other places Pina Coladas and the Red Lobster version is by far the best.  But not wanting to spend way too much money on a Bar tab i went hunting for the ingredients and tried many.  This Ingredient makes it PERFECT !!! Tastes Fantastic.  2 0z Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, 2 oz Pineapple Juice, and 2 oz of this " Cream of Coconut " blended with a cup of ice and you may not stop drinking this  tasty treat. Unfortunately here on amazon the price is kinda steep.  I get mine at BEVMO for significantly less. Sorry seller =(<br /><br />P.S. if you go sampling this at Red Lobster to see if you like it.  make sure they make it with Captain Morgan and you get the extra "Full Shot" of more Captain Morgan.  Cuz Mo Rum is Mo Betta =)

I'm not saying that they didn't say what was in it.  I take responsibility for not paying enough attention.  I guess I got used to buying coconut products that actually WERE pure, without added sugars and preservatives.

review/summary: You may become addicted!!!
review/text: I first received Zatarian's Creole Mustard for my birthday three decades ago from a friend in New Orleans after tasting in earlier in New Orleans and loving it. It is unique, not really having a strong "mustard taste", almost like a horseradish/mustard if you can possibly imagine what that would be like. When their factory was wiped out by hurricane Katrina, they e-mailed customers & employees from a remote location with updates on their facilities & product availability. I ACTUALLY HATE STORE MUSTARD AND NEVER USE IT ON ANYTHING but I LOVE ZATARAIN'S CREOLE MUSTARD unconditionally. It's so unique that there should be another classification for it. Over two decades ago, before it was available through Amazon.com, when I flew to South Carolina, where it is available locally in their various food stores, traveling on business or on a rare vacation with my family, I would very, very carefully packed over a dozen of these bottles in my suitcases. Now I can and do purchase them on line a dozen+ at a time. They have keep PERFECTLY for OVER 1 TO 3 OR MORE YEARS beyond the date on the bottle (when I brought a large stash of them home) if they have not been opened & the vacuum seal is intact. Refrigerate the bottle when it has been opened.<br /><br />Try a bottle if you like horseradish or spicy mustard you will become hopelessly addicted to it as I & many others have...

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I am lucky enough to be able to get to the Lancaster, PA area once or twice a year.  Jake and Amos is one of the brands I always purchase. They have so many delicious, jarred items I could write reviews for days!  But this is my favorite, so I thought I would concentrate on this one. They have a sweet and sour flavor that is addicting.  I may have never purchased them had I not received a sample at a farmer's market!  But they taste amazing, and even the sprout haters in my family like these. They have no fat or cholesterol, either.  And there is no preparation, when you want to serve them, just open the jar and put them out!  I like to serve them as a side dish with pork or as an alternative to cole slaw.

review/text: My cock-a-poo Otis who has a sensitivity to many food items thinks Bone A Mints are the Bomb. He used to eat Greenies and still enjoys the ocassional Greenie treat but they don't sit well on his tummy. He and his sister Bessie Mae Mucho have been Bone A Mint consumers for the past year. They are softer than greenies and not quite as expensive.

review/text: I first bought the white dental N Bone for my shiba inu puppy; however, he wasn't greatly interested in it and it took a while before he would chew on it.  So when I found the Bone A Mints at the pet shop, I decided to give these a try.  From the moment I opened the package and my puppy smelled them, his eyes lit up and you can tell he's in heaven from the way he eats these!  However, I make my puppy eat the Bone A Mint while I am holding it as when I allowed him to eat it on his own, he was probably trying to get it down too fast and vomitted everything up a little while later!  These are pretty expensive though so finding them on-line helped a lot.

review/summary: Wonderful treat for my pekingese
review/text: My Pekingese is remarkably picky about what she eats. If it's not up to her tastes, she'll just spit the food back out and walk away. My first week after adopting her was going back and forth between the pet stores trying to find the right food. Even harder, was finding the right treats for her. I wanted to stray away from the popular branded stuff that had "by-product" in the ingredient list, but she also doesn't have a strong bite so I could get the Greenies brand.<br /><br />This is the perfect breath freshener treat that my little dog can actually chew through. She's only 14 pounds, so I break each bone in half, which helps make the bag last alot longer. All in all, a great treat that picky dogs will love and tiny dogs can bite into (if you're dog can bite a carrot, they'll be fine with this.)

review/summary: Surpringly Sumptuous!
review/text: Having bought this product, on a whim, from an eclectic assortment of goods in a "marked down" cart at my local Kroger, I wasn't expecting much. The fact that it's imported from Italy helped to influence my purchasing it; the price did as well.  The cake sat around for about two weeks until last week when I had nothing for dessert.  It looked lovely, but definitely a sponge cake, which I usually don't covet.  No matter--that little cake turned out to be DELISH!  The ganache-like icing is rich and bittersweet, the filling light, creamy and hints a liqueur. It is most certainly worth the full price (I won't even tell you what I paid for it; you'd hate me).  I would give it 5 stars, except that I would NOT allow for any wording implying "low-fat"!  Per 83g serving there are 18g total fat--of the 350 calories, half of them go to fat (28% of your daily value)! 30mg cholesterol lurk there which is BAD for me (and most others) so I won't seek it out for another year or so. However, my husband eats enough for both of us, so a teeny piece was enough for me. It was devoured in two days. Since this is NOT a "health" item, I MUST highly recommend this Balconi Choco Dessert as just that: a fabulous dessert!!!

review/text: NO MSG. NO SALT. Only REAL spice ingredients. But... and here's the amazing thing... it tastes great! We use so much of the various mixed blend Spice Hunter seasonings that we buy this stuff by the box at The Spice Hunter online. As someone who is allergic to MSG and sensitive to too much salt, this seasoning is perfect.<br /><br />I also recommend: the Fajita seasoning (we use the Mexican seasoning and the Fajita seasoning together in fajitas and tacos), the Steak Grill & Broil Seasoning Blend, the Seafood Grill and Broil Seasoning Blend and the Chicken Grill and Broil Seasoning Blend.  We also enjoy the Spice Hunter "Cowboy BBQ" blend, Hickory blend and Mesquite seasoning. These blends are excellent and will save you time when cooking. [FYI: I only recommend Spice Hunter BLENDS, not their single spices (e.g., garlic powder) because the single spices are too expensive to justify the cost in my opinion.] Recommended.

review/summary: Great coffee but...
review/text: We have been purchasing Tim Horton's coffee for many years now. It is a superior roast. The disappointing part is the size of the can. We started off with 1.2 kg, a few months ago the can was made smaller - we went down to 1.0 kg. A few weeks ago the product was 'out of stock' for a couple of weeks only to return at 930 grams. So in less than a year 270 grams were removed - this is 1/2 lb. I understand that coffee prices are soaring but I really wish Tim Hortons was up front about what is happening - not sneaking in a can that contains less product in order to keep the price the same. I would much rather pay the price for the original can size then getting smaller and smaller product every few months.

review/summary: In-Store is Better than Canned
review/text: I love the single cups of coffee I purchase in Tim Horton's stores, but I was disappointed with the canned coffee. It doesn't taste the same. It must be the difference in water being used. I found their canned coffee to be no better than the Arabica coffee I buy at the store for much less.<br /><br />I'm guessing that Horton uses a water filtration process to keep its in-store cups of coffee consistent from shore to shore. No matter where I travel, Tim Horton's coffee tastes the same. It's a different story with their canned. The quality and taste will be dictated by your own water supply. I can't fault Tim Horton for that, but they could at least warn the consumer before they fork over big bucks for their grind.<br /><br />I even tried my favorite water - Poland Springs - to brew a pot of Horton's coffee at home. It still didn't taste as good as their in-store product.<br /><br />I love the single cups. I don't like the canned.

review/text: Got my first cup at a service plaza while driving my truck along the Ohio turnpike. What a surprise! It was the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Stopped at the next plaza for a refill but they didn't have a Tim Hortons. This coffee isn't available down south so I had a friend living "up north" send me some. Its been great now that I can get it through Amazon and save my friend the hassle of packing it up and sending it to me. Cheaper too since shipping is free. If you like a great tasting coffee and not "truck stop" coffee, or Starbucks, get Tim Hortons. Beats them all, hands down. As a driver, believe me, I've tried them all.

review/summary: Great coffee from Canada!
review/text: My wife and I first discovered Tim Horton's coffee while on a trip to Toronto in 1998. This is the best coffee that I've ever had! The only problem was getting it in my state. I accidentally found out that there were a couple of Tim Horton stores in Connecticut, and that was it. I was finally able to get the coffee that I love in my own state. We would make a monthly trip to the store (about 45 minutes away from home), to have lunch and pickup a couple of large cans. This was great until they closed down all the Tim Hortons stores in CT. I wasn't happy about the closings, and had to find a way to get my coffee. I've been purchasing my coffee online since. Although I miss having the stores in my state, at least I can get my coffee. If you have never had it....try a small bag. Most likely, you will wish that you had purchased the large can. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of the "incredible shrinking can".  It started as a 39 oz can, then down to a 35.3 oz can, and now a 32.8 oz can.  I hope that it doesn't shrink again in the future, but like I said, at least I can get my coffee.

review/text: If you ever visit Canada you cannot miss the Ubiquitous Tim Horton's franchises, it seems as if they are on every corner (and small wonder: everything they sell is excellent, reasonably priced, and served with typical Canadian efficiency and politeness.) The quality of Tim Horton's coffee is pretty remarkable -- it is very, very good -- and the price is not outrageous (I picked up a 39 ounce can in a Canadian Walmart for about $16.50 in American dollars toward the end of november, 2010, which was about the same price they were selling for in the Tim Horton's stores.) Note: Their decaf is every bit as good, but I haven't been able to find it in cans larger than 13 ounces.

review/summary: Some of the other reviews are for a DIFFERENT flavor
review/text: If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack.<br /><br />This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked.<br /><br />We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different.<br /><br />Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet.<br />When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough.<br /><br />Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />------<br />UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time. I am finding I do better with soaked nuts. I also prefer to eat as close to 100% organic as I can.

review/summary: Feel good about eating it!
review/text: Read the ingredients, this is not a HFCS/processed chocolate bar!  However if you like "REAL" food and are looking to have a slightly sweet snack that is completely good for you then this is it!  I gave up sugar a few months ago, and these bars have been wonderful, a way to satisfy my sweet tooth will all natural fruit-sugar sweetness...the main ingredient in ALL of them (Larabar & Jocalat) is dates, this one also has almonds and cocoa powder, do note that just because it has cocoa powder it does not mean it's sweet, this is unsweetened cocoa powder, the sweetness comes from the dates.  It's a snack you can feel good about eating.  Just make sure you are not expecting a sugary chocolate taste, or you will be disappointed! If you want a real, raw, good for your body, mind and soul snack then I highly recommend.  I also love the Apple Pie Larabar!

review/text: If you are a fan of Larabars like I am stick with the fruit bars. They are delicious. I ordered these without trying them and was very disappointed. They are dry and not the least bit sweet.  You do have to realize that you are not eating a candy bar, and that there is only 3-4 ingredients in most Larabars.  This works for the fruit flavors but not for this particular Larabar. I would not order them again.

review/text: I'm addicted to these! They're basically like a raw candy bar. I like them because the ingredients are healthy and they don't contain agave syrup. I used to make something similar, but these are so much easier and convenient to have on hand. I suggest you try the various flavors before buying a whole box on Amazon. I decided to try every flavor and discovered (oddly enough) that I only like the original chocolate. It seemed like most of the other flavors were too dry or something. If you buys these expecting them to taste like a "real" candy bar, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a healthy treat though give them a try.

review/summary: LaraBar Jocalat Chocolate Coffee -- Excellent!
review/text: I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as "food" (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like "dessert".

review/summary: Different (Good!) Chocolate Flavor
review/text: I think that some of the comments that mention that it's not chocolate-y enough or just plain tastes bad might be used to a more milk-chocolate taste rather than a pure chocolate taste. Since, as far as I understand, the only sweetness in this bar comes from the dates, people might be missing the processed sugar and all the other stuff usually mixed in with chocolate.<br />I also thought at first that the bar tasted strange, but I think it was like a city person getting to the countryside and thinking that the fresh air is unbreathable. I was intrigued enough to try a second bar, which I tasted so much better than I remembered. The third was a revelation. Now I crave this flavor all the time, and find that most other chocolate desserts that I used to love taste much too sweet.

review/text: I like these bars but strangely, they don't really taste like chocolate or orange. They have a very strong orange-y smell (like concentrated orange oil, orange extract, or lots of orange zest) and a zest-like flavor but again, not quite orange or chocolate. But I like them. Weird I guess but they're moist and dense and you can't beat the unctuous quality of a snack that feels naughty, fills you up, and yet is healthy and natural and actually good for you. I'm starting to really like Larabars and hope to try more flavors.

review/text: I tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet.  Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not.

review/summary: Satisfy Without Being Overly Sweet
review/text: Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee was the first Larabar that I've ordered. Before the bars arrived at my doorstep, I was expecting a typical fruit-n-nut type of food bar that contains whole pieces of chunky nuts. So I was a little disappointed when I opened one and saw that the nuts were broken into tiny pieces instead. The bar was also shorter than I'd imagined.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the taste didn't disappoint. All the bars were not dry and hard, but instead they were moist and firm even when they were kept in the refrigerator. It would be a different texture if huge chunky nuts are used. Those who found them hard and dry probably got bars that were too close to their sell-by date. My bars had a good 10 months to go before expiring.<br /><br />What I like most is the fact that Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee (and later I found out it applies to other flavors of Larabar as well) these bars were not sickening sweet like other energy bars I've tasted. It's quite sad to taste a food bar prepared with good ingredients being drenched in excessive sweeteners, no matter how healthy the sweetener is touted to be. But this bar did not gross me out like other bars did, and in fact, satisfied my sweet tooth pretty well.<br /><br />Since I am a chocolate lover, especially dark ones, the smell and taste of the cocoa in the bar added to my satisfaction rating. There was also a subtle hint of coffee, but it was almost undetectable if you're not mindful enough.<br /><br />I wish the bars are bigger though. I'm in no way a large man, but I find one bar hardly makes me feel full, though it does stop my hunger pang.<br /><br />After trying this product, I've since moved on to other flavors. I found that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAE">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.8-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> has almost the same taste as this. The coconut shreds in it have no taste but gives a distinctive coconut texture. But since this bar isn't made of organic ingredients, the price is lower than the Jocalat series. If budget is a concern to you, then you may want to consider that bar instead.<br /><br />One tip: As with any food bars, always eat Larabar with a full glass of water. Although not as hard and dry like other bars, it can get a bit dry on the throat when you're near the end.

review/text: I LOVE Larabars.  I am a very healthy eater and I try to limit sugary desserts as much as possible.  With that said, I occasionally get a sweet tooth.  These are a GREAT alternative to a brownie or other dessert when you feel like indulging without the guilt.  All of these bars have very few ingredients and are made of mostly  fruit and nuts. I also find that just 1 bar is satisfying.<br /><br />These are a good pick if you like dark chocolate.  If you are more of a milk chocolate person you will probably still like them, however they are less sweet and creamy than milk chocolate is, more bittersweet.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these you need to.  With around 200 calories per bar or less, these bars are like having a brownie with less than half the calories.

review/summary: I normally Love Larabars but the jocalat was gross.
review/text: I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar. They were dried out and when you tried to take a bit out of the bar it crumbed. The box said they were good until Jan 2012 but they tasted old, dried out, just plan gross. I am not sure if this a bad box or if larabar company needs to redo their bar flavor.Bad product!!!

review/summary: good healthy alternative to "junk" bars
review/text: I love Larabars. These Jocalat are not my personal favorite but they are what you can get at a reasonable price through the subscription option. I just received a box dated November 2011 and checked them out since I had read that others found that batch to be stale. Mine are fine - or I am used to them stale as they taste the same as the last box. they are a bit drier than the regular Larabars.

review/summary: Delicious and very healthy
review/text: These are amazing little bars. Filling, yummy and all natural. The chocolate mint flavor is nice though the mint is a little weak so it doesn't overpower you. The chocolate flavor is lovely too.

review/summary: Love larabar, but this is not one of my favorite flavors.
review/text: I have tried many of the different flavors of larabar and I love most of them.  Jocalat is not one of them.  It's o.k.  but not my taste. :)  I love the peanut butter cookie flavor and cinnamon roll.
