review/summary: SUPERIOR OLIVE OIL FROM SUPEROLIVE
review/text: First, the seller:  SuperOlive.  The way these bottles were padded & packed was amazing.  many times I've received items from other places that were damaged in some way because they just dump the stuff in a box & don't care what happens to it afterwards.  This box, the jaws of life couldn't open it. That's a good thing. I used a scalpel to slice thru.  Also..the shipping was crazy fast.<br /><br />I tried this olive oil in a restaurant not too long ago, & I really loved it!!  Asked the waitress what brand it was & then I went looking for it. Reasonably priced, too.  My other favorite olive oil is Bariani.

review/text: I found this EVOO years ago in a Whole Foods store and have used it ever since.  It's fruity with a peppery aftertaste - just delicious!!!!!!!  Wonderful for dipping or making crostini, bruschetta and pasta dishes too!!  My husband's family is from northern Italy and we all love it.  I'll never use another EVOO unless I cannot find this one anymore.  We don't have a Whole Foods where we live so I have to order it on-line.  I hope I can continue to order it for many years to come because I think it would be hard to find an oil that compares to this one.

review/text: I just opened my last 16.9 oz bottle of FRANTOIA XOO lot # 10145CAMP09/10. The previous bottle of the same lot was, without a doubt, the best tasting of any I have tried. This last bottle will only be used for medicinal purposes; a tbls. each morning before any liquids and one last tbls. before  bed. I believe it to be a powerful antioxidant when the burning sensation slowly comes on as the rich vit. E oil slowly coats the back of my throat. Sore throats are of short duration. I hope when I reorder the next bottle will be as potent and flavorful.  Garlic and Frantoia forever!!!!  Robert Kansas City, MO

review/summary: Best senior food for small dogs
review/text: For several years our small Yorky and Pomeranian suffered from sporadic intestional distress.  On the advice of our veternarian we tried several prescription foods and probiotics.  We also tried numerous brands of senior food.  Small older dogs who have only a few teeth do not like dried dog food so our search was centerd on canned food.  Finally we tried Natural Choice Senior Lamb and Rice, the intestional distress ceased, the appetities improved, and their general appearance and energy level improved.  Our only probalem has been availability.  In the two pet store chains in our area only one carries this product and they are out of stock most of the time.  Will order online in the future. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a dog over five years of age.

It is really nice the candies are mini so I think it looks like more, just add an egg and a stick of butter for an easy treat!

review/summary: Convenient, Healthy, and Tastes Great
review/text: StarKist Tuna Chunk Light Pouch In Water, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short. I recently began using Tuna in the pouch and really like how easy it is compared to canned Tuna which requires a can opener and is full of water. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Tuna can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Tuna pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Tuna in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 80 calories with only 5 calories from fat. Each serving contains 18 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product may contain bones but I have yet to encounter any bones. This Tuna is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Tuna is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2� years from that date that I purchased the Tuna so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for about a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend the StarKist Tuna Chunk Light Pouch to others.

review/text: I bought this seasoning because I saw that it had nothing but five star ratings on here. I have made two batches so far, and it has definitely not lived up to the hype. I prepped the meat for 24 hours as instructed, then I dehydrated it for 4 hours like I usually do for jerky. The taste is OK, but it really has a meat flavor first, with a jerky aftertaste. If this is the only jerky seasoning I have ever tasted, I might like it better, but I know there's much better out there. If you want the opinion of someone who makes several pounds of jerky a week I'd suggest going with the Nesco brand of seasoning. They're messier because you have to make a marinade with them, but the flavor is fantastic, and in my opinion, unbeatable.

review/summary: By far the Best!
review/text: I have been making beef jerky for 20 years, and in that time I have tried every brand of jerky cure, and this is by far the best. This is better than the other brands, and is better than the other Hi Mountain flavors. You will get perfect jerky every time with this cure. It has the traditional salty, peppery flavor, without a lot of extra (in my mind unwanted) flavors.<br /><br />There are some secrets to getting perfect beef jerky with this seasoning.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />1) Use lean meat. Fat does not cure, and if you have fat in our jerky, the jerky goes rancid pretty quickly. I have found a London Broil is the best cut to start with. Trim the fat off the outside.<br /><br />2) The meat needs to be cut into uniform slices. Go ahead, bite the bullet, and buy a nice meat slicer. You will be glad you did. By having each slice the same thickness, they will dry uniformly, and be ready at about the same time. You will have to experiment a little to get the perfect thickness, but with a meat slicer, they will all be uniform.<br /><br />3) Almost freeze the meat before slicing. If the meet is almost frozen, it slices precisely, and does not tear.<br /><br />4) The biggest mistake I see beginners make is to over-dry the jerky. It should not be shoe leather. If you bend a piece in half it should not break. At the same time, there should not be even a hint of moisture on the finished product. Know that a batch of jerky can go from under-dry to over-dry very quickly, so watch your batch pretty closely. Also know you must go by look and feel, not time. Some days it takes longer some days shorter. You are looking for that dry to the touch but not dried out point of jerky perfection.<br /><br />5) The key element to good jerky is smoke. If you use a smoker, make sure you keep the temperature cool. You are trying to DRY the meat, not COOK the meat. You can give the meat a good smoking in a cold smoker, and then move it to a dehydrator to finish drying. Sometimes my smoker has a tendency to heat up, so I often give the batch 30 minutes in the smoker and then move to the dehydrator. Also, the best wood to make jerky over is hickory, which you can get at walmart.

There are lots of everything, it all tastes fresh (well, as fresh as dehydrated fruit can taste...) and no sodium.  Even the pistachios, which often tend to get a bit soft in mixes like this, are still fairly crunchy.  And, with the subscribe and save, the price is pretty reasonable for this quality mix.  I've had a similar mix from Trader Joe's (that one had chocolate chips as well), and I think this one is superior.

review/text: I love these.  I think it is great that Amazon carries these.  I was buying them at Whole Foods and Shop-Rite but they stopped carrying them.  I eat them on top of my cereal in the morning, and occasionally just as a snack.  They are a healthy addition to my diet.  I have trouble with leg cramps, and so I need to make sure I get enough magnesium.  The almonds in this snack are a help with that.  If I stop eating almonds, then I get the cramps back.  I will take the almonds, for sure.

review/text: I have tried quite a number of the "sugar substitutes" and this is the best! It is made and processed in the most natural way possible, and if you check on most of the other ones, this is not true. You mayeven find a number of the others using GMO crops as well as adding various fillers.  This is the best buy.

review/summary: Cute plants!
review/text: Just picked these up - couldn't resist two sets of little bamboo plants for $10! Some notes:<br /><br />1) "little bamboo plants" are roughly a foot or so outside the vase. Not complaining, and it might say that somewhere, don't remember. Just a heads-up on the exact size.<br /><br />2) I kinda assumed it would come with little decorative stones for around the roots - most other bamboo arrangements do. Not so much apparently. Vase, bamboo, there ya go. Again, totally not a deal-breaker, but I woulda picked some stones up if I'd realized that >.&lt;<br /><br />I take a star off for the lack of stones or anything. Overall though, very nice looking little bamboo plants! =)<br /><br />EDIT: I had taken a SECOND star off for the lack of stones/soil, because the description claimed it had some, and I didn't see it. But I found it. Is some clear crystally stuff wrapped up with the roots. Still would have preferred stones, but they provided what was described so I'll give em their stars back =)<br /><br />PS- Still get rocks or more soil. What they give you isn't enough even to hold the plants upright. Still not taking stars, they're gorgeous little plants, I'm happy. =)

review/summary: good sugar free, caffine free, hot drink
review/text: I wish there was more similar to it. Wasn't the best thing ever tasted and doesn't really taste like vanilla. Has a decent taste. Somehow got moist and then clumped up but still loose enough to obtain a scoop or two. Finished the whole can eventually. Would buy again. Hope to find something better maybe but not bad. Hard to find this kind of product. A product that is sugar free, caffine free, tastes good and something you can drink over and over again and like it every time. Like the sexy graphic on the can too. I think white velvet. Reminds me of some 50's product or something with the can appeal. Two scoops does a mug. Just mix with hot water and good to go. Like hot chocolate but with a different taste. One problem was the can lid if folded when taking it off with too sharp of a crease the lid can crack a little on the side bend. That might have cause the power to lump up. The can is metal but there could be a better lid and a better tasting product if possible. You have to buy it this big too. I never found nothing smaller, like packets or something.

review/summary: Great as a base
review/text: I try to buy this when I can get it for under $3 a jar. Supermarkets usually charge me at least $4.80 or so, so I figure my rating is appropriate just because of the cost savings. This is a great alternative for anyone on a budget.<br /><br />But I also like this because it's a pretty decent base for spaghetti sauce. I don't actually eat this straight. Instead, I mix in various combinations of chopped garlic, canned diced tomatoes, black pitted olives, canned mushrooms, and whatever beef, turkey, chicken, or spam I can find whilst scrounging about. This concoction gets simmered for a while. Aging it a day or two also seems to help the flavors blend together.<br /><br />Things can be chopped up a lot or a little depending on taste. I like chunky tomato sauces. Others may see it differently. Either way, we save with this over buying the "gourmet" sauces. I used to get those, bt with a little effort I can make up something that tastes a lot better to me.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: I'm Usually a Coffee Drinker - Until
review/text: I'm a coffee-a-holic and darned proud of it. However recently I've been in the mood for tea.  Tea and scones to be precise!  i asked my tea drinking friends which would be a nice tea  that would tickle a coffee lovers palate and they told me English Breakfast.  And I agree.<br /><br />So I purchased this tea for my Keurig  and fell in love with this tea.  I'm especially pleased since it is decaf and my heart doctor has me on a limited caffeine diet.<br /><br />This tea is dark, aromatic, not bitter and the fact that the Keurig makes it steep for just the perfect time is a plus.  While I probably will never give up my coffee addiction  for tea, I sure will find a permanent place on my shelves for this product.

review/summary: A welcome addition to my kitchen
review/text: If you watch Emeril Lagasse's Food Channel show, you know that he routinely uses what he calls "Essence."  This is what Emeril, on the bottle, calls "a blend of spices and herbs to complement meat or fowl, fish, veggies and pasta.  I use it on everything but ice cream."<br /><br />The bottle itself does not list all the ingredients.  However, if you check out "Emeril's Delmonico," you get the full recipe.  The nice thing here is that it is very easy to make; most amateur cooks have most or all of the ingredients right at hand (for instance, I do have them all, so I could make my own and save some money over Emeril's bottled version!).<br /><br />When he says "kick it up" or "bam," Essence can help out. The cayenne pepper component will kick things up.  However, the combination of ingredients balance one another nicely, and this ends up being a useful product in the kitchen (at least for me).  I don't overdo amounts, but used moderately, this adds a nice taste to food.<br /><br />Anyhow, this is a nice addition to my kitchen.

review/summary: Creative Seasoning
review/text: Emeril's Original Essence is a combination of salt, paprika, pepper, granulated garlic, spices and onion powder. This mixture is perfect for chicken, fish, meats and even veggies. You can use it to enhance the flavor of anything savory and as Emeril says: "I use it on everything but ice cream."<br /><br />I can truly see why he does because this is especially convenient for anyone who loves using garlic and paprika. It also saves you lots of time not having to reach for the salt and pepper. You can skip lots of steps like crushing garlic cloves, although you may want to add even more garlic flavor with fresh garlic.<br /><br />Lately I've been using this essence along with parsley flakes, basil and a mixture from Dean & Deluca called: Herbes de Provence. I sprinkle this over steaks when I fry them in olive oil and then finish the dish with a tablespoon of butter and a � cup Cabernet Sauvignon to make a delicious sauce. Adding in a little fresh or dried basil is optional, but delicious.<br /><br />Emeril's Original Essence frees up some of your time in the kitchen, which allows for more creativity and uniqueness in your cooking. Sprinkle a little of this essence on all your savory dishes and see what happens. The new depth of flavors will amaze you and tantalize your taste buds!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Very good but no secret weapon
review/text: After having this recommended by a friend of mine who is an excellent cook, I tried it quickly thereafter. She was not wrong, it is a good one shot spice mix to enhance almost any food you care to use it on. What did surprise me it that it really is a bit on the mild side. The first time I used it, I thought I shook out an adequate sprinkling on the food and could hardly taste it in the finished dish.<br /><br />The next time I used it was on chicken as I was about to stir fry it. This time I made sure to pretty well cover the chicken up with it as the wok was starting to heat it. That did the trick. The chicken was still not overly spicy tasting, but the flavor had been pleasantly enhanced. I've never watched Emeril's show, so I guess I had no frame of reference on how much to use. LOL<br /><br />Make sure to check the prices on the web against those in your local market. Often Amazon is less expensive, but not always.

review/text: I was introduced to buckwheat groats while stationed overseas and have learned to love them.  Incredibly healthy.  I personally love to mix the uncooked groats with greek yogurt and let the mixture sit overnight.  The groats absorb the liquid of the yogurt, and become soft and pliable.  Proceed to eat, or mix in a little honey or agave nectar to sweeten it.  A great treat you'll learn to love.

review/summary: Keep it in the freezer, not the 'fridge
review/text: I make bread in the bread machine all the time, and the individual packets are very expensive.  So first I tried buying in big bulk, all in one big packet - Fleishmann's - but found that the yeast didn't last more than a few months, so had to throw most of it out.  So then I tried a compromise, buying these jars. It says either refrigerate or freeze...I thought the 'fridge would be OK, but was very disappointed by how short a time the yeast lasted when stored that way - I had to throw out more than half a jar.  I know I'm not giving precise times/dates - sorry, I'll keep a record next time.  But I have found keeping a jar in the freezer, it has been OK down to the last small amount I still have in there...so I'll probably give it a second chance, just make sure to freeze it (in its jar, no need to decant it).

review/summary: Great Expiration Date
review/text: Every bread machine cookbook I have owned has said to use Red Star yeast for superior performance so I started doing it.  The only problem I have had is that the local stores no longer carry it.  When I opened my last jar, I sent for replacements since the jars are glass and I was afraid of dropping it and  having none in the pantry.  The yeast in the jars is good for only 4 months after opening so I take a sharpie and write on the label the date I opened it and the date in 4 months; I throw out any that is left past that date.  I keep the yeast stored in my freezer on the door rack.  It's stays in separate granules and is just as easy to measure as it would be in any other less favorable location.  I was very pleased that the yeast I received has a long expiration date so I can be sure that it will stay fresh long enough that I can use all 3 jars.  The yeast came promptly during a very hot spell and the jars were toasty warm, but I'm sure the yeast is just fine.  However, next time I will try to order during cooler weather, just for my peace of mind.

review/summary: Madagascar Vanilla and Lime in Ginger Ale?
review/text: Love this stuff.  As a kid the only soda I drank was ginger ale ... back when it had real sugar and ginger in it.  That was a long time ago and I had stopped drinking the more commercial brands when they changed their formula.  Recently I had a taste for a good ginger ale and didn't think I was going to find it - so many of them are over processed, have nothing real in them anymore and are loaded with high fructose corn syrup (and even though there's a nice little advertising campaign out saying that HFCS is processed by your body the same as real sugar, most dieticians and those in healthcare say otherwise... hmmm).<br /><br />Hansen's has real ginger, vanilla and lime in it which produces a really nice and slightly unique taste.  The lime is subtle but the vanilla is more pronounced - it may turn some off depending on what they're used to.  I love it.  It's just different enough and again, real ginger and real sugar - a rarity.

This ginger ale was not quite as sweet, and although it DOES taste a bit different than my old favorite Canada Dry I found the taste refreshing.  I will be trying other flavors, especially Hansen's Cola since one reviewers likened it to a cross between cola and cream soda--YUM!<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!

Blue sky organic is better than this ginger ale at this point unless Hansens listens and changes up the recipe. Fever tree ginger ale / ginger beer is the best I have had so far but I cannot afford it plus you get approximately half as many ounces 6.8.

review/summary: Bold Ginger Taste....real sugar
review/text: When you think ginger ale you may think of all those brands that you see on the grocery store shelves or that are normally served by barkeeps in most towns,  once you taste this Ginger Ale you may find the others flat tasting.  This has the real sugar taste and a nice ginger flavor that is more intense that the stuff that comes out of soda fountains and cans for the main line commerical ones with HFC.  The ginger flavor taste is a bump up from the commerical ginger ale and two bumps down from ginger beer.  Personally, the taste of ginger beer is too strong for me.  This ginger ale has clean crisp feeling and does make an excellent mixer when used with rum or whiskey.  I would not recommend this taste for children; it is an adult flavor.

It isn't nearly as good as Seagrams, which begs the point, why doesn't Amazon sell Coke, Seagrams, Pepsi, or other brand-name products on their site or their subscribe and save location? It seems they would make a lot of sales if they would, rather than these off-brand labels. If you read the label for this brand, the amount of carbs in it is ridiculous, but it is from the very high amount of sugar in it. NOTICE: It is VERY SWEET.

review/summary: Brazilian Sea Salt Best I've Found
review/text: India Tree Brazilian Seat Salt is an excellent sea salt, the best I've ever used -- and I've used many. When my local resource for it vanished, I found it on Amazon and ordered these extra large containers. During my search for another source, I continued to try others but they disappointed. I cook with it and I also sprinkle it on salads, scrambled eggs, etc. The flavor is more robust than others and I prefer the larger crystals to fine. Hopefully I'll always be able to purchase this salt from Amazon. Anyone who prefers sea salt to the Morton's style should try this. It wakes up your taste buds and I'm convinced you end up using less salt in your diet, which is a good thing.

review/summary: One of the best brown rice varieties
review/text: I don't like brown rice unless it is fresh and organic; the rice oils in the bran layer go rancid easily, so I generally buy more expensive brands of rice in small bags. This way, the rice will be fresh. Lundberg is a well-known rice grower, and the jasmine rice has that delightful smell when cooking. The texture is chewy, as all brown rice tends to be, but moist. I make mine 2 cups of water to 1 cup dry rice, and I let the rice soak for a half an hour in its cooking water before I cook it in the rice cooker. This hydrates the rice more and I get a better texture for eating plain or with stir fry.<br /><br />This rice is good plain, with a small sprinkling of soy sauce, or as a breakfast cereal with a dash of cinnamon and maple syrup or raw sugar and a dab of organic margarine or butter. It's very nice in pilaf and as stir-fried rice. I keep the opened bag in the freezer, with a clip on the bag, to retard its getting rancid.
