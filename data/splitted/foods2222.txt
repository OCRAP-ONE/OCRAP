review/summary: Still the best beef marinade!
review/text: I was thrilled to find this available since all my local supermarkets stopped carrying it a while ago.  It turns out to cost only $1.52 a pack and the free s/s shipping was quite fast.<br /><br />There is no doubt this is my favorite marinade for beef.  It's not too seasoned as to not allow the beef flavor to come through, it's just subtle, but tasty.  Also I like marinades where you only need to add water, and are fast, and this works in 15 minutes!<br /><br />Recently I mixed it with 1/3 cup dry red wine and 1/3 cup water (it calls for 2/3 cup water) and the results were so good in the test tasting on my family with inexpensive sirloin steak that I offered it to company with filet mignon cooked on the grill.  Our guests declared it was the best filet mignon they've ever had including Ruth's Chris!<br /><br />Try it, I guarantee you will not bother with any other beef marinade sold in stores.

review/summary: Best Marinade on the Market
review/text: Lawry's Beef Marinade is the best, easiest to use beef marinade on the market. It requires only water to be added. The flavor is very enhancing to any cut of beef. While it is not yet available in all areas, it can be ordered from Amazon and delivered anywhere. Thanks to Lawry's Beef Marinade and Amazon.com, I'm cooking the best roast beef on the block.

review/summary: Amazingly Delicious
review/text: I have used this marinade for a few years.  In my area, McCormick is the 'spice of choice' for the grocery stores as it is a local company. For a long time there was one store that kept this stocked.  However, due to the economy, that store has closed and I can't seem to find it stocked in my area.  Amazon.com to the rescue!!  They not only stocked the product I was looking for, but the price was excellent, too.<br />I use this to marinade my pot roast.  I just add a dry onion soup mix packet, a can of mushrooms, a little seasoning salt, and bake.  Give this a try.  The spices are amazing and you won't be disappointed.

review/text: Tried these on doctor and nutritionist recommendation to include more actual whole foods to my diet rather than just popping another supplement or vitamin. These were nice pecan halves that are probably better suited for fancy holiday desserts than my intent and pricier than I prefer. I'm sure the difficulty cracking pecans for nice halves affects the price, but pecan pieces would better serve my purpose and budget.

The other shaker was more of an orange color than red, maybe that was the difference, plus it had a little more flavor.

review/text: I want so badly to make my almond milk, so while I'm still working on my "craft" I buy it in the meantime. My kids love Rice Dream, so I figured it was time to give this a try, too. I've bought other brands of almond in milk in the past and this is the best so far! Pacific tastes like almond-flavored sugar water, Almond Breeze was quite good, but Almond Dream blows them both away! Its very creamy and flavorful, but not too overly sweet. My only disappointment is in the price on Amazon; I buy it at a notoriously expensive health food store for only 2.59/quart.

review/summary: Awful taste
review/text: My fiancee and I have been testing out alternatives to regular milk. I like regular milk, but she does not (though this wasn't the only considered factor). We both enjoy soy milk and Whole Foods 365 almond milk. So we figured we would also like the Dream brand as well since we had a coupon. Regrettably, the Almond Dream milk is the worst milk I have ever tasted. Even regular milk that has gone a little off doesn't bother me, and milk that has certainly gone off still isn't this bad. I'm not a picky milk person. We are pouring the rest of this milk down the drain.<br /><br />I will consider the possibility that the milk we purchased is bad, in which case there is a quality control issue for what is a very expensive product. I'll pass on this brand in the future.

review/summary: It's pretty good
review/text: My 1 and 3 year old like it in their cereal. We're trying to avoid too much dairy because it isn't very good for you. You can look up stuff on "no milk" to find out more. We still have some cheese and stuff but we cut out all cow milk. I decided to find an alternative with some protein and other nutrients to boost my kids cereal in the morning. I have tried it and there is no way I could ever drink it straight but it is fine mixed in other things. I've tried it in oatmeal and liked it.<br /><br />I'm trying to get my 1 year old used to it. He has drank it plain a bit and doesn't love it but will drink a bit of it. He's still transitioning from breastmilk though so it may take a bit. I think he will end up liking it more over time.<br /><br />It's only around $3.75 or so for a half gallon at another place I shop.

review/text: We've been buying this for the past 2 years, after trying other "vegan" mayo's on the market, and I like this one the best by far, especially as they offer the light version, to cut down on the fat and calories.  My son is allergic to eggs, dairy, and nuts, and he loves this stuff.  We've used it to make everything from sandwiches, salad dressings, and fry sauce, or tarter sauce, to chocolate cake that calls for regular mayo.  Anyhow, glad to find something so easy to substitute for regular mayo, that tastes great.  People never have any idea that I've used a vegan mayo, they think it tastes like the regular stuff.

review/text: Spectrum Light Canola Mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute. I bought a jar of this at my local store, as it was on clearance and I'm trying to avoid eating real egg products. It has a very good smell, like real mayonnaise; however, I was put off by its gummy texture. It has a passable flavor-somewhat tangy like the real stuff-but it also tastes very floury. The biggest downside to this mayo is that it leaves a terrible aftertaste for hours. I won't be buying this mayonnaise again.

I drink about 3 to 5 cups of tea each day and was used to domestic, "super market" brands of tea.  I was impressed with Barry's deep rich, almost sweet, flavor and quickly used up the box she bought.

review/summary: A Mixed bag, so to speak
review/text: A longer review than I would usually write for food but since there's 4 different items, I address the set as a whole and each of the different snacks/cookies.<br /><br />Warning for allergy eaters: This is on the back of the box in small print "Contains Milk, Wheat, Soy, processed in a facility that uses eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts".<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to get a variety pack since I had never tried her packaged snacks and small enough that if you don't like them or get allergic to something, you don't have a whole lot to give away and feel you wasted alot of money.<br /><br />*CHEESE STRAWS are the second biggest pro but I would like to buy them on their own in a larger package in the future.<br /><br />* CHEESE STRAWS stay crunchy, taste great, no aftertaste<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Okay, this may seem like a contradiction because I love that I can get a small variety pack in order to try something out - if I got a full box, it would be plenty but once you open the box and then open the little bag stuffed in the bottom, you barely get anything in each package.  No offense but what a waste of a beautiful package/box for less than two servings of a snack.  If you eat a couple here and a couple there (of cheese straws) you could make the package last two days.  If there's two people having two here and two there, and they have complete self control and are very conscious of limiting your portion sizes (people who have the ability to eat 4 potato chips and not go back until tomorrow) I'd give it an hour, or less. For me, the cheese straws lasted an hour - I put them away three times. There's certainly not enough to put in a little nut size bowl and set it out on the coffee table if you are having a couple people over.  This is literally a sample packet put into a box that's made to look like you are getting a full box of treats.<br /><br />One open box is 7" tall and 3 1/2" wide.  Inside the box is a gold bag that is about 5"x4 1/2".  But the contents of the bag is 4 1/2" wide and only 2" tall.  For the cookies, because they are so sweet/strong you can make them last a few days, and they are tiny (size of a quarter for the pineapple cookies), so just a few will do for the chocolate cookies and pineapple cookies. But still, nowhere near putting them in a nut-size small bowl unless you combine them all.<br /><br /> *All snacks except for the cheese straws, change texture in less than 5 minutes of being open.  Immediately transfer to a tightly closed ziploc or tight lidded "tupperware" type container.  They all are crunchy when opened but after a couple of minutes, the pineapple and the shortbread go from firm , crunchy pecan sandies to falling apart crumbly and can't hold the cookie as a solid piece, the Chocolate marsh go from solid crunchy to a stale chewy texture.  The texture changed before I put them away the very first time and each time I only had a couple cookies and decided to put them away but the texture already changed dramatically.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br /><br />CHEESE STRAWS -<br />If you've had Paula Deen's Macaroni and Cheese - which I was able to find online - and you like it, the Cheese Straws taste very much like the Macaroni and Cheese.  It has a strong Cheddar flavor but not quite "Sharp cheddar" or "mild cheddar", more like a medium with a stronger taste than medium.  It also seems like it is a multi cheese, but I don't know what other cheese is in it. I ate them and tossed the box the night I got them.  They look like crinkle fries, fatter than my pinky,crunchy when opened and they stay that way-while I had them out and each time I went back for more,still crunchy and very good.  No funky after taste (like two others).<br /><br />PINEAPPLE DROP COOKIES - Quarter size, very very strong pineapple taste, with a very very sweet powdered sugar on top that tastes like it has pineapple (or something?) flavoring too.  Bitter after taste, way too strong, crunchy in a "pecan sandies" like texture, unless they are out for a couple minutes, then they crumble.  I had two cookies with a few minutes in between because it was so very strong I didn't know if I really wanted another one.  When I reached in the tiny bag for the second cookie, they were already crumbly.  I couldn't have a 3rd and instead gave them away - they were just terrible, although I usually love pineapple, love sandies type cookies, and love powdered sugar.  But there was nothing good about these.<br /><br />COCONUT PECAN BARS - about 2" long rounded top rectangle, they were mostly broken but that was okay.  These too are like a "pecan sandies" texture to start with, good crunch, but does turn soft and crumbly very quickly. The initial flavor is very good, like a powdered sugar covered pecan sandy with a hint of coconut flavor and obvious pieces of coconut once you chew the cookie, and pecan flavor, but very little in the way of tiny pecan pieces.  The main problem is the awful after taste that lasted way too long-not bitter like the pineapple but just as funky. Worse than that is that the after taste isn't recognizable. It isn't coconut, isn't pecan, it's what I usually call "chemically" because it's not a food flavor. Even strong coffee didn't get rid of it. But I did have four of them before tossing the other 6-8 cookies in the trash.  First 2 were the original texture and the last two fell apart in my hand, like a handful of sand with some coconut.  Literally, not 3 minutes after the first two I ate, the last two were like a totally different cookie, could not hold itself together and the sandies crunch was gone replaced by crumbled ingredients that made the shredded coconut much more obvious (not bad if you like coconut, which I do)but no longer a cookie, more a pile of crumbs. But the after taste is a product killer, I just couldn't have any more.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE MARSH MUD COOKIES-  The best sweet in the assortment.  Round quarter size, sweet enough that you only need a few but not so sweet that you don't want more.  Not mild like milk chocolate, more like bitter-sweet chocolate chips type flavor or cocoa powder.  Except for the bizarre texture change, they were good and I ate them all over a few days.  There's not that many, they are small like the pineapple cookies but chocolatey enough that I couldn't just eat the little bag in one or two sittings.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy them quite as much two hours later when I went to have another two cookies because they had a chewy/stale texture-not chewy out of the oven, but chewy/stale/rubbery and even though they were folded over twice with the sides tucked in, clamped closed with a mini binder clip, and back in the closed box, the texture still morphed - that's just weird to me.  Next day out of a ziploc, still chewy but didn't get worse.  They were still an actual cookie and held together to be eaten like a cookie (well, it's bite-size so it's not like you're going to take a bite anyway, it's too small for that but it's not a pile of crumbs like the other two, but if they were a normal size cookie, they could be bitten into without losing the entire cookie.  Anyway, although it was totally weird, like nothing I've ever seen before, this morphing texture thing that is almost immediate, I still ate the rest of the Chocolate Mud Cookies.  But, I wouldn't buy them again.  They weren't good enough to ignore the texture thing and $5 a box for less than a nut bowl's worth of cookies (they are sold here-- 4 boxes, 3 oz each, same as this set for $19current price-$24 regular price)that's just a ridiculous price for the amount of product, especially considering the quality as a whole.  Sorry Paula Deen, the cookies in this set are just not quality products and 3 oz is much less than you could ever think.  Sadly, the one and only decent product that I would buy again from this sample is the Cheese Straws and it is THE ONLY PRODUCT IN THIS SET THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ITS OWN.  That's a shame because I would buy them today.

review/summary: Yummy Coconut Pecan Bars by Paula Deen!
review/text: I think these bars are absolutely delicious. Somebody spoke of an aftertaste, but I don't get why that's a problem when you love the taste and don't want it to leave! To me, it leaved too quickly, and off I am to another one :) Its coconut flavor stays with you for just a little while, and I can't get enough. I like the texture as well, which is crumbly and remind me of some fancy cookies I had in France once. I want more! I bought these for $4.99 and I will be buying more.

review/summary: Not a healthy choice
review/text: Though both my dogs love Purina Beggin' Strips, I am wary about feeding them too many due to the ingredients as well as the calories. There are 30 calories in one Beggin strip. The main ingredients in Beggin Strips  include ground wheat, corn gluten meal, wheat flour, ground yellow corn, sugar, glycerin, soybean meal,salt, and bacon fat preserved with carcinogenic BHA. Lots of corn meal and artificial preservatives sure isn't good nutrition for dogs and too many can lead to obesity and other health problems.

review/summary: Just another ramen noodle soup
review/text: I'd read some reviews of other Mama Brand soups so was expecting something much better than average.  I found these to be little more than the typical ramem noodle soups on grocery store shelves but at a premium price.<br /><br />Inside the package, in addition to the noodles, are 3 packets instead of the usual one.  These consisted of a packet of powder, a packet of a paste, and a packet of sesame seeds.  Instead of preparing the soup in a large pot or bowl, the soup is prepared in your soup bowl.  The directions were not specific about when to add the packets so I put in the noodles, the powdered flavor mix and poured in 1 1/4 cups of boiling water.  The bowl was then covered for about 4 minutes before adding the paste and sesame seeds.  The results were a hot sour ramen soup.<br /><br />While the flavor was not something typically found on a store shelf it was good but not particularly outstanding.  The sesame seeds were a nice touch but I add sesame seeds to almost every ramen soup I make.  The reasons for my 3-star rating are that it did not meet my expectations of being something special, and, for the premium price.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Not at this price point.  If priced closer to the typical ramen soups, yes I would.

review/text: Not even one star! Not fit for human consumption, not like the picture at all...all gravy, not white meat chicken...horrid stuff!<br />I am glad I tried it before I fed my grand niece this.  If you happen to not believe me and purchase it, try it before you try to feed it to your child.  You will not even eat it, unless starving to death.<br />Upon opening, after cooking, it was swimming in a salty RUNNY brown gravy with maybe two pieces of corn, some pasta shells, a few small mushy carrots and a pinkish small meat, maybe 3 tiny pieces that tasted like rough string. It had no flavor except salt.<br />If you do want to try it use a spoon (It is not like the picture; pasta, corn, carrots and white meat chicken, showing no gravy...TOTALLY FALSE ADVERTISING!) and get ready to want to choke the people who saw this as fit for human consumption, much less a small child.<br />This is the worst heat and eat entree I have ever tasted in my entire life.<br />I wish I had my money back or that someone had written a review for me to read (I am the first.) so at least I would have been warned before purchasing, believing the picture and ingredients.<br />*You have been warned.*<br /><br />I WANT THE COMPANY REP TO TASTE THIS MESS AND REFUND MY MONEY TO AMAZON FOR ME.  I bought 2 boxes.

review/summary: Really great! Good value!
review/text: I bought this at a gourmet grocery store for $5 and made it yesterday using light cream cheese. The taste is like a cherry cheesecake dip and the texture is like the flavored cream cheese you put on bagels, topped with an almond/coconut topping. It didn't make a ball very well, but that was probably because I used lighter cheese.<br /><br />We are using it as a dip for pretzels and chips, a spread for bagels, and it would be great on fruit or as a makeshift cream cheese frosting on cookies. We are going to buy this set on amazon because it's a great value and use it for parties as a dip for fruit and pretzels -- it's an unusual item, and the kind of thing that gets gobbled up fast. Looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br /><br />These could also be separated out as small gifts/stocking stuffers.

review/text: It may sound crazy but from time to time I do taste what I feed my dogs especially when they are made with all natural ingredients.(no I don't taste test can food or their normal dry food) You can actually taste the blueberries. I always wonder if a pet product says it tastes like peanut butter or filet mignon, or jerky, does it? etc. I certainly wouldn't want to do more than my taste experiment but I think my dogs are getting what you pay for and they like them(my dogs love everything). Also I feel the price is reasonable and you can split the treats in half which makes the box stretch. I have found that even big dogs don't care about the size of the treat as long as they get one.

review/text: No corn<br />No wheat<br />No artificial colors, flavors, or by-products<br />Made in the USA<br /><br />I've always liked the Zukes offerings and so do my pooches. When I noticed they made a product called turkey 'n taterz, I had to buy it so my girls could try it. Evie the bichon loved them right away and gobbled several of the flat-bottomed, oval treats in short order. Ever the fussy one, Piper the shih tzu had to be cajoled and had to see if Evie liked them. After her first taste, Piper was a convert soon begging for more.<br /><br />The crunchy treats come in a convenient small size, but have an indentation in the middle so that one can more readily break them in two for dainty dogs who like small bites. (Namely Piper the shih tzu)<br /><br />Made with USDA turkey and fresh potatoes, these wholesome treats are bound to get the attention of spudophiles everywhere. Give them as treats or rewards or sprinkle them on the dinner plate for those reluctant fussy eaters. (See Piper above)

If you have a smaller dog, the treats have a mild indentation so they can be split in half.

review/summary: So far.. no good
review/text: **Well, I'm amending my review... in the negative.  10 more dogs found it completely unappetizing.  Some wouldn't even pay attention to me when I held it out.  The few who tried seemed to spit it out in confusion, like, "Why does a cookie taste bad?  I don't understand this."  Have to return.  Wholly disappointing.<br /><br />As a behaviorist at a local shelter, I need lots of different types of treats to keep dogs' attention.  I trust Zuke's to make non-reactive yet enticing doggie snacks and had success with their moist "mini naturals", so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I bought the Blueberry flavor.  So far, 5 dogs have informed me in varying ways that they couldn't give less of a flip that these are edible.  I've had them spat on the ground or flat-out ignored.  I have no idea where Zuke's went so wrong with this treat, but 5 otherwise treat-motivated pups give it two paws down.<br /><br />Risking disgusted stares, I will venture this information; I occasionally taste a crumb of a dog treat.  These were entirely bland and tasteless, and frankly reminded me of the insides of a vitamin pill.  No hint of blueberry or peanut butter... and downright sandy.  They may be starting to sell old stock from the back of the warehouse, as others had good experiences earlier with this treat.  I can't explain this shelter's unanimous population down-vote any other way.

review/text: My puppy really likes these treats and they've been great with training, there are just two things I would mention that I didn't think about before purchasing: 1. These treats are big for a puppy so we cut each one in half 2. Since they are hard, our puppy has to stop our training to eat which can cause him to loose focus. If you're looking for training treats, I'd get a smaller and softer kind, but if your just looking for some yummy treats they seem work well.

review/summary: Great for pockets!
review/text: So many dog treats leave crumby greasy messes in my pocket that is worth celebrating a treat that does not. These treats are also easy to break in half, which makes them a great size for training.  I am usually running around with a pocket full for my dog, and she likes them enough to listen to me.  On a side note, this is the first box of dog treats that my cats have ever tried to break into... they must smell pretty good even to finicky eaters.

review/summary: it will dry out if exposed
review/text: I think the title explains it. We cut it into quarters and use it for rewarding our puppy while we train it. Took us 24 hours to teach a 8 week puppy to use the outdoor for relieving itself. The dog will do anything for a reward.<br />Do be careful in how you store it as it will dry out if exposed to too much air.

review/summary: great treats at a great value!
review/text: healthy treats my puppy loves.  not to big for a puppy, they are about 3/4 of an inch long and 3/8 of an inch wide and are scored down the middle so you can break them in half if you want (makes two pieces about the size of a kibble of food each) and you can easily give a larger dog a few at a time.<br /><br />peanut butter n' blueberryz is the only flavor I have tried so far but my puppy gets excited when she has earned one!<br /><br />great value especially considering the quality ingredients they are made with.<br /><br />I rotate these with Blue Buffalo Health Bars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XGAE">Blue Buffalo Health Bars for Dogs, Apple Yogurt, 16-Ounce Bag</a> several flavors available.

review/summary: Great treat for dogs with sensitive tummies!
review/text: While I wouldn't necessarily suggest these for a dog with food allergies--every case has to weighed carefully--for my German shepherd who seems to have tummy issues with nearly anything, these are a fantastic find.<br /><br />I picked them up on Amazon when I needed to spend a little more to get free shipping. I read the ingredients, didn't see anything that I wouldn't use when I make my own and the price was right (they've since gone up.) While I don't smell the blueberries like others have said they do, I will say it's nice to buy a dog treat that doesn't smell bad.  The scent sort of reminds me of going into the local feed and grain store. Even better, you CAN carry them in a pocket to use as a training treat and your fingers won't stink. (Or your pockets.)<br /><br />Both my GSD's love them, and the one with the sensitive tummy has NO PROBLEM with these at all. I'm also impressed with the quantity-a full pound. The insulated plastic bag in the box is full up. This is pretty unheard of when buying dog treats. I've been using them almost 2 full weeks and the container is barely half empty. This includes taking a small baggie of them to work so I can give treats when I'm in the office too.<br /><br />I've always liked Zuke's products, but because of tummy issues, and budgetary concerns, I typically make my own dog treats.  These are a great alternative when I don't feel like spending a Sunday afternoon making dog cookies I can't eat myself. (Well I could, but they don't really appeal.) Definitely will buy again.

review/summary: My go-to training reward
review/text: These are great treats for dogs prone to allergies and I always have a box or two on hand for my dog.  They are made with good ingredients and haven't caused any allergic reactions.<br /><br />They are small and can be broken in half most of the time without shattering.  Since they aren't enormous, you don't give as many calories to your dog as a training reward or lose too much focus on a treat that takes time to eat (or is so big it needs to be carried to some special super important treat-eating-spot).  I value keeping my dog in shape and not itchy and these treats do the trick.  He sits through nightly ear cleanings without a fuss because he knows he gets one of these per ear.<br /><br />I don't know if they are particularly tasty because my dog eats all of the things- and a friend's dog did reject them when I tried them for him, so if your dog is especially picky, these might not be perfect for you.

review/summary: Pixel says they're pretty good
review/text: The Zuke's Mini Bakes in Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz smell good and my small dog Pixel (a beagle-daschund) enjoys them (though they aren't her favorite treat).<br /><br />I bought these because the ingredients are simple, they're free of wheat and corn, they had no animal products or by-products, and they're made in the USA. One of the nice things about the Mini Bakes is that you can easily break them in half and get two little bites out of one treat.<br /><br />These are crunchy treats, but they're not super hard. They should be fine for smaller dogs, especially if you break them in half.<br /><br />I still think that the best dog treats out there are The Lazy Dog Cookie Co Inc Coconut Carob Chip Pup-squeaks (which are unfortunately out of stock right now on Amazon). But these Mini Bakes are good too.

review/text: I was worried because of some of the reviews, but my puppies(pit terrier-2.5 years & pitboxer-8 months) love these treats. The younger was having a hard time being potty trained among regulating her bathroom schedule, we'd also reward them with these treats after doing they're business outside. Now they run inside and sit by the cupboard where we keep the box. They are kinda difficult to break in half, but other than that they're great.

The downside: giving her as few as three treats causes her to have horrible gas. I stopped giving them to her for a few days and the gas stopped. I'm going to try something different for treats or maybe a different flavor. We have the chicken n' cherries.

I've had no issues with indigestion, gas, or any other stomach problems with Zuke's products and will be ordering them again and again.  They are all natural, which goes a long way for me.  No need to give our dogs chemicals or preservatives.  Give them a try.  You will be pleased as I was.

review/summary: My puppy loves them.
review/text: I like everything about Zuke's treats - the ingredients, no artificial stuff, and they're made in the USA.  They're a good (healthier) alternative to the stuff you can typically find in most retail stores.  They cost more by weight, but they're not really expensive either.  (If you try some and like them, stock up in bulk on Amazon because they're eligible for the free shipping, too!)  And they actually do last a long time - each pound box is a big supply because the treats are small, and my puppy doesn't care that they're small, he just loves eating them.<br /><br />I started using Zuke's Mini Naturals treats when my English Setter puppy was right around 7-8 weeks old when we started training simple obedience, then a few weeks later I ordered the Zuke's Mini Bakes as well.  As far as training goes, I agree with the reviewers who said that it is better to use a small moist treat for early training, as the dog can swallow it quickly and not take extra time to chew it up.  If the puppy is small in size or young, use a moist treat.<br /><br />For a larger puppy that's a little older, these mini bakes work fine for training.  My dog is now 5 months old and ~40 lbs. but he's still a puppy, and he can eat these quickly enough that they are a good training reward.  I still break them in half to make them smaller and make the box last longer.  They're scored across the middle so they break in half pretty easily.<br /><br />We've tried both the Turkey n' Taterz flavor and the Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz flavor.  He loves both.  He was a little hesitant to eat the biscuit the first time I offered it.  He sniffed, dropped it on the floor, and sniffed some more before eating it... after tasting it, he gobbled them readily, and continues to enjoy them.<br /><br />If you're wondering just how big these are... "mini" is correct.  They measure about 2cm long and 1cm wide, or about 7/8ths in. by 7/16ths in.  Small, but effective.  Recommended.

review/summary: Great Treats, Go a Long Way
review/text: Zuke's treats have been pleasing my pups for several years now.  I particularly like these Mini Bakes because they're a small, crunchy treat that can even be broken (easily) in half - - - perfect for training or just because.  So far I've only bought the Turkey n' Taterz flavor in this product, but Gnocchi (3 yr old Chinese Crested Powder Puff) and Peanut (2 1/2 yr old Yorkie/Bichon Frise) LOVE them!  As I mentioned, they can easily be broken in half which I think is good on two counts: 1) It makes them last longer, saving $$ and 2) It enables you to give your dog a tasty little treat while keeping calories in check.  I also like that they use healthier ingredients and are corn & wheat free since one of my boys has sensitivities to those *and* they're made in the USA.  Last, but certainly not least, I like that Zuke's give back, donating portion of annual profits the Dog and Cat Cancer Fund.  No, I do not work for the company!  I just like their products & so do my pets. :-)

review/summary: Perfect for Training
review/text: We have two dogs who both love these. One of the dogs is new to our house, and we've used these to help crate train him (he gets one every time he goes into his crate). They're the perfect size for training, and I love that we're feeding our dogs something we can feel good about. I also love the price! We use jerky treats for potty training, but for everything else these are the best we've found by far.

review/summary: All gone!
review/text: My doggie ate these up! He loved them. I like that they were mini, so I didn't have to worry about breaking them up or my dog getting too many treats when he was going through his training stages. I will be ordering these again in the future for sure!

review/summary: Great treats!
review/text: I was skeptical about the combo of flavors on this one, but my dog loves them and they're a prefect size to break in half and use from training purposes.

review/summary: Dog not impressed
review/text: I wish I could give a better review but our dog does not like the taste of these dry treats.  He pretty much eats anything so it was a surprise to see him pass these treats up

review/summary: Great treat just like all Zuke products
review/text: My dog loves these, will do anything for them. They are a great training treat also and are easy to break in half. I also use the Zuke mini treats which also are awsome treats. I have repurchased these multiple times because they are so awsome. I also love that Zuke's uses quality natual ingredients. Nothing bad to say about these treats.

review/summary: My picky dogs love them
review/text: I have 2 poms one who has a heart condition so we have to watch what we give her.Both of my dogs loved these treats. We have tried a lot of the other treats that Zukes makes and they like all of them.<br />The nice thing about these treats is they are small and you can break them in half very easily if you want them even smaller.<br />If you have dogs that are as picky as mine and you are looking for some healthy treats you cant go wrong with these.

review/summary: dislike at the beggining love them when he actually tasted them
review/text: I got this and i also got the small dog Salmon Zukes, i have a little chihuahua, he immediately loved the salmon ones, but not this, he would put it on his mouth, walk outside the kitchen and drop it on the carpet, so i had them sitting there for about a week, then i thought of smashing one and letting him eat it from my hand, ever since that day he loves them, i guess the softer stuff in the middle is tastier or something,  they are the perfect size for him too.
