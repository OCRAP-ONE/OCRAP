review/summary: Walkers Crisps 6 pack
review/text: I ordered this product on Amazon to get some of the flavors we can't get in the US, namely, bacon, worcestershire, and prawn cocktail.  The photo of the product was so small and the description was so vague that I didn't realize until it came that what I was getting were actually 3 flavors of crisps that I can get down the street from my house:  cheddar cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, and regular flavor.  I was VERY disappointed.  Instead of trying again to order online, I will ask friends in the UK to shop and mail them for me.

review/summary: Excellent Aroma.  A Positive Therapy.
review/text: I don't drink hard booze. I just can't handle it. Wine is about the strongest I can tolerate. However, my wife has used Myers's Rum (Original Dark) for cooking and has had good results with it. Well, this may seem a bit out of place but.... I came up with a lung infection (bad cold) in late June and just haven't been able to shake the aftereffects. My lungs feel somewhat clogged and I run out of energy easily. I was talking to a nurse friend about the problem and he advised to take some brandy in a brandy glass and to very lightly sip and inhale at the same time. The idea was mainly to breathe the fumes in, not to consume the liquor. He said the fumes would relieve the congestion. Okay, it seemed worth a try, but I didn't have any brandy. So I asked if my wife's Myers's Rum might work, being as it was rather strongly aromatic. He said to give it a try. Well, I'm reporting here that it worked marvelously well. The fumes are strong and make my lungs feel refreshed. The next day, I was able to breath better. I've done it several additional times since. So, that's your little helpful hint for the day. Also, enjoy the rum. It certainly smells good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: We've used the meat grinder for a few months now. It is nice to have a machine that works with me instead of against me. I actually look forward to grinding meats instead of dreading it. For its size, it's quick and efficient. Clean up is a breeze. From set up; chopping, grinding, packing and cleaning, it's a total of two hours for a months worth of ready to use meat. Customer service is the best. Support and solution from this company make it all that more enjoyable to use and to own their product.<br />A+++++++ product and A+++++++ customer service.<br />Thank you again,<br /><br />************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Great product.

review/summary: Amazing Wonderful Grinder
review/text: The STX Magnum stainless steel grinder is wonderful.  I purchased it to grind up chicken and vegetables for raw food for my two dogs.  The past 2 grinders that I used were relatively good but I would have to stop and clear jams fairly frequently or at least put it in reverse to clear the jams.  I was very happy that my first batch of over 50 lbs of chicken legs it didn't jam even once and it was so fast.  In addition to all of this the stainless steel body made it extremely easy to clean.  I am very very satisfied with this unit and even more satisfied with the customer service I received when I first received the unit.  Amazing.  Thank you.  Marilyn  Houston, TX

review/summary: GRINDERS DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS ONE!!!
review/text: I purchased this grinder a little over 2 months ago from The Mercantile Station thru Amazon. Since that time have we run over 300 lbs of meat through it as my wife and I do not purchase hamburger from the stores anymore as we like to know what is inside our hamburger mix. We are also grinding up meat into hamburger for our relatives so this grinder is get a lot of good hard use. We had a smaller kitchen grinder for a couple of years before we purchased this one, but it was a much smaller size and it kept bogging down and our meat kept getting caught in the front of the grinder. This is why we decided to purchase a larger grinder with more power. The Magnum 1800W (we found out) is what is considered a size #12 grinder and not a size #5 or #8 like most smaller kitchen grinders and this larger output of meat made our job of grinding much faster. In fact we have been grinding 60 lbs of meat at a time and freezing it into 1 lb. bags. We double grind our meat with the largest grinding plate first and then follow up with the smallest plate for the second grind as this helps us mix the fat a lot easier.<br /><br /> OK - the Pros of the grinder:<br /><br />1) Fast & Powerful HAWG grinder - 60 lbs. of meat (double ground) takes us around 15 to 20 minutes<br />2) The grinder body itself is cast stainless steel easy to clean<br />3) The parts of the grinding head are 100% cast aluminum - also easy to clean (NO dishwashers though)<br />4) 3 stainless steel cutting blades - excellent so we can match them up with the 3 grinding plates<br />5) Very Good instructions which also included tips on grinding meat<br />6) Sausage Stuffing Tubes<br />7) Tomato juicer attachment- nice extra, but we have not tried this one yet.<br /><br /> NOW - the Cons of the grinder<br /><br /> 1) NONE so far!<br /><br />We will be grinding much more meat in the future and if I come up with any extra information on the Pros and Cons of this product, I will add them to this review as time goes on, but for now we could not be happier. I can sincerely tell you if you are looking to purchase a fast and very powerful meat grinder, I would highly suggest that you buy one of these and I do not think you will be disappointed at all!

review/summary: Best grinder I have had bar none!!!!
review/text: This is the 3rd meat grinder I have purchased, and the best by far.  We make our own raw diet for our cats, so a grinder gets<br />a real workout from us.  We grind at least 40# of meat at a time when we use it.  With the other two grinders we had to reverse the grinder several times because meat got hung up.  Also, we would have to let it "cool down".  With this one we have NEVER had to reverse it, and the motor stays cool.  We do shut it down several times so we can crack the chicken leg bones with a mallet (we were told to do that by the manufacturer) and we do a bunch of legs at a time.  I would recommend this grinder to anyone wanting a GOOD grinder that<br />doesn't hang up and have to be reversed or cooled down often.  This grinder is a real worker, and I would compare this with a grinder costing 3-4 times as much money.

review/summary: Did they forget something?
review/text: Before buying this coffee, I read the other reviews, including the reviews on the box of 50.<br />I didn't heed warning to several claims of the coffee being weak - my mistake.<br /><br />After trying more than 24 varieties of K-cup coffee, Green Mountain "Our Blend" is easily the weakest coffee of ANY K-cup I've ever tried. I was disappointed, but if you like extremely mild coffee, then this one may be fine for you.<br /><br />I tried brewing on the smallest Keurig cup size - a half cup of coffee, but this idea didn't work out. I learned to use only a fraction of half & half, otherwise the coffee would be as white as milk.<br /><br />For me, this box of 24 is more like having a box of 12 - because I need 2 k-cups to make a full cup of coffee.<br />With a higher cost of coffee these days, it's important not to waste money. I personally would not recommend "Our Blend".<br /><br />Thanks for listening,<br />Jeff

review/text: I have been an avid Green Mountain Coffee fan for several years. I have been to the factory store in Vermont (all the way from Ohio) a couple of times...the last one after the floods that caused a temporary move of the store.  I felt that this blend is too weak tasting for me.  It is the first Green Mountain product that I have not been completely satified with.  Great for those who don't like the bolder tastes, but not for me.

review/summary: Good coffee, but not great coffee
review/text: My husband and I typically buy our K-Cups from the Keurig website. We drank a few more cups than normal last month, after the birth of our daughter, and ended up running out of cups a few days early, so we bought a small box of these to tide us over until our auto-ship order arrived. I chose this blend because it's a medium roast and something we hadn't tried before.<br /><br />It's a good cup of coffee, and it's of a good quality, as we've come to expect from Green Mountain. It brewed up with a nice, inviting aroma which was quite welcome when the baby woke up at 3am for a few days in a row that week. It's also fair trade certified, which is important to me. There are some endemic issues with the Fair Trade Certification system, but the system as it stands is better than no system, and suffice it to say that I would be happy to pay more for a good cup of coffee with a fair trade certification, and to pay a premium for a truly fairly traded cup.<br /><br />Green Mountain's Our Blend gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the flavor doesn't quite live up to the wonderful aroma. I do not care for dark roasts or "bold" brews, (As far as K-Cups are concerned, "Bold" means there is more coffee in the pod in order to brew a stronger cup.) and Keurig offers several coffees which are medium roasts, and are quite flavorful. This one is quite good, but it's just a little lacking.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a pinch. It won't be my go to blend, but it's inviting and tasty enough that I can recommend it without qualms.

review/summary: The One and Only
review/text: I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online).<br />I love the TASTY HEAT that this product puts into my curry dishes. It is versatile, as I have used it to make beef, chicken, and pork curry (haven't tried to make seafood yet, but soon). This is so much cheaper (per ounce) and tastier than the impotent crap that they put in small fancy glass jars that they overprice and try to pass off as a great product. These companies (can you say Thai Kitchen) that manufacture those imitations probably survive here because most people don't know that they can buy MAE PLOY which is 100 times better. Not only is Mae Ploy tastier, it is also so much cheaper to make sauce with. All you have to do is add coconut milk (less than $1 for 14 a oz can) and/or a little fish sauce(not for me) to match (actually overmatch) the mix that the imitators sell. I also love the fact that I can vary the potency of my sauce because it is not pre-mixed with coconut milk. I once purchased a unauthentic crappy product out of desperation when I first returned to the U.S. in 2007. I used the whole jar (11 1/2 oz) and payed about $5. It was so weak and flavorless. That will never happen again as I keep it well stocked. One jar of this lasts me about 4-5 large curry meals (I always make enough for leftovers as I use two or three cans of coconut cream). So if you make a smaller amount it could last you 8-10 meals. They even make a 35 oz size of Mae Ploy that you can find (google it). Just make sure that you seal up the plastic well before using again (I also refrigerate it after opening).<br />Bottom line though is that this is the BEST and the ONE and ONLY Curry Paste that I will ever use. I never order curry when I eat out because I know it will not be as good as the one that I make at home. Thanks to MAE PLOY RED !! Thanks for reading. Read up on this product and then try it out, you won't be dissapointed.

review/summary: Best brand for Thai red curry
review/text: This is my favorite brand of Thai red curry paste.  We use it to make thai curry at home, because it's soooo simple to make.  Chop 1 onion into chunks, heat up 2 tbsp. of canola oil in a wok or dutch oven, toss in the onions and stir for a minute or so until translucent.  Take 1 tbsp of Mae Ploy red curry paste for a mild curry (use 3 tbsp. if you enjoy spicy foods like jalapenos) and stir into the onions, stir and heat for a minute, then pour in half a can of coconut milk, stir again, and turn heat to medium, toss in 1 lb. of cubed meat (beef or chicken or pork or duck), 2 lime leaves, a few dashes of fish sauce, stir to mix well. Turn heat down to simmer for 15 minutes, add chopped bell pepper strips, bamboo shoots and 2 handfuls of fresh basil, simmer for another 10 minutes. Pour in the remaining half of coconut milk, stir to mix well, then turn off heat immediately. Remove the lime leaves. Serve with steamed rice.<br /><br />The other reason we love Mae Ploy brand so much is because it's the only brand available here locally that has NO MSG, NO PRESERVATIVES. Thank GOD for Mae Ploy !!!

review/summary: Afraid to try it at first but it's THE BEST
review/text: I've only ever used the curry pastes they sell in my local chain supermarket. It comes in a tiny jar, is $7, and has such little flavor I almost need to use an entire jar every time I make curry.<br /><br />After doing some Amazon searches for curry paste this one seemed to have the most, and best, ratings. And it has  A LOT of paste in the container! So I ordered it. I figured if Thai folks use this curry, it must be good.<br /><br />And it is! It's the best, and now my curry rivals that of the local restaurants. We don't go out for curry anymore, since it takes less than 30 minutes to make one that tastes just as good.<br /><br />The container is huge, and it will take months for me to work through it even if I make curry once per week.<br />When I first smelled the curry I was a little afraid to use it. The spices are definitely in there, and I started to sneeze from the chili! But I tried it and all the scariness of the curry went away. It smelled amazing, the amount of kick was perfect, and it was not overwhelming.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and I will definitely stock up. This is cheap, free shipping with Prime, and it's the best curry paste I have ever used.

review/summary: Lazy Cooks Rejoice!!
review/text: Finally, thanks to Mae Ploy and Amazon, even an ordinary, Hamburger Helper stir-in kind of cook like me can make mouth-watering exotic Thai fare.  The best part?  All those expensive, impossible-to-find ingredients are right in the paste!  No more shopping, peeling, pounding, mincing, or guessing about quantities.  An easy master recipe is right on the canister, you just decide what vegetables or meats to use, and I haven't tried any yet that did'nt taste great.  In the time it used to take to make a box of macaroni and cheese, I now have a fresh, healthy, and very economical meal.  Love Mae Ploy!!

review/summary: Thai Red Curry Paste...
review/text: Now, I have made many times; shrimp with *long cellophane thin noodles, in a Thai red curry coconut sauce. It was simple to make, but I am certain I left out some ingredients. I never tried the yellow or green curry paste yet. It tasted good to me the way I was making it, so I make it that way as often as I can, which is a couple times a year or more, for about ten years now.<br />All I did was;<br />In a large bowl of fresh, cold water, I would place the cellophane noodles *(we called them 'corn starch noodles), in until they were soaked for a couple minutes giving them a bath, submerging them and then, whilst they were soaking I put in a large frying pan, or wok, 1 can of each: Coconut Milk & Coconut Cream, stirring in as much Red Curry paste as I would like. I learned not too much, because it gets hotter the more you put in. Stirring until blended well and on a medium heat I then added my noodles and cooked them only a few minutes, until tender. Then, since shrimp only take a couple minutes to really cook, no longer than 5 minutes, I would toss them in at the end and serve. That was all I did. Like I said, I saw recipes after I made this and they always add this and that extra, but the simple way I made it was fine for me. To each their own, but it was good. :o)I didn't even need salt or pepper!

review/summary: Great taste, heat and convenience.
review/text: Since I love Thai food and there are no Thai restaurants in my area - AND I've had to go gluten free, which spurs me to investigate all sorts of new-to-me cuisine - I ordered this paste which incorporates the ingredients that are both hard to find here, and difficult to process. (Just TRY to get some galangal around rural parts of New England!)<br /><br />So then I had to learn how to use it. I think... I got it. To jazz up some already-cooked chicken tenders and millet, I used a teaspoon of this Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste, maybe a quarter cup of coconut milk, fresh minced gingeroot (the kind available in US supermarkets) and a couple of teaspoons of ground cumin. Mixed all those together, added my chicken and millet, bopped it in the microwave, and wow, I thought I was transported to a good Thai restaurant in spite of the non-traditional millet in it. The red curry paste has the elusive ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, shrimp paste with Kaffir lime already mixed together so adding the other parts is simple. Wonderful taste, wonderful heat.<br /><br />BTW I carefully cut off one corner of the heavy plastic packaging so that I can squeeze out what I need easily. And it does say to refrigerate after opening, although I suspect the red chili would preserve most anything, including me.

review/text: My niece turned me onto Mae Ploy red curry paste and I was hooked. One of my signature dishes now is Thia Curry using what ever protein and veggies I have on hand. It is always delicious. I tried using another brand (Thai Kitchen) once my Mae Ploy was gone. It was not the same. Unfortunately I couldn't find Mae Ploy locally so I had to go on line. Ordering it through Amazon I was able to get it reasonably, though it did take a while for delivery. Thanks Amazon!

Mae Ploy is the real deal -- intense flavor, VERY spicy and completely authentic.

I'll never go back to buying it from the supermarket!

I also really like that there are no artificial ingredients.

review/summary: The Good Stuff, Minus the Packaging
review/text: I can confirm that this is the exact curry paste used in many Thai restaurants - I've worked in one where this was the case.<br /><br />I don't particularly enjoy the smell of this product, but the taste is quite good and will produce a nice result. The minor problem is that the actual paste comes packed in a vacuum-sealed bag that itself is stuffed in the tub. This doesn't make much sense to me; why not just seal the tub itself? The paste can be easily popped out of the bag, however.<br /><br />This is a cost-efficient way to produce curry at home. Using three tablespoons of paste for each curry, you'll get about eight uses per 14oz tub. Try it.

review/summary: Best Red Curry Paste
review/text: This paste is infinitely better than the Thai Kitchen brand that you can buy in the stores. Its a LOT less expensive, and a little goes a long way. The other brand is very weak and you need pretty much a whole $5 jar to make a big pot of curry.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this stuff is that in order to get that nice red color and the great flavor of the lemongrass and thai basil, you have to use a bit more of it, and that means your curry will be pretty spicy. But, that being said, I love spicy curry so this stuff is my favorite.

review/text: I make a pretty simple curry: chicken, veggies (red bell pepper and a yellow onion)m coconut milk, red curry paste, curry powder, and fish and soy sauce.<br /><br />When I first started making the curry, I used the Thai Kitchen coconut milk and red curry paste you can pick up at any grocery store. It was always pretty good, and the main thing that prompted me to start looking for other curry paste was the $$ of a jar that lasted only 3 servings.<br />We found an asian market next to a vietnamese place we frequent. I went hunting for red curry paste and came across this. Even cheaper than Amazon at $4 a jar for about 3x as much as the little Thai Kitchen ones!<br /><br />I have to say this paste(plus a higher quality coconut milk) has taken my curry to a new level. Comparing the ingredients to the Thai Kitchen paste, the only difference seems to be the Mae Ploy has shrimp. The flavor is amazing, not to mention it has a spicy kick that the other one lacks. When I first used this after the small jar I almost choked at the spice, mostly because I just wasn't prepared for it! After 5 servings of curry the jar is only half gone.<br /><br />The only recommendation I would make is to look for this at your local asian market - seems to be twice as expensive here on Amazon!

review/text: This product lasts for a long time when it is refrigerated; I find that the 50g or 10 tsp. that this would be, according to the package directions, is extremely hot even when mixed with the coconut milk and water.  I use half coconut milk and half chicken broth for the sauce. If you can put in some wild lime leaves (kaffir lime leaves),cilantro and a dash of fish sauce, the curry will taste like your local Thai restaurant.

I am extremely pleased with this product and so happy that it is available online since I don't think there is really any other way we would have been able to get it; we don't often drive to the city to buy groceries and the small grocery store in town does not carry Thai food.  I would highly recommend it to people who like red curry.

My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.

I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.

review/text: . . .A little fussy about my coffee, and this coffee did not disappoint me.  It has a rich flavor, I can control the strength by adding or substracting the amount of water I use (which you can do wih all coffees, I know).  The flavor - although I cannot pinpoint the difference, is very nice.  I'll definitely be buying more of this brand and I think that's probably the best review I can give it - I want more.

review/text: I made my coffee the usual way but it was not strong enough. I don't like my coffee overly strong, but I do like it to taste like coffee. I made another cup, but used 2 packets, perfect! It tastes exactly like coffee, nothing over the top, just coffee. I gave it 4 stars though because it is organic, and I prefer everything organic!

review/text: I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure.

review/summary: Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe
review/text: While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.

review/summary: A tasty treat
review/text: We saw that some of the coffee reviews said that the coffee was weak when "teabagged."  We put a few pods of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOLXM">Marley Coffee One Love, One Heart</a> into our old-fashioned stovetop percolator and let the steam do its magic.<br /><br />Yum. Great flavor, and strong enough. Even though I prefer my coffee whitened and sweetened, I was surprised that I enjoyed the Marley Coffee black. This coffee was great alone, and would probably do well as a mixer for cooking or alcohol recipes.<br /><br />Next time, we may experimentally open the pods and try the in the Keurig; however, we *were* satisfied with the percolator.

review/text: First of, I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this coffee.  Come to find out the "single serve pods" are flat, round cushions that require a special coffee maker.  I own a Keurig and Eco-Brew refillable cups that I really like, so I decided to open the pod and dump the grounds into the Eco-Brew cup instead.  It worked like a charm, and on the 6cc setting I got to enjoy a very bold brew with no aidic aftertaste.

review/text: One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.

review/text: Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill.

review/summary: This Coffee is Not Bad
review/text: This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of "pods" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.

review/summary: Weak but okay
review/text: Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.

review/summary: Needs more instruction but we figured it out
review/text: Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the "One Love" variety is meant for two cups per "single serve" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to "Stir It Up" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song.)<br /><br />There wasn't instruction on the packaging on how to get the brew right with these large "tea bags" of coffee. The only thing clearly marked was which side of the bag should be faced down in the cup.<br /><br />The coffee has a good taste, but the first bag I tried brewed up so strong it gave me the jitters. Good thing there are 15 individual plastic-sealed bags in the dispenser. My husband fiddled around with them because he likes an occasional cup of joe in the afternoon but doesn't want to brew up a whole pot.<br /><br />I credit him with coming up with the "spoon test" to figure out when the coffee was at the perfect strength. We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill. And it's a really nice way to remember Bob Marley, a man of nature from Jamaica.

The coffee is organic, no artificial ingredients like some of the other ones have (including the ones recommended by Philips!) Size wise, each coffee pod is quite thick, I would equate it to 1.5 times the Senseo ones. Smells and tastes great. I am not the biggest coffee drinker, but the ladies in the house love it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again.

review/summary: Not the best Ethiopian coffee I've had, but pretty darn good for a coffee pod
review/text: Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I've ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.  The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn't pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I've never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It's my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I'm wrong, sorry--I'm not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I've had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn't present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don't recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn't give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, delicious taste
review/text: This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat. The flavor didn't disappoint. Smooth, complex, and rich, with a subtly floral note, this coffee was head and shoulders about my usual Senseo pods, and in my opinion, far superior to the burnt and bitter notes of a certain overpriced but popular coffee chain.<br /><br />A fair trade product that donates funds to a children's soccer charity (rather than turning a blind eye to child labor), Marley Coffee is a morning cup you can enjoy with a clear conscience.<br /><br />Normally, I drink more tea than coffee, so I don't consider myself an expert, but I know what I like, and for me, Marley Coffee was definitely a treat. I received a free sample for review, but I'll definitely be purchasing my next box.

review/text: This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine. Unlike other pod coffees I've tasted, which are weak and watery, this has a good coffee flavor. A nice medium blend, it has a unique flavor, and isn't bitter/acidic. However, those looking for a dark or super strong jolt should try one of the other roasts. Overall, a good, easy to make, cup of coffee.<br /><br />According to the box, the Marley Coffee company's products are organic, USDA certified, Fair Trade, and child labor free. In addition, some percentage of the profits are donated to children's soccer programs.

review/summary: Marley One Love Organic Coffee
review/text: I have not always been a coffee drinker but have recently begun to enjoy a cup or two per day. Since my son is the only other person her that drinks coffee and he usually drinks the entire pot by himself, I tend to use the store brand or Maxwell House single serve coffee that is used in the same manner as a tea bag. I am not certain that is the intended use for the Marley single serve coffee pods. I don't have a single serve coffee machine although at times I vacillate about buying one, so I'm not sure what the pods for the machines that use them look like. The Marley coffee pods may be intended for use in one of these machines; however the package and the item page do not specify how they are to be used other than single serve. I brewed them in the same way I brew my usual coffee by heating the water in an electric kettle and letting it steep in the cup until I think it has brewed long enough. It seemed to work just fine.<br /><br />As far as the taste, I enjoyed my coffee. It had a somewhat bitter smell but I was happy to find that it did not have a bitter taste. In fact it was fairly smooth tasting. My son also tried a cup and said it was okay. He likes his coffee so strong that most other people can't drink it so I wouldn't go by his opinion. He did mention that he thought it was too expensive. I guess it would be expensive for someone who drinks as much coffee as he drinks. He could finish a box in a couple of days.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1. This coffee is very tasty and perfect for those who only want one cup at a time.<br />2. This coffee is a good choice for those who prefer organically grown, fair trade coffee.<br />3. This coffee also supports the Kicks for Cause Foundation with partial proceeds going toward youth soccer programs.<br />4. I doubt that I will purchase any of this coffee but that is because I am not a coffee purist and tend to be satisfied with less expensive blends.

review/text: Delicious medium roast coffee made of 100% Arabica beans, grown in Ethiopia by a very conscious company.  This company exists in an area where child labor is prevalent; they however, insist the children of laborers go to school.  That says a lot!<br /><br />The coffee itself is not a blend that will give you a morning jolt, it is a medium blend with berry and floral overtones, which we had a difficult time tasting, but it does have a nice flavor and would be great to serve to guests or for a special occasion.<br /><br />I find it rather difficult to review an item such as this, as taste is so subjective.  However, both my wife and myself find this to be a premium coffee that has a slightly different taste than that which we are familiar. I am not saying that in a negative way, just to let you know that it will be something a bit different.  It is enjoyable and believe it can be well recommended for most coffee drinkers.<br /><br />The company itself must be commended for its treatment of workers, sustainable crops and its contributions to kids organizations in that area.<br /><br />Stir It Up!<br /><br />Ed

review/summary: Excellent coffee, upscale packaging but lacking in description
review/text: Most attractive and functional packaging (individually foil-sealed pods) but while it wasn't hard to figure out the usage once I had them, it certainly was a mystery what exactly they were going to be prior to their arrival. Please note I would have expected the product description to give me some idea of whether this is produced for a single serve maker and if so, for which one(s).<br /><br />I am using single pods in my Senseo brewer, to make small cups (4 oz.) and am finding this most satisfactory. But in order to brew these larger-than-standard pods, I do have to use the 8 oz (two-pod) holder. No problem (as Marley would say). I do my usual routine of wetting the pod prior to brewing. Figure I deliberately make a strong cuppa; that would be my preference. It tastes great. I agree with the description of floral and berry, a very smooth, non-acidic cup of coffee.

review/text: I'm by no means a a coffee expert, but I do drink a ton of it every day.  I do have sensitive tastebuds, and can tell the differences and nuances between a Starbucks Sumatra and a Dunkin Donuts dark roast.  My taste ranges mostly for medium to strong flavored coffees.  This coffee is on the medium side of the flavor spectrum, and it's free of the sourness found in some store brands.  I would call it a mild medium, and I like the portable package as a way to break up the monotony of what's offered at the office.  I can keep a pack or 2 in my desk drawer whenever, as the individual wrapping for each pod is quite handy.  There's nothing terribly distinctive about it- just a clean tasting coffee.  I will say this- I prefer it over the Starbucks Sumatra offered at work.  Recommended.

There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very "Starbucks-y" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.

The Ethiopia Yiragacheffe is the "exotic floral and berry" blend, yet all I could savor was a brilliant smooth cup of coffee that had absolutely NO need for sugar, honey or cream - it is quite frankly perfect as is. Also easy on the stomach.<br /><br />No instructions, but they are single serve pods made for single serve brewers. As for a standard brewer, compile pods for brewing according to taste. Experiment & enjoy.<br /><br />I shared this with my family, we have a new morning favorite.

review/summary: Very smooth flavor in a convenient form.
review/text: I find this coffee to be very pleasant with very little bitterness or acidity. Since it comes in individual pouches, much like a tea bag, the result is perfectly filtered. There are brewing machines that take such pouches, but I just put it on the bottom of a cup and pour boiling water over it. By adjusting the amount of time that you let it steep, you can regulate the flavor. Most experts suggest only a few minutes, similar to the amount of time a drip method would take. More than that is considered over-extraction that may result in more bitterness and other changes, but it is a matter of personal preference. The foil packs also keep each pod very fresh. It is also very convenient to take to work with you since it is so simple to brew.

review/summary: Very good coffee
review/text: I tried the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee the day it arrived. I really love the individual coffee "pod" that is so handy and easy to dispose of. The directions suggest using one coffee pod to make an eight ounce cup of coffee. This makes a good cup of coffee with no messy coffee grounds.

review/summary: Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water
review/text: These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.

review/summary: A Good company, but the coffee is a disappointment
review/text: I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization "kicks for a cause," a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good.

Very flavorful.<br />My preferred coffee flavor is bolder along the Italian/ Colombian lines so this having a subtle hint of flower flavor was very different.<br />I know this will be a big hit to some coffee drinkers but it is not for me.

review/summary: Five Star Coffee but a One Star Pod
review/text: I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added "flavored coffee creamer" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.

review/text: Tried it three different ways: black, just cream and cream & sugar. This was such a smooth flavor that I enjoyed drinking it all three ways, which has never happened before. I also love the pod design; I used my regular coffee machine, so the pods make clean up quick & easy.

review/summary: For people who Like Weak Coffee
review/text: I like my coffee strong so to me this tastes like strong tea that smells vaguely of coffee.  I prepared it the way you would tea--just put it in the cup and poured.  Maybe I should have done something differently but that's all we have (except a conventional coffee machine).  I tried squeezing it with my fingers and that helped a bit.  The only problem was that afterwards my fingers smelled like bitter coffee.  Squeezing the coffee bag with a spoon didn't produce quite the same result.<br /><br />So bottom line: if you like weak coffee, this is worth a try I think.  Otherwise, not so much.

review/summary: Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC
review/text: I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.

review/summary: Amazing smell, good flavor
review/text: It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.  That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness.

review/summary: Flavorful but weak
review/text: This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you.

review/summary: Not Bad at All
review/text: I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there.

review/text: The name and packaging is what attracted me to it.<br /><br />The smell lured me in; I could sit forever in a coffee shop that smells like it.<br /><br />The struggle to open the outer wrap was frustrating.<br /><br />The brew itself, no matter how it's prepared is ok to good. It's not strong like Starbucks, nor mellow and smooth like Dunkin's. It is mild with no aftertaste. I am a long time coffee lover and drink it black.<br /><br />The choice is sustainably grown organic coffee or taste?  I'm going to mix it up!

review/summary: Strong Branding, Weak Flavor
review/text: I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.

review/text: These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold.

review/summary: Very light coffee-  not medium roast
review/text: Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me.

review/summary: Dark Color, Watery Flavor
review/text: Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy.

review/summary: Lovely Coffee, Shhh, Here's a Tip!
review/text: I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a "strong" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee. I ripped open a couple of bags and made a 10 cup pot in my MR Coffee Coffeemaker (bought right here on amazon.com and was an "open-box" absolute bargain) and found it made a really fantastic pot of coffee. I ended up using it all in this manner.<br />I like the idea of this coffee, it is grown in an ethical manner in Jamaica and also in Africa and Central America)by the Marley family (of Reggae fame)<br /><br />A quick look on their web-site reveals they have several other offerings plus a neat (if pricey) coffee-maker)<br />If you like a great tasting coffee, this is worth a try even though it is a bit pricey!
