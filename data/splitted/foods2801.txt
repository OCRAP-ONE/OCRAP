However, a large shopper's club sells essentially the same product (ingredients, and including the capped box and inner packaging), while offering the product at a consistently lower cost: 10%-12% per unit.

Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week.

review/summary: Freshens breath and my Yorkie loves 'em!!
review/text: When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie "yelling" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!

review/summary: Absolutely fabulous
review/text: I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, "Almost three." And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. "No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned."<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.

review/text: I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the "large or X-Lg" greenie where you get fewer pieces.

review/text: I usually buy these at the pet store, but the price was great, and the product arrived fresh. These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.

My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh. It's also grt for their teeth, she hasn't had to have her teeth cleaned at the vet once since she started eating these.

review/summary: Greenies teeth biscuits
review/text: I love this product!  My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting brown in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :)

review/text: We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!

review/summary: My Lab's favorite bedtime treat
review/text: I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that "tail-wagging drool" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)

review/summary: Only thing my dog will eat.
review/text: I have a 3 year old Siberian Husky, who has to be the pickiest dog in the world. He will go days without eating if I don't give him exactly what he wants. I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done.

He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)<br /><br />(To the bad reviews/comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)

review/summary: Works well but too dense
review/text: My dog likes to chew it but it's "heavy weight" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here.

review/summary: My Dog Goes CRAZY!!
review/text: I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.

review/summary: My poodle loves these
review/text: These are a great training aid for dogs because they seem to like them so much.  I have one dog but have offered them to others as well when I go to the dog park.  I have had great luck using these for rewards when she follows the commands.

review/summary: Best Price
review/text: For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally.  My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that.  The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness.

review/summary: My pugs favorite dental treat & works!
review/text: I've had my pug Koa for over 6 years now. Since 2 years I've been providing him with greenies and he just loves it!  Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.  But with purchasing different pricing each time through Amazon is something I don't understand.  It would be great for return loyal patrons to purchase same price or honor discount pricing.

review/summary: the best reward/bribe ever
review/text: I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in. And Greenies are good for their breath/teeth, healthy and easily digestible. My vet, too, recommends them.

review/text: My two little Italian Greyhounds love Greenies. I did buy the wrong size Greenies this time. I usually buy the teenie Greenies with 96 in the package for aprox the same price, but I must have hit the wrong size product. Not too big a deal, I just break them in 1/2.<br />The product arrived very quickly and I will be certain to order again in the future....thought I will be sure to order the correct size next time!

review/text: My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.  He gets one per day and always lets me know when it is time to have one.  The cost is a little high so I buy them in the larger quantity.

review/text: Our dog knows the word Greenies so we have to call them Gs, but never to her! We don't want to have to come up with another name. These are an absolute must. The dog must have them. That is all there is to it. The fact that we could find the "lite" greenies was an added bonus.

review/summary: #1 dog treat!
review/text: These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole.

review/text: My two babies just LOVE this product - they cannot get enough.  They usually get their treat just before bedtime.  When they know the time is nearing, they sit on the bed and anxiously await their bedtime treat.  Although the bones are small, I cut each bone into four pieces so they think they are getting multiple bones.  This item is a win win for my little ones!!

review/summary: Dogs love Greenies
review/text: Dogs LOVE Greenies!  They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!
