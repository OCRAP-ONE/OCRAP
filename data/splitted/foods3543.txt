review/text: $13.95 in shipping (5-7 days) for a $26.00 order!?!?!?  Do the math, that's OVER 50% extra on shipping alone.  Are you crazy?  We're not talking about Scharffen Berger chocolates here and they only charge $9 for 3 to 5 days (for a $30 order).  I don't care what chocolate you buy, but don't get taken on the shipping for a cheap product!!!

review/text: Although I have never ordered the candies from a website, I have heard from other reviews that the shipping is outrageous. I find that very disapointing since the chocolates themselves are so outstanding. However, these are available at other locations like airports around the country. That is, now a days you need to actually be flying in order to enter the shopping area, but that are often there if you do!

review/summary: The BEST candy EVER!!!
review/text: I've tried the rest, but this is the BEST!<br /><br />I've been eating See's candies since I was just a kid!  Easter was one of my favorite holidays, because my mom would order See's large easter eggs, we would get to pick our favorite filling, Chocolate or Chocolate Walnut, then we'd get a medium chocolate egg, I would always choose the Bordeaux (by far the best flavored candy See's sells), you could get the divinity if you liked that.  The buttercream is always a huge favorite at our house.  You have your choice of Dark or Milk chocolate. Choose your own liking!  I prefer Milk chocolate.  Another of my favorites is California Brittle.  Also, the Vanilla Nut Carmel (no chocolate on this one), but very tasty!<br /><br />Just remember the Assorted premade box doesn't always have the best picks in it.  If you like nuts and chews, that's one of the better choices.  I prefer to go down to See's and select my own mix!  Pecan turtles--just melt in your mouth.  Try the truffles if you like!<br /><br />Never did like Godiva or Fanny Farmer, once in awhile I could take a piece of Helen Grace or Lindt, but they never live up to my standards.<br />See's is the perfect candy and it makes the perfect gift for family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, service company's and the postal person.  Don't cross anyone off your list until you surprise them with a gift of See's candy for the Holidays.

At S*m's they were $8.98 for 32 oz, which is $.28/oz. Amazon is usually the best, but in this case the Amazon price is astronomically high!

review/summary: 6-pack almonds are not always fresh...
review/text: My household eats a lot of sliced almonds, so I thought that getting them for a great price from Amazon would be perfect.  Sometimes it is perfect; other times (3 times in a row, once), the almonds tasted rancid although the use-by date was over a year from the present.  I was about to stop my continuing order, but then received a "fresh" 6-pack of almonds, so I'm just hanging in there for now.  I love Amazon, so I hope they read this review and check out the almonds for themselves.

I don't know if this is typical for nuts, or if the packaging was not airtight. Keeping in the freezer remedied the problem.

review/summary: Great price for fresh product!
review/text: I had two fears when purchasing the Almonds. One was that the slices would be too crushed, the other that the almonds would be so close to their expiry date that I would not be able to use up all six pouches in time. I am glad to report that my fears were unfounded. The almonds were fresh with their expiry date one year and ten months out. The slices were adequately thick, with only minimal breakage. The price, under Subscribe and Save, was excellent.<br /><br />I use almonds quite often not only in baking, but in dishes such as curries and dahls (lentils with curry, almonds, and raisins, served over basmati rice are DELISH!). I also like to add almonds, raisins and honey to warm bulgur wheat and eat it as either a meal, or a desert.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Buttercup gives this a thumbs up!
review/text: Okay, so maybe not a thumb, but a paw up!  My 4 month old female kitten Buttercup just LOVES this stuff!  She sees me take it out and she just goes crazy...meowing and running around.  Once I get the food on her plate, she jumps in the air to try to get to it while I am bringing it to her food "station".  She is still a kitten, so I will normally feed her 1/2 of a container in the morning, seal up the rest and feed that to her later in the evening.  She will only eat the whole thing at once if she is super hungry.  Buttercup also likes Fancy Feast, but not nearly as much as this stuff.  I also tried to feed her 9 Lives canned cat food and she wouldn't touch the stuff. I try all different types of food to feed her so she gets variety and this Meow Mix Market Select is so far her very favorite.  She is licking her chops right now!

review/summary: Very good formula
review/text: This is a good soy based formula.  I fed it to my daughter and son when they were babies. Now I buy it for my grandchildren. It is gentle on their digestive system. They all breast fed for at least one year or more. Now my grand daughter who was breast fed and weaned herself is drinking it at ten months and loves it. I buy in the glass because it is very easy to warm and is just the right amount for her. She is a slow drinker and only drinks this amount each time. She will not drink more than six ounces at a time. This size is great because it doesn't get wasted as you can't leave it until later. Once opened the instructions are very clear, it has to be discarded after one (1) hour. Ordered it on amazon.com, and Diapers.com delivered it within two days and it was packaged very well.

Too many bottles were jammed into a large carton at origin, causing the breakage problem (16 - 32-bottles total, as I recall). As far as I can tell, this Seller could care less about standing behind his product; or, even half-way trying to keep his customer(s) happy. Evidently his business is so good that it just does not matter what his Buyers think! Very, very poor treatment can be expected if you buy here. Given the way they package the orders, expect lots of broken glass. Grade: DDD---

review/text: I stumbled onto this while looking for a low acid coffee, as I was having some problems with coffee apparently aggravating my acid reflux condition.  It tastes delicious and comes very quickly after ordering it.  I only wish Amazon itself would stock it so that my Prime membership would eliminate the shipping.  The shipping charges are the worst part of the deal.  I initially ordered a 1# bag to see if it was good...most really low acid coffee are not so great to drink, in my opinion.  This is great tasting and very smooth and I will order the 5# bag in the future, the shipping being hardly any more than for the smaller bag.<br />This company seems to be a really first class outfit with a great product (many more great looking coffees on their web site, including some Jamaican Blue Mountain Reserve I'd like to try) with reasonable prices and quick shipping.  Now if we could just get a bit of a better break on shipping, it would be perfect.  They do not charge a rip off price on it, but it is not inexpensive, either.

review/summary: Healthy and my dogs love them.
review/text: These Moo Sticks are very loved by my dogs. The sticks themselves are pretty stinky and are greasy feeling. However, they are good for the joints of dogs and dogs go crazy for them. This size is a good deal, the only drawback is that they are difficult to cut into pieces. There are 6" pieces available for purchase, but at a much higher price. So, I continue to order the 12" size and break them in half, This can prove to be quite difficult, I use my hands to bend them, then I use a knife to fully separate the 2 pieces. My dogs are about 35-40# in size, so they do not really need a 12" piece as a treat.<br /><br />I will continue to order these treats for my dogs, I wish that it were possible to buy the 6 inch size at the same cost as the 12" size. I can recommend these for dogs, a treat that they love, at the same time these are good for them too!

You won't get the, "You got milk mustache" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark.

review/summary: illy issimo cappuccino
review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, good price.
review/text: I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.

review/summary: Perfect little guys
review/text: Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.

review/summary: One of my very favorite flavors!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

review/text: If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These almonds are lightly salted and roasted.  They are absolutely delicious.  I could easily see getting in trouble with these since I could sit down and eat the whole can in a sitting and not even realize it.  I snack on them pretty much every morning to tide me over until lunch without having to eat a big meal or something very unhealthy for me.

I happen to love all of Blue Diamond's different flavors for their almonds. This flavor - Smokehouse is the best IMO. It's got just the right amount of smoky flavor to it without being overbearing. I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2-3 servings - about a handful each serving. Very tasty

It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.

review/text: DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

review/summary: Good quality tea
review/text: Love this tea, I order it regularly for drinking. Be sure to sift it for smoother less bitter taste. Any bitterness comes from clumps; sift your tea before pouring the water. On the subject of water, don't bring it to a full boil or else let it cool. If the water is too hot you will burn and scald your tea!!!!

review/summary: Matcha
review/text: I bought this matcha at a health food store. It cost me $29. At first I hated myself for spending so much on such a tiny tin. Then I tried it in a matcha frappucino and I am hooked. It all started with a green tea frappucino at starbucks....It was ok but not great...I knew I could make it better. After some research I found out that this brand is indeed the finest quality matcha around. I will be purchasing the 2nd harvest matcha next time as i only want to make lattes with it and its cheaper because the quality is not as high with the 2nd harvest. my recipe is this: in a blender add one cup milk ( I have also used almond milk and thats good) 1/2 cup ice, 1 tsp matcha, and one tablespoon torani vanilla syrup. These are honest guesses since i only eyeball things, if it doesnt taste right add more or less of something. I top it with whipped cream sometimes.

review/summary: DoMatcha Green Tea
review/text: I just recently started drinking green tea and I purchased a green tea set with some Teas' Tea Matcha.  I wanted to try some different brands of matcha to see which one I liked better.  I trid the DoMatcha last night and it had a more leafier taste and it was much stronger (I made a face when I first had it) than the Teas' Tea Matcha in my opinion.  I'm not a seasoned green tea drinker so I'm not sure if a better quality green tea tastes stronger or not.  Even though I made a face when I drank it I'm still giving this 5 stars because the product is everything it says it is.  I can't give a bad review just because I'm not used to the taste.

review/summary: Very nice.
review/text: I had never tried matcha before, and read several articles online as well as the reviews on Amazon to help me choose a brand and grade to try.  I settled on DoMatcha and am happy with my purchase and plan to reorder.<br /><br />Since I've never experienced matcha before, I don't have anything to compare it to.  I expected something very smooth and grassy, which is what I like in a green tea.  This wasn't as smooth as I thought it would be as it did have a hint of a bite to it.  However, I'll assume it's just the way it is and I've learned to enjoy it.  I make a serving every morning and I enjoy the process of sifting and whisking the mixture.  There is something very peaceful about the process.  I have noticed that I really do feel better after I drink it.  I don't feel the effect right away. It gradually sneaks up on me then I feel more alert and energetic for a few hours.  I don't feel jittery, either.<br /><br />I would like to try the second harvest DoMatcha to see how they compare. But I am happy with this and even though the package is small, it goes a long way.

review/summary: Malty Breakfast.
review/text: Given that it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word "English" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of "acquired taste" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the "water of life" ("uisgue beatha") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.<br /><br />Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday "work horse" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee. Enjoy!

review/text: I really love this tea, and I cannot start the day without it. It has a full bodied and malty flavor. I like it with a little milk, but it's also great on its own. I wish the leaves were whole, as is the Taylors' Assam, Doomur Dulling, but that is my only nick against it. I've tried both, and I still prefer the taste and fully body of the Scottish Breakfast Tea.

review/summary: May CAUSE Joint Pain
review/text: Review edit: If you are looking for other opinions in this issue, Google Jenna Scribbles Can Green Tea Cause Joint Pain. You will be able to read over thirty comments from people around the world, confirming this problem.<br /><br />Many doctors and articles will state that green tea is good for joint pain. It's an anti-inflammatory and people suffering from lupus or arthritis are encouraged to drink it.<br /><br />I started drinking this lemon and ginseng tea last winter. I stopped drinking pop and wanted to avoid the caffeine withdrawal. About one month later my joint pain was so bad I needed to use ice packs on the affected areas. I racked my brain trying to figure out where this was coming from. I'd never had this problem before in my life.<br /><br />The only thing that had changed was I stopped drinking soda pop and started drinking this green tea. I guess you could add that I was two months older, but I hoped most people didn't dive into old age that quickly.<br /><br />So one day I decided to stop drinking this tea. Twenty four hours later I felt much better. Two days later I felt almost perfect. And one week later I was back to normal.<br /><br />I'm not a doctor. I'm not saying all green tea is bad... just analyze and take note of how your body reacts to this product or any tea. If you are experiencing joint pain - trying cutting out all tea and see if it helps.

review/summary: For our premature twins.
review/text: In October of 2011 my wife and I became the parents of twins; a boy and a girl.  They were 6 weeks premature and had to spend two weeks in our local NICU.  Similac Neosure was the formula that both of them could stomach.  They initially tried other brands but one or the other couldn't hold them down.  Well, almost 6 months later and we're still feeding them Similac NeoSure.  The product seems fine I guess I have to give it the majority of the credit for my once 3lbs babies now weighing between 12-13 pounds!<br /><br />What I don't like about this product is the small can that it comes in.  The pack of 6 is the best value for your dollar but it still doesn't go very far.  My wife and I buy about one case a week, that's nearly 400 dollars a month in formula!<br /><br />A tip to parents of multiples; we make our formula once a day and that will last through the day.  We pour in 58 ounces of water and add 28 scoops of NeoSure (both of us hate the scooping part).  We use a large blender for our storage container.  This makes mixing and storage that much easier!  Good luck out there!

review/text: This product has worked very well for my twin sons who were born a month early. When the boys were in the NICU for their first week, the hospital used this product as a staple for every preemie. When we took the twins home, the doctor advised us to continue using this as it has more calories per ounce than regular formula. What I have to stress about this formula is that you really should only use it with a doctor's recommendation. It is the amped up version of regular formula, and shouldn't be used unless you are directed by your infant's physician.<br />The price here is consistent with Safeway and even Wal-mart's prices, but when ordering from here, it gets delivered to your door free of charge, and with twins, that's a big help!

review/text: Product is great but Amazon has again raised prices. I was able to buy elsewhere and the case value worked out to 11.84/can. This was a huge savings for my twins.

review/text: Neosure is preemie formula, and in my opinion - is just about the best option available. By the time my boys were four months, they had hit the 50th percentile in weight. I attribute their excellent weight gain to Neosure.<br /><br />As to the comments about cost, I just looked up the price on Walgreens.com. It's $15.99 a can plus tax (in my area 8.5%) or about $17.00. Amazon's price is less than $15.50 a can, with no tax add-on. Plus, I appreciate that I don't have to run to the store to pick the boys' formula up.

review/text: I us this to supplement my baby. She has been on it since she was two weeks old, and she has never spit up, and she drinks it very well. I use it because she was three weeks early and not gaining enough with just breast milk, so my doctor has me using this about three times a day.

review/text: My son was born at 25 weeks and when I brought him home at 3 months old, he weighed 4 pounds and 8 ounces. He's been home 2 months now and is 5 months old and weighs 11 pounds and 4 ounces! This formula is all I feed him. He eats 4 ounces every 3 hours and I use 1 scoop for every 2 ounces of water as directed. I've had no issues with spitting up or reflux.  The only drawback to this formula is that it is so dog-danged expensive! Ouch!  Our pediatrician has said that my son should be on this a year.

review/text: I'm not really sure how to review this formula. It is only recommended that you use this under the direction of a physician, so whether or not it worked for our babies doesn't mean that it will, or even should be attempted, for your babies. If, however you're just checking to see if other people have used it, then yes, our preemies were given this in the hospital and we continued its use at home. When asked if I could switch formulas, my pediatrician advised not to since the babies still needed the 22 calorie formula. Even at 10 weeks premature, our babies at 3 months now are no different than ACTUAL 3 month babies - pretty amazing. But, yes, now the price on Amazon is inline with what you will find in the store. The only better deal I can find is to use the coupons that Similac sends out, but there are only so many of those. But free shipping and no tax through Amazon? Can't beat that!<br />I bought it at eighty nine dollars, so that at least saved me tax. I also bought it through one of the other sellers here on Amazon for seventy two dollars, and that was even better. Just depends on when you read this review as to whether or not it's relevant.<br />**Update - the Neosure also ended up being very hard on our babies' tummies. They were switched to Alimentum, and now the $15 a can - even with tax - is like a dream price.

review/summary: Really packs on the pounds!
review/text: Our twin girls were born at 37 weeks and around 5.5 pounds each, and after three weeks of breastfeeding exclusively, they had dropped to just below 5 pounds, so our pediatrician recommended I supplement breastfeeding with Neosure. The results were astounding -- within a month both girls were just under 10 pounds! They've been on this calorie-laden stuff ever since (22 cal/oz versus 20 cal/oz in regular formula and in breast milk -- that's 10% more!) The reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because it gave our baby girls a touch of reflux, which we had to combat with 1mL of Mylanta before each feeding. It's also a little more difficult to mix than other formulas since it's creamier/fattier - you need to really shake/mix it to be sure there are no little beads of formula that settle at the bottom of the bottle (happens to us all the time). And yes, it is a tad pricier than other formulas, however like the other reviewers I've found it for a little less at CVS, and even snapped some up for $12.99 a can on sale at Wegman's. All in all though, it's made our girls big and strong - they're not even 4 months yet and already sitting up, rolling over, trying to "stand" on our laps and talking up a storm!

review/text: I had twin girls born at 33 weeks.  They got a combo of NeoSure and pumped breastmilk during their 19 day NICU stay.  When they came home, I attempted exclusively breastfeeding and while my girls gained weight, it was less than stellar and the pediatrician told me to start supplementing.  Their weight gain has been fantastic and seem to be on par developmentally and size wise with their cousin that was born 4 weeks later at full term.  But it's very hard on their little tummies.  They both spit up pretty much after every bottle and one girl is on Prevacid for her reflux.  They're still gaining weight well though, even with all of the spit ups.  My pediatrician wants them on this until they're 4 months old and I'm counting the days till I can switch formula to cut back on all the spit ups!

review/summary: Just what the doctor ordered.
review/text: Exactly what my late term premature twins need. Great having these delivered. I only go to the shop to buy them if I find coupons.<br /><br />My twins are taking these well. Our surrogate is pumping breast milk for them, but she can't keep up with their growing demand, and they seem to be doing well on a 50-50 mix of formula and breast milk.
