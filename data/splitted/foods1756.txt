Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />I'm from Brazil and I used to live right on the coast of Pernambuco. Coconut water is something I grew up drinking and I missed it once I moved to the USA. Now that I've found O.N.E. I'll always have this sweet taste of Brazil with me.<br />Besides being a great source of potassium and electrolites O.N.E. is 100% natural and taste great.<br />Two thumbs up!

review/summary: Can't get enough!
review/text: I'm very familiar with brown coconut water, which I absolutely love, but had never had green coconut water before. I read many reviews from O.N.E. as well as Vita and Zico before finally going with this. One person stated that green tasted different from brown, and they were right. However, I was not disappointed with green. I got my case 2 days ago and am hanging on dearly to the last 2. I'm on a tight budget, otherwise I'd be ordering a few more cases just to get me through next week.<br /><br />This is very refreshing, doesn't leave any nasty aftertaste, and very light in sweetness. If you're a fan of sugary drinks, this is not the drink for you. I also really like that O.N.E. adds a telescoping straw to their container because I don't enjoy drinking from cartons.

review/text: I got this because I wanted to be more healthy and stay hydrated. The flavor is light but it took me some time to get used to. The individual packaging is great and air tight, just be careful when you open it since they fill it to the top and even a little squeeze can squirt some juice out. After drinking one of these everyday for like 2 weeks or so I noticed my face was a lot more moisturized and some of my acne had gone down(just some results that happened to me). I also had more energy and didn't have any energy crashes like I usually do from all those other energy drinks.

review/summary: Very close to the real thing -- but definitely an acquired taste
review/text: My parents, who were stationed on Guam during the Korean war years, raved for years about the cocoanut water which came from fresh, green cocoanuts.  Apparently on Guam, in the fifties, it was a treat to bring in a bunch of green cocoanuts to their Quonset hut, extract the liquid and mix it with other fruit juices for an island treat.  They never actually said so, but I think some of those juices might have been of the fermented variety.  Anyway, when I saw this product on Amazon, I immediately ordered a case.  I must say that drinking straight cocoanut water is an acquired taste.  Two of my teenaged daughters liked it better than sports drinks, and thought the exotic nature of it gave it cachet among the athletes on their various teams.  They are anxious for me to order more.<br /><br />My dad said that this beverage is not quite like the fresh cocoanut water he recalls from his Navy days on Guam, but that it is very close.  He, too, wants to stock it in his pantry.  He said that the water he remembers was a little more flavorful.  But he did say that they seldom drank it straight, so he may have a faulty memory.<br /><br />As for me, I found the taste of this water a little on the thin side.  I expected more of a true cocoanut flavor.  I did try mixing it with fresh-squeezed orange, lemon and lime juices and adding a little sugar -- I found that helped enormously.  But I hardly think that's the point.<br /><br />This beverage is wonderful for those who have already developed a taste for cocoanut water, as my dad says it's very close to what can be found in Nature.  It is also a low-calorie, potassium-rich drink which might fit in very nicely with a sports or exercise regimen.  As for me, I might try a real green cocoanut and its liquid the next time I'm on a desert island.  But I think I will leave this beverage for those who are sophisticated enough to truly appreciate it.

review/summary: My Favorite Commercial Coconut Water
review/text: If you've ever had the good fortune of drinking coconut water from a coconut (preferably picked yourself, top hacked off by machete), you know how refreshing and sublime it is. There's also nothing else that tastes like it. Coconut water is a slightly opaque water that seems to have a little weight to it (it's not the milk, which comes at a later stage in the coconut's life). The taste of coconut is very faint, and it's super smooth going down. There are few things on earth more thirst-quenching on a hot day.<br /><br />Since, for most of us, young coconuts are not readily available, coconut aficionados are happy there's ONE Coconut Water. Water is usually my preference for a portable drink---filtered water from your tap in a stainless bottle. But there are times when water isn't going to quite do the job. Coconut water is packed with electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous), so it makes for quick hydration. Keep some in the fridge and on hot days like today slip a couple in your backpack on the way out the door. Coconut water is also very useful to have on hand in the winter--it's great for when your child is sick and won't eat or drink.<br /><br />There is no sugar, it's miles away from any "sport drink" out there, and my son thinks it's a huge treat. The packaging is the eco friendly tetra-pak which supposedly doesn't leach any harmful chemicals (I'm always a bit skeptical these days) and ONE participates in a carbon reduction program. Be sure they are super cold--I like to have them refrigerated a good 24 hours before drinking.

review/text: I read the previous reviews about dented cans and crossed my fingers.  Well, lucky me - 9 of 12 cans were badly dented.  The cans are obviously packed and sealed by the manufacturer.  Amazon did a fantastic job by wrapping that box in two layers of bubble wrap.  The manufacturer box was pristine, which means the cans were put in the box already dented.  This is such bad quality control in this day and age.  The manufacturer should be ashamed!

review/text: Received it and realized I messed up by getting the "Pie Mix" verses the Pure Pumpkin puree. I had gotten the pure pumpkin of this same brand last time and it made the best tasting pumpkin pie, pumpkin bread and pumpkin pancakes I ever had, hands down. This Pie Mix has a faint underlying, not quite metalic, flavor that I can't quite describe. It's little better than "Libby's" brand but not as good as the pure pumpkin.<br /><br />In fact, I like the pure pumpkin so much better, I've already ordered it and I'm going to bring the 10 (out of 12) cans of the Pie Mix I haven't used to work and give it away.

review/summary: Yep, My Order Contained Dented Cans As Well
review/text: As always, I received my order quickly via my Amazon Prime Membership but I was disappointed to see that nearly all of the cans I ordered were dented.  I'm not concerned about it necessarily, as the dents seem to be consistently in the same areas (at a soft spot in the top or bottom part of the can) so I believe it's a production/quality control issue in the manufacturing process.  The metal seems to be thinner in some areas on the can so it flexes when you push on it - as opposed to a can that's been dropped and the resulting dent is rigid.  I'm not a total "I refuse to eat this if the can is dented" type of person, so it doesn't bother me all that much, but I can see where folks who are concerned about it would be upset to receive an entire case of dented cans.  FYI - I ordered three cases and every case contained damaged cans.  The price certainly was right, but perhaps that is because the seller knows it's a "second hand" product???

Even though there were several reviews about dented cans, I decided to order this mix because I love pumpkin pies and cannot locate canned pumpkin in any store. I wouldn't mind a few small dents but most were severely dented and/or smashed. I am afraid to use them so I am returning the entire case.  I, too, believe the cans were damaged before they were packed, not damaged in shipping.  Maybe the same returned cans are being re-shipped???

review/summary: Dented cans
review/text: About half the cans in my case were dented, and it certainly looks to me that they must have been dented before being packaged together into my case (cans in the middle of the pack have side dents, for example).  I had intended to include a can or two into care packages destined for American soldiers (a little taste of Thanksgiving, and the cans are pretty enough to be decorative).  But, I can't be sending dented cans to our troops -- and I don't want to eat from dented cans myself, so I'm vexed.  For purposes of this review, I opened a good can to taste the product, and the product tastes good.  It certainly costs enough.  I would have been quite happy with this if I didn't find half the goods were damaged (I consider them unusable), and I didn't think that I was intentionally bamboozled by someone trying to dump dented cans.

review/summary: Sure don't take like Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix
review/text: I am a huge fan of Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie mix.  One can of that and a can of evaporated mix and you have an instant pumpkin pie pudding or topping, no cooking needed because it is precooked when canned.  Libby's was swept off the shelves due to a harvest shortage this year (2009 harvest).  I bought some cans of this Farmer's Market pumpkin pie mix.  OMG, out of the can it's a very thick paste instead of slightly pourable like Libby's.  OK, that's a good thing, means it's richer.  Or does it.  I dunno.  So, I used a spoon to get it all out.  Added the 3/4 can of evaporated milk as it says to do.  Proceded to feel like a kid mixing flour and water to do some craft project while I worked it to try to get a liquid going.  Took a taste.  OMG.  Who dreamt up this recipe?  Is this stuff raw and not to be eaten without being cooked first?  It taste like molasses and pie spice.  It looks like molasses and pie spice.  It's brown instead of orange.  OMG, who wants to buy my remaining cans?  I got 7 left.  This stuff tastes like crap if you try to use it as an uncooked sauce like Libby's.  OK, so Libby's taste like liquid pumpkin candy pudding.  It might really be typical unhealthy American diet fare.  I dunno except it tastes fabulous.  This stuff tastes like medicine in comparison.  It probably makes a very good tasting pie.  Maybe I'll nuke my mixture for a while and see if the taste improves.  Otherwise, wait till Libby has another good harvest.

I'm thinking that had to be my problem this morning.<br /><br />Instead of using yeast from my fresh jar in the refrigerator, I followed the instructions exactly by adding the water, the flour mix, and then the yeast packet included in the box.  Three and a half hours later I have a brick of bread.  There was practically no rise at all.  The bread has a quite interesting sour dough tang and we will certainly eat the bread, but it is definitely not 'gift giving' quality.<br /><br />When I bake up the remaining packs from this order I will definitely proof the packet of yeast from the box before I trust it in my loaf.  Quite an interesting thought process there, I trust the Fleischmann's in my jar but not the Fleischmann's in the mix container.  And before you wonder, no, the expiration date on the package had not passed.<br /><br />My lesson:  proof any yeast that is included in a packaged mix!

All natural stuff, lots of healthy proteins and probiotics. I was using Nuturo and paying the same price at PetXX, and Nuturo doesn't hold a candle to TOTW. This is a premium dog food for a very reasonable price.

review/text: My wife and I switched our puppy to Taste of the Wild after trying numerous other dog foods. Our puppy had a lot of issues with loose stool and other things early on in his life but Taste of the Wild fixed all of that. Our dog seems less hungry, more healthy, and has consistently firm stool since we made the switched to TOTW. I would highly recommend this brand of food if you want a healthy dog. We haven't been able to find the 30 lb bags of puppy food in the store but Amazon has a great price. We've made the switch to TOTW and won't ever leave. They make high quality food that will leave your dog really happy.

review/text: Our German Shepherds are thriving on Taste of the Wild (TOTW).  Skin and coat issues are a thing of the past, foul doggy odor is GONE!  Their health has improved, no more chewing / cribbing type behaviors and life is more pleasant when landmines are smaller, less frequent and not absolutely foul as nasty as they were when on Purina and Pedigree cereal-based products.<br /><br />Our dogs dropped weight in the intense summer heat (almost a dozen days were 105+ degrees!) - a bag of TOTW Puppy mixed into their regular TOTW for adults corrected this problem right away.

review/summary: should've stuck with royal canin...):
review/text: this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.<br /><br />I might give another brand besides royal canin a try (since it's so expensive...), but I'm going to stay away from the taste of the wild...

I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.

Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows.

review/text: I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.

That also cuts the sweetness.

The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed.

review/text: Without a doubt this cannot be surpassed. I am always so conscientious about calorie count until I took a sip of this. I will just ration it for special moments. Even the cat's nose was twitching from the delightful scent. It is hard to believe that it was made in USA. If my daughter is lucky I might send her some at Christmas. It is a good thing I live alone or else I would have to hide it.

review/text: So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!!

review/summary: Stephen's Hot Candycane Cocoa is the best!
review/text: We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision.

review/summary: Stephen's Gourmet Candycane Cocoa
review/text: Well, I love hot cocoa but this is truly different. It literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing "warm you from the inside out" hot cocoa drink. If you are someone that isn't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it. The peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate. Truly different from any hot cocoa that I have ever enjoyed.

review/summary: Great even when made with water
review/text: I originally received this Mint Truffle hot chocolate as a gift, and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water, because in the past that always results in a weak flavor. Amazingly, that is not the case with this mix, even with no milk added this has a great rich, chocolate-mint taste.<br /><br />Because it doesn't require milk, I can keep it at work for a warm-up drink on cold office days. I usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P6855Y">Aladdin 16-Ounce Recycled and Recyclable Tumbler, Lily</a> then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate.

review/text: I bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting.  We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it, I saw pieces of Candycane candy in the chocolate powder. I made it the way that they suggested, with hot water, not milk.  It was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  There were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop.  I am thrilled to see that they carry this on Amazon because I know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on Amazon is much less than I paid.

review/summary: I agree!!
review/text: These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands, but I would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good.  We just had to order another case.  Try it with some coffee.  Mash it up in some vanilla ice cream. Seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude's first name.  First name only brands really cheese up the product.  How about "Cocoa Passions" or "Divine Cocoa" or even, "Serenity Now Cocoa".  Anything would Glam up the product name a little. I am a builder, would you buy an expensive house from "Kreg's Stately Mansions"? Nope.  Doesn't matter how choice the work is. I am sorry, Stephen, you do have a great product, I'll stop. Oh well, keep the prices low...Five stars, brother.

review/summary: Very tasty - maybe a little too rich if making with milk
review/text: I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.

review/text: I have tasted several Stephen's Gourmet products, but the Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite. It's creamy, smoothe and delicious.  I consider it my one splurge for myself.  I have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son, who just cannot get enough of it.  He has created different recipes with it, one using ice cream.  I will stick to the original method.  It's the best hot cocoa mix I have ever tasted.  The aroma alone will draw you in.  I am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage.  Occasionally I will share in hopes they will purchase their own.  Stephen's Gourmet makes the best cocoa ever.  I will drink it as long as they continue to make it.

I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all.

review/text: This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.

review/summary: Stephens Gourmet NSA Hot Chocolate
review/text: If you've read the other reviews about Stephens hot chocolate, well, the same for this one. It tastes rich and good. I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work. Thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me. Good stuff.

review/text: Make per directions and use half & half to top off for richer taste, maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair, soft spot, where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads.  Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.  I have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense.  Thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance.

review/text: I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it. I stumbled across this and thought I would try it. It is white, even though "cocoa" is in the title...in case you didn't figure that out! I did realize it wasn't chocolate, but didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake, but hot! I happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones (but hate drinking milk, go figure), but somehow, I haven gotten used to this product after about a week. I have 6 cans now, so I have many more opportunities to try! It may just be that I sort of mentally "expect" hot chocolate and I have to retrain my slow brain! It is interesting and different, and I still drink it, and almost like it, but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this. Definitely worth a try if you like vanilla.

review/summary: The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.
review/text: I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

review/text: I don't think there is a better hot cocoa (especially at this price)on the market than Stephen's. It lasted me the entire winter and made for awesome x-mas gifts. Now everyone I know buys it and I'm even happier to be spreading it around. My only issue is that I wish they would have a mixed pack; a 6 pack of mint, hazelnut, regular, dark, vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect!

review/summary: My Favorite Cocoa!
review/text: I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled "Gluten Free" -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).

review/summary: French Vanilla Cocoa-- Wow!
review/text: This stuff has an absolutely incredible taste. Very smooth and you can mix it with water or milk. If you like vanilla and you haven't tasted this stuff you are missing out!<br /><br />Get it, it's worth it!

review/summary: Delicious hot chocolate
review/text: I love Stephens Chocolate Raspberry. It is the best I've ever had. Other brands I've tried were bitter and just not as tasty.<br />It stirs in smooth, no lumps.<br />My order arrived quickly, just as promised. I'm a very happy consumer of this product and the supplier.
