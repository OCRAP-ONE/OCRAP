review/summary: Jack Link's peppered beef jerky
review/text: I like the sweetness taste of the Jack Link's peppered beef jerky over their over-salted Hickory beef jerky but it had WAY TOO MUCH black pepper.  I hope that Jack Link can cut the black pepper down to more than half or that Jack Link can come up with another version with less black pepper.

review/text: I've tried a lot of different beef jerky products, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ51NA">Mr. Z Beef Jerky</a> from Amazon, as well as the store brand from Jewel, and a great many others, including buffalo jerky like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48P4U">Golden Valley Buffalo Jerky </a>. Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

review/summary: Nice value!
review/text: We love rice around our house, and have tried a wide variety. We find white rice akin to library paste, and regular brown rice a bit like tree bark. This large bag of brown Basmati has become our favorite, both for flavor and for value. Brown rice has much better nutrition than white, by the way.<br /><br />For those who don't know it, Basmati rice has a delicious aroma even before you start to boil it. The flavor and texture are more interesting than white rice but not as sincerely virtuous as regular brown. The cooking is more like brown than white, however. Allow about 45 minutes, depending on the desired texture.<br /><br />While heating two to four cups water per cup of dry rice, I wash the rice with hot water. You'll see why. Drain and rinse, then add to boiling water and turn the heat to medium until it resumes boiling. After that, medium low will suffice. Frequent stirring is not needed if the heat is appropriate. After 30 minutes, I start to check more frequently.<br /><br />It's really best if you don't season brown rice until it's cooked. Read up on osmosis if it's not immediately clear to you why adding salt to the cooking water prolongs cooking time. Brown rice owes its reputation for being slow to cook almost entirely to recipes that add salt at the beginning (dried beans are the same way).<br /><br />To really tantalize the taste buds, add a tablespoon of Vegeta per cup of dry rice when the rice has reached the texture you like. Stir and let sit five minutes, covered. Mmmmmm!

review/summary: Excellent cream for dogs, too.
review/text: Have you ever owned a dog whose skin was extra sensitive and hard to calm? Have you gone nuts trying to get your dog to stop biting himself and chewing on irritated spots? Here's an answer that has worked wonderfully for our Rottie:<br /><br />This cream is the only thing that I have used that calms my poor Rottweiler's skin. We live in the mountains, and nobody can figure out what he has, but it makes him itch so badly that he chews his fur off where there is irritation. The ailment has parts that look like bites, but we can't find one bug on him and we bathe him a lot. His skin has rashes where it is bothering him, and sometimes is extremely irritated, with scabby parts. Ugh. SOLID GOLD cream immediately works, and now dear doggie is looking forward to my applying it every day.<br /><br />This cream is thick and greasy. It melts and is clear when warmed (or put on the dog), and I found that when I left it by my hot wood stove, it became smoother and faster to use, as when it's think it needs to be spread around with more effort.<br /><br />I am extremely happy to have found this cream! Ordering two jars this time.

review/summary: Versatile bean: lovely taste at a great price!
review/text: The Eden Garbanzo Beans are a fantastic value for this excellent quality product. The beans are organic. They are very low in sodium (only about 100 mg for the entire can of 3.5 servings). They are also much softer and flavorful then other brands I have tried. They are lovely on their own, eaten one bean at a time as a snack. This particular brand is excellent in hummus. I mince some garlic in a food processor, add the beans, tahini, roasted peppers in oil (instead of just oil by itself), lemon juice to taste, and I blast it until the consistency is right. These beans are also excellent in cold salads (try mixing them with finely chopped sweet onions, parsley, mint, olive oil and lemon juice; this tastes very nicely with a hot side of beef). I will be buying these beans again!<br />PS: The beans are kosher, for those to whom it matters.

review/text: I love this product because it tastes good and is organic. Unfortunately, every can in my shipment was dented. It was not packaged well; however, since every can was dented I suspect it was damaged before it ever shipped.

review/summary: Safe Beans!
review/text: I eat these right out of the can. The Eden cans are the only cans that<br />do not contain some type of preservative (bhp? I could be wrong with<br />the name..). Anyway, the beans have a sort of pleasant nutty flavor and<br />I eat these about 4 times a week.

review/summary: I  Eat  'Em  Every  Day  I'm  Not Eating Eden  Black Beans
review/text: I love chick peas (garbanzo beans).  Eden's are saltless so you can enjoy them as is or add whatever you like.  Personally I like to add a little hot sauce to spice them up.  That way I get great taste but not a huge load of salt... Even reduced salt canned beans have enough to weaken bean's natural health benefits.  Another great thing about Eden's beans are the cans they come in which are lined with BPA free plastic.<br /><br />I get a case auto-shipped every month.

review/text: I've purchased different brands of chickpeas for years to make hummus, and these are the best I've ever used. They're bigger, fresher, and more flavorful and anything else I've ever purchased and you won't find anything else with less sodium in a can. You also won't find them cheaper anywhere else, especially if you suscribe and save.

review/summary: YUMMY!  Hummus at your fingertips if you have a food processor.
review/text: I am so excited!  I LOVE hummus, but it's so expensive at the stores.  These garbanzo beans make hummus easily at my fingertips.<br /><br />Throw a can into the food processor, some tahini (found here on Amazon), garlic, and lemon juice, yogurt (or silken tofu--I use the tofu)...maybe paprika (I like the smoked paprika)...and well-la!  Major YUMMY.  I added peanut butter to one recipe and people LOVED it.<br /><br />Hummus is great for you, can easily be made vegan, an goes on everything from fresh veggies to sandwiches to meats.<br /><br />I will be ordering this again and again.  The beans were flavorful and the texture perfect.  The fact that they are organic is a plus, and the price can't be beat.

review/summary: Nice flavor
review/text: I sometimes like to marinate these in wishbone italian dressing, cool them , then eat them.  They are  a great source of protein.  These beans are also nice in cold salads add basil, parsley, mint, olive oil and lemon juice; this tastes very nicely with a  side of chicken). I will be buying these beans again! The beans are kosher, in case it is helpful to know that.<br />The  Garbanzo Beans are a fantastic value for this excellent quality product. The beans are organic. They are very low in sodium only about 100 mg for the entire can of 3.5 servings. They are also much softer and flavorful then other brands I have tried. They are lovely on their own, eaten one bean at a time as a snack. This particular brand is excellent in hummus. I mince some garlic in a food processor, add the beans, tahini, roasted peppers in oil (instead of just oil by itself, lime juice to taste, and I blast it until the consistency is right.

That's like $1.29 each or something... did not feel like doing the math there. I am glad it is way cheaper here.

review/summary: If you do not normally eat low-sodium - then these may not be for you
review/text: I'm going to buck the trend of reviews here.  I have eyed these at Whole Foods before.  We frequently make hummus and fried chick peas (yum!), and when I saw a good deal on a case, after reading all the great reviews, I thought I would give these a try.  I was particularly impressed to learn that the can was BPA free.<br /><br />Usually, I enjoy snacking on chickpeas right out of the can as we are preparing our recipes.  I popped one into my mouth, and was underwhelmed.  The second one, I thought maybe I just need to get used to them.  The third was as bland as the first two.  We ended up adding lots of seasoning to give these any flavor at all.<br />My husband teases me occasionally about using up the remaining cans.<br /><br />Maybe I am just not the target audience for this product.  Mine is strictly and clearly the opinion of someone who does not look for low sodium products. I am sure these are great for others (as indicated by other reviews), but I wanted to give the review of someone who does not regularly eat foods without any salt - I wish I had read one before I purchased these.  if you are not used to no-salt added products, like me, these may be to bland for you too.  As for me, I will save some coin and stick with the Goya brand (recommended by Cooks Illustrated),  when I have finally used up all of these.

review/summary: Glass In Pancake Mix
review/text: We recently purchased the 2 lb. bag of Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix and when we received it the bag was sealed. While serving pancakes to my family I bit into some crunchy pieces and immediately thought "oh I must have accidentally dropped an eggshell into the batter." After biting into another crunchy bit and then getting a jab in my mouth it dawned on me (duh) that all I added was water. I immediately told the family to stop eating!  I investigated further to find large shards of glass in the pancakes (two of them 3/4 of an inch long).  The measuring cup that I used was metal and the only glass in the process was the mixing bowl which after careful examination revealed no signs of chipping and it wasn't broken - it was fully intact.  I poured a cup of the dry mix from the original bag into a sieve and found pieces of glass - including small chunks (1-2mm in size) as well as additional shards.  I then contacted Continental Mills (the company who makes Krusteaz) as well as the FDA.  Let me be clear on something - I have no interest in any sort of legal action - I simply wanted to be heard.  Other than that I suppose that I wanted to hear them apologize.  I thought that was fair especially after I just served glass to my 1, 3, and 7 year old courtesy of Continental Mills.  The FDA was great - saying that they log complaints like this in order to agglomerate data to look for trends. THEY even apologized that I had encountered that problem.  Continental Mills immediately told me that it was impossible for there to be glass in the mix but they would send me a packet to send the Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix back to them for analysis.  I just received the reply stating that they did in fact find glass in the mix but "were unable to identify it as coming from our facility." They also included a $0.30 off coupon for Krusteaz products. I find their response to be absolutely unacceptable.  I am left with the belief that they do not care about quality nor the safety of their customers.  The glass came from somewhere - either from their facility or one of the suppliers that provides them with salt, baking soda, etc...<br />I recommend that you avoid this product for your safety and the safety of your family.

review/text: I have bought this brand for several years and my family has always enjoyed the pancakes. The formula had to be changed in the last order of 4 boxes I received. The taste was not good. I thought it might be just one bad box soni opened a second box. The second box tasted off as well. A shame because we have really loved these pancakes for many years.

review/text: I love everything Krusteaz makes. It tastes homemade and all you need to have on hand is water. You can make enough for one or for many. And it is a base for adding things like fruit or nuts or spices. Fresh fruit like apples chopped up fine, or dried fruit like raisens or cherrys, or cranberries. Cinnamon or cardomon or bacon pieces. You can use this mix for waffles too and add things like whole pieces of cooked bacon and applesauce on top!.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/summary: Pretty lousy, and a total ripoff!!...
review/text: These were a complete ripoff. I could not have been more disappointed. First off, they tasted cheap, and i mean Dum-Dums taste of far better quality than these things did, the most basic and bland flavors possible (Pineapple, Mint, & Cinnamon) . They are absolutely too expensive for what they are, they run almost a dollar a piece, it's a scam! And last, the only ingredient separating these from the absolute cheapest, most generic lollipops you can get your hands on is L-tryptophan, which regardless of what this package tells you, is VERY dangerous in large consistent doses. I quit smoking, but with no help whatsoever from these cheap awful lollipops, i actually threw half of them away because they were so awful. If you must, i would recommend just getting a L-tryptophan supplement vitamin, but do not abuse and take with caution. I quit with "One Step" filters and a few other products, that helped alot more than these, yuck!

Oftentimes I'll take a slice of this "bread" and a 100-calorie pack of plain almonds and this 200 calorie combo is enough to get me through the work day! Crunchy and savory, like a big cracker, and a great bread substitute for any raw vegan, or anyone aspiring to add healthier snacks to their diet. I don't eat any grains, short of the brown rice protein powder I occasionally add to smoothies, and every once in awhile a craving for toast sneaks up in me...this does an excellent job of satisfying that craving! I also found a recipe for olive "butter": a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a dash of salt in the freezer until it reaches a buttery consistency; a little of this spread on the bread tastes great! Highly recommend this and anything else from Lydia's Organics.

review/summary: An Unusual Treat!  Yummy!
review/text: Between my numerous and bizarre health issues, I have to scan everything I buy for ingredients I can't tolerate.  So I was pleased when I found this "bread", which was very safe for me.  Then surprised to enjoy it as much as I do.  I wake up alot in the middle of the night, needing something to munch  on and this bread does the trick.  It's delicious in it's own way. I will be trying it soon with nut butters, I bet that will be really good too.  Am impressed by Lydia's Organics.  Will be buying more of her goods, thanks!

review/summary: Jury's Still Out On This One
review/text: Hmm, I'm waiting for the day that I will love this bread.  Right now I'm calling it Lembas (sp?) bread because a little corner of it is all I, um, "need" before I've had enough of it.  I can't say it's bad, but I can't say it's great.  I'm giving it four stars instead of three because while I don't adore it, it's the only raw bread I've yet found that appeals to me (I have not conducted an exhaustive search though).<br /><br />I am new to raw foods and am looking for a convenient bread substitute that doesn't consist mainly of flax seeds (whose texture I don't care for).  This bread is made mainly from finely ground vegetable pulp (presumably what's left over after the juice has been extracted by a juicer), so it's not flax-seedy.  It tastes like dehydrated vegetables (like green veggies and carrots) and I think it's the flavor that I don't like.  It's texture is more crunchy than crisp--it's not brittle like seed crackers.  If you're new to raw food this product will probably take some getting used to, but it's easier to eat than flax crackers.<br /><br />You will receive 7 3.25" x 3.25" wafers, approx .25" thick, encased in plastic that is not resealable, enclosed in a box.  I keep mine in the freezer and it may last me a very long time.  I am hopeful that it will grow on me though.

I've used them for a version of mac & cheese, "spaghetti" and meatballs, & Hubby likes them with just butter too. Not sure what happened to the previous reviewer, but mine were fine. I stored mine in the fridge,& gave 2 away for friends to try. I am in love with this product, and will be reordering soon!

review/summary: A pox on Green Mountain for discontinuing this!
review/text: I found out that the wizards at Green Mountain discontinued what was probably the best k-cup bold roast around!  Midnight Magic is one of the most flavorful and smooth coffees around that has the body to really taste like coffee without a hint of bitterness!<br /><br />Have these guys every heard of 'NEW COKE'?  This has to rank way up there in one of the biggest marketing blunders in history.<br /><br />I'm currently buying up as much of it as I can find here and at other sites (no not hundreds of boxes but enough to last me for a year or so).  Because, while I will look for a replacement, no coffee I will replace it with will be from Green Mountain!  They could have kept the Midnight Magic blend if they wanted to discontinue the Timothy's brand.  But I simply don't understand why discontinue the blends.  They have a Web site that recommends replacements for the discontinued coffees.  I've tried just about every one they recommend for Midnight Magic.  FAIL!!!!  None of them come close!<br /><br />Green Mountain, you've blown it big time!<br /><br />P.S.  The 5 stars are for the coffee.  Green Mountain doesn't even get a single star, in fact if I could give -5 stars to GM I would.

review/summary: The Stinkiest!
review/text: Out of all the Plato Treats (Duck, Salmon, and Chicken) that we have purchased, the Salmon treats are by far the stinkiest.  Our trainers highly recommended these treats for us to use to ensure that we have attentive dogs in class.  In fact, one of the trainers always brings in plenty of salmon treats whenever they get a new batch of first timers to class.  Whenever my dog gets distracted in class, I take out a piece of salmon and he is all ears.  I love the fact that Plato Treats can easily be broken down into smaller treats.  It is so difficult to find these in a local pet store and they are usually pretty pricey.  I have fed my dog other natural salmon flavored treats, but they are not even half as stinky as these.<br /><br />Just don't forget your treat bag in your car on a hot, sunny day.  Your car may smell like salmon for the next day or two.

review/summary: Get the whole bean version
review/text: Ever since my first stop at Intelligentsia in Chicago, I've really liked Intelligentsia black cat espresso.<br /><br />It's ideal for my taste: sweet, rich, chocolatey, well-balanced acidity, great mouthfeel, wonderful thick dark crema. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm....<br /><br />I don't have a good grinder at home, though, so I thought I'd try the pre-ground version.<br /><br />It made fine shots, but not anywhere near as good as ground-right-before-brewing black cat. In fact, I think that the shots from the pre-ground black cat are not too different from some of the Lavazza pre-ground coffees (which are a fair bit cheaper).<br /><br />So, if you have a good grinder, black cat is brilliant (but get the whole bean one, not pre-ground). If you don't have a good grinder, and you are buying pre-ground espresso, you might as well save a few bucks and get cheaper pre-ground coffee (and put the savings into your piggy bank for that future grinder purchase!).

review/text: I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewer say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are.

review/summary: No Maltodextrin!!!
review/text: This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly.

Ive been doing 2 scoops with ice, water, and a banana for breakfast and lunch. Snack on nuts and have a healthy dinner and am already down 7pds. I definetly recommend this product, just ordered vanilla ice cream flavor and cant wait to try it. Also I shopped around and this price was the cheapest ive found by almost $10.
