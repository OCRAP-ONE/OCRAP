review/summary: best on the market
review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

review/summary: MMMMM....Chocolate....
review/text: I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister. I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

review/summary: Good, but Amazon has the flavor names wrong
review/text: Flavor names vs flavor photos are pretty confusing. I ordered "Rich Chocolate" and received "Rich Milk Chocolate". Now that I tasted it it's fine and I realize it's very possible that Nestle stopped making Rich Choc and started these Rich Milk / Rich Dark items, but Amazon should really fix the flavor names so that it's clear what you're getting.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

review/summary: Morning Comfort
review/text: My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

review/text: I use this product mixed with chocolate or vanilla Soy Slender, which also has 30% calcium, 25% D, and 7 g fiber.  Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.<br /><br />And I will be happy to answer M "M" about why.  This is four (4) canisters so it's not that expensive.  The other reason, besides it is good, is that those grocery stores you speak of don't have it. It has become very hard to find.  I can't find it at all any longer and am very happy to order a supply at Amazon.

review/text: I have long loved this hot cocoa but each year it gets harder and harder to find. Amazon's price is quite the bargain.<br /><br />Like a review posted upthread, I have tried several different hot cocoas including Ghirardelli and Godiva, both of which are great. However, this cocoa is my fave. I love the Butterfinger flavor and it really does taste like they dropped the candy bar in your mug. Because of Amazon's economical price, I am a little more willing to share this product at work and I must say, everyone has fallen in love with it.

review/summary: Good hot cocoa mix, but....
review/text: I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br />This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we've<br />never had before.  My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,<br />but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.

In the fall they stopped carrying the item.  I checked at several grocery stores with the same results.  I was surprised to see Amazon had the item. I placed my order and it arrived within the week.

We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether.  It was very disappointing.  It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate.  As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.

Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

review/summary: Tasty little snack!
review/text: I like to keep shelf stable snacks on hand at work, especially food that I can use as a lunch if I should forget to bring one that is both tasty and healthy.  I think these kipper snacks are a great size source of fat and protein. All that's in these is the smoked fish and pepper.  They are on the oily side, which I don't mind at all since it is oil that came from the fish itself rather than added.  They have a nice and firm texture, which I really enjoy.  Unlike sardines, they are not whole in that you are eating all of the scales etc.. Rather, they are firm and meaty little fillets.  I don't recall getting too many bones in them.  I personally just eat this out of a can, but I imagine they would be great on crackers, or made in to a pasta dish if you're using these at home.  I've almost finished my pack that I ordered, and I will continue to purchase these.

We got tired off paying ridiculous prices at the grocery store and at Whole Foods (their bulk syrup actually costs more than their packaged syrup!)  Coombs is a decent price and it's delicious.  It seems to have more flavor than the grocery store syrups, so we tend to use a little less.<br /><br />We like it so much that we put it on Amazon Subscription and now we receive both our oats and syrup automatically every few months making it one less thing I have to remember to pick up at the store and lug home.

review/summary: Very Good Grade A Maple Syrup...
review/text: This is very good Grade A-Dark Amber maple syrup, which is a VERY high compliment, since I live in the Midwest in a state that produces a large amount of high quality maple syrup that I've been used to consuming my whole life long.  It is thick in texture, dark and full-bodied with a fairly good, pronounced maple taste.  Compared to a grade B, it has just a slight less maple flavor, but is sweeter in taste.  A grade A-dark amber syrup is usually produced from sap gathered slightly later in the season, but before the grade B and commercial grades.  I wish Amazon had it available by the gallon, for an even better price.  For those who are wondering, maple syrup will keep for a couple of years, just fine, if refrigerated and even longer, if frozen.  It does not freeze hard, merely getting very thick, until the temperature is raised, due to the high sugar content.  I have usually preferred the maple syrups we produce locally, but this is one I will purchase again, if the price is right!

review/text: We admit, we love all foods bad for you and loaded with chemicals...I was afraid to purchase this because I was afraid it wouldn't be as sweet and we would end up tossing it - but we loved it!  It is just as sweet as the fake stuff and has a great flavor - even better than log cabin or aunt jemima butter syrup...and I never thought I'd like any as much as the butter flavored syrup...  As a test, I tried the rest of my Aunt Jemima butter flavor syrup and I thought I'd like that better - to my surprise, the Aunt Jemima now does not taste good to me on pancakes and I can really taste the after taste.  This is ruined me to ever go to a pancake house again if they don't have real maple syrup!  I tossed the rest of the fake stuff.<br /><br />My husband is not a pancake fan, but we used this syrup with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL60W">Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a> and it was amazing!  He actually loved the pancakes and said he'd want them again!  I can't wait to try it on waffles and french toast.  Also - I also purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019MYZGS">Brown Family Farm Pure Vermont Maple Syrup, 32-Ounce Jug</a> and side by side, we liked Coombs better.  It has a stronger maple taste to it.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to give it a try!  I just ordered a second bottle.

review/text: Maple syrup is just one of those things on which foodies and proficient cooks don't skimp.<br /><br />Microwave pancakes and toaster waffles benefit a great deal from the application of real maple syrup, but it does not work the other way around. There is no benefit to making pancakes or waffles from scratch and then serving them with maple "flavored" syrup unless you are also into that "Gee, I Wish Were Butter" hydrogenated oil stuff in a tub.<br /><br />This Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup is US Grade A Dark Amber. You can see by looking around here at Amazon.com that the cost of Grade A syrup increases as it gets darker. The light and medium ambers are both available here for a little less, but for the minimal difference in price you may as well treat yourself.<br /><br />In the U.S., maple syrup is broken down into two grades, A & B. Grade B is used most in baking and cooking because it has a deeper maple flavor that shines through as a flavoring, but is found by many to be "too sharp" when tasted pure (like on your pancakes!).<br /><br />Whether you plan to dress up your pancakes with Grade A or flavor some baked goods with Grade B, you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal than Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrups.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to regular syrup!
review/text: This syrup is great stuff.  My children were a bit apprehensive about real maple syrup, having been used to the store bought corn syrup stuff before the parents finally read the label on one, but now they only like the maple syrup.  The taste is great, like only real maple syrup can have.  Only negative is the expected drips of syrup on the bottle, but a quick rinse in the sink and it is good to go.  I suggest refrigerating it before and after use, as mold can grow on syrup (not experienced with this stuff, however).  We use the subscription to get a regular bottle replacement and to get the free shipping.

review/text: I ordered this for my son for his birthday. He and his son love the gooooood maple syrup, and the Vermont maple syrup is the best quality. He was very pleased, as I had gotten this for him before, and he knew how good it was. They had pancakes and syrup for breakfast the very next day. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves the genuine product.

review/summary: Easy way to get great syrup
review/text: I eat a gluten-free, corn-free diet, which makes syrup choices quite limited. Ordering a jug of 100% maple syrup through Amazon is a wonderful luxury. While I can find less expensive maple syrup if I drive a way's to our local Trader Joe's, I don't always have the time to do that. That is when I am grateful this product is available from Amazon. I've been ordering this from Amazon, which together with my Prime means I get a new jug in just two days, more often than I've been able to make the drive for less expensive syrup. Both taste good on the gluten-free, corn-free pancakes I eat regularly (the Namaste Pancake mix I also order from Amazon).

review/summary: Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Maple Syrup
review/text: Purchased this product from Amazon. We love it. Have always purchased 'pure maple syrup' from grocery stores at an exorbitent cost. The cost from Amazon was very inexpensive and we saved further after signing up for a delivery every 3 months. The syrup is kept in the freezer and poured into a small pitcher and put in the mic. Folks it is great. Anyone out there using commercial fake maple syrup such as Mrs Butterworths or Aunt Jemima you should know the following. They use zero amount of pure maple syrup. What they do use is Fenugreek seeds (for the flavor), High Frutose Corn Syrup and ADS Sodium Hexametaphate which is a seqestering agent most commonly found in soap and photography products.<br />Your body does not need those chemicals.

review/summary: A Keeper
review/text: Amazingly and briefly, the local grocery store offered this during the holiday season last year at an inflated price common to this area. I tried it regardless out of curiosity and desire to learn more about maple syrup grades. I was richly rewarded with this one. Luckily I kept the label and ordered online at a much better price and more reliable availability. The robust flavor, sweetness, aroma and viscosity (yes, thickness matters) are full-bodied and satisfying without that miserable cloying aftertaste of "maple flavored" sugar syrups. Flavor perception is very personal, so I'll not waste space in description. What is important is that this syrup fulfills my expectations of what maple syrup should be.

review/text: Latest Update 8/15/2012:<br /><br />I wrote a note to Kraft extolling the virtues of their great decision to keep HFCS out of their sauce.<br />Well, I got a note back saying this:<br /><br />Thank you for visiting [...]<br /><br />The formulation of BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce has indeed changed and I'm sorry you were disappointed with your most recent purchase. Your experience is important to us.<br /><br />BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce is committed to bringing the flavor you enjoy, while minimizing the impact of rising commodity costs to ensure we're providing the best possible price to consumers.  To continue delivering the barbecue sauce you love we are now using high fructose corn syrup in all BULL'S EYE Original Barbecue Sauce.<br /><br />Product made with high fructose corn syrup can be identified by the ingredient statement on the back panel of the bottle.<br /><br />Our staff works very hard to provide the best tasting and satisfying products to the preferences of most consumers. Your opinion about the product is important to us as well and I will share your comments with our product development staff.<br /><br />Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts.<br /><br />Kim McMiller<br />Associate Director, Consumer Relations<br /><br />I say write to Kraft and let them know if you're unhappy with their decision.  I would be willing to pay a bit more to purchase sauce without HFCS.<br /><br />My original review follows:<br /><br />I love the taste of Bulls-Eye! I found out that I was on my last bottle of the 'original' - I like the other flavors as well - so I went by my local grocery, and I don't know why I looked on the ingredient list, but there at the top of the list, the main ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup! I was shocked. Didn't buy it of course, because besides the taste, I also love that I don't have to eat HFCS. I then checked the bottle I had at home. Unbelievably, my older bottle had no HFCS in it at all. So I'm savoring it for as long as I can until I can find a suitable replacement. What genius at the company took a ridiculously fantastic product and decided to ruin it?! Almost every BBQ sauce out there has HFCS in it, which is why I was so happy when I found Bull's-Eye.<br /><br />If you love Bull's-Eye as much as I do, please let the company know how much you enjoyed their original non-HFCS formula. It may be that this vendor still has some of the non-HFCS bottles, but I would check first. And if you can find bottles of the old recipe online, please post it so I can buy as much as possible until I can find another with great taste and no HFCS in it.  Thanks

review/summary: Our favorite BBQ sauce, and no High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: I'm a big label reader at the store, and I must have read 30 different barbecue sauce labels looking for one that doesn't have HFCS as the first or second ingredient.  Bullseye is the only one I've found (it doesn't contain any!).  This fact, and because it tastes really good means it's the only brand I buy.<br /><br />This original flavor sauce is just spicy enough, and has a nice smoky flavor.  The Kraft website says it "doesn't contain artificial colors, flavors or preservatives."  Ingredients include real molasses, tomato puree and natural smoke flavor.  This is the type of product I'm willing to pay more for, but Bullseye isn't one of the more expensive brands.<br /><br />I signed up for automatic delivery with Amazon, and saved 15% on the cost, and got it shipped free to me as well.  With that deal, you won't find this sauce cheaper even at the big discount stores.

review/text: I came across a recipe for Skillet BBQ Steak Tips in an issue of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006PUYLY">Cook's Country</a> magazine, and it recommended Bull's-Eye BBQ sauce, so I went ahead and gave it a try.  Both my husband and I liked it more than the better-known BBQ sauce that we had been using.  It added a nice zing to the steak tips and didn't have that kind of sticky-sweet flavour of the better-known brand.<br /><br />We go through about a bottle a month of this BBQ sauce, so it's convenient to find it sold in six-packs.  I'd hate to run out, especially since I'm now using it in all of my BBQ recipes.

review/summary: what's a martini without this olive?
review/text: On this site or since there's not a review here on another site, I read that this product arrived with all the cheese dispersed in the jar. While some cheese did dissolve in the brine, the olives were jam-packed with blue cheese. I think the problem is that the cheese used is very soft. And wonderfully creamy. And I would take this product, cloudy brine or not, over what is available locally. Also I should mention that the size of the olives are quite large compared to the locally available brands and at a lower price. I have not yet signed up for any of Amazon's food subscriptions, but I might make an exception here. Those that read my reviews know that I demand quality and value, and this product hits the bullseye.

Anyway, we ordered our first tin a couple months ago, and have been reordering it from Amazon ever since.  The 1L tin will last about 3 months, depending on how much you use it.  We used it for cooking and dipping bread into.  It's the most delicious EVOO out there.  Throw out your old EVOO bottles, kids, because you've hit the best of the best.  It's buttery, extremely rich, and healthy for you.
