review/summary: Varies in quality
review/text: I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

review/summary: Mold all over! Be careful
review/text: This is my second order of Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack from Amazon due to lower price than other stores and I hit the jackpot.  You can see the pictures I upload for this product.  It has mold all over, which even can be seen from outside the bag.  Unfortunately I did not see it and put one in my mouth.  Few seconds afterward, the taste was so strange and my friend, who was about to eat, stop me from swallowing.  Try for yourself, but please be careful.

review/summary: Great product but the subscription ships old products.
review/text: I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/summary: MOLD on Jerky!!!
review/text: I bought eight packs. Seven of those, I hope, were in good condition. One of them looks darker and has mold on it. I didn't notice that after I ate two pieces... That was disgusting!! It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again.

I wish I would've gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff, but it is good.<br /><br />They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff, or I might have to go to a different brand.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

review/text: I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.

Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...

review/text: One of the most disgusting experiences of my life!  Pulled the package out, opened it without looking at it, and smelled something indescribably gross.  Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

I have a son in college so I have them sent to him. It is pricier than going to a warehouse store and buying in bulk but you are paying for the convenience of the 100 calorie packs.  I have them in my pantry at home also, and my 2 adult daughters use them for their lunches also. I would have given 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.

review/text: Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, two 10-Ounce Packages.  Arrived today and this is what I was after.  Last time I ordered their medallions and they were terrible.  These premium cuts in the Megapacks are most excellent.  Good flavor and nice texture.  Just how I like it.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

review/text: My daughter loves the A1 Steak Sauce flavor of this particular Jack Link's beef jerky.  With Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, I can make sure that she receives a care package of her favorite beef jerky at school every month.  I get a reminder that it will ship, the shipping is free and I get a discount to boot!  I can't beat it, especially since this flavor can be difficult to find in stores.

review/summary: If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find
review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

review/text: I would like to see this a few bucks less then it seems like it would be more inline with the value.  At least I can save some money and buy it on the internet  instead of at the store. This is also the best flavor based on the other ones I have tried.  in their line-up. I have tried several of them, and this is the best. As long as I can keep getting this flavor, I will keep sticking choices. This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/text: Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum.

review/summary: Wish They Were in China
review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

review/text: The wonderful flavor of Jalapeno's in this zip locked bag fills the air once it is opened. I originally purchased this package of Jack Link for snacking but found myself munching until the entire bag is empty. I first across them on store shelfs in Toledo, Ohio and have not been able to find them in any stores in the Fort Worth,Texas area (until my only other source amazon.com). I love the flavor of the Jalapeno and it is spiced just right. Jack Link is great but Carne Seca is one of the best.

Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

review/summary: Feed Raw!
review/text: The previous reviewer is obviously unfamiliar with the benefits of feeding freeze dried and raw or low processed foods. Most dogs cannot easily digest kibble and those that seem to don't get all the nutrients they are meant to have. Consider living on a diet of fast food versus cooking at home with whole foods. Your pets are meant to kill, scavange and eat whole foods, NOT ultra processed kibble! Yes it is more expensive then kibble....but it is so worth it. I have a dog with chronic allergies and digestive problems, the only thing that has helped is keeping his diet as natural as possible and supplimenting with digestive enzymes and an essential fatty acid. Please don't read the previous review and dismiss the wonderful benefits of freeze dried raw diets. Do your research, then decide which food is best for your dog.

review/summary: The Best Peppermint Gum--Sweet & Long Lasting
review/text: Ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Base, Natural Flavors (peppermint oil), Vegetable Glycerin, Gum Arabic, Soy Lecithin, Beeswax<br /><br />I usually buy the 100 count container of this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00124VRPU">Xyloburst Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 100 Count</a>, but these blister packs were $3 cheaper for 44 more pieces of gum.  Prices seem to fluctuate a lot though, but either way this is a terrific gum.  Not only does it have better ingredients than traditional gums, but it tastes better too.  Very intense at first and then mellows.  I like that it doesn't cause cavities (like sugar gums) or cancer (like artificial sweetener gums).  I had debated between this and Spry xylitol gum, but a lot of reviewers said Spry faded quickly and tasted bad. Glad I chose this instead.  Xyloburst is definitely my brand of gum from now on.<br /><br />*Spearmint flavor is also delicious <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019AH24C">Xyloburst Xylitol Gum Spearmint Blister Pack</a>

review/summary: Buy This Gum!
review/text: I am a hypoglycemic and have recently decided to respect my body's need for very low amounts of sugar so that I do not end up as a diabetic. Before beginning this new lifestyle my creature comforts were mints & gum, but because almost all of them are made with sugar / sugar alternative that raise insulin, I thought I had to give them up completely. Xylitol doesn't require insulin to metabolize so this gum is a god-sent. I love having multiple packs at once - I keep one in my purse & one at the office. Any time I need a breath freshner or a sweet treat I pop 1 in my mouth & I'm good to go! I'm so glad this gum exists.

If these didn't have 1G of xylitol I would not purchase again. 9.99 for the 12 pack was a good buy, however, I'm going to try the Spry and Epic brands next time.

review/summary: Like the Buffets
review/text: I have been trying to find a soup mix that replicates the buffet style hot and sour soup I love.  This is as close as I have come. I have tried all the mixes, the other best is the harvest 2000 mix, now a difference is harvest brand is a mix (powder), this is a paste, I don't know if that makes a difference to anybody but it did to me.<br /><br />Now for the soup, I made it like it said only ommitting the meat, I just didn't have any on hand and was excited to make the soup. Other than that I followed it closely. It taste close after making it, just a little off of my local buffet soups, so I asked a friend that actually owns a Chinese Buffet and is Chinese, he asked the ingrediants and suggested to add rice wine vinegar and white pepper to taste, I did and let me tell you it is fabulous.<br /><br />Now I won't quit going out to eat Chinese, but I do feel good knowing if I just don't have time to go out after work or something I can still enjoy resteraunt quality soup at home, thanks to this soup paste, the packet looks like a mix but when you open it there is a small plastic packet with the paste inside.<br /><br />It is very important to try before you add things, according to my friend no two chinese resteraunts make this soup the same way, they only have a few base ingrediants they build upon, different regions of the country are different and I agree after traveling it is different everywhere.<br /><br />So my suggestion is to make the soup like it says, if it isn't right I suggest adding in small amounts rice vinegar and white pepper, only to taste both are pretty strong, so go slowly, I can guarantee after trying endless soup mixes and internet recipes,this is the closest I have ever come to my local buffet, it is really good.

review/text: Ever since my favorite Chinese buffet changed hands several years ago, I've searched for a similar hot-and-sour soup recipe. I've found some decent ones during the search, but none like theirs - until now. This one may not be exactly the same, but it's close enough to do - spicy with just a bit of a tang to it. Yum! So glad my search is over. Now if my grocery store and/or Amazon will just continue to carry this ......

review/summary: Not the best taste and a time waster
review/text: Short on time? Don't like the idea of putting live coals in your mouth? Then this soup is not for you =)<br />- There's nothing in this package except for a thick spicy paste - no mushrooms, no veggies, not even a chicken broth or little pieces of chicken meat. All that you'll have to buy separately and add as you cook.<br />- Maybe I just expected too much from it but that's definitely not the kind of hot&sour soup I prefer. All you get is red burning lips and a feeling that you should probably give the rest 11 bags to your friends (maybe some of them will be able to feel any taste except the burn).<br />- My personal choice is Kikomn Egg Hot and Sour Soup - probably the most underrated on the Amazon, but it's really the best tasting one.<br />- The price is good though =) Two stars for that.

review/summary: Great Tasting Blueberries
review/text: Not too sweet, not too tart, not oily at all. These blueberries are great tasting. One reviewer talks about disappointment because the package says it contains high fructose corn syrup. I checked the labels on the ones I ordered, and it's fructose, not high fructose corn syrup. Hello? There's a big difference between the two! I've been getting these blueberries on monthly deliveries for almost a year now. None of the labels have listed high fructose corn syrup. Only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish they had smaller blueberries, which are sweeter. Some orders have bigger ones than others. But they're all sweet. When I emailed the company and asked about the size differences they told me they had no control over the blueberry lots that they get delivered. Mother nature has control. I guess they're partially right. I wish they could pick more smaller ones!

review/summary: Great for Snacking, High in Anti-Oxidants
review/text: Product: Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries (3pk of 8oz each, 1.5lbs total)<br /><br />A quick glance though my 100+ oookbook reviews will show I'm no slouch when it comes to global cuisine, and diverse ingredients. This product (both the blueberries and the cherries) marked the very first instance where I bought a dried fruit product online, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />The blueberries are evenly ripe, not overly dried out, are sulfite-free, deeply flavorful, and only lightly sweetened. They have a very light coating of oil to seal in their moisture, and prevent clumping. They're very good for snacking, and are naturally high in anti-oxidants.<br /><br />The Traverse Bay Cherries are slightly better suited for baking and sauces (due to their slightly higher moisture content), and the blueberries are mostly for snacking out of hand, and sprinking into hot cereal. Naturally high in anti-oxidants, and vitamins, they're a very healthy daily snack.<br /><br />My one small nit with this product is the use of corn syrup, rather than cane sugar, for sweeting.  Other than that, I'm happy with this product, and given that I own a vaccum sealer and plenty of glass jars with universal lids, they should have an excellent shelf life.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: The Best, Simply the Best!
review/text: I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried fruits. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />While dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites, I still really enjoy dried bluebarries. I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years and none of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried blueberries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is just a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried blueberries then look no further.<br /><br />5 Stars!

review/text: Order this brand and the JUST TOMATOES brand and this is better. They taste very similar, but this has a little more juice to it; corn syrup and oil. May not be considered healthy by others due to the high fructose corn syrup, but I'd rather have corn syrup over sugar free stuff which alters my body's ability to process sugar. If you want really dry blue berry, go for the just tomatoes brand as there's nothing added, but for a little more juice, this is the one to go for. Both are very, very good.
