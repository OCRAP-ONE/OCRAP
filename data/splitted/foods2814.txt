review/summary: Great pet treat
review/text: My cats love this! And after speaking with the staff at Whole Life about their company and products, I feel great about giving it to them. One of my cats will be 17 next month and has IBD, so I have to be very careful about what she eats--she has been doing beautifully with Whole Life Freeze Dried Chicken as her treat!

This Freeze Dried Chicken is their absolut favorite and they will fight for it. I wish it was not so costly so we could treat with larger portions.

review/summary: My cats love this!
review/text: My cats apparently LOVE the smell, taste and texture. Because THEY rate it so highly, I reserve this for a very "special" treat for my cats...say, after my one takes a pill, or lets me trim her claws.  I like it because it is all natural,100% chicken, and has no fillers. Also, my 20-year old cat has few teeth, but this is something she can chew, when I break it up into small pieces. One more thing...it is freeze-dried, and in a re-sealable plastic bag, so it does not spoil. Two-paws up!

No chemicals, fillers, etc, and they go berserk over them. No smell to contend with either. You cannot go wrong with these.

review/text: WE purchased these on line in order to save some money and because our local dealer was out of stock.<br /><br />However, the main reason for the purchase is that our two cats go crazy our there treats! I have never seen a cat salivate before, but our two do this routinely before thy are treated to the treats! And besides, these snacks are healthy for them as well.

review/summary: Most superb glaced apricots ever!
review/text: These are huge, moist, full flavored, candied whole apricots. The best version I've encountered in over 50 years of apricot appreciation. They may even be better than the ones my Great grandparents made (they were confectioners). I love these for dessert,with  cheese, to accompany ham and duckling  and just as a sweet. Each apricot is so large and satisfying that they will be a truly elegant addition to any holiday table. Given the weight and quality these are quite a bargain and far surpass ordinary candied apricots.

review/text: Original purchase was at Whole Foods Market on sale. Used it for hot tea. The product is incredible, just extraordinary taste that is unlike and exceeds your highest expectations when using honey. It is so good that I know just get plain Greek Yogurt and drizzle this on instead of any other flavoring. I put it in tea and share  and people always comment on how wonderful the Tea is. Try it and be amazed.

It's processed food with Dextrose and Sodium Nitrite so they're not for every day use.<br /><br />I see a discrepancy between what the label on the can reads and Amazons' published ingredients.<br /><br />The can reads ".....Contains 2% or less of: Dextrose, Natural Flavors, Sodium Nitrite, Garlic Powder".  Check that against what is shown here.<br /><br />We have some in our storm supplies.  They taste mediocre as always, have the same finely ground up bone, and store for about 3 years.

These are also good cooked, like in the water you boil for Ramen noodles or a couple of cans in a pot of beans or lentils;  or dump on top of a rice cooker full of rice ready to turn on for a real meal deal when it is done. These little jewels are not full of grease so you don't have a bunch of fat boiled out, also no gritty bone meal like a lot of meat products.  First class eats all the way!

review/text: Great for a filling protein snack and long storage, these little sausages are handy to have around. But to my taste they're quite salty. It makes sense since that keeps them safe to eat for a long time but it's a bit overwhelming. So I do what people used to do long ago when everything was packed in salt and soak them in water for about twenty minutes to get them just right. Once that's done they're really amazing with fried rice or scrambled eggs.

review/text: Our dog is very healthy and happy on this food! He has no digestive or skin issues and he is never sick. He's an 8 year old American Eskimo Dog. We walk him a LOT, but he still doesn't need to eat as much as the package indicates. He eats the "weight loss" amount, but he's not losing weight, he's maintaining his weight. This isn't a complaint at all, but if you're going to feed this food to an older dog or a dog with a slower metabolism, monitor their weight carefully and make sure you're not feeding too much!

review/summary: Great high quality dog food
review/text: I have two golden retrievers with hearty appetites.  Feeding them regular dog food makes them overweight.  I switched to Core Reduced Fat when I began to worry about the quality of the food I was feeding my dogs.  I had fed my dogs expensive dog foods which I got at the grocery store.  When I read the ingredients, I decied to look for something better quality.  From my research I learned that high quality dog foods prevent illness and disease and increase life-span.  Core is made with ingredients like real chicken--not chicken by-products or lots of grain.  Afterall, dogs are carnivores.  Since my dogs have been on Core they have not had the usual ear infections, skin allergies and irritations; their coats are beautiful; they have lots of energy and are overall very healthy.  The extra money I pay for this high quality dog food I definitely save at the vet!

review/text: For what it's worth, my 9lb. yorkie-poo loves this food, more than the other types of Wellness. The local Petco carries every flavor but this, so I have to order it on-line, but it is really worth it. Whenever I read about a dog having "..re-newed energy", or "...a shinier coat", I always scoff because that has never been the case with my dog. Even with the foods he loves, but with this particular type of dog food with this particular company, I have to say it's true. I tried all of the various Wellness foods, and he was okay with them, but this is the only one that he's ever really emptied the bowl, every time. That includes the Super 5 Max, or whatever it's called, the food for smaller dogs that somehow finds grains acceptable.

review/text: The pieces are VERY hard.. in fact, too hard for my 12+ year old to eat dry. I have to soak it in some beef or chicken broth in order for him to be able to eat it. I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help. I have no idea how the taste is, because I don't eat it, but I did try biting into a piece to see how hard it was and it was. My dogs seem to like it as long as it's softened for them though.

review/summary: Helped my dog loses weight
review/text: I have two basset hounds and they tend to have weight problem especially since they have a mommy that dooesn't like to see them go hungry.  I feel good giving my babies this food because this company has a good reputation and they are consistently on the many lists of good pet food by independent raters.  I feed my babies half dry kibble and half home cooked chicken, turkey, beef fresh meats, and they also get daily multivitamins.  Jake actually host 2 lbs so he will get to keep the same amount bMy problem is that they get too much treats, mainly because I give them treats every time I have to give them medication or clean their ears.  So I decrease the food amount at breakfast and dinner to make up for the daily treats.  I also add some warm water to the dry kibble and let it soften the food, then add probiotic powder when cooled, and home coooked meats and vitamins. I like this brand as well as the Blue Buffalo and the Simple Life brands.  I wish Simple Life will make weight management foods.  I like the foods that are kept in special type of metallic zip lock bags to help keep it fresh.  Make sure you check the expiration date and odor to ensure the foods are not expired or have "off" odors.

I feed my baby poodle, Milo (the almost 2 year old) and my oldest poodle, Bosco (the 13 year old) the regular Wellness Core with Chicken.  Everyone is super satisfied!  It also oddly helped with itching/scratching as well as allergies.  Did I say..  they LOVE this food?!  *smile*  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

review/summary: Wise switch from Iams Low Residue Formula
review/text: When my Rhodesian Ridgeback-mix developed mild pancreatitis two years ago at age three, my vet suggested Iams Low Residue food.  Over the last year, however, she's also developed severe skin allergies (but mostly air-borne, I think)and was losing hair in small patches so, after some research I added MSM to her diet and decided to eliminate grain. Wellness CORE Grain-Free food was the perfect choice because it is also low-fat (too much fat aggrevating her pancreas).  In the month she's been on it--both dry and wet formula--her coat has improved and she even seems perkier!

review/summary: Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!
review/text: Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is "sub-par" compared to the "very top" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: It's a miracle.
review/text: Got a shelter dog back in November... Bichon Frise.  We have been thru 7 different brands of food and also boiling chicken and rice for him as well. His digestive system is a mess, and recently we learned his pancreas  numbers were off as well. This is why we decided to go low fat.<br /><br />It has been 12 days and the improvement is remarkable. We finally have good poop. It's a miracle!  PLUS he liked it right away as well.<br /><br />I researched dozens of dog foods over the last 6 months, and recently at least 6 low fat dry foods. This one appeared to be the best, and it is definitely the best for our dog!  We are VERY HAPPY with our choice. Plus it magically comes to the door via UPS.

review/summary: GREAT Dog Food
review/text: This is wonderful food, and would recommend it to anyone with a dog needing to lose weight, with a sensitive stomach, or allergies.  I had my toy poodle on Iams for 7 years.  I never did research on dog food, the breeder I bought her from had started her on Iams, so I continued on it.  She steadily put on weight over the years, & I switched to Iams Weight Control.  After continuing to gain weight, and just generally have no energy at all, I thought it's time for a drastic change.  At this point, I did A LOT of research on dry dog food.  I wish I had done this years ago!  I came to find out, that a lot of the well know brands, do not have quality ingredients.  After lots of research, I decided the Wellness Core Reduced Fat Grain Free was our best option.  She's been on it now for 5 months, and has went from nearly 8.5 lbs to just barely over 7, and still counting.  She seems to feel so much better.  AND...she loves the food too!

I mixed with some off the shelf dry food.  No Joy!.  Finally ended dousing it with some chicken broth.  That got their attention.  Risk Reward decisions were quickly calculated and they ate.  Must do this now every time until the bag is gone.  $3.00/lb down the drain.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: one of my favorites!
review/text: I received this tea as a gift a few years ago and quickly went through the whole can of sachets.  I kept on forgetting to order more and then just recently stumbled upon a cafe that sells them so I restocked.  To my surprise, I actually believe I love it MORE a few years later than I did originally.  It's a wonderful blend of spice and a hint of sweet - but not in the sugar-sweet sense rather in the sense that it goes down "happy smooth"... definitely not an official connoisseur term but that's the only way I can describe it.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone interested in something a little spunkier than your average blend.

review/text: taste & packaging were high quality. Per Harney & Sons web site, the two products (Cinnamon Spice & Cinnamon Sunset) are EXACTLY THE SAME. Read their FAQ's & one of the first FAQ is PRECISELY about this. Unless a reviewer (AROBINSON in "Hot Cinnamon Spice" review), compared Spice & Sunset in a different package (sachet or teabag or loose leaf), there is absolutely no logical reason for the difference in taste (or PRICE!).I enjoyed the taste but felt it left a clove after-taste more than cinnamon. Seems like Harney is a quality Company with helpful info on the site but having 2 different names for the same EXACT product is strange/misleading. I am sorry I believed a review that lead me to think that there were 2 different products -- thanks! Spice and Sunset are the same product so be happy & shop by price only, same excellent taste.

review/summary: Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice
review/text: A co worker gave me a tin of the Harney and Sons Hot Cinnamon Sunset and I found it absolutely amazing! I love the taste of cinnamon and this was by far the strongest cinnamon tea I have ever encountered. I decided to try another style of the cinnamon style from Harney and Sons and I must say this one is just as delicious. This is by far much sweeter than the Hot Cinnamon Sunset. Depending on your mood you may want to switch them up. The Hot Cinnamon Sunset has a much more potent flavor and boldness to it where the Hot Cinnamon Spice is sweeter and more mild but you still get the blast of cinnamon that tastes amazing. One thing that was interesting about this product was I was dead tired when I brewed this cup of tea, and after about 10 minutes I was awake and full of energy. More than I ever have at 5am, which is when I start work. The caffeine content is the same as the other 40-60mg of caffeine per sachet. Not sure what the difference is but it was a nice change of pace to the normal hum drum of my mornings. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who enjoys the strong flavor of cinnamon. 100% A++++. On another note the metal tins they come in are beautifully designed and can function as a holder of sorts when you are done with them. I plan to keep the tins.

Since it had been a while since I'd used Tinkyada, I forgot to rinse it before adding my sauce to my aglio e olio and it was really thick and sticky, but it wasn't enough to deter us, lol.  It would have helped to cook the pasta in more water than what the package says to use and to give it a quick rinse afterwards.

review/summary: Do I call it Macaron??
review/text: I Bought the same brand product from another seller on Amazon.I was very disappointed!! the packing system works for store pick up!The way these cookies(i don't call them macarons because it dose not look like them)are packed it wont guaranteed un-damaged delivery!Beside, they are so small!they baked plain and color and flavor(artificial of course)sprayed on the cookies that makes them gooey and crumbled(Macaron should be dry and crunchy outside and creamy inside)this product is expensive just because the call it Macarons. Maybe good for gas stations for 1/5 of this price! I returned mine back!

review/text: I have tasted a lot of macaroons, but I must say these are the best I ever had. They are incredibly smooth and tasty, and I love the fact they are all natural and gluten-free. Even the macaroons from La Duree in Paris do not come close to those.

review/summary: High quality spice
review/text: This product is high-quality, organic, ground nutmeg. Its aroma is wonderful, and that flavor will be well preserved because it comes in a glass bottle. Glass is inert, meaning that unlike either a plastic bottle or a plastic-coated metal bottle, it does not leach chemicals which are both toxic and taint the flavor of a spice.<br /><br />I use nutmeg frequently for Indian cooking, cookies and pastries, and this particular brand adds a terrific flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to learn that my local supermarket does not carry nutmeg, which to me is a standard, essential spice. I was relieved to be able to find it on Amazon, and it was an extra, big bonus to discover the Simply Organic brand in this large size at a very good price.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this purchase and would buy this product again.

review/text: First of all, I won't be buying the 'regular' size sunflower seeds again, only the jumbo sized seeds.  The little ones are too much work and too little reward.  The flavor of these dill sunflower seeds reminds me of a dill pickle and I don't get a sore mouth from the excessive salt/additives, as I do with David brand sunflower seeds.  The Jumbo brand seeds are fresh and I don't get loads of broken/empty shells in the packages.  Anyway, I do recommend these over the David brand of sunflower seeds.

I don't order enough for a delivery service yet I still order a lot so this works for me.  Fantastic customer service from  "Shop by MC".  Contacted them days after I placed my order to ask them if they'd use UPS, Ontac or FedEx to deliver my water (can only use these three for delivery of large packages).  They got back to me right away to say they would.  Needless to say I'm extremely pleased with "Shop by MC" and I'll be ordering from this company again.

review/summary: Syrupy sweet, barely usable with extra vinegar added
review/text: Cascadian Farm has some great stuff out there; there's this dark chocolate granola that I swirl into fig yogurt as an amazing albeit sugar-rific dessert. They don't junk their food with corn syrup or agave that I have seen, and they are earth-friendly in their manufacturing. Living in the PNW, brands like Cascadian and Pacific Foods make perfect sense... except when they are awful. No amount of ethics and organic-everything will make me buy this again.<br /><br />"Sweet" relish should be like sweet pickles--still clearly pickles but with the bread and butter flavor instead of heavy dill and garlic. Sweet relish being key to one of my main varieties of deviled eggs, I tried this out, and oh god, how gross. What relish has WATER added? This relish. I had to drain the syrupy liquid off them and add extra vinegar, and even then, the flavor lacked any real cucumber component--just eating a piece, it's like crunchy sugar with a bit of chemical aftertaste... as if the cukes they use aren't even pickling cucumbers (which are WAY different from the long salad kind we most often get in stores)... too watery, no flavor, and sooo much sugar: 4g sugar for a tablespoon (all its calories from that).<br /><br />Maybe it's the xantham gum mixed with the sugar-water simple syrup (I checked the labels, and my old kinds NEVER had water added to relish, which makes sense if you think about how 98% of a cucumber is already water and vinegar is another key component), but it's actually more syrupy than relish I've had (ie Mt Olive) that switched over to HFCS in the era of cheapness. In fact, looking at the same serving size of Mt Olive sweet relish or sweet cubes (what I used before), they have HALF the sugar for the same amount, if that puts it into perspective considering it's a southern brand. All this contributed, once I doused it in vinegar, was the texture. Back to doing what I did before: Chopping my OWN pickles for every batch and browsing the depressing aisles trying to find cubes that aren't grossly sweet. That said, in the same trip, I DID find Wickles, which are the closest I can find up here to "Frog Balls" (which are amazing). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M7ASAI">Wickles Pickles</a> Searching for those... I see THEY have relish. I guess I'll be reviewing THAT soon *crossing my fingers* since I guess I'm always going to love southern style pickles, from the hot to the sweet, and not these sugary insults to vinegar. Cascadian, try cider vinegar and lose the mega-sugar content and water!

review/text: I must admit that I'm not a tea connoisseur, but this herbal tea was a nice change of pace from my usual chai, black, or green tea I buy at the grocery store. I first had this tea at a conference, and it was excellent. I liked how it had a sweet taste, without feeling too sugary. The pyramid teabag made for a quick, yet even steeping. I have no idea was honeybush is, but I like it. The foil bags are also very nice, because I believe it will help the teas keep their flavor and make them last longer. (The lasting longer is really important, since I just bought 120 tea bags...) It was also nice that it was a caffeine free tea, which is not always easy to find.

review/summary: My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!
review/text: When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the "chicken flavor" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended "Golden Aloe" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.

review/text: Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these "doggie crack", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!

review/summary: Natural treat our Bichon loves!  A plus for his joints!
review/text: We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!

review/text: I have a maltese and she is 11 yrs. she was limping and I took her to the vet. They said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her leg.<br />I didn't have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain. So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.

review/summary: Thank God for Zuke's Dad!
review/text: Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have "that talk".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!

review/text: My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.

review/text: I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his "golden years" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D

review/text: Having a golden retriever with allergies, I have tried so many products.  Zukes does not set off the allergies and gives my girl what she needs now that she is getting older.  She moves better now.

review/text: We've given our dog Zuke's Hip Action for about two years. She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term. The Hip Action product is working for her to keep her free from pain and very mobile. It has made a great difference in her quality of life - plus she loves getting her 'treat' every day!
