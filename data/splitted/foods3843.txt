review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I love the Senseo coffee pods. cheaper than the Bosch pods we have at work and better taste too. Simple to use and simpler to dispose the spent pods. PLUS if I really want to use the coffee outside of the pods; I simply empty 3-5 pods into a old school paper filter and I can make a entire pot of drip brew just as easily.<br /><br />I cannot understand why this system is not as popular in my area (North Eastern US)<br /><br />O-Well I guess that is OK; as I can get good deals on the pods when it is time to replenish my stockpile ;-)

review/summary: Awesome Coffee
review/text: This is by far our favorite coffee to use in the Senseo.  We discovered it in a variety pack we often ordered, and decided that we liked it so much that we needed to start ordering it by itself in bulk.<br /><br />It's awesome that both my husband and I like it so much, because he leans toward bold coffees while I tend to go a little bit mild.  I think this one would qualify as being on the more bold side of the spectrum, but not extremely so.  It also has a slightly chocolaty flavor to it somehow...  Just barely.

review/text: No, it's not Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts.  It's not even a good home brewed cup.  But for a single serving cup of coffee it isn't bad.  I know that's condemning with faint praise but I will say compared to other single serving flavors it is, to me, the closest to a very decent cup of coffee.

review/text: My husband and I have been using Senseo for about 6 years and love the frothiness.  We used the mild roast coffee until they discontinued it and we were forced to use the medium roast.  It was a little too strong for us.  We were so glad when they introduced the Breakfast Blend which we think is comparable to the mild roast.

review/text: I use this in a Keurig coffee maker, using the adaptor cup.  It works fine, and the coffee is good.  Although the Keurig is nice and convenient, it is not the cheapest way to get a cup of coffee.  Using these pods cuts the cost about in half.<br /><br />I like this dark roast and will continue to buy it.  The taste of coffee, like the taste of anything else, is a personal preference.  I like it, but you might hate it.  The pods, though, are reasonably-priced and work well with my Keurig.

review/text: My husband and I have been buying Senseo coffe pods for about 3 years. Recently, I placed 2 orders a few days apart for a total of 24 packages of this coffee.  We love the coffee, but the quality of some of the pods is disappointing.  So far, we have opened 5 packages of the first order.  Inside 2 of the packages were pods that were not fully sealed, and the loose coffee had fallen out in the packages.  If we find more unsealed pods, all of the remaining packages are going back to Amazon.

review/summary: Almost as good as Millstone pods
review/text: Our pod coffeemaker is by Krups and uses pods rather than the newer K-cups. Senseo is one of the few manufacturers still offering the pods, and while the Columbian by Senseo are good, they aren't as "rich" in flavor as the previously available Millstone Columbian Supremo pods. That said, these are the best we've found and we just hope that Senseo continues to offer these pods to fit our wonderful little coffeemaker.

review/summary: Senseo Dark Roast
review/text: Have been using Senseo products off and on for several years.  They gave me their coffee maker for promising to recommend it to ten others. They later gave me another one.  I paid shipping on each.  This Philips coffee brewer works great, and is designed much better than Black and Decker, a competing product which does the same thing.  I've found the coffee from these pods to be a little thin -- just not quite as flavorful as coffee made from freshly ground beans. Go figure.  I've tried every coffee making device on the market, and some that aren't, in search of a great cup of Joe.  I've even made my  own pods using a home pod maker, and my fresh ground coffee. The coffee is pretty good, and you can always stop the water before the coffee maker shuts it off, if you want it a bit stronger.

review/text: My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years.  We have always used the medium roast.  On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old.  Very nasty.  The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I don't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods.  These are so bad we can't even drink them.  I'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig.  VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old.

review/summary: Excellent coffee and value
review/text: This coffee, and method of preparing is simply the best. I will never go back to making pots of coffee. It's better than the K-cups because it does not fill your trash can with plastic and metal. In fact we compost ours. Besides the obvious advantage of making one cup at a time, this coffee simply tastes better. I have found friends that were not coffee drinkers but like this coffee. I brought one of these brewers aboard my last tug boat and the other crew is hooked. Everyone can put in the pod for th brew they like. Some guys insist on strong coffee and some on Starbucks. This brewer allows everyone's idiosyncratic tastes to be accommodated.<br /><br />Some people criticize the price but I have found it more economical for two reasons: for one you are not pouring any coffee down the drain. Second you only drink coffee when you want it. I usually make a full pot to get an acceptable blend/taste, and I will sit there and stare at it and drink it until the pot is finished. No more.<br /><br />The only thing this is not suited for is when you have a dinner party or more than one or two coffee drinkers. Then a pot type brewer is better.<br /><br />Another tip is to buy the extra large reservoir, this thing is cool. You will walking to the sink half as many times to refill it.<br /><br />One final tip: we have a couple of plastic universal pods. You can fill them with whatever coffee you want. We keep these around in case we run out of pods, we just throw some Cafe Bustelo in them, and we can have coffee. However with auto delivery from Amazon we hardly ever run out, unless I take a bunch out to the tug:)

review/text: We have tried several brands of coffee pads, even the local store brands in The Netherlands, but only one has the right taste and that is Douwe Egberts Senseo pads. We prefer medium. Delightful cup of coffee. Neighbors make excuses to knock on the door, because they know we invite them in for a Dutch coffee.<br />In comparison with prices, they are quite a lot cheaper in Europe. So we brought an extra suitcase loaded with 2000 Senseo pads back home. Hope prices will come down somewhat, in spite of the discounts it is a rather expensive "cup a java" in the States.

review/text: This is only coffee I can drink nowadays. And you can also vary the taste a bit yourself by either using 1 pod and hitting the "single" button on the Senseo, or use 1 pod and hit the "double" button on the Senseo.  Both ways, you still get a creamy cup of coffee ... either very strong, almost like espresso, or like a good European tasting cup of coffee.  With the Senseo coffee machine you can also stop the flow of coffee a little earlier, or hit the single button again to add a little more water without hurting the machine.  It is geared for that.  For me its the only way to go for a good cup of coffee!

review/text: Excellent product, fast delivery, excellent price (because of subscription: $23.66 for 6 bags of 18 pods). However, Amazon's current (September 2010) price (that is $3.94 per bag of 18 pods) needs to be reassessed because of dropping Euro (1Euro=$1.30). Local groceries sell bags for $5.25. However, Target dropped its price to $4.19 (or even $3.86 with $1 coupon that Target prints when two bags are purchased). $3.86 is 8 cents below Amazon's price! Amazon needs to urgently review its subscription price (September 2010).

review/summary: This stuff has turned me into a coffee addict!
review/text: I'm no huge coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is great.  Full flavor, never burnt tasting, has a chocolaty flavor, and the foam is great.  The Senseo pods are a breeze to use. It's much faster to make a cup than with the Krups machine, tastes better, and it's more environmentally friendly since they don't use a plastic container.  I suspect the dark roast is fresher than some of the other blends since it's a bit cheaper and they likely sell a ton of it, so it rotates more quickly from production to consumption.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is it could be a bit hotter, and that's to do with the machine itself.  Unless you heat up the mug, by the time your java is ready it's barely hot enough, but acceptable if you drink it right away.<br /><br />I've tried all the various combinations of one pod, two pods, the right and the left button.  I always use the single cup (left) button and one pod for the best taste.  You need to use two pods to make a full mug, but it's no big deal, so just run the process twice.  Takes less than a minute from switch-on to quaff-down.  The price for a six-pack of dark roast from Amazon is great and it just scrapes over the free shipping minimum.  Order a couple or weeks in advance before you run out.  Having a cup now as I write this...yum.

review/text: The Senseo coffee maker produces excellent coffee provided one uses third party pods rather than Senseo pods. I strongly prefer Fratello, Millstone or Halo pods which seem to have richer, more robust flavors. The Senseo pods generally produce weak coffee, in part because they do not contain enough coffee. The above brands all fit in the Senseo maker despite containing more coffee in each pod. The Senseo Espresso pods are only ok, better than some Senseo pods.

review/text: As the popularity of the Senseo pod system wanes and that of the Keurig system grows, there is diminished availability of pods that fit the Senseo. The Senseo brand pods are available on Amazon at a decent price. Unfortunately, the Senseo pods are not as good as competing brands formerly available on Amazon such as Fratello, Halo, Millstone, etc. Of the Senseo pods, the French Roast has a richer flavor than most of the others. It is often on sale and is a bargain when that happens. I suspect that the Keurig system makes good coffee, but I cannot imagine paying so much for a Keurig pod (thimble).

review/text: I have been a Senseo coffee lover since 2004.  This has been the best cup of coffee I have found.  On my last trip to Europe I brought a suitcase full of Senseo Coffee Pods back with me.  They are much cheaper in Europe.<br /><br />The coffee in the pods is not the same as in the past.  It's no better than the cheap coffee in the can you get at any grocery store.  I like a full bodied dark cup of coffee, and that's what I used to get in the Senseo Dark Roast.  Now it tastes like dishwater.  I like brewing one cup at a time so I ordered the aftermarket filter insert so I can use ground coffee.  If it doesn't work as advirtised, I'll get a different coffee brewing system.<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Why can't companies leave well enough alone.  If Sara Lee needed to make a bigger profit margin, raise the price, don't change the quality.

review/text: I don't know if the packs I had were old  (although they are stamped 06 18 11 so it seems fresh enough) or poorly stored or if it was just the coffee, but I was very disappointed with the coffee it produces.  It was weak, and bitter.  And did not have the same sort of buttery texture that can be produced with Sumatra pods for example.  I have an older model at home and the new model at work with an espresso holder.  The newer model makes a slightly but noticeably better coffee.  In neither case will you get an actual espresso but is a far cry better than drip coffee.  So far I have found the Sumatra blend pods provide the best results for those who are trying to get the texture and flavor of espresso.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: Having a one-cup coffee maker is the best coffee I have found, and you don't have to stand in line.<br /><br />You have a choice of 4 or 8 ounce dispensing of water through the pods, and strong or regular coffee comes out smelling so wonderful, and tasting as good.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I just replaced my old Flavia SB100 with the commercial Grindmaster opod.<br />This medium blend is the first pod coffee I've tried. It was<br />a very good cup of coffee; hands-down better than all of the Flavia's<br />I've tried. Part of the difference may just be the machine. I love the<br />Grindmaster's hotter water. I intend to try other coffees that were<br />recommended to me, but I could easily just buy the medium blend<br />all the time and really enjoy it.

review/summary: Like liquid crack
review/text: I love Espresso.  So what is better than a $10,000 commercial machine??  PODS!  This Espresso is really good, even though it is from a Pod.  It doesn't give the Crema like an expensive Espresso machine does, of course, but it tastes great!

review/summary: Great Sumatra Flavor & Easy On The Stomach!
review/text: I have always been an avid coffee drinker, but after gastric bypass surgery I've had little tolerance for my old brands.  My sister turned me on to Senseo and their Sumatra blend, and I am a very happy coffee drinker again.  This one has very nice flavor and less of the acid of my old favorites.  I'll be sticking with this one now that I've found it!

review/summary: Best Dark Roast for the Price
review/text: I have tried several other dark roast products for my Senseo. While the others are also quite good, I have come back to this product for the long term. The Douwe Egberts Dark Roast has been consistently good and I use it every day. The fact that it costs less then the other dark roasts I have tried is an added bonus.

review/summary: Espresso by another name
review/text: I started using this product by purchasing it at my local store.  The pods fit great in my espresso machine although I use it to make lattes.  Local store no longer carries it and I had concern if the product would continue to be around.  I bought the six pack as that will give me 96 lattes and the price was right.  As for using as it is intended, I don't know.

review/summary: Senseo coffee pods
review/text: Senseo is my favorite coffee and it is increasingly hard to obtain the pods in my area, especially my favorite flavor, Sumatra.  I was pleased to find it available at Amazon at a price less than the Senseo Company website,, with free shipping included.  I am pleased to know that there is a supplier for the coffee that makes it a pleasure to rise each morning.

review/summary: Kona Coffee Blend (10% Kona)  - Senseo Coffee Pods
review/text: I was very disappointed in the Kona Coffee Blend. It is bitter, does not have a smooth taste and leaves a metalic after-taste in your mouth. Anyone looking for the Kona experience will not find it with this blend ... perhaps a blend that has more than 10% Kona would be better.

review/text: I use a Grindmaster OPOD brewer.  These pods contain less coffee than other pods I've used(Fratello, Juan Valdez, Community).  I like a stronger cup of coffee.  This yeilds a smooth cup of coffee, but lighter than I prefer.

review/summary: I'm glad I tried them!
review/text: I have been using Senseo for years and I love it.  I saw that they came out with these new Espresso pods and thought, "Why not?  The darker the better."  So...I ordered them and I have thoroughly enjoyed them.  Actually, even as I write this review I am drinking a cup using one of the pods.  Of course it's not toally like a "real" espresso, but it's strong, bold, and makes me think twice about stopping at a coffe place rather than just coming home to make my own.

review/summary: What I've been searching for
review/text: The pod brewing system was the answer to my search for a way to brew my 1-2 cups of coffee a day with consistent repeatable results. Then, after trying several different blends, I found breakfast blend to be the perfect cup for me. Rich and flavorful, yet smooth and mellow. It's so good I don't even want to try other blends. Day after day I'm treated to the same delicious coffee to start and sometimes end my day. I'm rarely this satisfied with any product. Great stuff!
