review/text: My husband is from the UK and this is the only espresso coffee he loves (and he considers coffee to be a food group, so this is highly important to him!).  We were thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a reasonable price.  It's saved us from driving 1 hour (round trip) to a store that *might* have it in stock.

review/summary: My search continues for the perfect Italian espresso
review/text: Caf&eacute; Tazza sells Lavazza coffee in Atlanta airport (terminal B).  It was wonderful and did not have the "burnt bean after taste" of Starbucks.  And so I tried Lavazza Qualita Rossa Caffe Ground Espresso.  Unfortunately, it was either not the same espresso that Caf&eacute; Tazza sells or my machine is not professional enough to brew it the same.  Starbucks espresso is black, oily, aromatic and rich when compared side-by-side to the brownish, and dry Lavazza Qualita Rossa Caffe Ground Espresso.  I don't like Starbucks espresso but still prefer it to this one.  Further, we just got back from Italy.  Every street had wonderful espresso that we want at home. And so, my search continues for the perfect Italian espresso.<br /><br />Recommendations anyone?

review/summary: The Robusta Difference
review/text: I started drinking coffee and chicory in New Orleans when I was a kid and didn't know water was used for anything else.  Over the years, I somehow became an Arabica bean snob, so I hesitated to give this coffee a try.  After all, it is 30% Robusta, and we of the Starbuck's generation know those aren't the best beans.  I was wrong.  If you are an Arabica snob, like I was, you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try.  I think it will change the definition of bold for you as it did for me.  The package says this is a medium roast, but don't be fooled - this is strong, tasty coffee at its best.

review/text: I have a Mr Coffee espresso machine so that pretty much tells you what level I am at when it comes to making espresso.  My wife bought some cheap grind espresso from IKEA and it was awful.  Decided that I should try some better stuff before giving up and selling my soul to Starbucks.  Read all of the reviews and decided to buy this stuff.  I could not be happier.  The coffee has none of the bitterness that some other brands had that I tried.  Every sip brings back memories of trips to Europe.<br /><br />This is definitely my new coffee and will be sticking with it as long as I own an espresso maker.

review/summary: Best Coffee I have ever tasted!
review/text: After years of drinking many different blends of American Coffees this coffee was suggested to me by my Italian friend who lives in Italy. It is said to be "Italy's Favorite Coffee." . I tried the beans and the ground. I was overjoyed with both. Robust, yet round and smooth on the tongue with a clean non bitter finish. I set my Cuisinart Grind and Brew for early a.m. so I can wake to freshly made Lavazza. I have kept Amazon.Com busy with my ordering of coffee supplies. Now I am on a discounted subscription with Amazon.Com. At one time this coffee was not in stock for a while; therefore I was not going to take a chance of running out of my special coffee-something that makes me look forward to getting out of bed early each morning to enjoy my Lavazza while watching the sun come up. What a wonderful way to start my day. !

review/summary: Great aroma, rich body and lingering aftertaste...
review/text: I decided to try Lavazza given the many enthusiastic reviews and the fact that this Qualita Rossa is Italy's bestselling coffee. The wonderful scent that emerged upon first opening the brick packaging in the kitchen was overwhelming and took barely ten seconds to engulf the living room too! I mainly drink espresso using fresh-ground coffeebeans and I wouldn't be able to pick out this Rossa from my own fresh-grounds as a prepackaged ground coffee. The scent is that awesome.<br /><br />I brewed it using an espresso machine and a moka pot. In both cases I got one of the blackest espressos ever with a heady aroma that simply dominated the entire airspace! It tastes delicious too, with a richer body than illy (the only other ground coffee I take). However the strong aftertaste didn't agree with my tastebuds. It lingered on for so long and had an astringent effect on my tongue that I needed to use a tongue-cleaner to clear its traces.<br /><br />I had been drinking 100% arabica and this Rossa is the first time I'd returned to a robusta blend in a long while. I would attribute that strong aftertaste to the robusta beans. There is none of the velvety feeling on the tongue I get from drinking illy.<br /><br />This is still a great coffee though and I can see why it is so well-loved in Italy and the rest of the world. NB: It is a very strong blend and it not for the faint-hearted! I will definitely try Lavazza's Qualita Oro someday. That is 100% arabica (sweeter as promised by Lavazza) and probably more suited for my personal tastes.<br /><br />No regrets about trying this Rossa though. The aroma is worth the price of admission alone!

review/summary: LOVE Lavazza, but CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE!!!!
review/text: We have been drinking this coffee since we were introduced to it by our Italian-born brother-in-law.  It is simply the best, especially when made with the stove-top espresso maker.  I subscribe to this through Amazon and have been happy with it until my latest shipment.  BE SURE TO CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PACKAGE!!!!  The package clearly states "best if used by date shown on bottom of the package", and we received a shipment that had April 2010 date on the bottom...yes, packages that have expired for ONE YEAR!  When I called customer service, the lady tried to tell me that it was incorrect, that the date printed is the manufactured date, not the expiration date.  This is not true, as fortunately, I still had one package left at home, with a future date printed on the bottom.  Love Amazon and love Lavazza...but be sure to check the dates!

review/text: I've been buying ribeye steaks at a nation-wide store which will remain nameless.  A steak is a steak, right?<br /><br />Hubby was dying to try Omaha steaks, so I bought him a box as a present.<br /><br />I cooked up two steaks - both ribeyes, one Omaha and the other from the store.  I cooked them both with steak dust, for the same time and the same temperature.<br /><br />The Omaha steak was like butter.  The difference was so obvious.  I can't believe that both steaks came from the same species.<br /><br />This is now a once-a-week dinner in our house.  It's not cheap, but it's still less than going out.  Add to the steak the Omaha stuffed potatoes and a nice salad and you've got a dinner that's every bit as nice as the average restaurant.<br /><br />Yeah.  They're worth it.

review/text: My first Amazon preview AND how strongly NEGATIVE i feel about manufacturer deception.<br />The claim that each cannister has 50g of coffee is pure fiction and is actually more like 25g if not less!Upon opening my first can the coffee was way below the halfway mark, and the second... In effect I got less than 25g of coffee.The fact that no one has called the maker out on this fiction really surprises me and I intend to correct this anomaly.After buying this item, I wanted to buy the "Africafe Instant Coffee Large Tin - 250 Grams" (it was already in my cart) but due to this deception I would advise anyone to not buy this product.<br />Since I opened two tins, in all good conscience I will not return the items: but by the same token I will not buy this item again. one star or less for manufacturer peddling fiction.

review/summary: it's almost like heaven
review/text: Have tried it. Delicious!!!!! I think I'm in love. I've liked miso soup for many years but wheat and soy issues forced me to seek out alternatives. What a serendipitous find! The flavor and texture of this brand say 'old world is better.' After researching miso for its health benefits, I don't eat miso soup occasionally anymore. Studies at Nagasaki indicate it is protective against radiation sickness and cancer--possibly because of its alkalizing nature. It is nourishing and full of probiotics. South River Miso is a fabulous, delicious part of my morning and late afternoon routines. I chop 2 shitake mushrooms, mince a bit of green onion, ribbon cut a few leaves of spinach, add 1 t. dulse or a bit of ribbon cut nori, and 1/3 of a small red pepper into my oversized mug and pour 1 c. boiling water over. In a separate dish, I mix 1 1/2 t. chick pea, adzuki, red pepper miso, or a combination with 3/4 c. room temp distilled water and a dab of chili paste. I take a couple spoons of hot soup and pour it over the miso, then mix the miso into the soup. Now I don't feel hungry at all between meals. All that in less than 3 minutes and only 20 calories or so--it's almost like heaven.<br /><br />It may be cheaper at the company website, but if you can get PRIME shipping the savings is a wash.

review/text: I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live--I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.<br />The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes--a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff--and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better). Honestly I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. As an Italian food fan, I was pretty satisfied with this gift. If you don't want to leave the house or what to stay home to watch the game, it's a perfect gift. Do I recommend their food and services? Absolutely! Giving gifts like these are a good idea for single people like me, so I am thinking returning the favor and sending these to some people I know for the upcoming holidays.

review/text: I recently joined the dinner of the month club and I am so glad I did! It may be the best gift I've ever given myself:) My entire family reaps the benefits because it is a treat for everyone, no matter age or gender. We always look forward to the arrival of a new and exciting pasta in the mail every month. We even have a tradition now in our house that we all cook dinner together on "pasta night" and enjoy a savory dish provided by the dinner club.<br />It is so easy to make an impressive dinner with dinner club because they even send recipes to go along with their noodles and sauces! I recently received the Vegan Pumpkin pasta fettuccine paired with the Butternut Squash with Parmesan Cheese. I also got the Italian Spice Linguini with the Organic Roasted Garlic sauce. Even just boiling the noodles warms your home with a delicious fragrance. Everything I have ever received from Flying Noodle has always been of the highest quality. I have friends over to play dominoes every Tuesday night and I always brag about my Flying Noodle packages. They have tried most of my dishes and always want to know where they can get the noodles and sauces at our local grocery store. There is just nothing like it that you can buy from the store, I have since gotten all of my domino friends on Flying Noodle- dinner of the month club.<br />I definitely know where to go to do my Christmas shopping this year! There is something for everyone and I know I can trust Flying Noodle to deliver the best quality of products to my loved ones.

review/text: Polar jarred fruits used to come from Mexico.  They are now coming from China.  I can attest that these strawberries do taste very delicious, but I am concerned that Chinese regulation is still weak, and that pesticides and hormones are being overused on a large scale (see the story on exploding watermelons from 2011).  I have also noticed that when they started coming from China, the price dropped; something wrong with a product being shipped all the way across the Pacific, and being cheaper than coming across a land border from Mexico.

review/summary: The closest to real homemade stock
review/text: I've tried more than ten different brands. I've tried things billed as "stock" and things billed as "broth." I've tried powdered and cubed and pastes and the liquid in a box. So one day I tried these.<br /><br />I was totally shocked. The flavor was large and complex, not overly salty, and the most like real homemade chicken stock of anything I've tried.<br /><br />The packs look about like what you would find in a BBQ dipping packet from a fast food restaurant, and are about the same size. It comes out of the pack gelatinous, just like real stock is when it is cold (though I suspect some industrial food magic is involved there). It gradually dissolves in the hot water. I found that it dissolved completely with no difficulty.<br /><br />I have so far used it to flavor grains when cooking them, in a slowcooker with roasted chicken, and as soup. Delicious every way. Highly recommended.

review/text: This is an excellent stock! I am so very pleased with the simplicity of preparation and the taste. For those who are salt restricted, this may not be the product for you. There is 730 mg of sodium in one cup once prepared. That is very high. Knorr should consider producing a low sodium stock. I purchase many products by Knorr and I have yet to be disappointed. I made a chicken noodle soup. Thanks to the stock, the soup is delicious. I even boiled my noodles using one of the containers of chicken stock. This definitely added to the flavor of the soup. So, if you are not salt restricted, purchase it. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I was going to buy this product here at Amazon but when I found it at my local supermarket on sale for $2.99 (as opposed to $8.17 per package here on Amazon), I bought it.  In short, this is a great product and VERY economical.  Overall, it has a very good flavor and did not have that artificial or tinny taste that some do.<br /><br />As stated above, I found this on sale.  Its regular shelf price was $3.99.  So, where the $32.69 (for 4 packages) comes from, I have no idea.  It is, also, really economical and "green" minded.  Each little tub, reconstituted as suggested on the package, yields 3 1/2 cups of stock.  That is one ounce short of 2 cans of broth from the grocery store and 4 ounces short of one of those 32 ounce cartons.  So, one little package represents almost 8(!) cans or 4 packages and taking up a small fraction of the shelf space.  Also, this is stock, not broth.  So, there is a more complex flavor profile.  Bravo Knorr!!!<br /><br />Maybe someone here at Amazon will wake-up and realize that no one in their right mind will purchase this product...not when they can buy it at their local store for less than half of the regular price.

review/summary: chicken *littles*
review/text: I recently found this Knorr Homestyle Stock when looking in the soup aisle for my favorite chicken broth; I noticed that this says "stock" instead of broth and decided to take this home to compare the two. Turns out there is no comparison as this is definitely more akin to stock than a simple broth so comparing would be more of an apples to oranges kind of thing.<br /><br />This concentrated stock comes with four little packs slightly larger than those little creamers you get at diners with your coffee. The texture is a little gelatinous straight out of the container but melts quickly when mixed with very hot or boiling water. I wouldn't say this tastes "homemade" exactly, but it does have a very good balance of flavors that taste like it's been made with the traditional mix of onion, carrots, and celery, not just a boiled bird.<br /><br />This stock makes a nice start to something as simple as chicken soup without needing a whole lot of doctoring up. I tried this reconstituted with just noodles added and it definitely tasted more like chicken noodle *soup* as opposed to when I've made the same with just broth which tasted a little dishwater plain. To me, this tastes much better than bouillon cubes as well. Other pluses:<br /><br />Very convenient - my usual broth comes in large packages which are bulky and heavy in comparison. Much more efficient to store in the pantry (about 5.5 in x 2in).<br /><br />Earth Friendly: This is also a pretty "green" product; much less energy spent packaging and transporting these tiny containers than cans or aseptic packages.<br /><br />Easy substitution - most of my recipes are able to use stock or broth interchangeably.<br /><br />One small quibble is the salt content; my broth was a lower sodium version so I'll have to watch and make adjustments to added salt in my recipes. Not a deal breaker for me though.<br /><br />I can find this locally so I always compare prices first.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and recommended except for those with salt restrictions.

review/summary: Tough! Dont know how I lived without these!
review/text: Nice hard but flexible rubber.  Easy on and off.  Fits cans perfectly.  Will not break.  These are the highest quality lids I have ever seen.  Worlds away from those cheap plastic lids that crack and break over time.  Throw away all your other lids.  If you buy these you will be so glad you did!  Comes 2 lids in a set and well worth the price.

review/summary: Fit great and very flexible
review/text: So far I am very happy with these pet food can covers.  Unlike my plastic lids that cracked, these are very flexible and I don't think cracking will be a problem.  Theses lids fit two sizes of cans, my 13.6 ounce dog food cans and my 5.5 ounce Friskies cat food cans.

review/summary: The best pet food lids ever
review/text: I've had every type of cover for cat food cans -- these are without doubt the best. It's the material that makes them great. They're so flexible and they grip and seal well. That makes them easy to get on and off, as well as easy to wash. I don't really understand the spoon slot. I've never used it. But it doesn't hurt that it's there. I've had a few of these lids for a couple years. They are my go-to. I might as well just throw out the other lids. I just ordered more of these today.

review/summary: nice quality rubber plastic, but pricey and the slit in the lid is ridiculous
review/text: Bought these at p******direct for around $3.50 - if you can find them for that price for the smallest size, then they are a good purchase as the smaller size of this brand will fit the 3 oz. cans of cat food and the rubbery plastic of the lids really lasts without cracking.  I hate the slit in the lid, which is one of the dumbest ideas ever as it ruins the great seal that this lid would otherwise have - however if you never use the slit, the lids will stay sealed enough to hold up to normal usage for a decent amount of time.  Without the slit, these lids would probably last for years and be a terrific buy; with the slit you are better off just buying regular petfood lids from the grocery store for the 5.5 oz. and 12 oz. petfood cans (especially at this price).  So 2 stars removed for the sheer stupidity of the slit in the lid (not to mention the ridiculously high price).

review/summary: Exactly What I needed
review/text: For whatever reason we have been using Tin Foil to cover the cat food cans for years. Finally it dawned on me to purchase actual lids. After reading many reviews of lids on amazon we settled on these and good thing we did. First, these are real rubber, soft and easy to put on and take off. They have large pull tabs on the side that make it easy to take off. They fit the large cans and small ones (they have a inner ring for the smaller cans) and the seal is tight. I put them in the top shelf of the dishwasher and they hold up just fine. After a few months they look and work as good as new. They shipped fast and arrived undamaged.

review/text: These lids were just what I was looking for.  They're nice, heavy rubbber and easy to get on and off.  AND they held up to a bit of chewing from my puppy who got one the other day.  If it was a plastic lid I'm sure it would have been ruined by the time I realized she had it.  Not one tooth mark on this lid.  They're a bit pricey and I would prefer not to have the spoon slot on them but they FIT the dog food cans which is more than I can say about the Hartz Mountain ones I purchased several months earler.

review/summary: Sweet and yummy
review/text: The taste is lovely and mild.  I have had some barrels that contain a strong herbaceous flavor.  This is not that category.  The<br />flavor is true root beer, and does not fade.  I can only describe the flavor as sweet, mellow.  These barrels are smaller than some<br />others and fit in your mouth easily.  My only beef was with the wrapping.  For some reason the paper stuck to the barrel in little,<br />easy to miss spots.  I ended up with unpleasant shards of plastic in my mouth and got my fingers all sticky and sugary trying to retrieve the tiny masses.  But the taste was so good, there is not one single barrel left.

review/summary: A Good Deal, If They're Priced Right
review/text: These were a decent value purchased at $6.99. While not *quite* as flavorful as I might have hoped, they were still tasty and sweet and everything you'd expect them to be. Oddly enough, they were oval-shaped, as though they'd all gotten squished slightly during production. Of course this doesn't affect their taste or quality, but it's curious nonetheless.<br /><br />I'd probably buy again, but I might also try another brand just for comparison. If you don't already have a preferred brand, these are worthy of a try.

review/text: We are orginally from the Midwest and have grown up with Calumet. In the Southwest after over 20 years it is now impossible to get here. We tried the famous baking soda company brand and knew we trust them and it has no Aluminum! Okay my cake fell! (Been baking this cake for 30 years) So I tried a famous Southern brand it worked just okay but the rise still was not normal. So I ordered a case before I started believing I could no longer bake. Cake baked up perfectly. 24 cans is a lot to order so all my friends and neighors will never have to worry about their cakes falling.

review/summary: Calumet Baking Powder is best
review/text: I have used Calumet Baking Powder all my life, along with my mother before me.  It is the only baking powder that works correctly in backing.  It is because of the stabilizer.  For some crazy reason, the grocery stores are no longer carrying Calumet, so I've had to try all the others.  They all foam up and cause the rising to fail.  The consistency of the baked goods is not right with them.  I'm so happy I can get Calumet from Amazon.  I thought I would have to give up baking.

review/text: What is there to say?  KMR has been around forever because it is one of the best,  I just keep it in the fridge once open and it last a couple days worth of feedings. Great as a supplement during the transition to solids too.  Just remember milk replacers are species specific for a reason.  KMR is much richer than the puppy milk replacer so it is best not to substitute for a different species unless it is an emergency situation.

review/summary: This is the best seaweed/salad!!!
review/text: This is basically a salad in a bag. I pour about half of it into a medium sized ceramic bowl and add distilled or filtered water to about 1" above the dried greens. Then I wait for about 15 mins. I will taste one ribbon of seaweed to make sure it has absorbed enough water. If it hasn't, I mix it and wait another minute.  Then I pour off the extra water. I then add some soy sauce and rice vinegar (to taste) and mix. Serve. Makes about 2-3 servings.<br />It is really tasty! My friends who wouldn't dream of eating just seaweed are amazed at how good it is. The first time I ever ate this was at a high end sushi place in Tokyo, since I live in the States, I was really glad when I found this!

I ordered on 6/13 and it took until 7/2 to get here. Really, 3 weeks? I'm on Prime and am used to getting my items ~2 business days later. I don't expect everything to get here that fast, but 3 weeks is ludicrous. I ordered a few days before I ran out of the old brown rice, then was out of brown rice for two and a half weeks waiting for these guys to ship it.

review/text: This is pretty strong stuff - if you are not nuts about garlic I would stay away...far away. My entire desk smells like garlic now, ha. The flavor reminds me of garlic bread at an Italian restaurant. There is a little salt on them too, which is great. The pistachios themselves are super fresh and crunchy. If you like garlic AND pistachios this is for you. The onion is very subtle, more of an after taste.<br /><br />One recommendation for Fiddyment Farms would be to dial back the garlic a bit...just a bit, to attract non-garlic fiends. Otherwise, this is a supreme product.

review/summary: Cats LOVE it.
review/text: I have 6 cats, all rescue and it's been really hard to find a food that all of them will eat, but they all love Fussie Cat.  From the research I've done, it's a high quality food, manufactured in a human food plant.  This is one food that a human can look at an actually identify as fish and/or chicken. I buy all three flavors for my fur kids and have it on the subscription plan now.  I used to buy it at a pet food warehouse many miles away.  With the Amazon subscription plan (and free Prime shipping) it's cheaper to have it delivered to my front door and I can speed up or delay delivery according to my needs, too.  Fussie Cat is a winner in my house.
