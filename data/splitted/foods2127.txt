review/text: Torani Sugar Free syrups are a staple in our house!  Caramel and English Toffee are my favorites, but I also keep Peppermint, Orange, and Hazelnut on hand.  Pineapple and Coconut are good, but not very strong so I don't use them as often.  We use it to flavor hot cocoa, coffee, smoothies, plain yogurt, you name it.  If you're watching your diet, this is a must have!  DIY Starbucks drinks are a breeze with these syrups (in fact, I think this is the brand Starbucks uses for its own sugar free syrups).

review/text: The Holiday Collection arrived safe and sound - well packaged, thank goodness!  The product arrived quickly, too - faster than I expected.  Flavors are wonderful, but customers might want to know that for 'sugar free', they are very, very sweet.  One pump of the syrup was MORE than enough to flavor my protein shake!  Given my sparse use, they will last a long time!  :)

review/text: Yikes is about all I can say for this bundle.  I bought this bundle as part of the Black Friday week and though it would be a great addition to our morning coffee routine.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />The flavors of these syrups (at least the ones I've tried) is pretty nasty. We were so looking forward to adding the Gingerbread syrup to our coffee, which we never finished after adding it.  Yes, it is that bad.  It left a metallic flavor in my mouth.  My wife is a huge coffee fan along with creamers and flavors, but 4 of these still sit unopened on our counter with the 2 that were opened, not going down at all.<br /><br />Next time we will go with the sugar ones.

Thought a Holiday Pack would include more exotic mix like Pumpkin or Cinnamon Sugar.  Yes, it is cheaper to order a 6 pack but next time I'll just order individual bottles.

review/summary: Excellent Flavors At Lowest Delivered Price
review/text: I make my wife and myself a frozen coffee drink daily with the Mr. Coffee Frappe' Machine.  I normally use the flavors in this group except for the gingerbread and the peppermint.  I've been sourcing the flavors, other than the two I've noted, at my local Wal-Mart.  I'm happy to say that these bottles are more than double the size at well under 2x the Wal-Mart price for a net price that is a lower cost than Wal-Mart ( they're not badly priced at Wal-Mart, but the Wal-Mart price has crept up and the bottles are getting smaller - plus WM isn't committed to keeping these in-stock).  If you use these flavors this pack is absolutely the way to go and Amazon's fantastic delivery is the icing on the cake making it easier than going to the store only to find that one or more of these flavors are not in-stock.  Amazon rocks here!  Even better get on the subscription delivery service if you use these steadily and you'll never run out and you can adjust the delivery frequency at any time to more manage your current needs; it'll save you even more time and money.  I do want to say one thing, out of all of these flavors I find them universally well done except for the peppermint.  I like chocolate mint frappes' and I must admit I enjoy just the littlest drop of McCormick's Peppermint extract versus a splash of Torani sugar-free peppermint.  I still love this group and will buy it, but I'll be likely, in time, disposing of left-over peppermint unless they get a new mixture on it.  This is the only reason I give this group 4-stars instead of 5-stars.

review/summary: Not Bad for the lightning deal price
review/text: Got the holiday variety pack in the fall, figuring they would go great with the warm coffee that is all about comfort on cool fall/winter days. I really wanted some variety of flavors to add so that its not the same old same day in and day out and this package deal was a nice variety. Just some background, I have tried Torani SF caramel, SF chocolate, SF french vanilla, SF raspberry before from the local store. I have also tried SF pumpkin spice. I always get the sugar free versions to help cut down on calories and sugar...after all abs are made in the kitchen!!!!<br /><br />I have tried these SF syrups in a variety of ways. Some examples are gingerbread SF syrup with a gingerbread flavored coffee. Peppermint SF syrup with my regular dark coffee and the holiday special peppermint flavored coffee creamer (another time with 1 tbsp cocoa, 1 tbsp peppermint creamer and milk for a peppermint mocha type drink)...Ive tried them in tea, homemade plain greek yogurt and so on... I even added a few ounces to some sugar free pudding (same flavors as the added syrup)... there really is no end to how to use them and I think taste is subjective so you have to try many out and see which you like and which you dont. My personal favorites were the peppermint mocha and the vanilla added the greek yogurt. I also liked adding an ounce or so of the SF chocolate (not in this variety pack) to a diet coke (next time I want to add a squirt of that new mio or equate sugar free cherry drink mix to make it a diet chocolate cherry coke...LOL) SF Raspberry is also a personal favorite of mine.... perfect in my greek yogurt or green tea!!!!<br /><br />Would I buy the holiday variety pack again...sure... they last a long time and keep well... so if you have enough space in your pantry... and the price is right (I like to pay about .18-.25 cents per oz max)... go for it... trying them out I suggest splitting your order with a family member or friend. Just make sure to get or save some extra bottles for your friend.<br /><br />As for the sugar vs the sucralose sugar free versions... I have found that most are comparable to the real deal sugar versions, but nothing beats the real deal. I think it is because the sugar versions have a thicker texture to them and it works better in liquid than the sugar free version that is not thick at all. But I do not want to add excess sugar to diet so I avoid it, especially if there is a no calorie sugar free alternative like Torani SF Syrups.<br /><br />I wish Torani would included sample sachets of various flavors attached to their regular size bottles (ketchup/mustard packets are called sachets) ... even at a few cents increased price for the sample I think most consumers would like this idea as it would give them an idea of what flavor to try next.<br /><br />Are the sugar free versions really healthier or safer than the sugar versions... well that is up for total debate, but let me say this as long as you keep your artificial sweetener use at moderate levels I feel they are safe for long term use as per the studies ive read. Those studies showed them to be safe at even EXTREME levels of use....we are talking in the hundreds and hundreds of servings per day for the average human... so even at a moderate use of 5-10 servings (say 1-2 diet sodas, 2-3 coffees with a few ounces of SF Torani and some splenda in your green tea or something) you are well within the low to moderate use range for humans. Is this low risk better than having a few hundred extra grams of sugar/carbs per day that will screw up your insulin sensitivity, increase triglycerides, lower HDL, increase LDL, make you fat, give you extreme sugar highs and lows and really increase your risk of diabetes.... to me the low long term health risk of sugar free alternatives are better than the high health risks of increased sugar consumption....

review/text: So I bought these to spice up my coffee.  Some taste good with coffee and some taste very artificial.  I use the hazelnut and gingerbread for coffee.  My SO uses the vanilla.  I put these in tea or protein shakes because I think they blend better with milk or something with texture.  I'm glad that they are sugar free.  I know regular syrups like the ones they use in starbucks are LOADED with calories and make it a meal instead of a drink.  Kinda defeats the purpose of drinking coffee with a healthy breakfast.  I haven't used the peppermint because I'm not a fan of minty things.

review/summary: Mostly good flavors in this pack
review/text: Gingerbread was a little disappointing, is more like nutmeg to me than gingerbread. I use less of this one than most. Not a fan of the caramel in general. Peppermint and chocolate combo works great in coffee or vodka. vanilla is versatile and makes a nice soda or coffee (or vodka, with a maraschino cherry to boot). Overall, I'm a big fan of Torani syrups. The regular sugar ones are definitely truer tasting, but I get the sugar free when I can. If I'm using fat-free milk in my cappuccino, I don't want to dump a bunch of sugar in. I find that when using the sugar free varieties, you should use less syrup to avoid the artificial sweetener taste from coming through. Yes, it's a tad less flavorful, but it works bet. After all, you want to taste whatever you are flavoring not just the syrup.

review/text: So, I get the variety pack from Costco.  It comes with strawberry, pears, and apple.  I get it because it actually ends up being pretty cheap compared to here.  I find it there for around $12 for a 20 pack.  I can say that strawberry is my family's favorite because of the immense flavor it has packed in the fruit chip.  I do agree with the other review that there is a lot of powder it seems in the strawberry, but I definitely think that it is because of how fragile it is.  If you have ever tried Gerber freeze dried stuff, the apple and pear I would think is comparable to that.  Which I mean it isn't anything super interesting about it.  They are all good though, I just personally think that the strawberry is the best.  I wish that I could have tried the pineapple, considering that seems to be a interesting flavor too, but I haven't found it anywhere other than here.  If anyone knows where to buy these individually boxed elsewhere for cheaper, I would love to know.  I definitely have suggested this to my family members, and luckily they are Costco members so it isn't a problem if price.  I hope this helps a little.

review/summary: "Fresh Mixers" to "Lunch Express" Not Good For Consumers
review/text: Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former "Fresh Mixers" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to "Lunch Express," apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.

I suggest taking the instructions off before you take off the seal as this will help prevent noodles from flying every where :)  The chicken in this can some times be chunky so you may want to mix it in after the noodles are cooked and heat it for another minute.  I find the chicken to be cold other wise.  I also have these in my disaster my closet as we are prone to tornadoes in our area and these will keep.

review/text: Got these for a change of pace when it comes to packing my lunch for work. My usual fare is either an Easy Mac Bowl or a Lean Cuisine, so I wanted to try something like a Lean Cuisine that didn't require it to be kept frozen. Seemed like a good idea.<br /><br />Firstly, it doesn't appear as though you get much. There was some penne pasta but it doesn't seem like much and it's really not. I guess for the amount of calories per serving it's fine, but I was still hungry after eating it. The sauce is a bit on the sour side. Now, being a born and bred italian, I despise sickly sweet pasta sauce one often finds as you move west through the country, but this was even too sour for me. The chunks of chicken were laughable, i probably wouldn't have even known it was chicken had I not been looking for them and ruled out every other piece of food I *could* identify. I almost would rather not have the chicken in there at all if it's just going to be little freeze dried cubes of mystery meat.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed. Maybe another style/type of Lunch Express is better, but I don't think I'll be buying any more of the Tuscan Style Penne any time soon.

review/text: This is a beautiful and aromatic black tea, enhanced with real rose petals that give a perfect rose-floral lift. It is a full-bodied, lovely tea, suitable for gifting - housewarming or hostess. It comes in a triple-sealed tin. Once the seal is broken, there is still a canister lid and an inner metal lid to protect the tea.  I love this tea.

review/summary: 5-hour ENERGY - WOW!
review/text: As I get older I have noticed that my mental process is a bit slower than when I was younger. I have tried various energy drinks and dietary supplements to see if I can recover my mental acuity.<br /><br />The problem for me is caffiene is not good for me. Unlike most folks it actually disrupts my mental process rather than improving it. I get more confused, not less. It makes me very jittery and disrupts my sleep patterns. It is like some kind of amphetamine. So, I tried the decaf 5-hour ENERGY and it gives me a great boost from the B vitamins etc. I like the benefits I get without the caffeine. I feel better, short term memory is improved and none of the side effects I suffer with other caffeine laden supplements.<br /><br />I like this stuff and will keep using it.

review/summary: Works even better than it's supposed to!
review/text: This product is fantastic. The caffeinated ones work fine for me, but they can make me a little bit twitchy - this one gives me a very gradual increase in energy and mental clarity, and I never get any jitters, palpitations, flushing, etc.. It's so gentle that I really don't even notice the effect until I realize that I've been awake and productive for a long time without needing a nap! It tastes like diet soda, kinda sickly sweet, but I just chug it and away it goes!<br /><br />The only disclaimer I can provide for this is that it works WAY longer than 5 hours for me...I have to take it in the morning, because if I drink it anytime after about 11am, I'm up all night. Not wired or bouncing off the walls, just not tired and not able to fall asleep...funny because caffeine has zero effect on my wakefulness, so it's a riot that the decaf version makes me so much more alive than the caffeinated ones! This stuff is the only thing that gets me through the day (heck, even gets me out the door in the morning) when my thyroid is low too - sounds silly but this magic anti-zombie potion has kinda been a lifesaver!

For anyone with a sensitivity to caffeine or that have issues with your body processing sugars (i.e. diabetic), 5-hour Energy Decaf is definitely the way to go. Energy without the jitters. Also, the price was admittedly less expensive than from 5-hour energy website. I would buy from this company and from amazon.com again.

review/summary: Bookers is a massive flavor bomb of cask strength bourbon richness.
review/text: The top of the line of Jim Beam's Small Batch Collection, Bookers is a 127.9 proof monster (at least my current bottle).  Booker's a single barrel offering, and varies by proof and age from 121 to 127 proof (according to the web site, because the distiller chooses casks by flavor each cask is unique) and from 6-8 years in the barrel (for the same reason).  I guess my 127.9 proof example is "pushing the envelope" for Bookers.  I'm not complaining.  Alcohol is a flavor carrier and Bookers is a big flavor bomb.<br /><br />The dark tea orange color speaks of a heavy char in the barrels and you can smell it.  The toffee caramel aromas mix with the char to produce dark chocolate / cocoa notes.  There's also vanilla and tobacco and leather in there.  As Master Series reviewer Paul Pacult notes - there a "paraffin" note.<br /><br />Take a sip and pure sweetness hits first.  An intense sugar hit like maple syrup right on the tip of your tongue.  The midpalate mammoth wallop of orange fruit (citrus / apricot), toffee, and caramel corn hit a nanosecond later followed by spirit heat, wood tannins, oiled leather and vanilla aromatics from oak.  That paraffin note I own to Paul Pacult shows up here as well.  The high proof makes itself known in the huge midpalate hit and in a big spicy burn which hangs on for minutes as this bourbon finishes long and simple with a wood smoke, sugar glow, sourmash twang, and burnt orange throat bitterness.<br /><br />Wow!  I'm after another sip right away, but at this high a proof I must take my time.  The first big question is "can I use water"?  You always can, but sometimes it robs a whiskey of its heart.  The answer here is "yes you can".  You can put quite a bit of water into Bookers and it still tastes clearly of Bookers (i.e. delicious).  It loses some intensity (particularly the aroma and midpalate explosion) but might gain something in the fruit esters department.  It certainly is easier to drink with some water.<br /><br />Bookers is clearly the most powerful bourbon flavor experience I've had so far.  The flavor profile is first rate too:  distinctive, complex, and luscious.  Excellent stuff!

If orange is your favorite flavor that's fine. If not, it is feels like you got cheated. You get better variety in the 4.5oz packages.

review/summary: Not bad, but not the real deal
review/text: These lentils are sold as "French", but are actually grown in Oregon. Uncooked, they look very similar to the very tasty lentils from Puy, France. Once cooked, however, they lose their dark green marbled color and swell up to a much larger and softer lentil very similar to the lentil most Americans are familiar with. If you're looking for the real deal, stick with lentils from Puy, which are tiny and dark green. When cooked the Puy lentil remains small and has a firm texture, retaining its earthy texture, color and flavor. The Oregon lentils do not.

review/summary: Dee-lish!
review/text: Lentils would win the Miss Congeniality title in any legume pageant.  Even the lowly brown grocery store variety is tasty in soups, salads and on their own, but Lentils du Puy are the Holy Grail of lentils, grown in rocky French soil and very expensive in the US.  Bob's Red Mill French Green Lentils are the closest things to Lentils du Puy we can get.  Even these are not cheap, but SO worth the price!<br /><br />How fortunate are we that Bob's Red Mill has these tiny green jewels available. Described on the package as 'exquisite', this is not hyperbole.  They are beautiful to look at and to eat.  The flavor is more sharply defined and 'beanier' than the brown kind, and makes a superb soup.  Simply saute some chopped up carrots, onions and garlic in some olive oil, add a cup of these green lentils in three cups of water or stock, a cup of dry wine, and a can of stewed tomatoes with juice, a healthy pinch of Herbes de Provence or Italian Seasoning, a couple of bay leaves and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour.  Meat eaters can add some ham cubes, cut up cooked Italian sausages or smoked turkey cubes, but it's wonderful meat free and even better the next day. For an elegant soup, use a stick blender to puree, and add a little cream or lemon, but none of these is necessary. A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese to serve is the perfect touch.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with these lentils and they've become a staple in my kitchen.  They do take a little longer to cook than the package directs, and do not expect them to become mushy.  No matter how done they are, they will retain their shape along with a lovely chewiness.  Main dish, soup, side dish or salad, you can't go wrong.

But honestly, they are around $17.50 for a little over a pound (that includes shipping) so let's try these first.<br /><br />These are smaller than the dark lentils I am used to. They didn't break down or give off a soupy or starchy texture either. They retain a bite... "to the tooth" texture after proper cooking time. I went ahead and followed the directions, added sauteed onions and garlic, toasted walnuts and chevre. Topped with fresh thyme and a drizzle of walnut oil. Very, very good.<br />I think a lentil smoked sausage soup is in my future.<br /><br />When these are gone,(I stored them in my freezer like it says to) I will have already tried the Le Puy lentils. These convinced me to splurge, so I'll go for the best during the holidays. Also, I really want to try prunes in armagnac, so maybe a French food fest is in order, duck confit, wines, Moelleux au Chocolat...Thanks for sharing.

review/summary: Great Tasting Lentils
review/text: If you love the taste of lentils, then you'll probably love these lentils, which are more similar to the French Puy lentils than what you'd find in the supermarket.  The great thing about these lentils is that they don't take hours to cook, and you pretty much can't over cook them into a gooey paste, even served as a leftover a day later these tough little lentils hold up their shape.  If you like mushy lentils you might be turned off by these lentils which sort of have the consistency of al dente pasta.<br /><br />I am still trying to perfect a recipe as not everything goes well with these lentils like the brown ones.  I would recommend sauteing a yellow onion in four table spoons of olive oil for about 8 minutes, adding a couple minced cloves of garlic and simmering the lentils and water for about 30 to 45 minutes.  It is important to add the recommend amount of water as if it is too runny then your lentils aren't covered in the delicious sauce and taste slightly bland.  Add too many ingredients and you lose the essence of these lentils.  They do go well with fish.

review/summary: Price keeps rising; product has LOTS of water.
review/text: I signed up to get this as a "subscribe & save" item. It was briefly under ten dollars, but now over fifteen. In addition, after noticing how liquid it was, I poured out the water, and the remainder (including the weight of the can) was 3 pounds. That means over 27% (almost 1/4th) of this product is water, not tuna. Fish already has lots of water naturally, so the additional liquid is overkill. There's room in there for more tuna.<br />  However, I get it as an occasional treat for my dogs, and they LOVE it. They jump around as soon as I pick up a can, they wag their tails happily as I open it, they pounce on the bowls once I put them down, they gobble up the tuna, they slurp up the tuna-water, and they lick the can too. So, no problem with the product, just the excess water in the can, and the escalating price.

review/summary: Perfect size for my tuna casserole.
review/text: This size was just the perfect size for my tuna casserole that serves 6-8 people. When I use the little cans, it is a lot of work opening the cans and draining the water and sometimes there is not enough tuna or I would over compensate the next time and have too much tuna. This size was just right and I only had to open 1 can. Also the quality, taste, and size of the tuna was superb! This casserole is one of my masterpiece recipes that involve a lot of work chopping up the celery and onions, mixing the tuna w/mayo and making the sauce with milk, cream of celery soup and slowly melting the colby cheese in the sauce, then cooking the noodles, mix it all together and then bake it. So any step savers is great!

review/summary: The best tasting bar out there!
review/text: I've had more than my fair share of protein bars and energy bars over the years. They fill me up in the morning, provide a quick and more nutritious snack alternative in the afternoon and help me stay on track with my diet. Unfortunately, most of them taste like seasoned cardboard. Of all the bars I've tried (atkins, pria, luna, slim fast, etc), including other south beach diet bars, this one is by far the best tasting one I've come across. I'm not big into chocolate and it seems as though many bars available have chocolate something in them, which this one does not. This bar really hit the spot in terms of flavor and it's so filling, a big feat for someone who craves protein all the time! I would highly recommend the south beach cinnamon raisin bar to anyone who regularly eats protein bars.

review/text: These have to be some of the best tasting bars out there. At only 140 calories, they make a great snack before or after a workout-without loading you up on calories. The other good thing about them is that they have 10 grams of protein- which means you stay full for awhile (studies have shown that between fats, carbs, and protein, its protein that stays in the stomach longer than the rest- leaving you with a full feeling longer). So unless you hate raisins or cinnamon, give 'em a try! Also recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000U1OCI">Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer</a> if you're looking for a good pedometer.

I think they're perfect for a healthy snack, energy during a longer workout, or if you eat two of them with a piece of fruit, a very good light meal. They have about 10 grams of protein each, which is really good considering they're only 35g bars. They also have a good deal of fiber, are low in sugar, and have very little fat. They are smaller than many other protein bars, so bear in mind that they are NOT meal replacement bars unless you eat more than one of them.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size: 1 Bar (35.0 g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Calories from Fat: 45<br />Total Fat: 5.0g<br />Saturated Fat: 2.0g<br />Sodium: 160mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 15.0g<br />Dietary Fiber: 3.0g<br />Sugars: 6.0g<br />Protein: 10.0g<br />Vitamin A 15%  *  Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 15%  *  Iron 10%

People's tastes vary, but I personally like the combined flavor.  The harder rolls keep the bread firm (it does not work well on soft slices of sandwich bread).  The tuna fish should also be well drained so that it does not have excessive oil.  I prefer tuna fish in olive oil if I can find it.

review/text: I've been drinking locally roasted coffee for years, and recently developed a reflux problem. This coffee is definitely low acid enough to keep me from getting reflux. For that purpose, it is excellent. But it doesn't have that fabulous coffee aroma and distinctive coffee taste I also enjoy. If you look forward to the rich smell of coffee brewing as you start your day, this coffee won't deliver. However, I find it very drinkable and the French Roast (the only one I've tried) is not too strong nor weak tasting. I don't find it bitter either. And I have to commend the company for making a coffee that truly is low acid, and not just a marketing ploy. I will continue to purchase and drink this coffee, because for me it is much better than having no coffee at all.

review/text: 1/29/12 - as of today I have completed the Shiraz out of this kit.<br /><br />I have made plenty of kits to date and this one has been just as easy as the others.  Everything needed (other than the equipment) was provided for both the Shiraz and the Gewurztraminer kits.  All processes went well and as expected with the Shiraz kit finishing right about 11% ABV.  I did have about a glass left over at bottling which I drank to test it out.  ABSOLUETLY GREAT WITHOUT ANY AGING.  I could obviously tell this in a nonaged wine, but this wine, just made, without any aging, I can only assume this shiraz will be ridiculously good!  I have given this a 4 star for now, hoping I can kick it up to a 5 star after some aging.  I will open a bottle at 3 months and see how it is and report back to everyone.  Also by then I should have completed and started a review for the gewurztraminer.

review/summary: A Complete Kit of Wine Making Ingredients and More
review/text: The description of this wine kit is woefully inadequate. The full list of items included should read: Two twenty pound bags of varietal grape juice concentrate (enough to produce 60 bottles of wine--30 Shiraz and 30 Gewurztraminer); all ingredients including bentonite, yeast, stabilizer, kieselsol, yeast nutrient, and chitosan; 60 real corks; bottle labels; heat shrink caps; and instructions. The ingredients are all food grade, produced in Canada.<br /><br />I had first bought a home wine making kit with the carboy (glass jar), bucket, siphon, cleaning solutions, corker, etc. This kit in combination with the fermenting hardware gives me everything I need to get started (minus the bottles)....Return to read of my progress, or better yet begin your own vintage and share your experiences. I can hardly wait!<br /><br />Update:  The Shiraz turned out great according to quite a few wine enthusiasts and without any particular difficulties. The GewurtztramIner also turned out quite professionally and now I'm never without a gift.

review/text: It tastes OK,  I ordered a jar last spring and it seemed to tasted fresher, have less bones in it and more beans. I think it may have been a different brand or either i got a bum jar. Its not worth $40, if you can get it for $20 or under then its a good buy

review/summary: Good stuff but the regular white stuff is better
review/text: It seems that the difference between the black Quinoa (this product) and the regular (white?) quinoa is that the black still has the edible hull on it.  Any quinoa is healthy and nutritious but I prefer the regular (white) version.  The black quinoa is heavier in the stomach, more filling and does not pick up the taste of garlic or other seasonings or flavors added to it as well as the regular quinoa dies.<br /><br />I suspect the black version has a lot more fiber than the white due to the hulls and as a result may prove to be the ultimate colon cleanse diet.<br /><br />Either one seems to cause a lot of flatulence, though it generally seems to be a rather harmless, inert, odorless gas.  You may find that you startle people around you as you backfire but you are not likely to injure or poison or overcome anyone with your pungent odors.

review/summary: Damaged Product
review/text: I purchased a box of the International Delight Hazelnut Liquid Creamers (288-count) a few weeks ago. Although the product was great, we were disappointed again in the number of single-serving cups that were damaged and opened evidently in shipping. It looked as if the product has possibly frozen and exploded. Several cups needed to be thrown away and we had to wash the remaining cups and carefully check them to be sure they were not opened. This is the second time this has happened. I wonder what could be done.

review/summary: Problems in packaging/shipping
review/text: I have ordered this product four or five times now, so that our group at work can keep flavored creamer around without it being used by everyone in our large office building.  All four times both the outer shipping and inner packing boxes have been in perfect condition, but two of the four times, many of the creamer packages have been opened and/or leaking.  I'm not sure if it's a temperature issue in shipping or if they can't handle being jostled around the way they are, but it's dissapointing to lose so many of the packets when opening a messy box that has obviously had some kind of problem.<br /><br />I see that there are a few other people that have had this issue and wonder if the product could be packaged differently to avoid the problem?

review/summary: hazelnut creamer
review/text: I have tried the French Vanilla before so I thought I would try something a little different.  I buy these in the largest quantity.  288 count I think.  Just a much better deal.  If you want to see just how good of a deal it really is just go to your local grocery store and check it out.  I bout a case of this and a case of French Vanilla.  I am a paraplegic, so I buy a lot of stuff online.  The only problem I ever had was I got the wrong book once, but it did not come from Amazon.  It was through a third party.  Amazon corrected the error immediately.  When my family asks me what to get me I tell them just a gift card from Amazon.<br /><br />Steve Brooks<br />Lawrenceville, GA

review/summary: Most popular flavor
review/text: I supply a group that drinks a lot of coffee 7 different flavors of individual-serving creamers each week and this is by far the most popular flavor. I've actually seen people use 2 in a 6 oz. cup. It's nuts.
