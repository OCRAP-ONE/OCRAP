review/summary: Great for Iced Tea
review/text: I am not a hot tea drinker.  But, having grown up in the south, I am very big on iced tea.  I like my iced tea to have a little flavor.  I know mint is common favorite, and my Mom used to make orange tea, but I found this to be my favorite.  You can make your iced tea in the 'fridge or you can make sun tea.  This is a great flavor!

review/summary: Smooth not Bitter
review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/summary: Tatsteh Tea
review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/summary: The freshest, fights edema!
review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/text: Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

It gives a calming effect and does help sooth your throat if you are coming up with a cold or something. A great product and I am happy with the fact that we can buy it on Amazon in bulk at a very good price.<br />If you love Herbal tea do try this product from Stash it is good.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

review/summary: One of the better stevias out there--still plagued by bitter aftertaste at high concentrations
review/text: PROS:<br />Added sweetness without the added carbs<br />One of the better tasting stevia-based products for me<br />No effects on insulin levels<br />Safe for diabetics<br />0 calories<br />Moderately priced for a low calorie sweetener<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sweet, but with a different overall taste than sugar<br />Bitter aftertaste better than other stevias I've tried, but still accentuated at higher concentrations<br />Fine grained, non-sugar like powder<br /><br />Zsweet is one of the better stevia based sweetener on the market.  It is moderately priced and a reasonable alternative to table sugar when used to sweeten hot beverages.  The sweetness of this and any other stevia compound is not exactly like table sugar and this one, too, is plagued by the bitter aftertaste that can occur when you use the product at higher concentrations.  Still, Zsweet did a pretty darn good job and is definitely a product that you might want to try.<br /><br />Please note, I have been trying a lot of different sugar substitutes recently.  Instead of making a big investment in yet another sweetener, I ordered sample Zsweet packets from the company's website.  So basically, I looked at this as a coffee or tea sweetener and was more limited in testing, given the number of packets that I was sent.  Still, I think that I was able to fairly assess Zsweet.<br /><br />The packets contain one gram of sweetener.  The powder is finer than table sugar but easily pours and mixes into a beverage.  Each package is supposed to equate to about two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Zsweet's claim to fame is that it is a combination of two different natural sweeteners.  Stevia, which is a leaf extract from stevia rebaudiana and erythritol, a sugar alcohol. According to the company's website the two sweeteners complement each other, yielding a better, hybrid product.<br /><br />In my opinion, however, the erythritol is basically used as a vehicle in the Zsweet packets.  Let me tell you why I say this.  Erythritol on its own does have a very clean, sugar-like taste, but there's not enough erythritol per packet to contribute much to the sweetness (see next paragraph if you want a full explanation). The erythritol is basically used as a filler.  Stevia is something like 300 times more potent than sugar.  Purified, you'd only need less than a few 100ths of a gram of stevia to equal two teaspoons of sugar.  Erythritol adds bulk without interfering with the stevia.  Note, that in their baking product(e.g. Zsweet granulated), where you need added bulk--the company probably uses more erythritol (and possibly fillers like polydextrose, I'm not certain) so that you can measure out Zsweet granulated as you would sugar.<br /><br />(For the mathematically inclined--others may want to pass on this--Erythritol is only about 70% as sweet as sugar.  Zsweet packets are supposed to be about as sweet as two teaspoons of sugar.  Two teaspoon of sugar equates to 8 grams.  In order to get the same relative sweetness of sugar, you would need about 11.4 grams of erythritol.  Given that the packets are only about 1 gram apiece, this would be the equivalent of 0.7 grams of sugar or just about 1/6 of a teaspoon of sugar--not enough to appreciably sweeten.)<br /><br />So the major ingredient that sweetens here is stevia.  Zsweet's stevia, as with all stevia preparations, has two main difficulties.  First, the sweetness of the stevia is more cotton-candy like.  Although this is a pleasant taste, it is not quite the same as sugar.  I preferred the taste in flavored teas (e.g. raspberry) where the stevia taste complemented the fruitiness of the beverage.  However, I was less enamored of the taste in coffee, where I prefer a more generic sweet taste like plain table sugar.<br /><br />The second problem with stevia is the bitter, almost licorice-like, aftertaste.  This was less pronounced at lower concentrations of the Zsweet, but if you up the amount of sweetener the bitterness does kick in.  Once again, Zsweet worked better in the tea, where its taste enhanced the natural sweetness of the raspberry flavor.  Because of this, I tended to use less Zsweet in the tea and the bitter aftertaste was barely noticeable.  In coffee, however, the results were less impressive.  I don't like my coffee overly sweet, usually one to two teaspoons of sugar per ten ounces.  (For comparison's sake, this is about � pack of Equal sweetener.)  One pack of Zsweet didn't quite cut it for my coffee.  A packet and � worked fine in terms of sweetness, but then that bitter aftertaste kicked in a bit.  Not as overwhelming as I have experienced with some other stevia brands, but it was still there.<br /><br />(A word to the wise: the bitterness is pronounced at high concentrations.  If you try to taste a stevia preparation straight out of the packet and directly onto your tongue, you will conclude that it is bitter beyond belief and never use it as a sweetener--this is true of Zsweet and any other stevia preparation I have tried.  However, the bitterness fades more or less when you dilute the stevia in a larger volume. Depending on the preparation/brand, the bitterness fades to a varying degree and the sweetness comes out at lower concentrations.  Always test stevia in a diluted form.)<br /><br />The quality of the sweetness and bitterness of stevia preparations really varies from brand to brand.  I still haven't found the ideal stevia:  all of them don't sit quite well on my palette.  Everyone's taste buds are different, though, so you have to see what your preferences are.  I will say that this one of the better stevias that I have tasted and is eminently usable.  I would definitely use it in tea, but not for my morning coffee.<br /><br />Having a choice, however, I prefer pure erythritol and xylitol in terms of flavor.  These sweeteners certainly have limitations of their own but are far more similar in taste to table sugar and don't come with a bitter aftertaste.

review/summary: better than some, but I still don't like the taste
review/text: My sense of taste has always been rather finely tuned. Once upon a time I was a pioneering vegetarian chef and whole foods baker. I have always hated artificial sweeteners, from a taste point of view, as well as a health point of view, but here I am now, Type 2 diabetic. Keep reading about things that "Taste just like sugar...with no aftertaste", only to find myself disappointed. Well here's another one. I find Splenda to be less objectionable than Aspertame and this to be less objectionable than Splenda. But no off flavor? Fuhgedabowdit!<br /><br />Of course I love the IDEA of Stevia, but hate the taste. Somehow failed to notice that this product contained any, but the taste is enough to spoil the morning coffee for me.<br /><br />I find pure chrystaline Xylitol to be far, far tastier. Just had some in my coffee AND on my steel cut oatmeal. I would never have put any previously tried alternative anywhere other than in my coffee, where there was at least some chance of any objectionable off flavors being masked.<br /><br />Different people must have very, very different senses of taste. I can't otherwise imagine how they manage to sell some of these products (more than once).

Where else can you get nearly 100% of your day's fiber by slapping two tortillas together and making a cheese quesadilla in the microwave?  One minute later and ka-bam!  I've now had a high fiber diet for that day!  Want even more fiber?  Toss some beans into that quesedilla!  Do they taste like a normal corn tortilla? NO...but they taste just fine (it's mostly a texture difference...these are smoother and not as granular/cake/flour like as a normal corn or flour tortilla) and will turn nearly any variety of unhealthy compliment (i.e. cheddar cheese, etc.) into something that's not too bad for you!  Looking at the ingredients, it looks like they're getting most of the fiber content from oat fiber, so that explains why these don't taste overly wheat-like.

review/summary: YUCK!  They smell (and taste) like moldy plastic
review/text: I spent nearly double the amount of money that I normally spend on flour tortillas when I bought s pack of these low-carb tortillas.  They looked very delicious while inside the package.  But once I opened the bag, the smell made me nauseous.  These tortillas smelled like moldy plastic.  And they tasted just as bad as they smelled.  I threw them into the garbage and settled for typical flour tortillas - instead of settling for a ruined Mexican meal.

review/summary: Perfect for diabetics!
review/text: This product is great for diabetics watching thier carb intake. The carb content of each tortilla is 18g, but each also has 12g of fiber which brings down the total carb content to 6g! Great choice for wraps. You can have 2 of these, fill them up with meat and veggies and feel very satisfied. And each tortilla is only 80 calories. I've finally been able to find these at our local Walmart superstore and they cost almost $2.00 less per package than advertosed here, and you don't have to add shipping for each package. If your store doesn't carry them, ask them to. All the diabetic people in your area will appreciate it!

review/summary: Very good tortillas for low-carb
review/text: Gotta keep your expectations in check, like all low-carb foods, but these are very decent tortillas. Flavor is on the whole-grainy side, but nothing too awful. They work great in wraps, for large tacos or you can crisp them for taco salad shells. My preferred use is to crisp them for a low-carb pizza crust, which works very well if you enjoy a cracker-thin crust and can trick yourself into believing it tastes remotely the same. Without these, I'd be a sad, sad guy, watching people eat their pizza while I eat a salad with pepperoni. Now I can stand tall and pretend a tortilla with cheese and pepperoni is a slice of pizza.

Speaking of that, these do not get hard when cooked which is another plus.<br /><br />Bon Apetit!

review/summary: Good for Low Carbers, Weight Watchers, etc.
review/text: I love Smart & Delicious Tortillas!  They can be hard to find in the grocery stores where I live so I ordered some thru Amazon.  Although the wraps have a lot of fiber (12g!), they don't taste strange or "diet like".  I also don't experience any stomach issues due to the fiber but I could see some being sensitive with that much fiber in one meal. These wraps are low calorie and good for those watching their carb intake (net carbs is around 6). I usually heat my wrap in the microwave for 30 seconds (spray on a little Pam butter first) and then fill my wrap with eggs/egg whites, salsa, avocado,and mozzarella cheese for a very filling breakfast (I mean I'm full for hours!). I also make plenty of other tasty and filling meals using ground beef or turkey. I rarely eat any other bread product but this one now.

I had promised to bring my enchiladas to a dinner party one time but ran out of time to make my sauce so I crossed my fingers, closed my eyes and picked an unknown sauce. (I had tried the rest, blech!) I got rave reviews that night and everytime I make them now!  I have been using this sauce for about 4 years.  It is also a low sodium choice which is important to me and my family.  As for the review that it was too hot, yep there is a bite but my 6 and 7 year olds LOVE when I make enchiladas so .....

review/text: Purchased an entire case of 12 boxes and signed up for 6 month renewal on item. I didn't foresee a problem going through 12 boxes in 6 months.  However, when they arrived the use by date is only 3 months out and the cookies must have been overheated, because the white powdered sugar is non-existent (cookies have a brown glazed looked). The cookies do not taste bad, and I'm hoping they are not. This item is not eligible for return, so I will just have to use these up within the next couple of months and cancel the subscription.

review/summary: Best Cookie Keebler Makes
review/text: These are the most addictive cookies on the market.  They are Very rich, Ultimately delicious, and far to difficult to find in stores.  I got hooked on them in 1963 and have never looked back.  Because they are so rich with shortening and butter, chocolate chips and everything else that is not on your diet, they are prone to a short shelf-life.  Since they are Primarily a wedding cookie and most weddings notoriously occurr in June, I am going to offer my assumption that they are manufactured to be at their optimum during this part of the year.  The hazard of this is, the heat of the summer is detrimental to their shelf life, most notably, their appearance, regarding the white powdered sugar.  I have never found their taste to falter or disappoint me in spite of this.  As I mentioned in another post; you can re-coat the cookies with about a half cup of Powdered Sugar per box, and they will look like new.  I noticed they are rated at 80 calories per serving........ a serving being one cookie !  Get Real Folks !  Forget the calories, to a cookie lover, the serving size on these little bites of heaven are a minimum of one bag per person and that is only if someone is watching you eat.  Plan your weddings etc well ahead of time and order these cookies the earlier, the better.  order them in January or February and keep them in a cool place ready for the occasion,  I have even been known to freeze them.  I think you will find no problems with them at all doing this.  Got Milk ?

review/summary: Wedding cookies better than honeymoon sex
review/text: These cookies are the most addictive cookies on the market.  They aren't like your regular wedding shortcake cookies.  First, they add teeny little chocolate chips and an assortment of oils (that tastes like a hint of malt) to the recipe.  With a hint of coconut. Yes, the powdered sugar absorbs into the malted cookie, making them appear different than ones you would buy in your bakery. The cookies are sort of brown, the sugar absorbs into the cookies, I assume because they are still warm when they get coated.  Has nothing to do with the sugar turning brown because of age.  It also makes them taste better than anything out there.  Just make sure you have a gallon of cold milk handy, and plenty of coffee if you don't want to fall asleep from eating a whole bag.  There's no accounting for taste, but I think these things should come with a Surgeon's General warning.  I quit smoking years go, but still occasionally indulge in a bag or two of these to relieve stress.<br /><br />I grew up with these in the deep south, and once I went in the military and started moving around I found that they weren't available in all markets throughout the country.  I have ordered these online, a few dozen at a time for Christmas presents to fellow addicts.  It may be better to grab in your grocery store - especially around the holidays - but if you can't, buying here is a safe bet.  If you don't like coconut, chocolate, or malt, you probably won't care for these.  But I've given away more than a few bags or these and never seen them last more than a couple of days.<br /><br />Try them.  I think you'll really like them.

Bottom line - I only drink strong, bold types of coffee and this would qualify but there was an undertone of something off about it.  I wouldn't buy it again.  The coffee maker was new and had been run through two cycles before being used AND my daughter's Vanilla flavored was spot on so it wasn't the coffee maker.

Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice: "I hate you SATAN Ice!!" Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4.

If you need colors, they are vibrant and strong--their blank and read are the best.<br />While I have used Satin Ice many times, I will say that whatever fondant is used and marketed as the "Duff" brand (from Ace of Cakes) is a MUCH better product than even Satin Ice. You can re-rool and stretch it to fit like nothing I have ever seen. It really is the easiest fondant I have ever worked with--worth waiting for the 40% off coupons from the large chain craft store and buying the Duff brand.<br />You can find Satin Ice elsewhere on the Internet cheaper than here, but at least you know Amazon is pretty dependable.

The fondant was brightly colored, relatively easy to work with (with ample amounts of powdered sugar to prevent sticking), and didn't taste bad like many other fondants do.  What I especially liked was that I was able to store the remaining fondant away for nearly three weeks, and it was just as good as when I first received it.  The green is a bright kelly green.

review/text: I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to "step it up".  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said "It's fondant!"  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said "It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.  I'm exhausted!!  Never again.

review/text: I got this fondant for my brother's wedding. I won't be using it until this weekend, so the only things I can comment on right now are the taste and the color and texture.<br /><br />First off, right out of the bucket, this fondant was very stretchy and easy to work with, I pulled out a chunk just to see out it worked, before I ordered more. I found it very nice, and I'm just beginning to work with fondant. I was very concerned with the fact that it was being delivered on a 90 degree day, but it stayed gummy and workable and didn't melt or stick to anything.<br /><br />The color was gorgeous. I was a little worried about it leaving a blue or green color residue or not quite being black, but it's a great color and didn't bleed everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the taste, I tried it and I have to say this is some of the best tasting fondant. I liked it so much, that I ordered the white and I plan on making the flowers out of it, because I know people will love them.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Worked very well. I made many flowers and other decorations for the cake with this. Everyone thought it tasted great and looked wonderful. My only complaint is that it didn't dry as hard as other products I have used, so I had to be very careful when moving them around as they easily lost shape or fell apart. I'm not sure if this was because of the fondant or because of the heat, even though i made sure they were in a cool, dry place.<br />My other issues is that no matter what I tried, it was very sticky and stuck to the mat that I was rolling it out on. Once I let it sit out for 15min or so, it got much easier to work with and I was able to actually roll and cut ribbons without them breaking or sticking.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy this again, just takes a little bit of getting used to.

review/summary: arrived as promised
review/text: I love Satin Ice fondant.  The fondant arrived as promised and it was fresh and ready to use.  I needed to get the product to me quickly, so purchasing from Amazon 2 day was the most economical for me.  Which is good for when I need to try out mixing a few colors before ordering a large quantity. I used this blue along with the red to make purple which was perfectly stable to light. (unlike mixing gel colors which sometimes fade in direct light).

review/summary: Great fondant!
review/text: It was my first time rolling fondant and I did it for my 3 years old daughter's birthday. It was perfect! I used for a big cake. It was pretty challenge on rolling it at that big size but it was worth.<br /><br />I researched on few tips on line and used a rolling mat so it was easy to transfer from the table to the cake.

review/summary: great taste and easy to use!
review/text: This was my first time rolling fondant, and I had no trouble using this product.  Some that I've tasted in the past might as well have been made from glue, but this one had a pretty decent (though sugary, obviously) taste.  After a small amount of kneading it rolled out as smoothly as I could have hoped and covered my cake beautifully.

review/summary: great prosciutto!
review/text: Went to italy and tried bringing a prosciutto over as a gift but was told that I might have a problem bringing in meat to the U.S.  Upon my return went on line and amazon had a good price and great boneless prosciutto, not at all too salty, well aged. My friends now want another another of the same.

review/summary: Does Not Have a Bitter Taste Right After Drinking
review/text: PROS<br /><br />1) It has a great taste.<br />2) It does not have a bitter/burnt taste right after drinking.<br />3) It tastes better than Nescafe Clasico (Classic).<br />4) It lives up to its name: "Taster's Choice."<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1) It costs more than Nescafe Clasico.<br />2) The design on the container is ugly. Nescafe Clasico has a better design. They should invest on a better design so as to attract more customers. I bet many people have not bought this coffee because of the design.

review/summary: It's Instant but one of the best
review/text: Ok, it is instant coffee and can't compare to fresh brewed.  But I'm at work and the stuff we brew at work, where they NEVER clean the pot, is like this dredging silt and as strong as acid and who knows how long it's been sitting there "cooking" on the warmer.  Plus, at those times when I'm the only coffee drinking around, I don't want to make a whole pot of coffee just for my one cup (and I'm too cheap to go buy a coffee at Starbucks).  This instant fills the gap.  Nascafe bought it a few years ago but the taste seems to have stayed the same good taste.  However, it's become rather difficult to find--even Walgreens is locking it up so you have to hunt down someone with a key to get a jar--and they are selling a jar (I think it's bigger than 7oz) for over $15!  I can't find it at any of the supermarkets or grocery stores--which is why I'm here buying instant coffee online.  Sigh, what is this world coming to?  Can't wait until they have those food/drink machines like on Star Trek where you just ask and it makes it happen.  Anyway, I have found I will drink just about any instant coffee when I'm desperate, but would far prefer TC if I can get it because it just has a really mellow, solid taste.  The free shipping is making TC via Amazon.com happen for me.

review/summary: Taster's Choice....A Tasty Treat
review/text: I became aware of the Taster's Choice coffee after sampling some in the local grocery store. I had a coupon for it so I bought some. Then when I finished that, I went back to get more and the price was OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. I thought, " Can't afford that!". Then I got online at Amazon and found that that if I order through the automatic setup, I can afford it. And the taste is very good. Not too strong, not too weak.<br />Good stuff. Will continue until they discontinue it. It seems that every time I start liking a certain something, the manufacturer quits making it.<br />But, until then, "Bon Appetite"!

review/summary: pretty good--but it's just not the best
review/text: The original blend of Nescafe instant "Tasters Choice" is very good; but I don't think it quite measures up to brewed coffee. I like the little extra "zing!" that you get from good old brewed coffee; although when I'm in a pinch or if I can't brew coffee for any other reason then I do use this product.<br /><br />This is not to say, however, that this coffee doesn't taste at all like coffee. It's actually pretty good; but it's just not my personal favorite. Even with the fact that Nescafe regular instant ground coffee is rather consistently tasteful, there's an ever so slight blandness to it that turns me off. You may want to add a little extra sweetener or milk to this product as I do when I drink it.<br /><br />You probably should refrigerate the container after you open it; but I have left it outside on my kitchen countertop and the coffee I make with this still tastes fine. You can store it in a kitchen cabinet, too. You can even put unused containers in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste the same after you let it defrost. In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />All in all, Nescafe Taster's Choice Regular Original Blend is one of the better instant coffees out there and it remains extremely popular. It's not my personal favorite; it has a somewhat more bland taste than brewed coffee has. The extra added taste simply isn't there. Nevertheless, it's a decent choice when you want instant regular blend coffee.
