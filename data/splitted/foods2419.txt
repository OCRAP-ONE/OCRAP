review/text: I ordered this basket based on the reviews and the photo. The basket looks great in the picture but the basket is very small. The contents were yummy but if you are looking to provide several people with snacks, this isn't the basket for you! This is not worth $39.99!!!

review/summary: One of my favorite Gluten Free products!
review/text: This is not a typical 'bread' mix as I thought when ordering - it is more like cinnamon bread.  It comes with several recipes on the box.  I have used it to make banana nut muffins and coffee cake muffins (using the recipe for blueberry muffins, and cinnamon/brown sugar).  They are absolutely delicious!  No spongy or gritty texture, no 'gluten free' taste at all.  Even my gluten eating family loves this and nobody would know they are gluten free unless told.  I make half a box at a time which yields 9-10 muffins.  If I can keep the rest of the family from eating them, I freeze some so I can have a quick breakfast on the go - still delicious after defrosting in the microwave.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this mix is a bit pricey.  Amazon usually has the best price for the 3-pack, but I continue to look for sales.  This is definitely one thing that I keep on hand at all times.

review/summary: Good price, bulk pack
review/text: The packaging has poorly welded zipper-strip, so you'll need to clip or rebag any leftovers.  Aside from that, the product is excellent.  Onion moves quickly, so you're getting a fresh product.  Frontier does quality control and stays on top of their products and batch numbers.  Their dried onion flaks are good sized pieces, not just crumbs or powder.  The taste is good, with a faint sweet flavor, not cardboardy.<br /><br />We have used Tones, Frontier, and several others.  It's a commodity product, so there's a limit to the variety you'll find.  Where Frontier really wins out is that it's inexpensive, conveniently packaged, and you can get it on subscribe-and-save.  That's even less expensive, and saves from having to remember where I picked up my last order.<br /><br />This product is two 1-pound bags, and that's a good size for home use.

The chopped white onion has excellent flavor in our opinion but a LITTLE goes a long ways so be careful how much you use until you are used the product.  Wish I could buy only one pound at a time instead of two but they come in one pound packages so the second pound stays fresh with out a problem.

You can also grind this up in a spice grinder to make your own onion powder.<br /><br />If you want to use these onions in a sauce you can boil 1/4 water per tablespoon of dried onion and then let the onions 'bloom' in the water before adding to your dish to cook.<br /><br />Great product and very handy when you don't always have time to buy onions!

review/text: I was surprised to see such terrible reviews of this product! Admittedly, I have never drank it as a stand-alone hot chocolate drink.  I run this through my Keurig into a large mug and then mix a bold coffee into it (dark magic extra bold is my favorite to blend although any bold coffee is a nice choice) and it is a wonderful treat in the morning as something different.  If you have some at home that is not being enjoyed, try this little trick.<br /><br />[...].

review/summary: Perfect for those with a sweet tooth
review/text: One of the things that I love about my Keurig B70 is that I can have coffees, teas and hot chocolates on hand for my guests even though I would not drink them myself (I prefer "coffee-favored" coffee, such as the Newman's Own Organic Dark Roast and Timothy's Rain Forest Espresso).<br /><br />This item is a good example of the joy of beverage diversity.  Although it is too sweet for me, I am pretty sure that children and young adults will like it.  I think that it's great that some people are "blending" their k-cup brews, very creative.  When I use my machine at the smallest setting and mix Timothy's White Chocolate with my Newman's own it becomes something entirely different.  I will keep this on hand and offer it to my guests who prefer to drink their desserts.

review/text: I love white chocolate, and after reading the reviews BEFORE I tried it I already knew I would love it.  First off, White chocolate, like another review mentioned is not actually chocolate, therefore no cocoa butter, no thickness etc....secondly White chocolate is VERY sweet.  I actually can only eat actual white chocolate in small portions, but I still love it!  That being said...IF YOU LOVE WHITE CHOCOLATE AND UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT REAL CHOCOLATE....you will love this....yep its sweet....yes its watery....just like coffee is....because just like coffee....this isnt chocolate....did I mention this isnt chocolate??? It's white chocolate which is basically sugar vanilla and whatever other flavors they put in to make it taste like WHITE chocolate!  So if you like white chocolate you will love this!

Those who cannot have chocolate turn to White Chocolate for a safe chocolate fix because it is made with Cocoa Butter which contains no cocoa.  This product tricks those people into doing harm to themselves by calling itself something it is not.  Shame on you Timothy's.

review/summary: Amazon Really Came Through
review/text: We ordered this product hoping it would be a nice addition to our K-Cup assortment. It was awful, and no one who tried it wanted another cup. Ever. I took it to work, and again it bombed. I called Amazon to complain that the taste seemed very artificial and was overly sweet and that no one liked it, and I was so pleased that my money was fully refunded. I was told to keep the cups as they cannot be returned. I thought I might be able to give them away, but no takers, so they were thrown out. All of Timothy's other K-Cup products we've tried have been outstanding. I guess it's important to remember that not every attempt can be a home run.

review/summary: Just doesn't taste good
review/text: This sounded really good to me, so I bought some. It doesn't taste like white chocolate--it tastes like sweet water with a weird fake sugar taste. The only use for it now is to mix with coffee for a vanilla-coffee like drink. It's awful on its own. After I bought it, everyone at the office said the same thing. I wish I'd asked around before I bought it.

review/text: This has got to be the worst hot chocolate I have ever encountered...<br /><br />It is true white chocolate, and it sounds good. Great in a candy bar, but in a hot chocolate it is disgusting. Also leaves a terible after taste as well as a pasty feeling. There is a reason this particular hot chocolate is so cheap.<br /><br />AWFUL!!!<br /><br />Stay with the Dark and Milk chocolate people and may the force be with you!!!!

It is like watered down skin milk with a very little rich white  chocolate taste.<br /><br />Since it is not returnable I am stuck with it and  one review said to mix it with another coffee and  try for a latte,ugh..  I guess it's live and let live, or drink and not drink. Other pods I ordered were good, guess you can't like them all.

review/summary: Yuck! I love hot chocolate but this is sickening!!!
review/text: A coworker of mine asked me to purchase this for her for the office, but she told me it was a coffee. I searched and searched, then realized it was hot chocolate. She was clueless - all this time she thought she was drinking coffee, and this stuff is so sweet, thin, and the color is disgusting. She's 27, but she must have never drunk coffee before. So, when I tried it, I thought for sure it would have a bit of a bitter taste to it, and I would have to add sugar/creamer, but this stuff is so over-the-top sweet, it's just plain sickening. (When I drink hot chocolate, I like to put marshmallows in it, but there's no way with this one. I had to pour it out.) Would not recommend for traditional hot chocolate lovers.

review/summary: Cheap but strange ingredients...
review/text: The White Hot Chocolate by Timothy's was the cheapest item (~$0.50/cup) on amazon for some form of hot chocolate. I get sick of drinking coffee from my Keurig so I thought I'd give it a try. First thing I noticed was that the first ingredient was Coconut Oil (???). I know that this is prevalent in single-size non-refrigerated creamers but I would not expect it from hot chocolate. After all the different forms of sweetener and whey fillers, artificial flavoring is the 10th ingredient followed by "natural cream flavor". After 'brewing' my first cup, it fill my nostrils with a pleasant creamy, white chocolate aroma. First taste was OK, nothing special. Sweet initial flavor, followed by fake-creamy taste and then lastly that feeling in your mouth from the artificial sweeteners. Mixed it with my coffee and it tastes pretty good.

review/summary: Ummmm...white chocolate is NOT real chocolate....
review/text: It cracks me up hearing people crying on here that the product "doesn't taste like hot chocolate".  Well duh, that's because it's hot WHITE chocolate which isn't actual chocolate, it is the cocoa butter that is produced when cocoa is made, then it is sweetened and made into whatever. The result is a creamier, sweeter and smoother taste which is NOTHING like actual chocolate, so unless you are a fan of white chocolate and are expecting this to taste like real chocolate you ARE going to be disappointed.  I am a a fan and love it and my K-cups, I have the platinum B-70 coffee maker so I can make a 6 ounce cup if I want it to be extra tasty or 8 ounce if I want it more mild.  I would suggest giving it a quick stir as all the flavor can somtimes settle.  It's delicious and for those of you who are giving this a bad review because it "doesn't taste like hot chocolate", it's not supposed to, stick to that gross Green Mountain Cocoa that tastes like choco-chalk water!

review/text: I was excited when these came out as I LOVE white chocolate! I ordered them immediately and was excited to get them. Unfortunately it didn't taste as good as I hoped. With the 8oz. brew (as recommended by the manufacturer) it tasted very watery and with the 6oz. brew (not recommended ~ by me!) it didn't brew the whole product and just clogged up. I brewed the 8oz. into a stronger cup of coffee and that didn't taste too bad, but I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Too sweet, yet too watery
review/text: I don't know how the product can be both too sweet and too watery, but it is!  I bought these on a whim, thinking they would be good for guests and the occasional time I wanted something a little different.  After trying them, I won't even offer these to a guest in my home.<br /><br />Let me preface a little.  I have the original Keurig, with only one cup size, which is about 7 ounces.<br /><br />The consistency is watery.  There is no richness, no creaminess.  At the same time, the resultant brew is extremely sweet.  It doesn't really taste like white chocolate, more like fake vanilla flavoring.  The only way I can describe this is: non-fat milk, mixed with a LOT of hot water and sugar, with a touch vanilla.<br /><br />I am normally a fan of the Timothy's products, but I definitely won't buy this again.  I hate to waste anything, so I've started mixing one cup of this with a cup of Extra Bold coffee.  That way, at least I'm saving some money on coffee creamer.

review/summary: Very Disappointing
review/text: I really like hot chocolate all year round but find that drinking more than one cup is just not a good idea in hot weather.  I had to literally force myself to drink the entire cup. The white chocolate, as well as the regular chocolate, had a funky taste to it. At first I just thought I was something about the white chocolate, since I don't usually drink white chocolate, but then the next day I tried the regular and the same taste was there.  I have made tea and coffee in my brewer, and the taste wasn't there.  I have also made other kids of hot chocolate without the taste, so I would have to say that it is just in this particular product.  I unfortunately cannot send this product back due to my location, but I know I will never by anything by this company again.

It dissolved the whole cup and they put it on the largest setting (for ours its 9 oz) and it is not watered down or too sweet either.  Also, they love to put ice in it and have a cold one.

If you use less water in an attempt to make it more flavorful, it still tastes terrible and has a nasty aftertaste.  After looking at the ingredients I understood why - they include the artificial sweetener sucralose.  Now I have to figure out what to do with two boxes of this awful stuff since even my kids won't drink it.

review/text: I agree with other reviews I've seen about this product...that it is very weak.  However, I have found that after the brewing stops, if you just open the foil top and empty the powder that remains in the K-Cup into your mug and mix it up it then tastes great.

review/summary: Tastes almost like Duncan Donuts
review/text: This is a great buy and you get 2 boxes. The flavor reminds me of Duncan Donuts white hot chocolate which is one of my favorites. While its not as thick as D.D. it still has great flavor. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there tends to be a little still left in the K-cup that didn't melt. I just pop the foil off and mix it in my mug.

review/summary: Wonderful White Chocolate taste!
review/text: I love the Timothy's White Hot Chocolate! Over Thanksgiving my house guests loved it<br />way too much because they wiped me out and that is why I am here buying more.<br />I first had the white hot chocolate at Starbucks and so when I saw it for my Kurig I was so happy.<br />It went over well with the grandkids when the other k-cup hot chocolate was too strong for them.<br />So it really is a matter of taste. The person that mentioned not sharing with her house guests<br />probably cheated them out of a great drink! My husband can't quite past the fact that is is milky looking<br />but I noticed he keeps brewing it up for himself.

review/summary: The best creamy cocoa
review/text: This is the best k-cup cocoa ever created! I prefer the white to any other variety as it does not have caffeine. I brew this as a 6oz for a stronger flavor, using two k-cups per 12oz mug. The white chocolate flavor pops and is addictive! I do not drink coffee so this is my drink of choice, I buy these in bulk and am not willing to share normally! I challenge any cocoa conaseur to find a better tasting cup of cocoa!  White hot chocolate is #1! Thanks Timothy's for continuing to make it regardless of all the whinnying going on!!!!

review/summary: Worst K-Cup ever!
review/text: This is by far, the worst tasting K-Cup variety I have tried to date. Luckily for me, this was a gift and I did not fork over the money myself.  I am a HUGE white chocolate fan. Unfortunately, this had no white chocolate flavor whatsoever. What did it taste like? Watery milk, sugar, and a hint of vanilla. Everyone in my family tried this, everyone dumped their cup. I honestly don't understand how this could receive positive reviews.

review/summary: Not same taste as packets
review/text: The packets of white hot chocolate powder mix have been discontinued by Timothy's (per their customer service) so I purchased the K-cups this time around from Amazon for the great quantity and price deal.  Well, let me tell you, the K-cup formula tastes like chemicals and has a lousy aftertaste. They are horrible. The label on the box of K-cups says there is sucralose in them whereas the packets did not have sucralose. I still had one packet left to compare labels with and that is the main difference. I called Timothy's customer service to ask why they changed the formula & did I get a box of "sugar-free" or "diet" K-cups in a regular box in error. I was informed this is just the way they're formulated.  So, I will never buy them again & will have to find someone to take these 2 boxes of nasty tasting things off my hands.

review/text: The Timothy's White Hot Chocolate is delicious.  I normally do not like white chocolate, however, I bought this for my daughter.  After smelling it brewing, I had to try it.  I am hooked.  It is smooth, creamy and light, perfect anytime of day, especially as a "before bedtime" treat.<br /><br />If you are looking for something that tastes like normal hot chocolate, this is not it.  It has its own unique flavor and quality, a definite must in our family.

review/summary: Awesome stuff!
review/text: Being relatively new to the Keurig, we are trying all types of coffees, teas and hot chocolates.  We stumbled upon the white hot chocolate after ordering a chocolate and nut variety pack, and it has become my husband and son's favorite.  They have a cup of this almost every evening even though it's summer!  They love it so much that I had to order 4 boxes the last time just to keep up.  We definitely recommend this, especially to hot chocolate lovers.

review/summary: Taste's nothing like White Hot Chocolate
review/text: I am a fan of White Hot Chocolate, and this doesn't even come remotely close to the flavor. It is similar to 1% milk with some sugar added to it. My son wouldn't even touch the stuff, said it was horrible. I tried adding it to a cup of regular coffee, and it ruined a good cup of coffee. Those who gave this 5 starts obviously have no clue what good White Hot Chocolate tastes like! Gross, don't waste your money.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: If you like white chocolate you'll love this!  It's not as creamy as a Cafe Escape's hot chocolate k-cup, but add a dash of milk (it's always needed to cool down your beverage anyways) and it's like drinking melted white chocolate!  If you haven't had white chocolate, go buy some and taste it first, it's very different then chocolate.  Based on other reviews I read for this product it seems to me that people bought this without knowing what to expect.<br /><br />But if you've always been a fan of white chocolate like I am, then this is amazing.  I recommend making a small white chocolate and then adding a k-cup of coffee to make a delicious white mocha like beverage.  Granted it not a white mocha, but it's close enough and probably lower in calories.

review/summary: Yum!  On smaller setting
review/text: Coming home from a rough day and need a soothing pick-me-up or coming in from the cold and tired of hot chocolate.  This is your drink!  Be sure to use the smaller setting (in my 2 cup machine)to avoid it being too weak.  If brewed strong enough, this is fabulously soothing and relaxing.  It tastes like a cross between a hot chocolate and a warm milk. Only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is that it wasn't strong enough on the larger setting so I feel like I don't get as much as I would like for my money.

review/summary: Addicted!
review/text: I almost wish they would stop making this because heaven forbid I should have to use my own will power in order to stop drinking this stuff. My husband and I love it. we have even been known to enjoy a cup on a hot summer night. I use it on the 10oz. setting and think it is perfect. My husband who likes thing a lot sweeter than I do either uses the 6oz. setting or mixes it with another powdered hot chocolate mix on the 10oz. setting. He has come up with some interesting combinations. I also use it with Starbuck's Via (columbian flavor) and melt in a candy cane and it tastes just like a white peppermint mocha from Starbuck's. YUM! The only problem is now I have to have at least one cup of the coffee mixture a day and the hot chocolate at the end of the day. I think my New Years resolution might have to be to limit my White hot chocolate intake. This stuff is going to put me in the poor house.

review/text: I made a 9.25 ounce cup and was very pleased so if I want it more concentrated I will make a smaller cup (part of the beauty of the B60 & B70). For me it was sweet enough, but I don't have an addiction to sugar so my taste buds are easily pleased. If you like high calorie, thick syrupy drinks then you will not like this. If you are conscious about your health then you might.

review/summary: Timothy's White Hot Chocolate
review/text: The Timothy's White Hot Chocolate tasted good to me.  It's a good alternative to coffee or tea.  I didn't think it tasted like weak sugar water at all which was the feedback left from several reviews.  I had no resediue issues, or need for stirring-but this may be because I have a newer model Keurig....no complaints here  There must have been some changes to this product over the past few years because I ordered the product, read the reviews, and was worried I'd wasted our money when I saw all of the negative comments.  But that wasn't the case.  The only drawback is that is costs me 2 Weight Watcher points, so I'll have to drink sparingly :)I'm giving it four stars because of the stiff competition from Chai Latte and Cafe Mocha that Cafe Escape K-Cups offers.  These two items are staples in my kitchen that my husband literally frowns upon when we run low or out of.
