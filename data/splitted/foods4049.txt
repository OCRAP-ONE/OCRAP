review/summary: Great for dogs with sensitive skin
review/text: Our three doxies have eaten the Pro Plan sensitive skin dry dog food for years as other brands ingredients dried out their skin and upset their gastrointestinal tract.  We now use the flea pills for our dogs and they need to take the pills with moist dog food for proper digestion.  I wanted to stay with the same brand so I checked out the price of this food at the pet store and it was quite a bit more than on Amazon.  Great price for a great product!

review/summary: Nuance . . .
review/text: First off, do yourself a favor and buy the most lean bacon you can find. Not because it's healthier, because it taste better, there's more substance, etc. . .<br /><br />Okay about the genie. It simply wont catch all the grease that comes off of the bacon. Some with burst from it and you will end up having to clean your microwave. It's not a bad as just microwaving it on a plate, but still.<br /><br />Every time I have used it, the bacon sticks to itself where the 2 ends touch. Not a real issue but you have to let it cool down before you can tear them apart and pull the bacon off.<br /><br />This is a real lazy way of cooking bacon though. I bought it for my mom because she just doesn't cook. I still prefer a cast iron pan for cooking bacon but on those days where you just can't stand over a stove, this works fine.

review/summary: MMMM, bacon!
review/text: So, here are my thoughts... I LOVE bacon, obsessed some may say! I would bathe in the grease were it socially acceptable. Unfortunatly, it is not and I would probably end up with a lot of insect bites, although it might land me a man! You never know!<br />Pros of the genie: cooks fast, has drip tray to catch all that delicious grease I might some day bathe in, easy to clean.<br />Cons: Still gets effin grease all over the inside of the microwave and does not work well for thick cut bacon.<br />If you do get this, be sure to line the bottom of your micro with paper towels and clean it with some lysol wipes or something similar right after use!<br />ENJOY!

review/summary: Wow!  We're cookin' bacon now!
review/text: I've been a microwave oven user since 1986, and I've tried all sorts of tricks for cooking meat in them.  For the most part, I have it all down pat - but cooking bacon without mess or fuss or stuck-to-the-paper-towel bacon has eluded me.  Not any more!<br /><br />I got a Bacon Genie about a month ago and since then I've found that I can cook both regular and turkey bacon to exactly the desired doneness and crispyness I want.  For my health I tend more towards turkey bacon than regular bacon and I've found that the Bacon Genie makes it easy to cook eight slices in just four-and-a-half (chewy) to five (crispy) minutes - just right for two people for breakfast.  (I place three strips on each outer side and two on the middle bar.)<br /><br />And cleanup?  Not a problem.  The bacon's fat drips straight down to the collector in the bottom with no splatter.  Once I'm done, I pour the drippings straight into my grease jar (What?  You don't have a grease jar?  For shame!  You can always re-use for other cooking or throw the full jar away, saving you sink from grease clogs.) for disposal.<br /><br />Also, the Bacon Genie comes with a nice pair of tongs for removing the bacon without getting your fingers burned or greasy.<br /><br />Yes.  I cannot recommend the Bacon Genie strongly enough!

This time though when I received the package, it only had 1 bone in it instead of the box of 50.  Amazon was very quick to refund the original $69.95 and correct the issue, telling me that I would need to reorder them once my refund came through.  The refund was done in less than 12 hours, but when I went to reorder this product as a christmas gift for my dog, it is now $104 for the same product??  How does this price jump this high in less than 2 weeks?  My dog loves these, but I am not willing to pay $35 more because the item was packaged and shipped incorrectly.

review/summary: Perfect pasta and pizza flour
review/text: To save significantly I buy all my flour in bulk and keep it frozen.  The 2 pound bags of Spicy World Semolina are conveniently sized.  I use the flour for pasta, but also for half of my pizza dough mix (with finer ground standard high gluten flour).  And of course the hot pizza stone gets a sprinkling of the Semolina just before the pizza goes into the oven. I live rurally and can only get Semolina in 1 pound boxes locally (and at 3-4 times the price of this great Amazon deal).

review/summary: Why look any further?
review/text: I am reluctant to say anything about this product because I don't want to share it with anyone.<br /><br />I found a recipe for pizza crust that required semolina flour. Having never used semolina before, I searched amazon and found 12 pounds for $18. While at first it seemed like way too much flour, the 2-pound bags are easy to store in the pantry, fridge or freezer until you need them.<br /><br />My pizza crust is now much improved, and I've made dinner rolls with semolina, too. Friends rave about my pizza, and the rolls were a big hit. "How'd you get them so yellow and creamy?" they ask. I smile and say it's an Olde family recipe! (I've never met any of the Olde family, but I will praise them here, in print, just in case any of them are reading this!)<br /><br />In the end, its flour, and it behaves as you would expect. It imparts a delicate aroma to your baked goods along with a yellow tint. It is not as finely-ground as all-purpose flour, nor is it as couarse as cornmeal - it's texture is somewhere in between. And unlike cornmeal, it doesn't burn when used on a hot baking stone. Sprinkling semolina on your peel and proofing your loaves makes it easy to transfer them onto the stone.<br /><br />I have not used any other semolina flour, and I am unlikely to do so after discovering Spicy World.<br /><br />Finally, I challenge you to find semolina for less than $1.50 a pound!

review/summary: Makes great pasta.
review/text: The flour was delivered in one large plastic bag and was six 2 pound bags of flour.  I put four bags in the freezer, one in the fridge, and opened one to make pasta.  This flour was the best price I could find anywhere - it worked out to $1.50 per pound with free shipping (bundled it with another item).<br /><br />I had my own recipe for making pasta that I picked up from the interweb somewhere.  I only used one cup of the flour (with one cup of All-purpose flour) and the total recipe made one pound of pasta (yes, I weighed it).<br /><br />Anyway, the flour itself was sifted with the AP flour to make the pasta.  After the eggs, salt and oil, it was kneaded for 10 minutes.  Then the flour was passed through a pasta machine to flatten it and then it was made into linguini.  The pasta itself came out fine.<br /><br />Since this was my first foray into homemade pasta, I think it was a success.  The product was as expected.  If I had something to compare it to, I might have had a different opinion.  But I don't, so I don't.<br /><br />I would buy it again and recommend it to others.

review/summary: Great for pasta
review/text: I decided to use semolina flour for my homemade pasta but was frustrated by the high cost in our local stores.  Found this product, ordered it, and it's working great!  I froze a bunch of the packages and have been slowly making my way through them.  Fast shipping and well packed.  When I make my way through the last four pounds, I'll be ordering more from Spicy World!  BTW, semolina holds its shape much better than all purpose flour (put fresh pasta made with all purpose flour in the fridge overnight and it's a messy glump; dry semolina well and then store it in the fridge and it keeps a decent shape).

So make sure you get what you're buying and they don't ship you an inferior substitute product.

review/summary: Great value, great flavor
review/text: Best value I've found after years of searching. This pepper is stronger and more flavorful than anything you'll ever find in the supermarket, and is reasonably priced. You can use a little less than normal if you like, since the pepper flavor is so much more pronounced than you're probably used to. But I like to use my normal amount  and thoroughly enjoy the great pepper flavor. As long as you have a good pepper mill and grind it fresh, this is really the best I've found.

review/text: After buying a pepper mill I did some online sleuthing to find out that this peppercorn was highly & positively reviewed. I am no at all a foody but bought this as a gift for my wife (who is an amateur gourmand). She raves about this pepper. It is a large bag that at our rate of consumption will probably last at least five years.

review/summary: True Tellicherry Peppercorns?
review/text: It is said that the Tellicherry is "the largest of the peppercorns".  The product that I received must be from a miniature variant.  Measuring in at a scant 2.5mm, my grinder turns these little corns into dust, even at the coarsest setting.  The taste however, is excellent.  I will utilize these in recipes calling for "hand-cracked" peppercorns, and will use a light hand when I do.

review/text: It's difficult to explain the difference that fresh ground Pepper makes in savory dishes.  And quality pepper very much more so, and this is a very high quality pepper.  I bought it at the same time I purchased a new pepper mill.  Poured in the pepper and made eggs, once over easy with lots of pepper;  fresh, fragrant, inviting.  What a refreshing difference it made in both the aroma and taste of the eggs.  Now I use it when ever I create savory dishes.  It adds richness to stews and life to meat dishes.  My chili recipe how has a spark that was missing before.  An excellent product that I enjoy so much that I gave part of the package to my son, a self taught chef.

Most food has to have pepper and this makes everything better.<br /><br />I took mine out of the bag and put it in a mason jar.  I figure it will keep its flavors better in there.

We make Blood Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies, Brownies, Scones, etc.<br /><br />The combo of grapeseed oil & olive oils makes for a higher flash point when cooking, so they are great saute oils.

review/summary: Wonderful flavor!
review/text: I was lucky enough to grab this on Woot.com along with 3 other flavored oils (4 bottles for $44) and they are fantastic.  The garlic infusion is fragrant, leaving a delicate garlic flavor to meats and vegetables.  I have used it to marinate chicken, filet and salmon with equally good results.  Also, cooking a batch of fresh summer veggies in a little of this oil infuses a wonderful flavor into them.<br /><br />The lemon infused oil is wonderful for fish or chicken.  It has a robust flavor and a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Definitely a re-order for me!! :)

review/summary: Amazingly Versatile Red Chili Oil!
review/text: I have tried and loved all of the Exravagonzo infused olive oils, but my favorite is the Red Chili oil.  I have used it in everything from salmon to citrus salad to chocolate chip cookies.  My chocolate chip cookies have always been popular, but the addition of the Red Chili oil has taken it up a couple more notches.  Wow!

review/summary: Best Infused Olive Oil I have tasted!!!
review/text: I have been purchasing Extravaganzo Olive Oils for 3 years!  They are the best!  I love the lemon infused on salads.  Much healthier than ranch dressing.  I have used the orange infused to make chocolate chip cookies!  OMG - devine!!  I have also been taking a bottle as a gift to various parties - in lieu of a bottle of wine. Makes for a creative twist!<br />But don't take my word for it - taste it yourself!<br />Lisa

review/summary: Misrepesented product description
review/text: This is advertised as an Extra Virgin Olive Oil Super Premium. Not so. Upon receipt the label says olive oil and grapeseed oil. Cloying and dominate grapeseel oil flavor. Neither the Red Chli, the Meyer Lemon, nor the Blood Orange Infused rises to the flavor profile expectation. Plus that grapeseed oil dominance is nastique. I ended up throwing all three bottles in the trash. I would never buy any of this product line ever again. Very disappointed.<br />After many years of purchasing from Amazon, this is my first disappointment.

It  has a high "smoke" temp and I  use it in dishes  where  heat/temperature is  significant.  I have tried the other  flavored  oils and like the lemon  and garlic the best. My hope is that they will come out  with a sesame or ginger flavored oil..that would be  great !

review/summary: Not as Natural Anymore
review/text: I have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years. It was the only canned turkey sold in North America that contained no food additives. It was just turkey, water, and sea salt.<br /><br />As of this month( March 2011) new labelling and contents have appeared. The label now proclaims "Better Flavor".<br /><br />The product now contains 50% more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing "reduced sodium" vesions of their tradtional products.<br /><br />Worse yet, the "Better Flavor" is achieved by adding "rice starch", "vegetable starch" ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch) and "broth" - which contains, among other listed ingredients, "natural flavor" (derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ).<br /><br />This product is now useless to me as I am highly sensitive to corn products. While the label still claims the product is gluten free, which was pretty much guaranteed before, since it had only turkey, water and sea salt in it, this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive, there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and "flavors"<br /><br />The company needs to re-think this change. What made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets, was their plain and simple good food. Now they are little different from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives.<br /><br />They can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn, processed starches, who are on the Atkins or no grain diets, who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes, and who avoid processed food additives in general.<br /><br />The company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say "potato starch" rather than "vegetable starch" AND in bold print say "Contains Corn" to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product.<br /><br />Hopefully this "Better Flavor" change will be about as successful as New Coke" and we will see Valley Fresh "Classic" Turkey in a year so.

review/summary: Labeling is Incorrect
review/text: First I wish to say I have no problem with the quality of this product.  It is a good, fairly low sodium turkey.<br />My problem is in the serving size information.  The can says serving size is two ounces DRAINED and there are "about four" servings a can.  To me this means between 3.5 and 4.4 servings a can - or 7.0-8.8 ounces of turkey per can.<br />I have weighed the last three cans and the drained weights are 5.7 ounces, 6.0 ounces and 5.9 ounces.  This is about 15% less than the stated minimum on the label. At this average you are paying $8.75 per pound of meat.<br />Quality product but you are NOT getting the quantity advertised.

review/summary: Disappointing changes
review/text: The Valley Fresh 100% Natural White Turkey in Water as shown here, and as I've been ordering for quite some time, is excellent. It contains only turkey, water and salt. I order it because my daughter and I have a large number of food sensitivities, which makes finding whole foods without added ingredients difficult.<br /><br />For those of you who use this product because you need to know EXACTLY what's in it, the company has changed the product, and it is no longer what you see here. It has rice starch, "vegetable" starch...who knows what that means...and turkey broth, which could mean anything, including onion, garlic and yeast...all of which will set my daughter and I back. By that, I mean it will take months to recover from the damage it's likely to do.<br /><br />Please take a look at the ingredient list on the Valley Fresh site for their exact listing. A great disappointment! And now I have a ton of product that only my husband can use.

review/text: This is a great product!  Rather than the highly processed turkey slices generally encountered in "convenience" foods, this gives you genuine chunks of cooked turkey breast with natural flavor.  I prefer it for sandwiches, and would not be afraid to substitute it for home-cooked turkey in any recipe.  (I suspect that turkey has lower fat content than chicken--if so, this product might be substituted advantageously for chicken in many uses).

With only 20 calories, 5 carbs and 0 fat per mint, I don't mind using them freely.

review/text: The first time I had Citrusmint I liked it a lot and for a long time it was my favorite gum flavor.  For some reason they decided to change the "recipe" (I noticed the flavor was off and then saw 'new improved flavor' or some such notice on the package).  SangriaFresca became my new favorite flavor and remained so until Wrigley stopped making it a few months ago.  Anyway, this is a gum that keeps its flavor a long time, but it's a bit strong (hint of orange peel maybe?).  I still like it better than most fruit flavor gums.

So this is a decent deal.<br /><br />The coffee should be oily, dark and smelly snappy and fresh. If yours is not (mine was fine) then send it back. Life is too short to drink lousy coffee.
