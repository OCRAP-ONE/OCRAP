review/summary: Spectacular Flavor!
review/text: Since receiving my Jolokia powder (with very fast shipping), it has quickly become my favorite spice.  The flavor is very reminiscent of Cayenne pepper, except that the Jolokia powder has more flavor than the Cayenne.  It also has a lot more kick (though I admit it is not as spicy as I expected, based on reputation - it made me sweat, but my head did not explode).  If you find the Jolokia powder too spicy, I might suggest mixing it with some Cayenne powder, as the flavors are so similar.  I've not tried this myself, but it should be good.<br /><br />In short, if you like Cayenne powder but you want more kick, Jolokia powder is perfect for you.  If Jalapenos make you sweat... well, let's just say you should look elsewhere.

review/summary: Killer flavor with brutal heat!
review/text: I have always loved the Sonoran Spice Company. Their products are very high quality. And the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper) powder just proves that they're a chileheads' delight.<br /><br />I ordered both this and 1.5ox of habanero powder. in comparison to the habanero the ghost pepper powder is coarser in texture. Actual pods of both the habanero and ghost pepper were also packed with the order in heat-sealed zip-seal bags. Having the pods adds more to the conversation.<br /><br />But the ghost pepper heat and flavor is right there. It's a bit sweeter when compared to the habanero (at least to me). But the heat kicks in a few seconds later. And it does live up to the hype in regard to the heat. You don't shake this wildly over your yummies. A slight dusting is good to start with. For some it may be too much. But we're chileheads, right? The ghost pepper is a killer example of an attitude adjuster.<br /><br />For heat-seeking adrenaline and endorphin junkies you can't go wrong with this.<br /><br />Sidenote: For those who want to give the ghost pepper a shot yet don't want to spend $11+shipping on this you may want to check your local stores for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070XYM1I">Tropical Pepper Company Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce 5 Fl Oz</a>. I found it at Sprankles' supermarket in downtown Kittanning PA for $2.75 for a bottle of magnificent ghost pepper heat. It's a good way to experiment first before going all-in for the pure purgatory of this pepper powder.

review/summary: Not insanely hot, but just right
review/text: I've always liked hot stuff, but lately I've found I need more and more to get the same kick.  I guess I've developed a tolerance? I'm not a fan of ground habanero, because it changes the flavor of the food too much, so my go-to spice has always been cayenne.  But in order to get the heat level I want, I use so much that it  flavors the food as well. I finally got around to ordering this, and I'm very pleased.  I get just the right amount of heat without the flavor overpowering the food. It's no where near as hot as I was expecting, though.  I've seen it on several TV shows where the chefs make a big deal about it with gas masks and gloves like it's DEFCON 1. I don't know if this has the heat that a ghost pepper SHOULD have, as I have never tried it before, but I would hazard a guess that this has about triple of what your average grocery store cayenne powder has.<br /><br />P.S I give the seller 5 stars - Ordered late Saturday and received on a Wednesday!

review/summary: Properly used the ghost pepper has a great taste
review/text: I put between 20 and 25 grains of pepper powder into a bowl of chilli.  It put a very good flavor into my bowl of chilli.  I enjoyed the taste of the ghost pepper powder.  Now that said, 5 minutes later the burn in my mouth was still getting hotter.  It was not too hot but just the fact that it kept getting hotter minutes afterwards left me with a respect that I will keep in mind.  Yes it does have a good flavor but this pepper is hot and I am sure that using 50 to 55 grains would have made the hot part not very enjoyable.  I enjoy hot sauces and have made my own for years but you need to approach the ghost pepper with lots of respect.  I will use this powder to make my own hot sauce but it will be a sauce that you can can enjoy.

review/summary: Somewhat hot.
review/text: I guess I have a high heat tolerance, because this only seemed maybe two or three times as hot as a grocery store habanero. (according to scoville rating, the weaker grocery store habaneros are about ten times less than this, the red savina which I have never tried is supposed to be three times hotter)<br />That isn't why I'm giving this only three stars though.<br /><br />First off the taste - it was terrible. I haven't tried the peppers themselves yet, but the powder tastes awful I've tried it with soup and chips, and it worked slightly better with chips - and made my soup taste bad. It's a bit hard to describe - bitter and dry I guess would be the best way to describe it. Not sweet like I expected... I have heard ghost peppers have a somewhat similar sweet taste to the habanero. In this powder though I don't taste that at all.<br /><br />Second this stuff is very... dust like.<br />you have to be very careful pouring it, because it is ground so fine that it gets into the air easier than anything I've ever seen. Fortunately when I breathe it in, it doesn't really burn - I guess it's just to small and insignificant of an amount to do that, but it does make me cough a lot.<br /><br />I'll update the review a bit more once I try out the peppers themselves, even though they are a bonus.<br /><br />Edit: I got around to trying the peppers themselves, and the taste was similar. Perhaps I just don't like the taste of these peppers. I definitely would not call them sweet tasting at all though.

review/summary: Out of Control
review/text: As advertised, this powder is exceptionally powerful.  A little bit...and I mean about two very gentle shakes of the container...into a pot of baked beans and franks overspiced the concoction even by my maniacal standards.  Worse yet, it introduced a taste that I might describe as gunpowder but in any case was somewhere within the realm of acrid.  I had hoped that, with more power, one could get the heat with almost no taste influence.<br /><br />But the biggest problem was the container.  There is no easy way to control delivery to a single portion.  I bought this product because I couldn't find the one I love, whose name I no longer know, which is granular and comes in a container with a grinder.<br /><br />I will have to throw this away before it destroys a meal or hurts someone.

review/summary: The Marriage of Sweden and India
review/text: Cardamom is the essential spice in Swedish sweet breads and pastries; without cardamom, a Danish pastry is just a Missouri sticky-bun filled with jam. Adventurous Swedish cooks - both of us - also use cardamom in fruit glazes for roast chicken.<br /><br />But cardamom is quintessentially an Indian spice, one of those that Vasco da Gamba and Cristoforo Colon sailed over the edge of the world for. It's included in most "garam masala" spice blends. It's also one of the prominent flavors in 'tom ka gai', the Thai chicken-coconut soup. Indian shoppers in San Francisco buy it in one-pound sacks or larger. Some Indian people, especially older men, chew cardamom like candy or gum, to improve their breath and their amative fervor. Cardamom ice cream is rapidly becoming popular in Cambridge, Masssachusetts, as well as in the SF Bay Area. Coffee drinkers from Austria to Afghanistan, and especially in Turkey and Lebanon, often flavor their beloved drink with cardamom. Chocolate and cardamom also blend well; adventurous Mexican cooks - me - sometimes add cardamom to 'mole poblano', the chocolate-chili gravy used with turkey and chicken.<br /><br />Once ground, cardamom loses its flavor very quickly; a small bottle of cardamom powder is convenient but should be used within two weeks at most. Serious cardamom-lovers buy it whole, in the pod, and grind the small black seeds as needed, in a 'dedicated' coffee mill or with a mortar-and-pestle. The green outer pods shouldn't be wasted; they can be used to flavor stocks that will be strained, or added to the grounds in a filter cone to make coffee. More intense cardamom flavor in coffee requires adding the well-ground seeds.<br /><br />Cardamom and most other 'aromatic' Indian spices lose their flavor with prolonged heat. They should be added very near the end of any cooking process, especially in curries. Anglo-American curry powder is a debasement of culinary art; it's mostly turmeric, which should be stirred into the frying oil early in the process while the aromatics are reserved for finishing.<br /><br />There are two sorts of cardamom available in American stores and here on the amazon: the small green pods and the larger black pods. They have somewhat different flavors, the black ones being stronger and earthier, but in most dishes they are interchangeable. Both kinds of cardamom are more intense when fresh, so a 4 to 7 ounce package is appropriate, assuming that it will be used up in two months or less.<br /><br />Here's a puzzle for bold chefs: what large bird should always be served with a glaze of lingonberries, chipotle chilis, cardamom, and shallots?

review/text: As a few others have mentioned, this is not a high grade marzipan.  It doesn't taste or feel like the Odense marzipan I normally buy.  This tastes more doughy or floury (like flour) (are those even words?)  It does seem fresh, and while I do find occasional sections that aren't mixed very well (chunks of almond something - looks white, not an almond though) it does taste ok.  If you were baking with it, it's probably good.  I just wouldn't use it for making flowers or little edibles.  It has a slight alcohol taste.  Not bad, but not Odense either.<br /><br />[Edit about a month later]<br /><br />I ordered another batch from this company and this package tasted MUCH better.  Still not quite top grade, but I'm changing my 3 stars to 4.  I would buy this again.

Delicious!<br /><br />It has been hard to find lately at Whole Foods in my neighborhood, and even then it is 9.99, so very glad to find it on Amazon in a three pack.<br /><br />I brew it for 3-5 minutes (again, for the health benefits) and sometimes longer and don't find it bitter, as others have cautioned.

review/text: My husband, two little boys and I LOVE this tea! We're avid tea drinkers and this is the one we consistently enjoy most.<br /><br />I prepare it in a french press and DON'T use boiling water or it'll be nasty bitter. Put the loose tea in a french press with an inch of cold water and then add your boiled water.<br /><br />We drink this with breakfast in the morning with eggs, toast and jam. Makes us feel like kings.<br />I'm thrilled to find a 3-pack on Amazon, gotta love it. It's $9 a tin at Whole Foods.

review/text: I've been eating Tinkyada pastas for over six years now.  I gave up wheat seven years ago (allergies), had tried several gluten-free pastas (yuck!), and then had Tinkyada (wow!).  In taste and texture it surpasses many wheat (semolina) pastas: When served unawares, most people will not know that they are eating a rice pasta.  It really is that good.  Bravo Tinkyada!

After hearing her rave about it, and getting tired of never seeming to find a fast-cooking, healthy meal, we tried it.  Fabulous!  I'd never know it wasn't regular pasta, and my husband, who is generally wary of my insistence on brown rice over white, was just as impressed.

review/summary: Pricey but superb taste and texture!
review/text: This is the best gluten-free pasta I have ever purchased, HANDS DOWN.<br /><br />It's firm and holds up to stirring with a spoon while it's cooking, and it's really delicious. I tastes like very high quality traditional pasta. My only complaint is that it's expensive. Compared to regular pasta, it's like 5 times more expensive. But if you have gluten senstivity, or if you prefer a brown rice pasta (healthier alternative) it is the BEST one on the market.<br /><br />I bought this one and the curly pasta, and both were equally good. So I assume that all of the brown rice pasta by this company is going to be good.<br /><br />It also takes a little longer to cook-- about 17 minutes. And you should stir it frequently so that it cooks evenly. But I don't see these as a drawback-- just an FYI.  It really does taste very good.

But I suppose it you are trying to do a diet maybe this would be an acceptable taste compared to other things you are allowed to eat? I did notice yesterday that Costco has a multi-flavored 42 bar box for around $8 after tax, so I'll prolly be getting it from there from now on.

review/text: I picked these up at a blue & yellow import store and found myself eating the entire package. These are fantastic. The texture of the cookie, vanilla top layer and bottom chocolate layer, is like a slightly denser Nabisco animal cracker. The center cream isn't all through the cookie like an oreo, but more of a center drop. It's not as thick as Nutella, very smooth and light, soft of the consistency of a slightly melted hershey kiss, but with a praline paste taste.

review/summary: Some words of warning
review/text: Ballerina are definitely my favourite cookies. I agree with the other reviewer. They are ridiculously delicious and virtually impossible to share! You just *want* the entire package for yourself.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I was so addicted to Ballerina and their sister cookies Singoalla that I could eat one package of each instead of supper. I readily admit that my stomach said "no" to that particular guilty pleasure, so these days I avoid Ballerina, not because they are bad, but for the same reason you avoid a Femme Fatale.<br /><br />Ballerina are chocolate cookies, and my only complaint is that the chocolate tends to melt, making the cookies a somewhat messy experience...unless you devour them really fast! They might give an entirely new meaning to the expression "a quick snack". Also, the cookie really gets stuck to your teeth, so don't forget a tootbrush if you're planning to eat these.<br /><br />The other flavour, Singoalla, is raspberry + vanilla, and doesn't melt.<br /><br />Personally, I recommend both. But don't tell me I didn't warn you...

For some reason the paper stuck to the barrel in little,<br />easy to miss spots.

Oddly enough, they were oval-shaped, as though they'd all gotten squished slightly during production. Of course this doesn't affect their taste or quality, but it's curious nonetheless.<br /><br />I'd probably buy again, but I might also try another brand just for comparison. If you don't already have a preferred brand, these are worthy of a try.

review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/summary: Product changed....
review/text: This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. I've enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product.

review/summary: Great salt
review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/summary: Fluoride Content An Issue?
review/text: Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.  Also, it's mined in Pakistan if that really matters.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/text: This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.

review/summary: the only salt I use--except herbamare and trocomare
review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus.

review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/text: Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.
