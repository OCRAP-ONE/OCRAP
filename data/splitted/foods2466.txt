review/summary: Garbage
review/text: I purchased the B77 on December 27, 2009 and returned it back to BJs Wholesale Club.<br />1)  The K-Cups have very little coffee inside them.<br />2)  If you want a large cup 10 oz. cup of coffee, forget it.  The size is small and the coffee is Watered Down.<br />3)  Same thing with the 8 oz. size.<br />4)  If you want an Espresso, buy something under $40.00.  Keurig screwed up with this line.<br />5)  I called Customer Service, no one picks of the phone, and you can not leave a message either.<br /><br />Final Item:  Go to [...] for more information.

review/text: I was a little skeptical but I ordered anyway and you know what?  I was pretty impressed by the product contained within the slick packaging. First was the taste which was very good and tasty subduing my appetite for anything at that time and second the psychological boost of consuming what is assumed to be good for my body. I'm no clinical scientist or nutritional specialist so I can't give analytic proof that this stuff does what it says but all I know is that it's easy to carry with you on the go to fuel your body for energy while performing anything physical.  The packaging is also great to use afterwards for storing knickknacks!!!

review/text: Took a chance ordering this brand when there was no indication how much neem there was per capsule in their online description.  It turns out there is only 100mg of extract + 25mg of powder, far far less than all the other brands, and its not even organic to boot.  That's what I get for making my decision based on it being eligible for free "super saver" shipping.

review/summary: The BEST Pepper I have ever found.
review/text: I grew up watching the Watkins man coming to my grandfathers farm every once in a while and of course in the country those were the days that everyone swore that Watkins could not be beat and for the most part they were right.  Through the years, I tried many peppers including grinding several types on my own and although I ran into some good pepper, none of them had that pizazz that I lie in pepper.<br /><br />One day several years ago I was at one of our little country stores when I saw this on the shelf and sad to say, it was not selling simply because it had a picture of a beautiful black lady on the label.  That kind of thing irritates me and because of that and because the price had been reduced I bought one and the next day I went back and bought the rest and when those ran out I found these online here at Amazon and bought a case and even gave some to family and friends and they all agree.......<br /><br />This is the BEST Black pepper I have ever found............

review/summary: Not As Packaging & Description Stated
review/text: I have used Sylvia's "Coarse" Grind Pepper in the past & loved it - really spicy & flavorful.  That is not what this product is even though the bottle packaging clearly states "Coarse" grind and the Amazon description says it is "Coarse" Grind Pepper as well.  What I received is a finely ground pepper that tastes no different than any cheap brand pepper you can get at your local grocery store.  I should have listened to one of the other reviews that stated they received a finely ground pepper too.  I feel like a complete idiot for purchasing (12) bottles of this and paying almost $20 for pepper that tastes no different than the Walmart store brand pepper.

review/summary: I prefer Sylvia's coarser black pepper to this fine one.
review/text: I was disappointed with this FINE black pepper because Sylvia's coarser one had a significantly higher pepper flavor.  This one is bland.  It almost just disapppears on whatever food you put it on.  I have to use about a teaspoon on each chicken breast just to get that peppery taste.  I will be buying the coarser black pepper but not this one.  It's like it was ground up too fine and left to lose it's flavor into the air before being bottled. I have to use so much of it during each meal just to get some peppery flavor that the case I purchased is almost gone already.  That's not at all cost effective. Give Sylvia's Coarse ground black pepper a try...that's tasty but forget this one.

review/text: Supermarket canned black pepper is so powdery and bland.  I wanted an old-fashioned pepper that I could taste.  Sylvia's pepper fills the bill.  It is pungent and flaky, the way black pepper should be.  I am sprinkling more black pepper on my food than I ever did before.  Sylvia's pepper seems to enhance every food, and the taste just gets better and better.  I really think this is black pepper #1!

Our Boston, Bullwinkle, loves them and we just didn't know what we were going to do to replace them. They are easy for him to digest because they break into small pieces and we don't have to worry about him swallowing one of those huge pieces of rawhide that causes so many issues with the digestive tract. Thanks for having them available in this large quantity.

review/summary: slightly less than what I expected
review/text: This roast wasn't as good as I expected.  I loved Cafe Altura's French Roast's very intense (almost spicy) flavor and oiliness, which I often use for espresso. Reading these reviews, I thought New Orleans blend would be similar like the french roast, but slightly smoother. The result? Hmmm... maybe my bag could be just a less great one, but my bag had more burnt taste, less oil, and less oil means less flavor and crema. So the espresso tasted more flat, as if it is less burnt version of spanish roast. It still has same darkness as the french roast, but my guess is that the New Orleans blend is roasted in higher temp. with less time and the french roast is roasted in less temp. but longer. Still, this blend produce much better espresso than Starbucks', and since it tasted above average in americano, this would make great drip coffee.

review/summary: High quality brew
review/text: Amazing price for such a quality product:  2 lbs. of dark, oily beans.  However, do not expect a "bold" taste from this blend.  It is a much more delicate coffee, with a taste that is complex but not at all overwhelming.  As I drink espresso almost exclusively now, I will definitely go for a darker coffee--french roast or similar for the next batch.  Overall a grade A brew, suitable for those who prefer a lighter taste in their coffee.  Espresso drinkers may be disappointed in the subtlety of this blend.

review/text: I've tried several other blends of Cafe Altura coffee and been very satisfied (Current fav. is breakfast blend).  This order, I decided to try something different, and I regret it.  The New Orleans Blend is intesely dark and oily.  It almost tastes meaty.  If you like really dark, nearly burnt coffes, this might be your blend.  If you're just looking for a mellow easy-drinking morning cup of joe, this one probably isn't for you.

review/summary: Smooth and drinkable but not outstanding
review/text: I am glad it is organic, and it looks as though they have put a lot into making their packaging materials healthy and earth-friendly.<br /><br />The flavor is mild and the amount of caffeine is very low.  This is probably because there is very little green tea in this mixture.  The flavor mostly comes from the toasted brown rice.  This is a nice enough flavor, but it is not really like a more traditional genmaicha which has the flavors of both the toasted rice plus the green tea.<br /><br />I prefer either the Yamamotoyama or the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company versions of genmaicha for commercially available sources.  The best tea would come from specialty importers, but that would be quite a bit more expensive.

This is not bad, but the flavor is weak, or maybe the portion per bag is too small, and I have to use two bags to get the flavor I get from my favorite (non-organic) genmaicha.  And even then, the flavor is just okay.  So, I will use what I have but continue to search for that perfect organic genmaicha.

review/text: I have been avoiding tea bags and go for loose leaf tea whenever possible because the taste tends to be better. Most tea in tea bags does not even taste like tea and most people do not even know that until they have tasted real tea! After reading some good reviews on this I was willing to give it a try and I am glad I did. This is the most aromatic tea I've had in a tea bag. I actually love genmaicha and it compares pretty well to some of the loose leaf varieties I have. I also like the wide range of flavors they offer and the staple-less bag is a nice touch. Only drawback is the price though.

review/text: I became a regular green tea drinker during the years I lived in Japan, and although I prefer loose-leaf tea I wanted some tea bags that I could drink at work.  Genmai tea is one of my favorites, and I tried this "Choice Organic Genmai" thinking it might be an affordable, convenient way to brew up some of that delicious roasted rice flavor.<br /><br />Like many, I found these tea bags to be drinkable but weak.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the loose-leaf tea I buy, but I also wasn't expecting it to be so watery.  You can get a decent cup of tea out of it if you make a small cup, but I really wish it was more robust.<br /><br />I will keep drinking my way through the box I bought, but I don't think I will go back for seconds.  There are probably better tea bag Genmais out there.

It's not bad, but it's definitely nowhere above average.  It essentially tastes like a rather weak green tea.  Whatever brown rice is in there is barely noticeable at all.  If you didn't know this was genmaicha you would think it's just regular green tea.  And not that great green tea either.  I expected more from Choice and will go back to buying the japanese brand.

review/text: We've always purchased cheap dog shampoo from Walmart and our two yorkies would always start smelling bad a few days after their baths.  I'd give them a bath at least once a week and noticed they were always scratching...so I figured out I was bathing them too much.  I looked up Shampoos and decided to go with this one.  I used the Fresh N Clean Flea and Tick shampoo and followed it with this conditioner.  It works GREAT.  I now give them a bath every few weeks and they don't stink anymore!  I can't believe how much of a difference this makes.  I'm very happy with my purchase and will be buying this again when we run out.

review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/text: This illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink is very nice served over ice! The coffee flavor is not very strong but it is nicely sweet and packs a good caffeine (81 mg) kick, making this a refreshing "pick me up" on a hot afternoon.

review/summary: Lighter Alternative to Frappuccino
review/text: I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Frappuccino</a>, but I don't get to drink it too often since it's a bit on a heavy side for a casual coffee-based drink IMHO. illy issimo cappuccino is a much lighter alternative to Farappuccino: it has half the calories (100 vs. 200) and fat (1.5 g vs. 3 g), albeit in a slightly smaller serving size. The lightness, of course, comes at a price and illy issimo cappuccino tastes as light as you would have expected it. It is made of medium-brew coffee, which is not that bad, but I prefer more full flavored varieties. This is a fairly tasty coffee-based energy drink, but it's not as impressive as illy issimo's espresso drinks. Nonetheless, I've enjoyed drinking it and would recommend it to most coffee lovers in a search of a convenient and tasty energy drink.

review/summary: Not too sweet, with a mocha flavor
review/text: This is one heck of a good cold cappuccino drink. I like this much more than the syrup sweet thick Starbucks variety.<br /><br />Illy is a maker of excellent espresso coffee and machines. They are all over Europe, where the red square with Illy on it is visible, the espresso will be good - never great or spectacular, but never bad; always the same, always very good. It makes sense that they would produce a very nice clean not too sweet iced cappuccino drink in a can.<br /><br />The comparison to Starbucks Frappuccinos is just too easy to make. Starbucks packs 180 calories and a lot more sugar in their drink. They are good and tailored to the sweet tooth, more like a sweet soda pop than an espresso beverage. Illy's drink is about half as sweet and feels a lot thinner in the mouth. These are all good things. There's a good strong flavor of an espresso. The milk flavor is slightly burnt or caramel, a good flavor that reminds me of steamed milk.<br /><br />Illy does something a little bit different from Starbucks. Where Starbucks builds their mouth feel with sugar, Illy has chosen to use a bit of gum in the mix (carageenan, cellulose, and cellulose gel). It's a very simple food science issue, milk and coffee alone will end up feeling like water from the can. In order to make the drink taste rich, they have to add some body to it - Starbucks chose sugar and Illy chose gum. I'd take the gum over the additional sugar any day of the week.<br /><br />I really like this drink a lot more than Starbucks. I love the clean espresso and milk flavor without the sweetness. I liked this drink so much I've purchased a four pack and shared it with my wife. She really likes this drink also.

review/summary: illy issimo cappuccino
review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: My favorite tea in the whole world. Period.
review/text: Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews on the t-bag version of this item (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR14WO">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a>), many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.) But for godssake, try the small size before buying 1 lb of it!<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there was more pu-erh itself than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces). When I peak inside the bag I really see more pieces of this and that than tea (and chocolate + orange should never cost $43/pound; this is what it comes down to). This works better for re-steepings than the t-bags, but it doesn't go as far as most cooked pu-erhs.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals "eeew". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor just wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I mix it with regular pu-erh! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I">Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha works beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the super yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!

review/summary: Too bitter
review/text: I ordered this tea along with the Mint Puerh, and my review holds for both.  While this tea is a good value, it's way too bitter for my taste.  There are no brewing instructions on the bag, so I've tried different amounts and different times, but the result is always bitter tea.  Unless I can figure out how to brew it without the bitterness, I won't be ordering this again.

review/text: I bought this tea because I loved Numi's Chocolate Puerh tea in teabag form. Having tried it loose I think I'd recommend getting it in bags unless you are considering making this one of your staple teas.<br /><br />The tea settles in shipping so it's hard to get a proper mix of ingredients when you are brewing a cup. I really enjoy this tea... when I can get the right ratio of leaves and spices.

review/summary: Don't bother with the tea bags -- go for the full leaf!
review/text: Pu-erh is a tricky tea to talk about.  It is part of an ancient tradition of health-giving teas that isn't discussed or researched in the west. It comes from old (reallllly old) tea plants/trees.  It's aged in caves (natural or more lately, man made -- though purists will probably break out into cold sweats and loud fights over that one.)  This is the tea whose long tradition is of being given as a wedding gift -- like the envelopes of money in the Godfather movies.  Everyone brings pu-erh from their own stash, and contributes it to the newlywed's new stash.<br /><br />Pu-erh comes in green and black varieties -- this one is black.  Green is usually milder in flavor, and has less caffeine.  Black is considered more potent.<br /><br />Well -- this is very mild and smooth.  Delicate, in fact, like the best pu-erh touchas I've had.  The chocolate is an added bonus (who is ever going to argue with chocolate -- either for its taste -- or its own healthy attributes!)<br /><br />The chocolate and the pu-erh are both so complex that your best bet is to just dive in.  It tastes good -- especially with a little milk/half and half and a tiny bit of sugar (don't muck around with chemical sweeteners on this one. -- go for natural.)<br /><br />And go for the loose tea over the tea bags. I've had both -- and there's a depth of flavor in the steeping of this loose tea that really makes a difference.

review/summary: Doesn't Begin To Compare With the Real Thing
review/text: I usually buy Pu-erh tea at a store about 40 miles away, it comes in an orange box for less than 1/4 of the price of this (per pound). I haven't been able to get to that store for a while, and was having Pu-erh withdrawal, so I decided to try this. I don't know if this isn't aged, if it comes from inferior trees, or it's something else in how it's processed (or a combination of all of them), but this doesn't even begin to compare with the wonderfully complex and slightly pungent "real" Pu-erh that I've been drinking for the last twenty or so years. A real disappointment, I hope that Amazon gets the "real" product from China for sale someday - until then, I guess I've got a drive to take.

review/text: I am no tea expert by any means.  I do drink alot of coffee though.  Probably too much, and Ive been looking for a way to ween off of it.  I found this tea to be a great coffee replacement.  It tastes good alone, but even better when brewed with a fruity tea like Celestial Seasons Wild Berry Zinger.  Ill be going to the market to look for other flavors to combine with this tea.  This Black tea gives a nice boost without jitters and without as much caffeine as coffee.  I hope to lose weight by cutting out all that cream and sugar too.

review/summary: Big on ingredients, minor on flavor
review/text: This isn't the greatest Progresso soup I've had. It does have a huge amount of solid ingredients in it, which is great. Unfortunately the broth and the flavor are not as strong as I would have liked given the fact that it's supposed to be "roasted chicken with garlic." The garlic is what I was really hoping for, but it wasn't a very discernible flavor in my bowl. As you can see from the photo on the can and the photo I uploaded, this soup comes with chicken, penne, green beans, corn, tomato, and carrots. The vegetables did come out a little on the mushy side when I had it, microwaved at 3 minutes in a 1000-watt unit (the directions recommend 2-4 minutes), while the penne was just a little firm but in better shape than the veggies. The chicken doesn't look incredibly appetizing (it looks like it's been sitting in some broth in a can, frankly), but it tasted fine and the texture was normal. Overall it was a decent-tasting soup and it did its job of filling me up; you gotta love Progresso and the ridiculous amount of food they can fit into these cans. The broth did leave an unpleasantly-firm ring of color around the bowl as I continued eating. Nothing that wasn't easy to wash off, but just...you know...that's what you're eating, is all.<br /><br />Not a bad soup, but not a great one. You could do better with Progresso than this one.

If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars.

review/text: I make this in a bread maker and let it rest there - it's easy to do and doesn't take a lot of work. The resulting crust tastes very good - lots of flavor and no off characteristics. I haven't had much luck getting it punched down and rolled out thin enough to make real "pasta fina" crusts but I think that has more to do with my technique than the product. If you've been using the store-bought premade crusts, this will take longer and is a little more work but is a humongous gigantor improvement. It's made pizza night popular around here again.

review/summary: "Do it yourself" Pizza with Mama Leone's Crust Mix
review/text: Making your own Pizzas can be great fun - not only for yourself, but it makes a great "party".  I mixed the yeast packet with the dry mix, then I only use about 1 cup of dry mix to make "individual" pizzas.  I pat the crust to about 6 inches.  Since I usually make 2 at a time, one packet of pizza dough makes about 6 or 7 separate meals for my husband and me.  Mama Leone's crust mix with Rosemary and Basil is fantastic.  Purchasing through Amazon certainly made it easy.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Love It!!!
review/text: I love Bob's 10 grain flour. I replace 1/4 to 1/3 of regular/whole wheat flour with this flour to add more nutrition and taste to the foods I make. I love using it when I make homemade pancakes, and my husband doesn't even notice it when added to most things I make that he will eat. 10 grain flour should be a staple in every kitchen.<br /><br />***Edit 9/12/12***<br />I now use this 100% instead of regular flour. I find that the combination of grains creates a finished product that is somewhere in between a 100% whole wheat item and a 100% white flour item. So if you are used to a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and white flour when you make muffins, pancakes, etc then you could use this 100% and the texture would be very similar. I think the only think that I have ever decided I don't like about this product is the fact that it does contain soy. If this flour didn't have soy it would be absolutly perfect as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: Great chips
review/text: Hi:<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack of these 2 ounce bags (size you would get at Quiznos or Subway with a sandwich) since they were less than I could get them at Costco in a equal pack of Frito chips. I had tried previously by buying a bag at my local Albertsons and they are good. Good chip for dipping sicne they're a little thicker than Lays. The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.<br /><br />NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand. Use a knife or scissors.

review/summary: Ranch isn't only good with tortilla chips....
review/text: I have been a longtime fan of Kettle Potato Chips, since I was a small child. The terrific texture and "crunch" of their product never leaves me disappointed - what's more, the high quality ingredients that go into the top-of-the-line flavors they have are first rate. Zesty Ranch does not fail to disappoint me. The Ranch flavor has a terrific, zippy quality (like the flavor name would suggest). It livens up your taste buds, and I am pleased to say that it isn't too salty, nor too greasy. Each chip is packed to it peak with flavor, and it is far from skimped upon. You almost don't need any dip or sauce of any kind on this snack. It speaks for itself. Highly recommended. Makes me want to go crunch on some right now!

review/summary: Most of the Bags were open
review/text: I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years.  I was very excited to find them on Amazon.  I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).<br /><br />When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale.  I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.  Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service.

review/summary: Yummy chips!
review/text: My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!

The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ ! They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Krinkle makes very thick chips, what's even better is that the krinkle cut chips feel even thicker because they are krinkled or have ridges in them.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing. I like the peppery flavor of these.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/text: These Kettle potato chips are great. I love the krinkle cut because it gives the chip great texture when eating it. Those thick ridges also allows more of the seasoning to stay on the chip. The pepper in this really stands out so if you're not a fan of fresh ground pepper flavor then don't buy this. These chips are rich, bold and delicious. The quality of the potatoes used are excellent. I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: These chips have great flavor as is but I am more into the buffalo wings flavor more than the bleu cheese flavor, but it's a combo that seems to work well, I probably would like it even more if it just had the heat and flavor of just the buffalo wing sauce. And you cannot beat the crunch on these.

review/summary: Buffalo Bleu
review/text: I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer.
