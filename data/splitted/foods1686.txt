review/text: I started using powdered coconut milk mostly because it has a longer shelf life and is less expensive than the pre-mixed kind.  I drink regular milk but I also travel a lot and it goes sour sometimes. I enjoy powdered coconut milk more than regular powdered milk. This brand tastes great and doesn't clump as long as you mix it a bit thicker to start with.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: It's not easy finding good fish stock.  If I want really good stock, strong fish stock, I make it myself.  Can't always do that though.  I've gone through a few cases of this product and have been happy with the results every time I've used it.  Unlike other fish stock that is primarily vegetable broth (e.g., Kitchen Basics Seafood Stock), this product is represented to be, and tastes like, 100% fish stock.  They do uses spices (onion, celery, dry white wine, lemon, bay leaves, salt, whole peppercorns, parsley).  It tastes good but I don't really notice any of the spices.  So the use of spices seems to be minimal, which for me is good.  I like to add my own spices.  They claim the product has all-natural ingredients, which I also like.  Anyway, I recommend this product.

review/summary: thin stock
review/text: My order came in the swift, efficient Amazon fashion we've all come to expect. I wish Amazon  could have made this product. Amazon does things thoroughly and very well indeed. Sadly, it seemed to me the fish stock I ordered was not much more than clam juice. It was not a usable fish stock. I tried reducing it, but the result was too salty for inclusion in any dish. I'm sorry about this. Bar Habour, the town, is very familiar, and I'm fond of it. This makes me feel I'm profaning its name, when in fact, it's only this product that discourages me.

review/summary: Great product overall
review/text: Summary: Great (if kind of gross) product for distracting my puppy, but there is a slight choking hazard.<br /><br />My crazy but adorable Boston Terrier is extremely high strung and suffers from separation anxiety. These sticks were recommended to us in order to help distract her while we are away from home. When I first gave her a bully stick, she immediately waltzed off with it and proceeded to find somewhere to "bury" it; which was fun because she had never done that before with a treat. Now I find bully sticks in the laundry hamper, under my pillow, between the couch cushions, and other strange places (she once tried to hide one under my arm, which really didn't work out too well for her). When she gets around to chewing on one, she happily munches away. Between the "hiding" and the chewing, Chompers is occupied for quite some time. The sticks look really nasty once they have been used for a while, but they don't smell or leave marks on the carpet.<br /><br />Now for the down side: While safer than rawhide, these treats do occasionally choke my dog. The hard stick turns soft and stringy when chewed on for long periods of time. Since the dog can't really bite the stringy stuff off (hard to explain unless you see it), she will try to swallow stringy stuff attached to the remainder of the stick and choke on it when it gets caught in her throat. This is not a problem when I am home because she get my attention when it happens and I can pull the stringy stick parts out of her throat. When we leave the house, we have to make sure all the stringy bits are cut off of her sticks so she won't choke while we are away. I don't know if anyone has had similar problems (please let me know if you have found solutions!!!) but it was a little scary at first to see her choking. I'm not sure if she would be able to resolve the choking situation without our help.

review/summary: Works GREAT for training!
review/text: I've been taking my one-year-old jack russell/basenji pup to dog classes and thus train with him pretty regularly. I've been trying out all kinds of treats to train him with and this one, by far, takes the cake. I call these bully sticks my "magic wands" because I practically control his every movement with the stick until he gets it. My pup will do ANYTHING to get one! I started with the smaller order (10 sticks) because I wasn't sure if he'd like them, but I have no hesitation about ordering them in the largest bulk I can now. And to top it all off, they're mess-free, unlike many other chews out there.

review/summary: Pooch Is Happy
review/text: So far, our Cairn is happy with the purchase. He absolutely loves bully sticks, and we like the teeth cleaning factors they offer. Our dog is what we call a "Super Chewer". Once he gets a bully stick, he can't leave it alone until it's finished. With the Downtown Pet Supply bullies, it takes about one hour for our dog to chew it down to a 1-1/2" piece. Considering how much our dog loves to chew, I don't feel like the bully wears down too quick. We typically give our pup a break at the 30-minute mark so the bully lasts several days. We try to steer clear of giving him too much protein all at once.<br /><br />What we do like with the DPS bullies is the size. DPS claims they are 6" sticks and they don't disappoint. Out of the entire 18 pack, we didn't find one under 6 inches so they aren't skimping on product.<br /><br />In the past, we've bought the expensive bullies from Petco, but we feel these are by far the best value. For the most part, they don't stink too bad. We can't speak to the claim they are free range, but the good news is they don't reek like a barn full of bulls! What really matters is we will buy these again and couldn't find a reason to give them less than 5 stars!

review/summary: one of my dogs really likes them
review/text: I have 2 Chihuahuas (4 pounds, and 6 pounds).  The small dog is finicky; he likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00106ZXU0">Nylabone Nutri Dent Edible Dental Chew, 36 Count Extra Value Pack</a>  The larger dog likes the bully sticks.  So, I give the nylabone to the small dog, and he is happy; and I give the bully stick to the larger dog, and he is happy.  The bully stick lasts for an hour or longer.  It is something natural for him to chew-on, and it  helps to keep tartar and plaque down.  I give it to him every 3 days or so.<br /><br />There is an odor to them when I open the bag to take one out.  When they are sealed in the bag, you can't smell them.  When the dog is chewing on it, you can't smell it.  And they don't leave residue on the carpet or furniture.<br /><br />They come in different sizes and quantities.  Here is a larger size: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MA04LY">12" BULLY STICKS - Large Select Thick - Dog Chew Treats, 12 inch (4 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a><br /><br />You can also buy these directly from DogStuff4u (which I did); just Google that name; they have free shipping too.  After going to their website, just click the "bully sticks" link.<br /><br />For further dental care, I also use the following item in my dogs' water: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OVBAP8">Pet Dental Liquid Tartar Remover Liquid 16 Fl OZ</a>

review/text: Much as another reviewer indicates, these bully sticks were anything but "thick".  My dog goes through bully sticks on a regular basis and to even call them standard sized was an overstatement.  My dog likes them so I have no complaint about the quality.  The problem is he can go through these at a rate of one a minute.<br /><br />If you are looking for small bullysticks these will suffice, but you can find them for far less elsewhere.  If you are looking for sticks bigger than a pencil, keep look elsewhere.

review/summary: Stinkier than Cadet Bully Sticks
review/text: Our dog loooooves bully sticks, and they are great for keeping him occupied when we need to get work done around the house.  These bully sticks seem to be high quality and last as long as other brands.  All bully sticks are pretty stinky, however we thought these sticks were stinkier than our usual brand Cadet.  The Cadet brand sticks all smell the same stinky way - however, some of these sticks smelled like regular bully sticks and some smelled like poop.  YES POOP.  More than once I had to do a shoe-check to see if I stepped in some doo, but nope - no doo, just these sticks.  I guess we would purchase these again if they were considerably less expensive than Cadet, but otherwise, we probably wouldn't.... not because they aren't decent sticks... but because they are extra stinky.

review/summary: My dog loves them - and they are thicker than a pencil
review/text: My dog loves these bully sticks. I read some reviews saying they're "pencil thin," which I don't think is accurate. The sizes vary and some are thicker/thinner than others, but even the thinnest of the batches I've purchased so far have not been as thin as your typical #2 pencil. I'd say a thin one would be about the size of two pencils taped together, or maybe the thickness of two Twizzlers.<br /><br />I recommend storing them in an airtight container or Ziplock bag or something like that, because they are smelly...and probably smell scrumptious to dogs.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I recently got a miniature Australian Shepherd puppy, and he's been teething a lot due to his baby teeth coming in.<br /><br />I'd read that rawhide is generally not recommended, as it can upset a dog's stomach. I read statements by Cesar Milan and others that bully sticks were preferable to rawhide.<br /><br />These bully sticks are great!  My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).<br /><br />I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...  This very rarely happens (ive only seen it once in a week), but it goes without saying, if possible keep an eye on the dog while he's chewing on these, just in case.

review/summary: My Dogs Love It!
review/text: My two little doggies love these bully sticks. My peke-a-poo is a ravenous chewer so usually he finishes first whereas my bischon frise likes to take his time with it, not to mention the time he takes to find someplace to bury it before actually chewing it. Most of the time it'll take my peek-a-poo maybe an hour to an hour and a half to finish his off while my bischon frise takes maybe three hours to do so, unless my peek-a-poo steals it from him.<br /><br />The bully sticks tend to differ in smell as far as I can tell. I bought these on two separate occassions, the first bag had a mild fishy smell which I didn't mind, while the second bag had a more pronounced fishy smell. Although, the smell became milder after about a week to the point that I could only smell it if I was directly holding it under my nose. Then again, my sense of smell is a bit nulled. My mom has a very sensitive nose and she can't really stand the bully sticks.<br /><br />I sure am gonna get more of these treats in the future. My dogs enjoy chewing on them and they also do a good job distracting my dogs as well.

review/text: Our Mini Schnauzer puppy loves these. The size is good. It lasts several days. He does have other chew toys and sticks but seems to like these best. Although they are a little pricey I think they are better than plain rawhide.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: These were my first bully sticks and both my puppy and I were not impressed. The average diameter was less than 0.5" so thick is pushing it. My dog actually wouldn't even finish the things and they were donated to the neighbor's dog. Ordered other "thick" bully sticks from another site and they averaged an inch in diameter and my dog loves them.

review/summary: Worst Slim Jim's EVER!!!
review/text: I bought the 6-pack of these thinking "Hey, I bet these are way better than Slim Jim's, I LOVE THOSE THINGS, HOOOOO BOY YEAH!!!". I was wrong, firstly they are not individually wrapped. Secondly, when you try and bite into them they will loosen a tooth.<br /><br />Not to be deterred, I used my back teeth and kept chewing and chewing until viola', success!!! I maybe shouldn't have said all those bad things, they last through like 15 or so episodes of Breaking bad, and they taste pretty good. I can best describe the taste as salty sinew-laden beef jerky.<br /><br />So if you like beef jerky, and are patient, and enjoy chewing alot, I'd say go for it. Not a bad snack. Although, my dog kept looking at me all funny.

review/summary: Awesome Water!!!
review/text: I happened to find a bottle of this at Marshall's on clearance and figured it looked good, it's $1.50 how bad could it be? If it tastes terrible who cares it's just $1.50. I was amazed at the way you activate the flavor, it was ingenious and the taste was so fresh! I happened to be looking for something else on Amazon and came across Activate Drinks. I was thrilled and automatically ordered a case of the orange flavor. I'm almost down to my last bottle and was looking to order the variety case, unfortunately they are out of it. I think this is a great product for kids who don't like the taste of plain water. The packaging alone will excite them!! They get to turn the top and the flavor releases freshly into the water, shake the bottle to make sure there's no sediment on the bottom, then bottoms up and enjoy. The orange flavor has a great tangy orange flavor and has only 5 calories in a 16 ounce bottle. What a great concept!!!

review/summary: Now truly organic
review/text: This tea is a great way to get the antioxidents of both red (rooibos) and honeybush teas in one cup. I have enjoyed all the editions, and prefer full organic ingredients so this is the one for me. This is a good spicy blend that completely masks the earthiness of rooibos.<br /><br />As to the change in flavor, the Good Earth website FAQs say: ... the Sweet and Spicy Red Tea blend was changed from using an artificial spice extract to using an all natural spice extract. This change did make the blend less bold. If you ...[want] the original blend before the change, ... try the Original Sweet and Spicy - Caffeine Free ... that is NOT All-Natural.

review/summary: Excellent Spicy Fall Beverage
review/text: My first introduction to this tea came when I smelled something which was appealing and fall-like while at a meeting at work.  Looking around I discovered that a co-worker had a cup of tea and sure-enough, that direction coincided with the strongest sensation.  The label on the tea bag was strange.  I asked and he told me about this Good Earth Organic Sweet and Spicy Tea.<br /><br />Even though it was caffeine free I had to try it so I scoured the local grocery stores and found one that carried it.  It was GREAT!  Realizing that it would be inconvenient to drive out of my way just for this tea and liking Amazon.com I looked on line and found it available!  It was delivered to my home both less expensively AND with far less hassle than if I had driven to purchase it every time I needed more.

review/summary: Super disappointed with this version of this tea
review/text: I have been a long-time drinker of the Original Sweet and Spicey tea and was glad to find it in an organic version.  Since kicking the caffeine habit a few years ago, I have been drinking this tea every morning, and I really look forward to it.  But, this version is so much weaker than the original version that it just tastes yucky to me.  I understand that the original version now contains an "artificial" ingredient to pump up the taste.  Whatever it is, I'm ok with it because the original version is so much better than this organic version.  It's not worth drinking it if you don't enjoy it.  (If this is the version of the tea you start with, this may be fine for you.  But if you are used to the more flavorful version, you won't like this one.)

It also was "organic" and "all natural". the flavor of this batch, with the new labeling is completely different in taste and strength.I would not recommend it if one is wanting the original flavor that made this teas reputation. a significantly weaker flavor with a more metalic taste. really a whole different tea.not an improvement.

review/summary: No Ginseng=Milder Flavor & No Sleep Disruption! But, WAIT!
review/text: I love the flavor of the original version of this tea, but I had a big problem with it: the ginseng was at least as stimulating to my brain as is caffeine (my husband and my daughter both have an issue with this as well-and they are able to sleep fine after drinking caffeine at night!). If I drank even one cup of this in the afternoon my sleep that night would be horrible all night. This organic version *does not have panax ginseng*. Just to be sure I tested some on myself, and even after drinking it in the evening I slept like a baby that night! Yes, I do notice a slight diminishment in the wonderful flavor of the original, but it is still delicious (hot or cold, and even without any sweetener). And I can drink it any time I like!!!<br />UPDATE: July 2012 I re-ordered this tea and there is new packaging (the purple box). It *says* "NEW LOOK! same great taste" but the ingredients label is DIFFERENT! Now there is an ambiguous "natural flavors" in the list. I do not like ambiguity in ingredient lists. I must be very careful with food ingredients for health reasons. I have contacted the company and am awaiting a reply. I really hope I will not be forced to return my order and look for an alteernative.

review/text: I am currently living in Europe and wanted to send a sampling of some candy back home to the states for family and friends to try.  Initially I purchased some downtown and mailed it home (cost for each individual happy hippo was 0.45.  It seemed like it took FOREVER for USPS to get my package to its destination.  Then I found through searching on the internet that Amazon sells the candies!  Great!  I tried it and shipping was fairly quick.  The only issue I have for this is the shipping cost.  Cost for the candy for me is ~$2.50 so that means shipping cost like $5-6.  I know shipping can't be expected to be FREE but when it cost more than the product then maybe it's not worth it (I guess it depends on your needs).

They are adorably cute as they resemble little hippos.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but this is a wonderful flavor combination and a tasty little treat.

review/text: Best.  Cookie.  Ever.  My sister first brought these home from Germany.  I was hooked after only one bite.  When the cookies are at room temperature the filling in the middle is a perfect consistency.  However, beware of the high calorie count.  They are very rich, one is all you need.

review/summary: Happy Hippos are Awesome!!!!
review/text: I was stationed in Germany back in 2005-2006... I was 20 yrs old at the time and was or still am a chocoholic. They are great for that time of the month, lol. Most of the Kinder chocolates are really good. I especially like the Happy Hippos because of the smooth hazelnut cream on the inside. The outside is a crunchy thin wafer with chocolate crunchies on the outside. Bite the head off the happy hippo and you will experience a little taste of heaven. I sent a lot of these back to my little sister in Massachusetts who was 9 at the time. She loved them too. She went to Europe this year with girl scouts and brought me back a few packs. I soon rediscovered my passion for Happy Hippos. I'm so glad that they are sold here on Amazon!

review/text: I love this product line.  The chocolate walnuts are my favorite, but the dark cherries are my next-favorites.  The package is not huge and they go fast if you share them.  They are relatively expensive, but worth it.  This is truly a case of 'you get what you pay for'.<br />Everyone I shared with universally liked these.  The chocolate is not overly sweet and the cherries inside are moist and flavorful.  The cherries have a rich bing-cherry taste (dried bing cherries?) and I do not believe they are sweetened or contain any preservatives or artificial ingredients to preserve color.

review/text: This is one of the few yerba mate offerings on Amazon that is priced without a large add-on for shipping.  I favor vendors that include shipping in their price.  Of course, some of the other offers are actually a little lower priced, with shipping added.  This seems to be pretty standard yerba mate, and fresher than some I have bought.  Three kilos really is not a huge amount to buy at one time, if you drink yerba mate on a regular basis.  I prefer yerba mate over the more common Asian tea, since it is milder to the taste.

review/summary: The BEST Chai
review/text: If classic chai is your cup of tea, I don't think you'll find one better than Rishi's. My suggestion is to prepare it in the traditional manner, i.e., for every 1 - 1.5 tablespoons of chai, use 1/2 cup of whole milk, 3/4 cup of water, and 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar. Bring the chai and liquids to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for five minutes; I add the sugar after straining (it's supposed to be very sweet; add less if you like). It's really a yummy pick-me-up.<br />Rishi makes a number of organic chai blends, none of which, unfortunately, are available from Amazon at the time of this writing. I'm now going to make a confession: as good as Organic Masala Chai is, I actually prefer the other blends, all of which I prepare in the aforementioned classic manner.<br />One is called Maghreb Mint; it has a green rather than black tea base, and as its name indicates, is spiced differently from a classic chai. This one also tastes best sweetened with white sugar and is delicious. However, I drink a LOT of really fine tea (much of it from Rishi) that should be drunk "straight up," hence I'd rather have my chai "tea-free" (a contradiction in terms, I realize). My two absolute favorites are Rishi's rooibos-based chai blends: one is called Rooibos Chai and the other, confusingly enough, Rooibos Chai Caffeine-Free. Since neither of these blends contain (as far as I can tell) caffeine, the choice of names is unfortunate [UPDATE: these have since been renamed "Rooibos Chai" and "West Cape Chai," respectively and are both caffeine-free]. The one not designated caffeine-free contains something called "ramon nut" which adds a lovely, chocolatey flavor, and which is also an ingredient in another caffeine-free Rishi offering called Rainforest Chai which I also like but which some might find too peppery. These both, I find, taste better sweetened with honey or Volcanic Nectar blue agave nectar rather than sugar.<br />All of the Rishi chais can be found at Whole Foods or direct from Rishi. With any luck, Rishi will start packaging some of these other blends in canisters and Amazon will carry them; they're wonderful!

review/summary: Great masala chai!
review/text: I love this tea even though I can get all the ingredients from India and make my own masala chai. But this one has a special flavor and is organic! However, it is a little weak and does not give the full bodied tea experience of true Indian chai. So I mix strong black tea from India. Then boil some ginger before adding the tea in the water. Also, milk should always be added after the tea has boiled for a minute or so. When it all comes to the boil for the last time, add sugar/honey and strain. Boiling the tea without milk will give you more color and taste, otherwise it becomes too weak and milky.

review/summary: Mostly impressive, a touch disappointing.
review/text: First, allow me to say in summary: This is good Masala Chai.  It's a mostly balanced blend with a good mix of quality ingredients that tastes great when brewed properly; however, in its only shortcoming, the flavor of actual tea is somewhat weak, likely due to the condition of the leaves in the blend, which may or may not be Rishi's fault.  It's always possible the package was treated harshly in transit resulting in a can full of small leaf pieces as opposed to full leaves.  I won't be able to say until I'm done with this one and get more, which I probably will do.  Now only the longer version:<br /><br />I've long been a fan of Masala Chai, brewing it in pots in the traditional manner at home before it became popular in cafes and giving long-winded explanations to people why the term "chai tea latte" should never be used thereafter.  I prefer chai that tastes nothing like the mild, over-sweetened brews sold at most cafes in this country.  Instead, ones like those found at authentic Indian restaurants have been my preference, but even then I've found many do not do as good a job with their Masala Chai as I would have liked.  It is very safe to say I can be picky about my Chai.  Snobbish, even.  My supplier of choice for years had been a local tea artisan who mixed his own teas and made fantastic blends I've yet to find the match of.  Sadly, he closed some months ago leaving the world bereft of his magnificent concoctions.  This left me hunting for a new supply everywhere I could look from local tea shops, to high-end grocery stores, to the internet.  This also meant I have tried a number of Chais I did not care for.  Rishi's is not one of those.  It is, in fact, one of the better one's I've tried.<br /><br />It's made with a solid blend of ingredients.  This tea suffers no "innovations" in the name of trying to distinguish itself.  It's ingredients are whole and it's flavors generally balanced.  It's also fairly strong.  This one surprised me given the condition it seemed to be in when I opened it.  I was prepared for the worst, as most of the tea leaves seemed broken into small pieces, but came out pleasantly surprised.  In all, for someone looking for a good chai, this is an easy recommendation to make.  Considering it won the World Tea Championship's award last year for best chai, this isn't particularly surprising, though.  Also, it is certified both fair trade and organic, for whatever that is worth to you.<br /><br />What is surprising is it's one weakness.  As I've said, when I opened my first canister to brew a cup, I found no whole tea leaves.  Instead I found many small pieces of tea leaves.  From a company of Rishi's reputation this was shocking.  The predictable result was the flavor of tea was weak and unbalanced compared to those of the spices, which were strong and balanced with each other well.  This was a disappointment, and I expected not to care for the tea at all while it was brewing, but this proved not to be the case.  Still, this may have been my favorite blend were it not for that.  (As it stands the pricier Ineeka holds that spot) It's wholly possible the condition of the leaves was caused during delivery.  I won't know until my next order.<br /><br />Yes, "My next order."  In spite of it's one real flaw, I will be placing another order.  As I said, this is good tea, and really, for the price, I have not found another tea whose quality competes.  Still, I will probably take the advice of some of the other reviewers and start supplementing it with some black tea leaves of my own.
