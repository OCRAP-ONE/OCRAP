review/summary: The best bars
review/text: I have tried many protein bars in the last few years and these by far are the best. My personal trainer/nutritionist recommended these if I "absolutely had to" have a protein bar (sometines I just don't have time to sit and eat a full meal). I have tried the vanilla, peanut butter, triple chocolate and cookies and cream - the vanilla and peanut butter are the best. It's like treating yourself to a big cookie that is good for you!

review/summary: Best Power Bar.  Low Sugar
review/text: I have been searching for a power bar with high protein and very low sugar do to health reasons.  This is the perfect solution.  Tastes great...no cardboard taste here!!  The whey chocolate tastes like chocolate.  I almost feel guilty eating it!!  During vists with family and friends during Easter I was able to contain my urges during desert time.  While everyone else was chowing down on sugary cakes, pies and chocolate, I whipped out my protein bar and felt like part of the group!<br /><br />Thank you for the awesome product.  I will be ordering a lot more.

review/summary: My Doctor suggested these
review/text: So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .for dessert I have lost 14 pounds in 4 weeks and I don't have much more to lose!<br /><br />My Doctor told me that you must multiply the grams of protein in this bar times 2.5 to get the true grams of protein, since the protein used in these bars are di- and tri- peptides, and you absorb 2.5 more of the actual protein than in a regular protein meal. Therefore the true protein grams are:<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cream: 32.5g Protein<br />Peanut Butter Fudge: 32.5g Protein<br />Triple Chocolate: 32.5g Protein<br />Cookies & Cream: 35g Protein<br />Vanilla Cream: 35g Protein<br />Wild Berry Cream: 35g Protein

review/text: Gave the vanilla cookie to my husband who is a diabetic. He has been missing the sweet baked goods he used to be able to eat. He said this tasted like a cookie. The carb count is good but the fat content is high so we only use this as a treat when he really needs something sweet and other low carb food is not satisfying him. Highly recommend it in moderation. We want to try some of the other flavors now.

Sometimes there is a bit of dry after taste, but it is quickly solved with a swigg of water.

review/summary: Fantastic bar
review/text: I am recovering from pretty extensive GI surgery, so while I need a lot of protein, I have to be careful about what I eat to get it. I am on a bland diet and sensitive to many things right now, so I was having a hard time figuring out new things to eat during the day that are still somewhat healthy.<br /><br />I researched protein bars for days and all of them had either tons of sugar alcohols or were loaded with nuts or fiber. I needed one that would be easily digestible. I was SO glad when I found these but I only purchased one because I was still skeptical. Needless to say, here I am on Amazon buying them by the box.<br /><br />These bars are light, easy to digest, don't sit in your stomach like a brick, and one bar in the morning will curb your hunger until you're ready for lunch. I appreciate that they have 3 new bars that are sucralose free. I just wish they had more flavors!!!

review/text: Wafer is light weight but a package of french vanilla packs over 200 calories!  Weight to calorie ratio is important while hiking/backpacking.  This bar is lighter than most power bars on the market and tastes DELICIOUSLY like a desert!<br /><br />I only tried the vanilla flavor therefore I can't recommend other flavor but I am heading to my local Trader Joe's to get cookie n cream and the berry flavor to try (am tired of the chocolate and peanut butter varieties among all the energy bars).<br /><br />The vanilla wafer isn't too sweet and the crunch wafer is a great alternative from the usual soft/dense/chewy energy bars out there.

review/text: I've tried lots of different protein bars over the years and these are by far the tastiest (Triple Choc is the best in my opinion) - I actually look forward to eating these things!  I sometimes eat one of these in place of lunch or as a snack in the late morning and middle of the day (half in the mid-morning, half after lunch).<br /><br />The bars are relatively low-cal and have a decent amount of protein which, per their packaging, is more easily absorbed than other protein supplements.  I can't speak to their science but the bars seem to be working for me . . . I've lost around 10 lbs over the past month and put on a lot of muscle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good protein bar, look no further.

review/text: I am following a low carb way of eating and was looking for a protein bar that didn't remind me of a tootsie roll.  This is nice and crunchy, but a little too sweet for my taste.  So instead of eating it by itself, I add it to my morning breakfast of greek yogurt, nuts, and coconut oil/flax seed oil.  Now the sweetness is offset by the tartness of the yogurt, and perfectly balanced out.

I was ruined by buying some Sumatra that was recently roasted at $14/lb.  Going from that to this is like driving a Ferrari to driving a Honda Accord.  Sure, an Accord isn't bad if you know nothing else, but after having driven the Ferrari this was a disappointment.  It's not horrible, but no way its worth $10/lb.  I was spoiled and now I can't go back.  I'll use this up then go back to the heaven that was the other coffee.

review/text: These little biscuits are great for our little dachsies...pricey,but they are all natural, grain free. But this box is only  19 lbs. not the 20 lbs. advertised in the product description.  In the past they were 20lb. boxes ....now there's a little sticker covering the 20lbs printed on the box and it states there are only 19lbs!....wish they would lower the price as well. Good cookies though and they love them....

review/summary: excellent tea, blend with herbal tea for delicious midcaffeine tea
review/text: The chai mate has too much caffeine for me, as it is as much as a cup of coffee - although they claim it doesn't give you any jitters, for me it does. I blend this with one of their herbal (non-caffeine) chai's - the roobios is great - using a half-half ratio. The resultant mix is delicious with milk and a bit of honey - and is a great pick-me-up in mid morning. Teavana's teas also always make me feel better - each of their teas has a special "healing" power to it - I am not sure if it is true or not, but I do feel like I'm doing something better for my body by drinking their teas.

review/summary: Very nice chai with a unique flavor
review/text: Just got this tea in one of the IntoTeas gift sets and I'm loving it!  It's replaced my morning coffee and it much much healthier than the former with the same amount of caffeine.  Also, I have noticed that the caffeine "high" (for lack of a better word) is not as jittery as coffee but still gets the job done and gives me the energy I need in the morning.<br /><br />The taste is fantastic as well, and it's very unique.  I can't quite place all the flavors, other than of course the chai, but I'm very impressed.<br /><br />Here's to hoping the other Teavana teas I've got coming are just as good!

review/summary: Fantastical
review/text: I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the Samurai Chai Mate with the White Ayurvedic Chai  and they taste fantastic. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one, they use German rock sugar which costs a little more while most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea, and drink happy :D

Delish.<br /><br />Note - we ordered a tea kettle (on Amazon :)) that allows you to brew to specific temps. I recently learned the temp coupled with the steeping time makes all the difference.<br /><br />One more thing -- Teavana has an app. It provides directions for preparing all the teas they sell, including combinations between varieties. AND it has a little timer for steeping.<br /><br />Good job Teavana.

review/summary: Americolor is good but vendor is questionable
review/text: I've purchased many different Americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh. I purchased 7 bottles from this TCP vendor and 5 of them were old, one even had a use by date of one year before my order! Working with TCP to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with Amazon. I finally did get a refund but only for the product, not the shipping charges. The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not.<br /><br />The two yellows I ordered from TCP were good and fresh and the student pack that shipped directly from Amazon was good and fresh. I'm happy with these colors but will not order again from TCP because of the other 5 old colors.

review/summary: Company Needs to DOUBLE CHECK items being SENT.- They did, problem now solved.
review/text: Just like the others, I received two different colors. Instead of the AVOCADO and COPPER as described, we received FUSHIA and TEAL. Americolor is a nice product no doubt, but this seller must pay attention to the product description and items they are sending. Very misleading. Avocado and Copper are the main reasons why this SET was bought instead of the other sets. Either DOUBLE CHECK the ITEMS you are sending OR CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION ALL TOGETHER! Sending the box back is too much of hassle. Pay attention, TCP.<br /><br />update feb 6:<br /><br />I sent an email to TCP regarding the mistake in colors and the company is gracious enough to send me the right colors as described and pictured originally in the order. I was also informed that they will ask Amazon to revise the description on this particular set. Thank you TCP for your response and willingness to resolve this issue with less hassle. :) I am now a happy camper. Bought the edible markers from you too. thank you.

I had been hoping that buying this more expensive 12 pack would create better results than your average 4 pack liquid food coloring you can get from the grocery store. But the red in this pack still isn't the vibrant red red color you need to for say, Lightning Mcqueen. I do love the variety of hues, the fact that they have the darker primary colors and not just the pastels.

The picture shows that you will be getting a color called AVOCADO, but what I received was clearly marked as TEAL.  Normally, not a big deal.  However, I only ordered this particular collection of colors to have another shade of green besides LEAF GREEN.  There is a different collection of colors available containing TEAL which I purposely avoided.  While I am happy with the quality of the product, I am disappointed with the misrepresentation of the color selection.

Target has been my go to for supplies of Splashing Mint however, it has been "clearanced out" and CVS doesn't carry it either. So, Amazon to the rescue!  I purchased 2 12-pack boxes and think that I will buy more because as far as I can tell, this flavor and its Splashing Fruit cousin are no longer manufactured. The expiration date is well over a year from now and I'm sure that I'll go through my current supply by mid-winter. This may seem like a silly review, but I'm embracing the pleasurable simplicity of Trident Splashing Mint Chewing Gum.

There is never any doubt about how much sugar you are putting in your coffee or tea etc and no mess.  The price could be a bit cheaper but we feel it is worth it because of the benefits.

review/summary: Tastes okay but a little goes a long way
review/text: This stuff tastes good, but if you use too much its like cough syrup, and I dont mean that in a good way.  When I make a shaved ice for my son, he'll usually put 2 different flavors in it on each side, and I put a small stripe of this down the middle.  A real small stripe.  That works.  If you dump 2-3 tablespoons of this into a cup of shaved ice like other flavors, it wont get eaten.  Not as good as some other jelly belly products, but its a nice little extra flavor to use sparingly.

review/summary: Beware of the Ginger
review/text: I love Nature's Path Oatmeal. I suppose someone reading my Amazon reviews might think I love it a little too much as I have purchased and reviewed almost every flavor. That's probably true. I do eat it every morning.<br /><br />This texture of Optimum Zen is excellent, as are all of the Nature's Path Oatmeals. However, when I tasted this one for the first time, I was in for an unexpected surprise: Ginger. One of the many flavors in Optimum Zen is ginger and it is a little bit dominating. It pairs very well with Chai. However, I suspect that if you didn't like ginger, this oatmeal would not go over very well. So if you like ginger, are in for a unique oatmeal experience, buy it. If you're not sure, if I were you I would go to the local grocery store (only the organic-style stores around me carry Nature's Path) and purchase one box. You'll spend a little extra, but it'll be worth it with this flavor to make sure you like it before you buy 6 boxes.

The organic nature and lack of sugar in this oatmeal doesn't cause bloodsugar to "spike" like normal oatmeal or syrup.<br /><br />3.) Because bloodsugar isn't fluctuating (fluctuations in bloodsugar cause hunger) it is a filling and lasting breakfast leaving me satisfied for hours...<br /><br />4.) Tastes Great; I'm not kidding.

review/summary: High quality, balanced, good manufacturer
review/text: With the imminent demise of the Natura Pet brands (EVO, Innova, et. al.) after their purchase my P&G, we've moved to the somewhat higher priced Orijen line, with excellent results. Similar to Natura, Champion is concerned about ingredient quality and sources (avoid China), and produce their own food in their own plants (though Natura did not produce their own canned products). Palatability of the Orijen products we've tried (including their cat foods), and they smell like food, not gnarly "dog food" that makes you gag when you open the bag. The Acana brand from Champion is similar, but lower protein and nearly as expensive.<br /><br />I prefer the fish formulation, as dogs (and even more critically cats) have difficulties in synthesizing the omega-3 oils they need when only provided vegetable sources (canola oil and flaxseed are common). (AAFCO requirements are bogus -- they are an industry group that has rejected NRC recommendations and instituted their own, simpler ones. The NRC "upset" the industry when it required feeding tests to see if the diets actually met dietary needs.)<br /><br />Shifting to a high protein diet can seem scary, as you are likely to have loose stools for a week or so. Take it slowly (mix in with your old food) and you should be OK.<br /><br />My only hesitation (past the $60 for 30# price) is that for tiny, senior dogs the kibble size may be too large. Our nearly toothless, 16-year-old toy poodle has difficulty with it. It is about 3/8" disks, not large, but not as small as EVO or Innova "small bites" size.<br /><br />Check you dealer for Champion's "buy 12 get one free" or breeders' programs, depending on your status.

review/text: I have had my 22lb. Terrier mix on this since she was 1 yr old and she just turned 3 yrs old. She just had full blood work and liver/pancreatic enzyme readings as I have her on Atopica for allergies and they advise once yearly blood work. So far 3 tests total, one before Orijen, another after one yr on Orijen, and another after two yrs of being on Orijen. My vet said my dog has excellent blood/liver/pancreatic readings, in fact, he said better than most. In fact her readings where so good that he asked me what i was doing/feeding her and told me to keep doing what you have been cuz her blood work is so good and especialty as she is on Atopica and Comfortis. Orijen Fish is the only dry dog food I could find that didnt use chicken fat in it, which my dog is very allerigic to. My dog is also allergic to the follwing (confirmed by allergy testing, yes it was expensive)...chicken, turkey, beef, lamb, bison, pork, and most grains like rice, oats, wheat, corn, flax, etc...as well as fleas. I feel this food has saved my dogs life as I cant find another food she can tolerate and thrive on, yet she also loves the taste and is holding a perfect weight on only 1 cup a day so even though its pricey, only having to feed 1 cup a day makes it very ecomonical. I feel this is the best dog food I can buy for my dog.

review/summary: Orijen 6 Fish saved my dog's life
review/text: I have an 8 year old chihuahua named Rico. He struggled with digestive issues when he was a puppy. His vet diagnosed him with a protein allergy and said he would always have to be on a hypo-allergenic diet which is only available through vets with prescription. The food fixed Rico's digestion problems, so I thought nothing else of it. A few years later, he started having seizures. Awful, atypical seizures that would last for hours. We sought treatment from a neurologist who prescribed different medications. Some of which didn't work. Others made him loopy and unacceptably not himself. Thanks to a wonderful woman who read my post on a pet md message board, I did research on the food Rico was eating. Not good!! The food had an ingredient known to cause seizures, BHA, though none of the numerous vets we saw even mentioned food as being a culprit. I immediately researched hypo-allergenic, natural foods. Against medical advice, I took him off the medication and started him on Orijen 6 Fish that day! He has not had a seizure since then. Not one. I can't say enough good things about this food...and always doing your own research after consulting with professionals. My brother started feeding his dog this food, and I hope you'll consider doing the same.

review/summary: Impressed
review/text: I was looking for a kibble to replace the Innova I'd been feeding for many years (the change had nothing to do with quality and everything to do with not wanting to support factory farming and inhumane slaughtering practices).  Orijen 6-fish was the best I could find, short of switching my "domestic wolves" to a vegetarian diet.  I've been impressed how easily the dogs have adapted to it.  I started them on a 50% mix of Orijen-Innova, which is a quicker introduction than is usually recommended for new food.  They never had a bad poo, never had stomach aches.  They like the kibble so much that one started guarding the closet where it's stored.  I had to put the bag in an airtight storage can to stop that behavior.  Both dogs used to nibble grass after eating Innova, and they don't do that any more.  They are bright- eyed and energetic.  They aren't as gassy as they used to be.<br /><br />I should note that my dogs are young -- 7 months and 1.5 years.  I would not recommend feeding such a high protein kibble to an old dog ("old" depends on the breed).<br /><br />I found a company that delivers this at a discount if you agree to schedule regular deliveries.  And they pay for shipping!

review/text: I had been feeding my dog the same food for years but never knew he was allergic to it. I later learn that the formula was changed because it was bought out by Proctor Gamble. Go figure. My dog was chewing himself to the bone.<br /><br />I tried 5 different new foods--all of the highest ingredients. Nothing cheep for my dog. But he either was still allergic to it, wouldn't eat it, or had diarrhea.<br /><br />Then I found Orijen 6 fish formula. It was like giving my dog crack! He LOVES it. And his allergies no longer bother him.<br /><br />There's a video on the Orijen web site that I highly recommend. Between the experience I'm currently having with my dog and the food, plus learning to the extent that Orijen goes to make the freshest human-quality dog food blows my mind.<br /><br />There is NO OTHER KIBBLE that is as good as this food. Hands down!!! It's worth every penny.

She hasn't had any problems such as diaherra, stomach problems or anything of the sort.

review/summary: Healthy - but pricey
review/text: Like another reviewer, I'm in the same boat with puppy allergies. My dog is very allergic to chicken - even just two of those chicken jerky (all natural) treats has her with flaky skin and itching by the next day - and it's extremely hard to find dog food that doesn't at least use chicken fat, if not chicken meat as filler due to the comparatively low cost of poultry.<br /><br />My pup is thriving on Orijen Six Fish. Her coat is shinier than it has ever been (it took a very long time and multiple brands of dog food to figure out that chicken was the problem). Her muscle tone has always been decent (she's a dobe/sheppard mix) but now those muscles are 'sculpted', and although she's never been over-weight, her waistline has also never been so well defined. She is sleek, shiny, bright eyed, and always full of energy. Prior to the Orijen her coat was dull and flaky constantly. You could feel sores under her coat and on rare occasions she'd have to go to the vet for steroid shots. Even on Wellness, Evo, Taste of the Wild, etc, etc, good brands all, nothing worked for my dog's issues until the Orijen.<br /><br />On the down side, the price is outrageous for dog food. It's that simple. And although I've seen many reviews (elsewhere and one on here) giving the argument that "but because it's better quality food your dog will eat less", I have to disagree with that and say, if anything, Mazzy eats more of the Orijen than she ever did those other foods. I don't know if that's simply because she feels better (she also used to burp constantly and I worried about bloat) or if she just likes the taste a lot more, but she used to eat maybe 3 cups of food per day - maybe, and with the Orijen, she will easily eat four cups, and sometimes wake up in the night for a fifth (I semi-free feed, adding one cup at a time to her bowl when I see it empty). That's a lot of money at $40+ for only 15 pounds.<br /><br />I do think it's an excellent food, but if your dog does well on something else, I'd say go with that instead because Orijen is going to be more expensive AND hard to find if you aren't ordering online.

review/summary: Not for my doggie
review/text: Before I get into my commentary about the Orijen 6 Fish, I have to say that I have fed my dogs and cats raw for many years. We bought a 9 week old Pekingese recently from a breeder. She provided us with a 2-3 week supply of the food. I went ahead and fed it because I didn't want to change it too fast. His stools were big, soft and stinky. I found a shop that was selling it here and went out there. By coincidence they were going to have an Orijen rep there. So I talked with the rep who said that a puppy shouldn't be eating the 6 Fish and he recommended a puppy mix. I bought it and took it home. Basically I had the same results. I switched him to raw. I think  he has a bit of a nervous stomach as he has a few problems but nothing like with the  Orijen.<br /><br />I have read a lot of 5 Star reviews from people who seem to be conscientious and observant. I have also read some 1 and 2 Star Reviews from people who also seem that way. The only thing I have to say is that it is not for everybody.
