review/summary: Hubby loves the rich taste
review/text: We have one of the Senseo coffeemakers that requires coffee pods rather than the newer (and much more expensive)cups for single serve. I don't drink a lot of coffee, but my husband does and loves the Senseo coffees. Sumatra is his second favorite (he prefers Columbian, which we also order from Amazon in the Senseo brand) flavor of coffee, and he vows that the Senseo pods are as good as Sumatra brewed from freshly ground beans. It is certainly convenient to be able to brew a cup as needed, because it is always fresh, rather than stale from a day of sitting on a warmer. For anyone who likes coffee and doesn't drink a whole pot in a couple of hours, the pods are ideal, and for those who like a strong and rich flavor, Sumatra pods are a good choice.

review/summary: surprisingly... good
review/text: Okay... so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees. The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast. It's not that the roast itself was bad, it just tasted "flat" - none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods - and I was sorely disappointed. However, I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time, having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal, but the best machine - and then... when all hope seemed lost... a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast. This stuff is good coffee people! You can taste the nuances and hints of floral, chocolately, nutty, and all those other words that go with describing good coffee... so I highly recommend these pods. They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins... FIVE STARS!!!

review/summary: Not what I expected.
review/text: These coffee pods are very, very weak. I started with one pod, no flavor. 2 pods, a bit better but still weak and watery. 3 pods was all I get into my little Hamilton Beach but there was still no Hazelnut taste. I finally used 2 pods for just a half a cup and though it was somewhat stronger, there was still no taste. Very disappointed in this selection, looking around for some other brands.<br /><br />March 24, 20012<br />I like to update this review and give it 5 stars because I think I was a bit hasty the first time around. I only tried it in a cheap little 1-cup pot and I think that was the problem. I now use the pods in a 4-cup Mr. Coffee and it comes out absolutely delicious. I love the smell when it perks and enjoy the of it taste every morning. In fact, I'm ready to send in my next oder!

review/summary: Love medium roast Senseo coffee,
review/text: The Senseo medium roast coffee pods make an excellent cup of coffee every time.  It is always fresh.  Never old and burnt or sour tasting.  One reason is that it makes only one cup at a time.  The other being it is an excellent tasting coffee.  It is rich without being too strong.  Can't wait for my cup in the morning.  I have the Hamilton Beach coffee maker which uses the Senseo pods. The only problem with that is that it only holds 12 oz. and I like a 14 oz cup.  So I just let some go through and then add the other two ounces before I begin making my breakfast. Sarah

review/text: I think this is a very yummy cup.  Maybe if you are a Kona coffee expert, then maybe it isn't the best compared to the best Kona in the world.  Me, I didn't even know what a Kona was.  This coffee has no bitterness, yet plenty of flavor.  The thing that got me to love it was the pleasant, long lasting, subtle yummy aftertaste.  10 minutes after finishing a cup I notice a faint, yet pleasant aftertaste, and usually go get another cup.  It isn't the strongest, as I like very strong, large pods.  I put my Grindmaster on the tea setting and it comes out the strongest possible, yet still no bitterness.  Many folds in our small office have this as their favorite.

review/summary: Nice change of pace
review/text: I prefer the Medium Roast Senseo Pods - but the Kona is a bold, flavorful alternative to the medium.  I recommend the Kenya or the Sumatra as a change of pace,as well.  The Senseo Dark Roast tastes bitter compared to any of these other blends.

review/text: We have two coffee pots in our house the Senseo & a regular coffee pot.  We are lucky enough to be able to purchase regular Kona coffee for the regular coffee pot, so I was very happy when I found the Kona Blend.  Granted it is a blend, but it is very smooth & tastes great.

review/text: The coffee has a great taste but if you plan to make more than a 6 oz cup it's just not strong enough.  That being said, I have the Senseo that you can choose up to 12 oz cups so it's my fault for not thinking my purchase through.  The medium roast is still my favorite.

review/summary: Our favorite coffee
review/text: We drink Senseo Douwe Egberts coffee in my house every day. I usually use one pod for my morning coffee, and a "double" on the weekend. While I like all the varieties, medium roast is my favorite. We buy it by the 4-pack case in my house.<br /><br />The coffee has good body and is not bitter. I take mine with cream and sugar, but it is so easy to drink I could even go without and it still tastes great to me. The pod system is so clean and easy too. I love the fact that there is no cleanup. I think it would work especially well for someone who doesnt normally drink coffee but would like to have something nice when guests come over. Because the pods come in small lined bags, it stays fresh longer.

review/text: I've been drinking one or two cups of Senseo Medium Roast Coffee Pods almost everyday for about two years.  It's so quick and easy.  No mess.  Reliable taste in each pod.  It's not that the coffee is outstanding (I'd rate the taste as average), it's that it is so convenient and simple.  Just what I need as I run out of the house in the morning.<br /><br />I've tried the Senseo Dark Roast, but it was too bitter. And the Specialty (Brazil, Kenya, Colombia, etc.) Pods are a waste of money.  I found that none of them tasted as good as the Medium Roast.

However, if you do not like strong coffee, you can use an 8oz. coffee cup and press the double coffee button on the coffee maker and get a milder brew.<br /><br />Senseo is a great product and reasonably priced, unlike some of the other one cup coffee makers. I hope it is here to stay.

review/summary: Warning: highly addictive!
review/text: Senseo recently released several flavored varieties. Having always been partial to hazelnut coffee and being the happy owner of a Senseo coffee maker, I just had to give this new flavor a try. Well, let me tell you... I'm hooked! There is so much rich flavor in this coffee it's hard to believe the drink is calorie-free. It has the complex, subtle, thick texture and flavor of a fat- and carb-laden drink. If you've been worrying lately about the effects of your daily Caramel Macchiato on your waistline (not to mention your wallet) you have to give this coffee a try. It's wonderful and guilt-free! The pods are a little more expensive than regular varieties (the package is the same price but there are slightly fewer pods per bag) but boy is it worth that little extra!<br /><br />This flavor was all I needed to decide me to buy a second Senseo machine for my office. It's very quiet and doesn't bother my cube neighbors, and it's already paid for itself because I no longer spend a fortune at the coffee shop for mediocre coffee: I have my "candy bar in a cup" (to quote Paula) right at my desk.<br /><br />Senseo has a winner with this one... Give it a try!

review/summary: Great Senseo Blend
review/text: We purchased a Senseo coffee machine shortly after my son "borrowed" my Bunn coffee maker in March with the promise to get his own as he strolled out the door. Since I was the only person in the household drinking coffee regularly anymore instead of buying another Bunn and wasting half a pot of coffee every time I made a fresh pot of coffee, I thought I should at least look at the single cup coffee makers. I then promptly set off on a mission to find the coffee that "rocked my boat" given the fact that I was a sworn dunkin donut coffee drinker for years.<br /><br />I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees in general although they are nice to have on occassion, so I tried all of the Senseo coffees and eventually found that the Kenya Blend was the best of the lot given my individual taste for coffees.<br /><br />And then they came out with the breakfast blend. This makes a superb cup of coffee and it has effectively ended my murmurings for Dunkin Donut to get on board with Senseo and make a pod coffee just for the Senseo. Well ... maybe that is a slight exaggeration. I would still like Dunkin Donuts to team with Senseo and make a pod coffee but that only because I would like to have two superb coffee pods to chose from with one being the Senseo Breakfast Blend.

review/summary: Delicious, Fresh Ground Coffee Imported From Belgium!
review/text: Douwe Egberts makes some of the most delicious European coffee. When the Senseo Single Serve Coffee Maker was created, these single use, disposable coffee 'pods' fit together like hand in glove. 5,000,000 European coffee lovers cannot be wrong...Senseo Douwe Egberts is outstanding, fresh tasting coffee, and each imported 4 pack, (72 Single-Serve pods), comes attractively packaged in a resealable pouch.<p>Medium roast is apt to be a particular favorite for American coffee tastes. It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<p>Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup. The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top, and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up, or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.<p>I do envision the price point coming down a bit, as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation. Douwe Egberts recommends using your pods within 2 weeks, however, I've had good luck storing the extras in the freezer section of my refrigerator with no dicernable flavor change.

Every now and then I need a different kick from my coffee and until now it wasn't a possibility.<br /><br />The Vienna Hazelnut variety is quite good for hazelnut flavored coffee. My personal taste typically doesn't leave much room for liking nutty coffees. However, I am forced to make an exception for this one. It doesn't taste fake or cheap like many flavored coffees do. I prefer the other two varieties of Senseo flavored coffee more, but that is not to say that I dislike this variety, it's really quite wonderful.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: I've owned a Senseo machine for three or four years, and I generally like most of their coffees.  This breakfast blend is particularly good.<br /><br />Though I don't much like the pretentious phrasing one sees in reviews by experts, I can say that the breakfast blend is just a bit more robust than the ordinary medium roast, but a bit less than the dark roast.  It's a great coffee to have with a breakfast roll while you're reading the paper.<br /><br />I learned by experimenting that one breakfast blend pod and one decaf medium roast pod make a very good cup of "half-caf" for those who are prone to the caffeine jitters if they drink regular coffee.<br /><br />In summary, the breakfast blend pods combine the convenience of the Senseo system with a very good morning coffee.<br /><br />One bit of advice:  If you use Amazon's "subscribe and save" system, you can save a considerable amount of money on Senseo pods.  You get 15% off of the regular price and free shipping; the net savings on a 4-bag box of the breakfast blend is about $[...].

review/text: Why would I spend five bucks per latte (and take my chances with the barista's skills) when I can make my own cup of foamy happiness in less than a minute, and for so much less? Answer: I wouldn't. At least not any longer. The Medium Roast coffee pods will satisfy you whether you drink it black or take it &quot;regular&quot; (with milk &amp; perhaps sugar). I like to use one Medium pod and one Dark Roast pod for my first cup in the morning...it makes a nice, fragrant cup that packs a jolt. I'd highly recommend buying a few bags of the Medium Roast and the Dark Roast at the same time. If you're like me, you won't want to run out-your mornings just wouldn't be the same without your Senseo.

review/summary: senso coffees
review/text: I love the convenience of ordering my senso coffees through Amazon.  They always arrive quickly, and the price in bulk beats the prices in the stores hands-down.  The only thing that would make it better would be for them to offer Irish coffees in packs of four.  I'd LOVE that.

review/summary: A coffee haters first love!
review/text: I am over 50 and have never liked coffee. Loved the smell, but not the taste! I went to the Hawthorne Hotel in Salem, Ma. and the coffee smelled so good that I tasted it. I was hooked! It was Douwe Egberts, and from then on, I have been on a quest to find it in restaurants around the country. When I had the chance to buy the machine and use their pods, I jumped at it! I am now a coffee convert and have bought two machines so that I can tote one to wherever I travel. I can't imagine life without my Douwe Egberts!

review/summary: Best Morning Coffee
review/text: Well, its Monday and six a.m., time for the morning coffee. Down to the kitchen, fill the senseo coffee maker and then open the senseo coffee pack. What a wonderful aroma. Two pods in and two on standby.<br />The first cup of medium roast is not biitter nor clogs the senses. Since I drink it unadorned, there's just the right amount of roasted taste. No expresso for this person at this hour of the morning.<br />Douwe Egberts medium roast is the perfect median for morning coffee. Further, each day the taste remains the same.<br />Later that morning on to the second cup. Again perfect coffee taste, plus no acidity. Cannot say enough about the entire senseo coffee system. Please try.

review/text: Best blend and senseo pod yet!<br /><br />Very rich and strong.  Tastes incredible.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the other reviewer who gave it 1 star is talking about.  It's definetely strong and is guaranteed at least 50% true sumatra.  The pads are perfect size for a single 4 OUNCE cup of coffee.  It's not 5 ounces.  If you like senseo you will LOVE this blend.  My second favorite is regular medium blend.

review/text: I want to let you know that I received my order in today's mail, Im unhappy to say this but the taste of this coffee is terrible, I would have been better off if I had thrown my 37.00 out my car window.  These coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site.  I know you guys can not refund my money on this order, but I am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how I feel about their coffee products.  The taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach. If I were you I would post this commit under your customer's reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee.

review/text: I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year.  However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild).  So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors  (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil).  After trying all of them, this is my personal favorite.

review/summary: Rich and Dark
review/text: I tried this because I wanted a change from the regular (rather generic) Senseo dark roast, which was starting to bore me. For pod coffee, this is spectacular, with a richer, mellower flavor than plain dark roast but the same full body. It's true that it doesn't have the rather shrill high notes of true Indonesian coffee -- which I don't like anyway. (Before the Senseo, I'd buy various whole beans, and always blend Sumatra or Java beans with Mocha Harar beans to calm them down.) I'll be sticking with these pods, at least until Senseo develops an Italian-roast espresso-type pod.

review/summary: Terribly Disappointing
review/text: Senseo Sumatra Blend neither smells nor tastes like true Sumatra Mandheling. It tastes more like a stronger (barely) Breakfast Blend with an acidic aftertaste. This is a bland, boring, characterless coffee. In addition, the Senseo pods are very thin, with very little coffee in them, causing a very weak brew even on the 5 oz. setting. For a much better Sumatra Mandheling, stick to Java One or Molto.
