review/summary: Has something changed??
review/text: Let me begin my saying that this is my FAVORITE chai mix, and I've tried about as many as there are out there. Whenever I am out and about and order a chai (or a chai latte) I always ask what the brand they're using is, and if they say "Big Train," I'm good to go. I've been drinking a cup of this mix every day for the last four years, but...<br /><br />Has something changed in the formula? My recent shipment came in and it's just awful. I could smell something was 'wrong' when I opened up the container. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is different, other than to say there is something almost chemically about it. I made my first cup with the mix about a week ago and blanched; it was disgusting.<br /><br />So, I threw out my milk, thinking maybe that was the problem, but no...something is definitely different. I can't afford to just buy another order, so I've been drinking my other mixes, wondering what to do with these cans of mix that is just disgusting.<br /><br />If anyone out there has had a similar reaction to their chai as of late, please let me know. I was just in Washington D.C. for the rally and ordered a chai latte at a wonderful little cafe (and it was Big Train, Spiced Chai) and it was just HEAVENLY, like mine used to be. So...why does my mix taste so terrible?<br /><br />Please help, I love this brand and don't want to have to switch to something else if something has changed in their formula.<br /><br />UPDATE AND EDIT: (In case no one reads the comments, I thought I'd put this here) Over the next few months, as I continued to order Big Train, that problem began to diminish until that strange taste was gone. (It took two more orders until I got a batch that was as good as it always was). I suspect something went on with that particular batch wherever it was made, but now, it's every bit as great as I remember it being. I would absolutely recommend this chai - it combines all of the great spices traditionally found in Indian chai and gives it (what I think of as) a British twist with the sugar, so it's perfect as is.

review/summary: It tastes fake...
review/text: Based on the reviews and the word 'Chai' on the container, I decided to try it...  I am disappointed...  The taste reminds me of the latte freeze you can buy at Costco... or the taste of the Starbuck's Bottled Frappachino's and powdered Nescafe latte.  Its really sugary and not at all spicy.  It has a fake non dairy milk taste to it...  If you are hoping for a taste similar to Oregon or Tazo Chai Concentrate... this is not the way to go...  I might drink it if I run out of Chai flavored tea bags or hot cocoa or palpable water... but I have a feeling it will be living on my kitchen shelf for a very long time...  I tried all the variations on how to prepare it, listed on the back of the container, and none of them inspired me to 'want' to drink the stuff...

review/summary: Great Service
review/text: The spiced tea from Big Train is an excellent product.  We had already known that from a previous purchase and hence no hesitation in buying it in two large cans.<br /><br />On this particular order, the cans got damaged in shipping and were returned to the supplier by the shipper.  Apparently, there is no straightforward way for Amazon to be made aware that the product was returned to the supplier.  Once I contacted Amazon via e-mail and advised what happened, I got an immediate response and the product was immediately reordered and delivered in short order.  I was concerned that this might end up being one of those situations where no one takes responsibility, and the buyer is the one who ends up losing out.  Not in this case.<br /><br />We will enjoy our spiced tea throughout the cold Chicago winter.

It is sweet and has the spiciest flavor....like drinking pumpkin pie.  Starbucks doesn't,t come close!  I love this stuff!  I have 2 cups every morning and I even take it with me on vacation so I don,t have to go without it!  Now my best friend loves it too and wants a cup every time she comes over.

review/text: I found and bought this Chai off and on for a while at the various local Home Goods stores, but it is much more convenient to get these large, 1.9 pound cans, and still save substantially over Home Goods.<br /><br />The tea itself is quite good. Best "chai" for my tastes as brewed chai is too weak. I now drink it in place of coffee in the mornings, as well as a cold day replacement for hot cocoa.

review/summary: Feel Kinda Guilty...
review/text: I considered myself a chai snob. I brewed my tea from leaves! In a triniTEA brewer! Well, my chai supplier, Adiago, were constantly out of stock on their 16oz bags (funny how they always had 3oz bags in stock at a higher price though). So I started searching around. This brand name kept popping up in review forums and tea blogs. I look on Amazon and it's a powdered beverage mix??? No no no. That will not do! So I tried a few other sellers and the chai was bitter and inferior. Just various black teas with little to no spice. Ugh.<br /><br />So I broke down and decided to order this. Price was good and I have Prime shipping so what the heck, I said. Two days later, I have these two huge containers and just "brewed" my first cup (basically, my tea brewer has been demoted to water boiler lol) and it is EXACTLY the taste I have been looking for. All I ever wanted was to duplicate the chai latte I got at my local espresso house. Not even Adiago tea tastes like this (though to be honest, Adiago makes great chai. It's just different.). If that's not genuine chai, then I don't care. You don't even have to add sugar or cream! I LIKE this stuff and I'll get it again.

review/text: I know chai is sweet.  But WOW on this one!  I can agree with all here about the great flavors.  But the SWEET!  I have to be careful with sugar, but I slipped on this one.  Sugar is the first ingredient on the list.  It would be better for me if they would have put no sugar in this at all, and let ME decide how sweet it needs to be.  I would have used a stevia extract, a natural sweetener more attune to those with sugar sensitive constitutions.  I will be sending this to a church for their "bowl blessing" parties.  I think they'll enjoy it.

review/text: I consider myself a Chai snob.  This is the best Chai you can buy.  It is delicious quality, always consistent, and is my top choice.  It is a creamy powder, so there is a dry milk powder in it.  I have seen this offered at commercial shops (that's where I saw it and started my search!).  The Vanilla is okay, my husband liked the Chocolate, but I prefer the spice.  I can only figure that if you like Vanilla chai, you will really like the flavor of this brand's vanilla chai.  Worth the price but is a good value based on other buying options.

review/text: There was this bagel shop that served the best Chai Tea I've ever had. I found out what brand of tea they used and low and behold, found it sold on amazon ;)<br /><br />Now, I was a little hesitant in buying it myself thinking that it wouldn't taste as great home made as it is from the bagel shop, but I thought it was worth giving it a shot.<br /><br />So, I ordered the 2 pack and I'm pretty much almost done with the second can!<br />This Chai is great and suuuuuuper easy to make for yourself!<br />You can just add hot water and you're fine! If you want a little creamier taste you can use hot milk instead!<br /><br />I might just have to subscribe and have this Chai shipped every month! :)

review/summary: Exactly what I was looking for!
review/text: This Chai hits the spot perfectly and for a great cost combined with the simplicity of only needing to add water.  Yes, I will admit it is not as smooth as a Starbucks Chai Latte if you just make it like I do with nothing but hot water and no frother, etc.  However, for how easy it is to make, how cheap it is overall, and how quickly Amazon gets this to me, I will take this any day of the week.  I have saved soooo much money already from drinking this instead of my daily habit of visiting Starbucks previously.<br /><br />For those wary of buying in bulk like this, it is well worth it, and trust me you will drink it.  I have gone through 4 cans already and am about to order my next 2 cans.  I keep one at home, and one at work.  Never know when you need that Chai fix ;).  The flavor is perfect for me; it has the right amount of spices and a pretty creamy taste for being a powder mix (much better than most hot chocolate/etc mixes in terms of smoothness).  I am tempted to try the other varieties that Big Train sells as well now... like Vanilla.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this product, and will continue to order it as long as they sell it.  5 Stars, 2 Thumbs Up!

review/summary: not unlike heroin, in some respects
review/text: The stuff is delicious, but quite addictive. Probably the caffeine. It does have a TON of sugar in it, though I suppose that's the point of chai, more or less. Still, it would be nice if Big Train would make an UN-sweetened version of the same product, i.e., basically the same spices but with no sugar added. Then one could add their sweetener of choice.  Lately I've been using stevia in place of sugar where possible. It's pretty good.<br /><br />Trader Joes used to sell an unsweetened chai mix that was just the ticket, but dropped it a few years ago. But I digress.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I love chai and have a cup every day - summer or winter.  My favorite that I've had is the Oregon Chai Concentrate, but decided to give Big Train a try since it had so many good reviews.<br /><br />Upon having my first cup, I wondered if there was something wrong with the chai I had received, either that or my opinion on a good chai varies wildly from everyone else!  It tastes kind of chalky, especially when you get to the bottom of the cup.  The flavor was also kind of strange, nothing like the sweetness that you would get from Oregon Chai.  I was wishing that I had ordered the vanilla flavor...perhaps that would have agreed more to my tastes.  I know there are a lot of people that prefer the spicy flavor over the sweet flavored chais.  Perhaps this brand is tailored to the spicy chai lovers.<br /><br />I've had the two cans for a few months now, and have been drinking it as a last resort when I am out of my other chai.  I have ordered the vanilla Big Train chai to see if that has a better taste.  I'm also getting a hot drink maker (similar to a Mr Cocomotion) that will hopefully mix the chai better, eliminating the chalky texture.  I will update this review after I make it with the drink maker!

review/summary: Yumm!
review/text: I have bought and tried  lots of different chai tea brands: Tazo, Oregan chai, local shops etc. Tried this at a local shop and asked them the name of their chai as it was creamy and not overtly sweet and not too 'chai-ish' ( I know that isn't a word! ) When I looked it up on the Big Train website and was disappointed as I found they did not sell to the general public. I was glad to find it at Amazon and at a good price.

review/text: This is a terrific deal! The Chai stays sealed compared to the bag of the same Chai that wouldn't be as fresh. My favorite way to have this Chai is with warmed milk and just a few splashes of water into the milk. I add in the chai mix when its all warmed up! yummy for sure!

review/summary: Big Train Vanilla Chai is better!
review/text: Before you buy this, try Big Train Vanilla Chai.  It's exactly like the chai served at Borders long ago. ( WAY better than this spiced chai, which has a weird aftertaste.)  Vanilla chai would be absolutely perfect if it were guilt-free.  A whopping 23 grams of sugar per cup, plus artificial flavor and coconut oil, put it in the "only an occasional treat" category.  Still, I love it enough to sneak it. :-)

review/summary: Best "at home" chai
review/text: This chai is delicious hot or cold. The recipes on the side are helpful, but I honestly never follow them. To make a steamed "frothy" chai, I heat up a glass almost full of milk in the microwave and some water in the kettle. Use a whisk to beat your milk with the powder, then top off with a bit of hot water to bring the temp up. My boyfriend likes this chai as well- this isn't a deep, smoky, intense chai- it's more of a sweet, light chai flavor with chai undertones... Good for people fond of chai and those who don't like theirs quite as intense. This is by far my favorite chai to make at home. A scoop or two into a blender with some ice and milk makes a cool drink, or a quick bit of whip work makes a frothy hot drink. The price is also great- 2 big cans for $20. We're about half done with our first can, and we have a few chais a week in the house.

review/summary: Chai that's economical and delicious
review/text: I was searching for Cafe Escapes K Cup Chai for my Keurig that my daughter and I enjoy for a quick cup of hot on a cold morning or a leisure sit and relax moment after work. The problem is it's hard to find in the stores and expensive. I remembered buying a powdered mix in BJ's one time and liked it so I searched for the powder and came up w/ a choice of two one of which was the Big Train Chai. After a month of drinking this I found it to be a suitable replacement for the K Cup especially if you have one of those instant hot water dispensers in your home or office. It's quick, flavorful and though a few more calories than the Cafe Escapes brand it's a healthier and an so much more economical choice. I'd give it 5 stars if it was a few dollars cheaper. I recommend you give it a try if you're a Chai fan.

review/summary: Best Frozen Chai Anywhere
review/text: Whenever I would visit my sister in Salt Lake, we would go to one particular coffee house because they had the best frozen chai either of us had ever had.  I finally asked them what they used (so I could look for it here in Portland), and they told me it was Big Train.  Good ol' Amazon -- they carry it!  Now I can make them at home.  It's the perfect chai, not overly spicy but definitely not too bland, either.  The same mix makes hot chai as well, but it's incredible blended in the blender with ice (tip:  I use milk instead of water).  Try it; it's simply the best there is.

review/summary: THE BEST cat litter I have ever used!!!
review/text: No smell at all. I HATE walking into a house that "smells like cat" and this is the ONLY litter I've used that doesn't create or cause that smell. I have 4 cats, and 2 of the ginormous Pet Mate litter boxes; I use one bag and pour half of it in each box. It lasts about 2 and a half weeks before I have to change completely change it out.<br />1 entire box of clumping clay litter lasted me only a week and its nasty and hard to clean. So while this is slightly more expensive it lasts a lot longer. I subscribed to the auto shipping and the price is only $2 more than a box of clay clumping litter.<br />I highly recommend this stuff! Your cats and you will love it!

review/summary: THIS IS WONDERFUL AMAZING STUFF/WELL MAYBE
review/text: I love my cat kritters. I have 4 of them. Two are adult and 2 are kittens. They make my day. Would not trade them for the world. BUT, there is one thing I do not like. I do not like cleaning out the kitty litter box. UNTIL I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT.<br />I have to admit that I do not use it "straight" but am currently mixing it half and half with Swheat. But I am working to the end of using only the pearls. The kids are currently getting used to the feel.<br />BUT ALREADY there is NO ODOR. (Well there is just after they poop, but no one can change that.)<br />But as soon as the waste is buried, the smell evaporates and is gone. I have never seen anything like it.<br />The two big guys share a box and the two small ones have their own. I just cleaned them out. (Trash goes out today.) The big box, which I normally hate to do, was odorless. I scooped out the poop. I scooped out the clumps of urine, including all the small break away clumps and was done. No more rumaging around getting out the odds and ends that had gotten wet and needed to be gotten rid of to get rid of odor. Done in 5 minutes flat.<br />On to the little box. Took the disposable plastic spoon and got out the clumps of poop. Got out the few urine clumps and was done. Two minutes flat.<br />Got the hand held battery driven sweeper and got the dust that hit the floor and was done. It took me  10 minutes to do a job that used to take 30 minutes.<br />And the best part was that it was just a job. It was not a gross out production. I washed my hands with disinfectant soap and came to write the review.<br />Best Kitty Litter Stuff I have ever used. I put it on for monthly delivery and am pleased with the whole deal, cost and all. It arrives at my front door once a month with no extra shopping and cleans up like a breeze. No smell. I certianly recommend it to all kitter people.<br /><br />After using this for almost 6 weeks, I have to amend my first review of this product. Yes, it is amazing and keeps the smell down, but it was not as great as I thought. Initially, I had used it for my two kittens. Their poops are small and they urinate and leave small little domes and both were well covered. Then, I began using this Pure Product (not mixed with any other product with all four of my cats, two of whom are regular cats, one is 16 pounds and one is 11. One is female and one is male. Now males are nice things, but when it comes to male cats, urinating IS a BIG deal. My cat seems to save it up for a one or two times a day process, so when he goes, it is a flood. And Male urine is more pungent than female cat urine. There is too much of it to make the usual nice compact valcano shaped product that the kittens leave. He simly wets down one whole end of the box and it smells to bad to mix with the other and is also too saturated to do so, so one twentieth of the entire box has to be thrown out after Mr. T. uses the box. That automatically means the box cannot be used by him more than 20 times. Then, in comes the female. She does leave a compact volcano shaped urine package, but the poop is huge and has to go. If nobody bothered to cover anything, I could scoop out the poop and lift out the urine and be done. Worked with the kittens. But no, with the addition of two humongo cats, the box is throughly stired and within 4 or 5 days, at the MOST, the whole 7 pounds is used up and gone. I cannot afford 7 pounds of the litter 6 or 7 times a month.<br /><br />Also, with the addition of the two big cats, litter bits were everywhere and walking on that litter is like walking on sand in your house. It tears up the tile and gets in the carpet. Ugh. I spent a lot of time cleaning the laundry room where the boxes are when I used this litter.<br /><br />So overall, I have moved this from a 5 star to a 3 star item. I can't afford it, with bigs cats added, it does smell, and I cannot afford enough to cover 4 cats for the month. So, I have moved it down to three stars. Sorry about that, but REALITY HIT ME!

I use a bit less than they say and I change more frequently just because I prefer that, but it works great either way.<br /><br />Take note: it has less dust than clay litter, but it still is dusty. My husband has asthma and the dust from this litter seems to bother him when I change it. I dump he litter into the trash outside and fill the box outside and let the dust clear before I take it in the house and it seems to be OK then.

review/summary: Good source for Pringles lovers
review/text: This product is not well-reviewed so I'll throw in my 2 cents.  If you want pringles in this type of packaging, this is a great way to buy them.  I find this size is great for taking to work, they stay fresh and the larger tubes are kind of awkward and unsightly in the cubicle.  Here you can get a pretty good deal, you can get the flavor you want, and they get delivered straight to your home! They arrived in good shape.  Some broken chips but not really any worse than you find at the supermarket half the time.  I probably ate them all in a month.  I would re-order but I have this nagging head in my voice saying Pringles are bad for you.  If you are capable of defeating your conscience better than me, I recommend these Pringles!

review/summary: Tastes like Sleepytime Extra
review/text: Maybe I got a bad batch?  This smells amazing and I was super excited to try it.  I've brewed 4-5 cups now at varying temps and steep times, and I get the same result every time.  It . . . well, it tastes lightly like wet dog smell, like a small dose of valerian root.  Like sleepytime extra.<br /><br />I like sleepytime extra, but nothing about that flavor reminds me of any of the earl grey green teas I like.  I thought this would taste more like those, but with less green flavor.<br /><br />Again, I've only tried one tin, so I may have gotten a bad batch.  The flavor wasn't bad, but I was unimpressed, even disappointed.

review/text: If you're used to paying the price for "Albacore Tuna" thinking you're getting the best tasting tuna out there, think again! This "Natural Value" brand tuna is high quality chunk tuna just like the fancy albacore brands (except the price) and tastes GREAT! At only $1.71 per can it is an AMAZING VALUE! Also, tongol tuna is naturally lower in MERCURY than other tunas, like albacore. You'll be sold on this brand if you try it! (FYI: The HIGHEST mercury levels are found in SUSHI grade tuna!)

review/summary: NOT solid tuna at all! Grated style low quality Tongol Tuna!
review/text: Contains only Tongol Tuna (wild caught) from Thailand, and spring water,  so IS low sodium. However, it is NOT solid (or even chunk) tuna as described! You get what you pay for, and this tuna is a good example of that because it is cheap (about $1.70 a can) and looks it. Tastes ok but is really more like the grated tuna we buy our cat than the grocery store tuna we buy ourselves. Not recommended! For real quality tuna (albacoare) try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EF3E5Y">Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NO6EA2">Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water, No Salt Added, 6 Ounce Tins (Pack of 24)</a>.

review/summary: Not All That Impressed
review/text: Maybe it's just me, but this tuna is not all that impressive. It's not really bad, just not premium. It also seems to have quite a bit of "Natural" salt (140mg. per 2oz serving) in the tuna meat, compared to Safeway bought Starkist and Bumblebee "No Salt Added" tuna (at 35mg sodium per 2oz serving). As a another reviewer had noted, the tuna is a bit more like the lower grade tuna that you buy on sale. This Natural Value, Tongol Tuna does not look like Chunk White at all. Go to Costco for their Kirkland Tuna for the best quality and deal, even with the(180mg sodium per 2oz serving).

review/summary: Great Way to Try Different Coffees Without a Major Committment
review/text: I enjoyed this selection purchased from a Manager's Special Sale immensely! It's an economical way to experiment and try different coffees without a major committment; like buying a whole bunch of something you don't like.<br /><br />I only wish I had purchased it for the holiday season. It would've made each day with a houseful a relatives a wee bit more pleasant, no really. A change of coffee to break the annual routine of hearing the same old family stories from the in-laws AGAIN is something to savor. When the in-laws arrive they take over EVERYTHING including the coffee maker. So I'll get a chance to have something in addition to their STRONG, hair-raising brand and coffee method.<br /><br />Although not a coffee connoisseur, I like the different selections. I anticipate buying more to assist "counting the days" UNTIL the in-laws leave this next holiday season. See there really is a Santa Claus!

review/text: I drink a lot of coffee, and really enjoy a good quality cup in the morning.  It was fun to try the different flavors/blends, but overall, we found this coffee to be about the same quality you'd find from a mass-market brand in the supermarket and were looking for something a little more gourmet.  Cute for a gift, though, and admittedly fun to cycle through the 12 packets.  Favorites were Turtle Sundae, Dark Chocolate Decadence, and Jamaican Me Crazy.  Be aware that 4 of the 12 are not flavored, just simply special blends (i.e. Breakfast Blend).

review/text: Well, this would make a beautiful gift, that's for sure.<br />Nicely packaged, pretty foil packets.<br /><br />Now, the coffee - so far, we've only tried one of them. If that is any<br />indicator of the rest of the coffees, this was a big waste of money.<br /><br />We just made a pot of the dessert-sounding Turtle Sundae.<br />GROSS! Yes, that's all I can say about it. The coffee tasted<br />like burnt cocoa, like you tried to make hot chocolate, left out the milk and used water,<br />and let it boil dry on the stove. I tried adding creamer. Still bad.<br /><br />I sure hope some of the other flavors are better. I'll update my review<br />as we try the other flavors, but I don't hold out much hope right now.<br />This was a Christmas package, but sealed in foil, it should still be fresh enough<br />to taste good. If this was their best going in to the foil, then avoid at all costs.

review/text: This is the first and only iced tea I have purchase since owning my brewer for the past year.  I put off buying iced tea due to the expense and thought how much different could it be from those cheep container mixes you find at the grocery store.  Boy was I wrong.  For starters my favorite ice tea is the half and half lemonade, and I find that these deliver the right amount of flavor, sweetness and that freshely brewed flavor I would expect from a Keurig brewer.  I find myself hiding my k cups from the rest of my family and complaining when the ice tray hasn't been refilled.  Keep in mind everyone's tastes are different and I tend to like my drinks sweet, I find the smaller tea cup setting on my brewer to work the best for this, without having to add additional sweetner or sugar.

review/text: I love going by Starbucks during the hot summer days here in Texas and ordering a shaken black tea lemonade sweetened with light ice. When I got my Keurig brewer and was checking out the drink selections for iced tea I came across this one and had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste is accurate for the ratio of tea/lemonade and the sugar was sweetened just enough. My son and I love them and he is the one that discovered that the 6 oz. water setting is best for the maximum flavor. These are a staple in my household and I love my Keurig brewer and will be saving money by drinking these at home instead of going to my local Starbucks! They are on 70 calories per serving and you get 25% of your Vitamin C intake for the day too.

review/summary: Celestial Half and Half lemonade tea for Keurig brewers.
review/text: I purchased a box of 16 of these half-and-half (black tea and lemonade) k-cups at Bed, Bath & Beyond.  They had a $9.99/box sale, and it was too good to pass up--especially since my better half loves lemonade iced tea.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was barely different from the "Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea," and didn't have the bite of lemonade.  I wasn't expecting perfection--I realize that lemonade in any form is asking a lot from a hot beverage machine, but it was still a bit of a let down.  Also, I prefer to sweeten my drinks with Splenda.  (I don't need 13 grams of carbs from a glass of iced tea.)<br /><br />That said, my Keurig Limited Edition remains the best coffee machine I have owned to date, and the Coffee People "Donut Shop" variety is my favorite every-morning k-cup.

review/summary: Mmmmmm....so good....
review/text: I first tried this k-cup as a sample.  I was hesitant at first because most teas for the Keurig brewer are either bland, weak, or both.  The sample I tried came in a pack of 4 different iced tea flavors from Celestial Seasonings.  They were are suprisingly very good brewed over ice.  But, this one was by far my favorite.  It has a nice blend of "teaness" and lemon-y sweetness.  A pack of equal or splenda really brightens up the flavors.  I was instantly hooked and ordered a big box of this stuff on Amazon right after trying this drink.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there is one big caveat to this drink.  It is a caloric drink.  So, if you are looking to restrict your caloric intake in terms of sugary beverages, becareful with this k-cup.  There isn't a whole lot of calories (about 1/2 a can of soda's worth), but it's still there and considering how good this drink is, it's hard to just drink 1.  Other than that, I think this is the best non-coffee beverage available on the Keurig brewer.

review/summary: "Arnold Palmer" K-Cup
review/text: Arrived on time and was as expected.  Appears to be the least expensive per serving that is available, even on line.  The larger version (54-count) was less expensive per cup, but was out of stock at the time.

review/summary: Pretty good for quick iced tea but the Southern Sweet Tea is better.
review/text: First, what I love about this flavor is that it's iced tea that is ready in under a minute. Whenever I want iced tea, it's there and doesn't require a lot of work. That being said, I wish it was a little more lemonade flavored than just lemon-ey. Sometimes if I let the drink sit a little too long it takes on pretty acidic lemon flavor that isn't all that pleasant. I also stumbled across a sample pack of the Southern Sweet Tea flavor since ordering this product and I've enjoyed it much more. This flavor is a good try by Celestial Seasonings but it still needs a little work.
