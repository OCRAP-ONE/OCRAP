review/summary: My cat loved the smell!
review/text: My Persian absolutely loved and went crazy over the smell - at first, that is...  But then... there was a let down.  You see, my Persian is a finicky cat, who only wants to eat dry food. Unfortunately, Kitty Kaviar only enticed him into eating the wet food that I was trying to entice him into eating for only about 2 or 3 feedings.  By about the sixth or seventh feeding with the Kitty Kaviar he had completely snubbed his nose at it.<br /><br />Still, I must admit that I haven't found anything that worked better.  I would encourage people to give Kitty Kaviar a try, because of the fact that was the very best response from my finicky cat that I ever gotten.<br /><br />P.S. My other cat, who is an American Shorthair, and normally likes to eat anything I give her, LOVED and RAGED over the smell of it as I served it to her one time - but she didn't eat very much of it - so I haven't mixed it with her food any more since that one time.

review/summary: Kitties go bananas
review/text: My cats, even the one who doesn't care much for fish flavored dry and wet foods, love these flakes.  I am happy because they are all natural, and easy for them to eat.  Cats tend not to chew their food much and that is why crunchy treats are often a waste of money if not simply bad for digestion.<br /><br />My cats smell this stuff and heads start turning.  One of the cats gets flakes on her fur and then happily licks herself to get the remaining bits all cleaned up.  They purr like crazy with it.<br /><br />If you are looking for wholesome foods for your cat, make sure you get Ann Martin's book, _Food Pets Die For_, here on Amazon.<br /><br />Have fun!

review/summary: Cats LOVE this!!
review/text: This is the good stuff my cats come running for!<br /><br />This is a jar of dried fish "shavings." They're paper thin, and cats ADORE them. I have to hide the jar, because if I don't, I find the jar in the morning with little kitty tooth marks all over it, from them trying to get it open. LOL.<br /><br />This stuff is such a big hit at my house, that I have taught my cats tricks- like to "Sit" on command, in exchange for this treat- that's how much they love it.<br /><br />Best of all, I have a cat whose tummy gets upset easily, and she never gets sick after eating this like she did with other kinds of treats. This is 100% pure dried fish- NO fillers, which is great.<br /><br />I deducted one star because these shavings tend to turn to powder in the bottom of the jar, which makes the cats sneeze so I usually have to throw a tiny bit of it away- but it is a very small portion compared to the size of the container.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product, healthy and makes kitties VERY happy. I buy it regularly.

review/summary: Waffle Delight
review/text: I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband; he has a new toy - a belgium waffle maker.  He's experimented with various batters some his and the recipes that came with the appliance.  We made waffles Christmas day for breakfast.  This stuff is sensational, absolutely delicious.  I had read the reviews on this product and was particularly drawn to buy this as it was organic and one purchaser had written their kids love the waffle mix.  SOLD!!!! If the kids think its fabulous and it's organic, I wanted to check it out.  Glad I did and I am looking forward to purchasing an additional supply of mix.

review/summary: Delicious mix, good sell by date
review/text: This mix is wonderful, and it doesn't expire until 2011, not that it will last anywhere near that long in my house.<br /><br />I've made it twice already, and the second time I added some almond meal just for fun (I didn't measure- but it was between 1/3 and 1/2 cup), since it was so good when I added it to the Garvey's scone mix.  The almond meal was terrific in the pancakes.  It did not make them less fluffy, and it gave them a wonderful nutty flavor.  I eat mine with honey- fabulous.  And my kids liked them as well.  I use butter for the oil, and I also use non-homogenized (cream top) whole milk.<br /><br />I have now tried all the Garvey's mixes and I have been very happy with each and every one.  There are not many brands I can say that about.

review/text: I bought boxes of this mix to use as christmas gifts based on the high reviews and I'm ready to re-order.  I made sure I had extra boxes for my boyfriend and me and we ate them right up!<br /><br />This mix is easy to make (I'm a mediocre cook, at best) and it tastes delicious.  My notoriously picky boyfriend loves it.  One note; it makes a lot of pancakes for two people  (we can't finish them with two hearty appetites) so these are good for company.  If you do a whole breakfast feast (eggs, sausage, fruit, coffee) there's enough to feed four people to the brim.

review/text: I gave up loving pancakes a long time ago.. the Vegan mixes meant eating hockey pucks, but still I suffered through.  HOWEVER, this product resulted in the best pancakes I EVER remember eating, Vegan or otherwise.  I substituted Almond Milk for regular milk, and well-whisked "Egg Replacer" for a regular egg, cooked them on medium-high, and up they fluffed.  It all worked, and yummy; seriously, yummmmmmmmy!  And no animals or birds were hurt :-))))

review/text: It was amazingly simple to make absolutely perfect pancakes using Garvey's Organic Pancake and Waffle Mix. I'm certainly not a trained chef, so I was amazed how well my pancakes turned out. They were light, fluffy and perfectly golden brown with a slight crispness around the edge. The taste was incredible, the best I've ever had anywhere. The fact that the ingredients are organic is a big plus too. I highly recommend Garvey's Organic Pancake and Waffle Mix.

review/summary: Nice flaor/taste but expensive
review/text: I can see why the other reviewers like this stuff; it tastes good and is relatively easy to prepare.  Besides that, it is organic.  These are all positives; the only downside is you get six small packages for around $15 or so, and each package is one meal for two people.  Remember, this is only pancake/waffle mix; there are no exotic ingredients  in it; basically an unbleached flour with a few other small things.  Bottom line, it's a very good product, but so is Carbon's.  The key seems to be getting the right waffle maker (I have been talking about waffles the whole time here); I just spent another hundred bucks on another waffle maker (a Waring 300), and from what I have read, this unit is supposed to produce a better quality waffle, all else being equal.  Notice for all my rhetoric I still gave it 5 stars.  It really does have a nice flavor.

review/summary: Garvey's Organic Pancake & Waffle Mix...Not even Close to Expectations
review/text: Even though there were only 30, I bought this mix because of the stellar reviews.  I hate to be the one who gives only two stars but, it is what it is.  I've been on a quest to find a great belgian waffle mix that tastes as good as scratch or close to it.  Well, this isn't it and not even close.  Cracker Barrel Mix or Log Cabin's New All Natural Mix makes much better pancakes.  I tried one 9oz box for waffles and one for pancakes.  The rest will be given away to the needy.  Don't get me wrong.  It was OK.  It provided nourishment but, if not for the maple syrup it wouldn't have had much taste.  It looked good though.  Nice and creamy.  I realize I'm looking for a belgian waffle mix and have tried a few of those such as Krusteaz.  Still not making it.  So far it's been from scratch that pleases me the most.  I guess it's the yeast.  I realize that I may be expecting too much from a mix.  Today we seem to want instant gratification with everything.  I may not find it for belgian waffles.  I also realize people's taste are different.  Obviously mine are different from the majority of reviewers of this mix.  For those of you readers that are trying to decide what to buy, good luck on your quest too.  And, if there's any out there that can help in my quest, please reply to this opinion.  Thanks

review/summary: Even I Can't Screw It Up!
review/text: I'm currently stationed in Afghanistan and missed cooking so I ordered this product. I just got done making it... It calls for an egg, oil, and milk. I had no measuring cups so I guesstimated the oil and milk. I forgot the egg completely. (I don't have real eggs but I ordered powdered eggs). I mixed it up in a ziplock baggie since I dont have a mixing bowl, cooked it on a camping burner, and flipped it with plastic forks. It was lumpy and messy but let me tell you, they tasted great! I am not sorry I purchased this... now I just need a spatula, measuring cups, and a mixing bowl.

Well, my fears were soon erased after these fluffy delights were quickly scooped off my plate and into my gullet. These are some of the best pancakes I have ever had, right up there with my own mom's pancakes. (Disclaimer: I have to say that because she might be reading this at some point). Do yourself a favor and try these if you haven't already. I think all the glowing reviews here should speak for themselves, but I'll be proven right anyway after you taste them :-)

Even different packaged mixes I've tried have not been successful. Then I ordered and tried Garvey's Pancake & Waffle Mix. And FINALLY made the perfect pancake. The mix is super easy to make and the pancakes turned out perfectly. They also make incredible raspberry pancakes. Of course I didn't tell anyone I was using a mix. Love that it uses organic ingredients too. For a great pancake that your whole family will love, I highly recommend trying Garvey's pancake mix.

It also was just three types of chex mix pieces and that didn't give me a bag of interseting. I wouldn't suggest them to someone who likes their chex mix salty.

I feel silly recommending chex mix, but I'm sure there are some others out there besides me who are looking for a sweet and salty healthier-than-usual snack.  So, here goes...<br /><br />This mix has a great combination of chex cereal, pretzels, and these sweet swirly "cookies".  The pretzels are fine, the sweetened cereal pieces are very good, and those swirls...goodness, those swirls!  I open a bag and immediately start hunting down those swirls!  They are so good that I wish I could get bags of just the swirls.<br /><br />And Amazon, could you please start including nutritional information with the foods you sell?  Maybe even a scan of the nutritional label?  For those who care, here are some key figures: 1/2 cup serving, 8 per bag.  3.5g fat, no cholesterol, 21g carbohydrates, 1g fiber, 4g sugar, 2g protein.

review/summary: Love these peanut chews since I was a little girl
review/text: Okay I ordered these directly from the manufacturer in Pa. and found I can get many more much cheaper thru Amazon, so that is what I do now. They are unfortunately very good and extremely habit forming. I am the only one in my household of 2 that eats them since my husband complains that they stick to his teeth. Doesn't matter. Where I go Peanut Chews go!!

review/summary: Great coffee for my Senseo
review/text: Great taste, not very strong, definitely not bland. These 7.x gram pods fit perfectly on the Senseo, you may need to tap on it once the pod is on the holder because the pod is slightly smaller in foot print which causes the coffee to be "more piled up", so you just tap it slightly to disperse it more evenly; the Senseo pods cover up the whole circumference of the holder so the same amount of coffee is more loose. TIP: do not buy 12 gram pods for your Senseo, they will definitely NOT work. There are also 10 gram pods and these I am uncertain if they will fit, but I seriously doubt it.

review/summary: Good First Cup of The Day
review/text: Baronet 100% Columbian is an awesome every day, all day long coffee available at a great price! These three bags of Baronet 100% Columbian coffee pods are available for under $11 - $15 total with subscribe and save and free shipping - that's 54 good cups of coffee - what's not to love?<br /><br />Critics of bagged pods will be happy to find these bags are nitrogen flushed so upon opening the bag of coffee is as fresh as a single film wrapped pod. A little tape and a rubber band reseals the bag sufficiently for my needs, but vacuum canisters are available for a more high tech solution to preserving freshness.<br /><br />Baronet offers several other varieties and flavors (my wife and I have tried the Eggnog, French Vanilla Decaf, Small Village Blend, and Small Village Blend French Roast as well, so we are fans) in this 7.5 gram bag package format. This size of pod is designed to work in any machine that can use Senseo pods (which is probably every pod brewer built in the last several years)and brews great in our Bunn My-Cafe pod brewer.

review/summary: Good coffee when they get it right!
review/text: I ordered the 3 pack of the regular Columbian roast [Baronet Coffee 100% Colombian Medium Roast (140 g), 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3)] and all 3 bags I received were marked to indicate that that was what they contained.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first bag contained HAZELNUT FLAVORED COFFEE -- uggghhh! Probably not as gag-inducing as Wolfgang Puck's "Jamaica Me Crazy" variety, but along those lines and DEFINITELY NOT REGULAR COFFEE. You know what I discovered, though? Amazon's return policy on grocery items is pretty straightforward: no returns.<br /><br />The good news is that I've moved on to the 2nd of 3 bags and the coffee is fine. Quite good, actually.... so I'm going to hope that my experience with bag #1 was an aberration. I'll give it another shot (assuming bag #3 has regular coffee)!

review/text: The Baronet Coffee 100% Columbian Med Roast tastes good - I would say somewhere between Mild and Medium. The pods fit Senseo coffee maker (single-pod system). I've opened 1 bag so far - there were 3 pods that were not sealed all the way, so there was loose coffee in the bag. Obviously you can't use the unsealed pods. It was a bit of a mess. Overall, I would probably buy it again if the price is right, and there are no original Senseo pods in sight.

review/summary: Tasty Treats For Toy Dogs
review/text: I am lucky in that my 1 year Chihuahua isn't picky about his snacks and will eat just about anything. This product is no exception. I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite "eating spot" on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store. That's how I first discovered these.

review/text: This is the K-Cup I go to when I want a nice, bold coffee.  Not too strong and not too bitter, this coffee hits the spot! Wonderful on its own, but this is a great dessert coffee as well! Stands up well to the medium Keurig setting and might work on the large setting for those who prefer a little weaker cup.

review/text: Most Keurig coffees come out weak, but this one is nice and strong.  Not too strong, just about right.  I use each pod twice to make a larger cup and this one works great for that.

review/summary: My new fave!
review/text: Have pretty much tried all of the K-cup varieties available since getting our first Keurig machine about a year ago (we now have one in our weekend home as well) and this is my personal favorite - makes a nice bold cup of great-tasting coffee (particularly if you "double brew") that's now my first thing in the morning everyday brew! Might be a bit strong for some but great for those who like their coffee a bit stronger.

Of the many k-cup coffees we've tried, this is a favorite of both. Bold, with good aroma and smooth flavor.  Perfect for my husband on the smallest cup setting, and for me on the larger.

review/text: It has a nice strong flavor but I get a few grinds in my cup which is a first for all the k-cups I have tried.  I ordered Timothy's Midnight Magic along with this which I like better and would order again.  I probably wouldn't order this one again due to the grinds.<br /><br />*** update: 3/6/08 - I have had grind problems in other brands as well so I wanted to edit this review to state that I would order this one again.

review/summary: Even for mild coffee drinkers
review/text: This is simply the best coffee k-cup.  A little known fact about coffee is that the longer it is brewed the more bitter the taste.  To get a mild cup of coffee you should actually use a stronger roast, use less water and add hot water to the completed beverage.  This coffee makes the smoothest and best tasting cup I think I have ever had from a home coffee machine.

review/summary: K-cups are defective
review/text: I have owned a Keurig brewer for over 2 years and have never had a problem with any K-cups. I had previously purchased these K-cups as part of the Subscrible and Save program and had been happy.  The last order I received has been a disaster, either the filter piece is missing from the K-cup or the K-cup is not sealed properly.  Amazon customer service was excellent as usual and replaced the order, but I am having the same problem with the replacement cups.  I know it is not my brewer because I have other K-cups that work just fine.  It is very messy when the coffee grounds either explode all over the place or end up in the cup.  It is extremely aggravating to go through 10+ K-cups to get one cup of coffee.  Again, this is not the fault of Amazon, but rather the manufacturer of these K-cups.  I will be canceling this Subscribe and Save plan.

review/summary: Great coffee for you Keurig
review/text: I have had a K-cup machine at work for a year or two; and one at home for over a month; I am an addict for strong coffee/ we have a club at work (not k-cup related) and we get PEETS' coffee/ its really bold and rich.<br /><br />I have had most every extra-bold roast for the K-cup machine. In my opinion, the Black tiger is a great tangy bold coffee with enough earthiness too but nicely powerful and flavorful. A great combination. A double dose of this in the travel mug and its heaven. If you are like me and like dark coffee that actually still has flavor... You will really love this one.
