review/text: I reviewed the cat version of this product. My cats go berserk over this stuff! The dog version is the same, just in bigger pieces. I break up the large pieces before giving them to my cats.

review/summary: The cat and the dog love this stuff
review/text: I rate this a 4 star because of how it tends to have a great quantity of powdery crumbs in the bottom of the bag. The dog will lick it up, but with a powder, he tends to inhale and cough so I end up with unusable powdery crumbs that I can't give to the dog straight from the bag. Overall, this is a great product because it is just chicken and both the dog and the cat love this stuff. I frequently buy the biggest bag and will continue to do so. The good pieces are cubes of chicken, and are dehydrated and crunchy. Since its dry, its easy to handle and give to the dog or cat as a treat.  The bag has a zip closure to keep it fresh.

review/summary: My dog's favorite treat!!!
review/text: I sprinkle a little bit of this chicken over my dog's food for breakfast and dinner, and he loves it! It's also the only thing that I used when training him. It's the best of all the pure bites products...the beef, cheese things, etc are all too hard, so my dog won't eat them. The chicken is a must have!

review/text: PureBites Chicken treats are the best. Had previously been using Halo but found my cats vomiting from the last few batches. Found the Purebites and have no longer had any stomach issues with the kitties. Plus the dog loves them too.<br />The crumbles at the bottom are great over their meals when everyone gets a bit finicky so there's no waste!

review/summary: Healthy Cat treats
review/text: I am a vegetarian and I feel bad that I never have any real meat to give to my animals as treats. They get so excited whenever others bring chicken or turkey into the house. My cats LOVE these treats. The only ingredient is natural USDA inspected chicken breast so I feel good about them eating these. They are marketed for dogs but they break up really easy into cat sized pieces.

review/summary: Wonderful natural treat Made in USA
review/text: We got these as a x-mas gift and this is the BEST treat! I am very careful about what I give my Shih Tzu who is a puppymill rescue and has health issues. This treat is a 100% natural made with 100% chicken and also VERY IMPORTANT is that it is NOT MADE IN CHINA. I never give my dog anything that is made in China (I have relatives in China and trust me you do not want to feed your dog anything that is made there) so there have been very few options out there for my dog. The added plus is that both my dog and cat LOVE these treats. My dog is more finicky than my cat and they both go crazy over these and b/c I know they are 100% natural chicken I feel confident giving them the treats. There are, however, two drawbacks and that is why I can't give it 5 stars. 1) A lot of the treats are wasted b/c they crumble and at least 1/4 of the bag looks like it is filled with sawdust (crumbs from the broken treats). Many of the pieces also crumble into pea-size pieces which are too small for a dog. Fortunately my cat does not mind the tiny pieces so I give these to him. These treats are also very expensive which I don't mind b/c the quality is so good but for this price, I wish so much would not go to waste. 2) Like another reviewer said, you do need to be careful b/c I have found a bone in them as well. I found a bone about an inch long embedded in one of the treats so now I am careful to inspect the treat before giving it to my dog. Even with these drawbacks, I still feel these are the best treats out there if you are looking for 1) healthy, 2)natural, 3) tasty treats that are 4) MADE IN USA. In my experience, it is nearly impossible to meet all 4 criteria. This is the only treat that does (at least for my pets where taste is concerned. My pets refuse to eat Newman's treats even though they are healthy).

review/summary: Great but has some "bits"
review/text: Love this healthy treat for my cat! I actually grind it up into a powder, and mix with water on demand when giving medicine to my cat. I used to give him smelly wet food, but I just couldn't handle gagging 2 times a day...<br /><br />Since I ground it into a fine powder, I did notice some pea-sized bits of hard something, most likely bone. This might not be an issue for a big dog, but for my small, old cat, I have to be sure to pick these pieces out. Just be observant when feeding your pet.<br /><br />I used to buy this product locally, but I found they were selling it for over twice the price per ounce, so this is a GREAT value!

review/summary: The quality of the chicken is questionable
review/text: I just discarded 20% of the bag.  Some of the pieces had chicken veins (dark purple spots), others had fatty parts to them. A few pieces weren't completely 'dry.' This is the first time I've tried this brand and it looks like they use thigh meat in their mix, whereas the other companies I've purchased in the past seem to use only breast meat? It just looks much more yellow -- I don't know exactly what it means -- I guess I'm just used to seeing bright, white, crispy pieces when I buy the other brands that Amazon offers.

I tried these PureBites.  Both my cats & dog absolutely clammer for them.  You get a lot of bite sized freeze-dried chicken breast pieces & they are low in calories.  With 3 pets, the bag will last through a month. The cost is worth it to me....for the safety and happiness of my pets.  Will continue to order these.

review/summary: Great for ferrets to!
review/text: All 4 of my ferrets go nuts for this stuff. Even though theres a picture of a dog or cat, it isnt specific to just one species, its great for all of them! The ONLY ingrediant is 100% chicken breast which is perfect for ferrets an is the most healthy "treat" out there, better then the other junk like N-bones, bandits etc. They say the best treat is meat, so this stuff is PERFECT! It takes time for them to get used to it but once they did, they started doing tricks the 2nd they see the bag.<br /><br />There has been a huge increase in there coat and there energy levels. And since i started putting it in there food they even eat alot less because there getting filled more with meat as well. I support this treat for dogs, cats and ferrets :D!

review/summary: PureBites freeze dried chicken treats
review/text: I bought a small package of this some time ago as I was having trouble finding something to hide their meds in (both cats and dogs). They love this stuff!<br /><br />They haven't gotten bored with it, or learned that I sometimes bury their meds in it.  Works way better than pill pockets, pieces of cheese, peanut butter, or even a bit of roast chicken. When using it to hide meds, it's easier to soak a piece in a little broth. The pill doesn't have to be completely hidden, just kind of indent it in a bit, let the dog smell that treat and he'll gobble it right down.<br /><br />Also, there are always crumbs and bits at the bottom of the package that I sprinkle on their dog/cat food and they seem to enjoy that a lot - one of my dogs won't eat anymore unless he's got the chicken crumbles on his food.<br /><br />I'm completely sold on this product.

Take care of your pets and give them nutritious freeze dried meat/chicken rather than the junk food treats that are loaded with uneeded carbs.<br /><br />Also, this is a great price and a large bag lasts for a long time.  Cat and dog Pure Bites are exactly the same with larger pieces in the bag for dogs.  Just break them up and kitties love them too.  I also use the crushed treats to top off a meal and make it tastier.<br /><br />When my friend's bring their dogs by, they always get some too.  All of the pets love this product!!!

review/text: My 13 year old Lhasa makes the title Prima Dona seem tame.  She is so finicky, we're at wits end.  I got tired of making her treats and needed something to bribe her with. What makes it harder is that she can't have salt due to her severely enlarged heart. We went to a doggy boutique and the lady "knew" that she had something she would like.  She tried EVERY treat she had and Michi just turned her nose up at everything!  The lady finally said, I'll bring out the big guns, and indeed, Michi loved the freeze dried chicken breast treats.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $12.95 for 2 oz. We were desperate so I paid it.  PureBites are a God-send!  Not only is the price more than reasonable, but Michi will do just about anything for them.  I recommend these highly for anyone with a finicky dog, especially one with heart problems, such as Michi.

review/summary: The Only Thing My Dog LOVES!!!
review/text: My dog is about as picky as they come. We have the hardest time finding something that he will eat, But He ABSOLUTELY LOVES CHICKEN PURE BITES!!!<br />Every night he expects his treat! He typically doesn't bark but if you start to go to bed and Don't give him his Chicken PureBites, he will sit on the bed and look up at the container we keep them in and bark. When we get them down, he hops around like a rabbit because he is So Excited. Now, if we could only find some dog food that he LOVED this much, we would be doing Great! Snickers ABSOLUTELY LOVES THESE!!! Nothing any better as far as me and my husband are concerned!! Thanks PureBites,<br />Cea

review/summary: Puppy love
review/text: My three month old yorkie mix, Gizmo absolutely loves these treats. Every time he hears the bag crinkle he would run up and sit patiently waiting for his treat. They sell Purebites at my local petshop along with various hollistic brand dog food, so I know it's good. When Gizmo became picky about eating his kibble a pet shop worker suggested I sprinkle pieces of this onto the kibble, and it worked wonders for his appetite. The chicken is easiest on his stomach, I've noticed with too much liver Purebites he begins to have diarhia. Otherwise, I higly recommend this.

review/text: My pets love the chicken treats. But over the last 3 purchases, 1/3 of the bag ends up as powder, which sticks in my pets' throats. Working out to $35/lb -- that's some very expensive chicken. So I expect to be able to use more than only 2/3 of the product. Maybe I should try to make my own.

review/text: Good chocolate but somehow I was expecting that "With a name like Ghiradelli" it would be a cut above everything else on the market.  I thought it was no better than Nestle's, which is still my favorite.  Also, I was expecting a larger individual serving package but, like so many other manufacturers, Ghiradelli has downsized the size of their serving packet to make a 6 oz. cup of hot chocolate instead of an 8 oz. size.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Excellent quality. Chana dal is one of my favorites from when I lived in India & Nepal. Dal is the primary protein source for vegetarians in South Asia and can also be a great part of any vegan diet. Here is "Greg's Flavorful Chana Dal" recipe: Pour safflower oil in bottom of crock pot or deep fryer (.25"/.5 cm) and heat; after hot add minced fresh ginger, minced fresh garlic, minced fresh onion, and minced fresh habenero or chilis (optional) to taste and cook/stir for 1-3 minutes; add 3 parts water for however much chana dal you intend to cook and boil; then add chana dal; cook and occasionally stir for about 1.5 hrs or until creamy consistency. If preparing small portion, then do first steps in small frypan and transfer to cooking pot so oil is not too much. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

review/summary: You can call it dal or hummus & it's easy
review/text: The biggest pain to making authentic hummus from dried chick peas is removing the chick peas' skins after they've been cooked, after hours of soaking the dried beans, prior to cooking. Bob's Red Mill Chana Dal Beans removes the real work. While not exactly garbanzos, Bob's chana dal split beans are a very close cousin. Soak a pound for a couple of hours, rinse, then cook until softened, and run them through the food processor with a little cooking water, tahini, lemon, garlic, cumin, salt, and a smidgeon of turmeric and pepper flakes. One pound dry will make about three pounds of delicious hummus.

review/summary: these are great legumes!
review/text: I had never heard of chana dal before finding it on Amazon, but I am so glad I did. I eat many legumes, and am always looking for something tasty, quick to fix, and easy to mix in with grains. Chana dal fits the bill in all respects. It has a very mild flavor, cooks almost as fast as lentils, and the flavor works well with brown rice, whole wheat or just about anything else. It doesn't cause the bloating that beans like pinto or navy do, and I can spice it up or leave it plain. It will be one of my main protein sources from now on.

review/summary: I've eaten these for 15 years
review/text: I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

review/text: I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that.

review/text: The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it "raw" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!

Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them "raw" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.

review/text: I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that "practice makes perfect".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.

review/summary: I hope you like spice.
review/text: This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).

review/summary: Awesome stuff!
review/text: I love this! I do not buy it here, but at the store. I like it on pizza of course. But I also like to eat it right out of the container it comes in!  It's good on crackers by itself or with cheese, on hot dogs, in soup & pasta dishes. It is a little drier than other products I've tried. But that is ok, because I don't like peporoni that is too greasy. This product also does not give me heartburn & many of the others do. I like the product! GOOD!!

review/summary: Handy for "Seasoning"
review/text: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great "seasoning" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.

I got them home and immediately opened one because I have been craving pepperoni since I got here three months ago.  The flavor is awesome.  It's very spicy, but in a good way.  Heat in the microwave for a few seconds to get some of the extra grease out of it.

review/summary: PERFECT FOR PIZZA!
review/text: Bridford Turkey Pepperoni, it has half the calories as regular pepperoni only 70, regular pepperoni has 140 calories. I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You

review/summary: The slices are, um, greasy
review/text: This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.

I like it even more than the smaller sticks you find in some of the old Italian grocery.meat markets, mainly because of the spicy nature. (That's not to discount thos sticks, they're great, too.)<br />I don't just recommend this, I give it to friends as gifts. (Na, I don't wrap them. I just hand half a stick to them and say...

review/summary: Pure heaven!
review/text: I absolutely love any kind of chocolate, and I have tried so many different kinds.  However, I have to say, that this Ferrero Collection ranks somewhere near the top of all of the many chocolates I have eaten; yes, it's that good.<br /><br />There are 24 chocolates in the container made up of 8 chocolates of each of the 3 different varieties.  The first kind is the Rocher, which is a chocolate wafer covering some delicious chocolate cream filling which is then covering a hazelnut.  This is my least favorite (mostly because of the fact that I'm not a huge fan of hazelnuts), but it is still very tasty indeed.  The second variety included in this collection is the Garden, which happens to be the favorite of my family and me!  It is another wafer topped with coconut flakes; this wafer then covers a divine coconut filling that is supposed to cover an almond, but to be honest, I never tasted the almond.  The final chocolate that composes the collection is the Rondnoir, a chocolate wafer covering a chocolate cream filling which is covering a dark chocolate "pearl" or ball.  This will be the favorite of those who love just pure chocolate delight, although everyone else will probably devour it, too.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this collection!  It is amazingly delectable and is a fantastic gift for any chocolate lover.  I recommend it for parties, gifts, or really for anything where people will be eating.  It is an awesome collection that will have your taste buds tingling in delight the moment you taste your first chocolate!

Also, the Ferrero Rocher costs less. This gift box set would be a decent deal for $5 at a drug store just b/c of the great presentation/packaging. But you could buy its contents for only a few bucks. If presentation is what counts, buy this for sure! (I did not sample any of the goods, so I can not comment on quality.)

review/text: I am being very generous with giving 3 stars ---The 3 tower boxes measure just 7 inches tall - just so you know!  In mine, the top box had chocolate covered raisons--melted together - but we do live in Phoenix, AZ and it's over 100 here now.  The second box had a package of toffee covered peanuts, and the third box (bottom) contained a small package of  honey mustard pretzels and a small package of chocolate chip cookies.  There were no added peanuts or paper fillers in mine but the small package came in a fairly large mailing box so when you opened it, it was a bit disappointing to see the gift size. The raisons were just so so - not great chocolate - the peanuts didn't thrill me, the mustard pretzels were good and the chocolate chip cookies was a bunch of crumbs - a soft shortbread type cookie (not what you'd expect for chocolate chip) - but the crumbs tasted good!  I suppose you can use the little boxes for something else later.  They are attractive and the gift was thoughtful of the giver but I doubt they read the reviews first.
