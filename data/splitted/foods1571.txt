review/summary: Hint of Pumpkin
review/text: While I expected a stronger pumpkin flavor, I was pleasantly surprised and happy that it only has a hint of pumpkin.  It would have been hard pressed for me to even recognize the flavor if I didn't know it was pumpkin.  That said, I want to say that I just love the flavor of this coffee.  I have only been buying Timothy's coffee, because it is my favorite brand as well as being economical for the K-cups.  Although I usually drink my coffee black, occasionally I put milk or half&half in, and this seems to bring out the pumpkin flavor more.

review/summary: Sample before buying!
review/text: I generally like flavored coffees (and I'm not that picky about coffee) but this is awful.  The flavoring is overwhelming, I can't taste the coffee and I can't even quite tell what the flavoring is supposed to be.  Even watering it down doesn't seem to help.  However since some reviewers are actually giving it a 5, I'll just suggest snagging a sample somewhere before buying.  Do NOT buy this untested.

review/summary: A must-have K-Cup for me
review/text: I adore Pumpkin Spice coffee and am an addict of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte. The Timothy's pumpkin spice K-cup is a great alternative for a fraction of the price of Starbucks. I also like Circle K and 7-11's pumpkin spice cappuccinos. Timothy's pumpkin spice K-cup is the closest thing I have found for my Keurig to any of the commercially sold pumpkin spice drinks. I love this K-cup with some splenda and milk for a great cup of coffee.

review/summary: Trust Me !!! Buy The Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice K Cups, They Are Much Better !!!
review/text: Even on the middle setting the Timothy's Pumpkin Spice coffee tasted watered down and lacked flavor, its not worth saving a few bucks to buy the Timothy's brand if the coffee sucks.  Even though the Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice K cups are alittle more money, it is well worth the extra few cents per K-cup to buy the Green Mountain brand.  The Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice on the middle setting of the Keurig works great and you get a great flavored cup of coffee without watering it down on the large setting.  Add sugar and half and half and you are ready to go.

However, this product was like drinking a cup of chemicals.  I couldn't even doctor it with cream and sugar to make it somewhat okay.  So, I ended up throwing away the several boxes I purchased.

review/text: Reading the reviews on this coffee flavor, it appears Timothy's has some real quality control issues in this particular flavor of coffee.<br /><br />I drink a lot of flavored coffee and its rare to see a set of reviews where so many people think its the best flavor ever and so many others hate it completely.  The coffee I got is not drinkable without cream or sugar - there is a strong taste of some type, but its not pumpkin, or spice, or coffee - just some bitter unrecognizable strong taste.<br /><br />It's so bad I am contemplating throwing the rest away after I tried about six cups.

review/text: I bought this coffee after reading other reviews.  I thought "pumpkin spice", yum!  Something similar to the taste of a pumpkin pie or coffee and pumpkin pie.  WRONG!!!!  This doesn't even taste like coffee!  I shook the K-cup around prior to putting it in my Keurig machine, so as to make sure that the hot water would run through all of the coffee beans or flakes or whatever you call the chopped up coffee bean.  Fresh, clean, cold filtered water, a little pure cane sugar and a small individual serving of coffeemate (the liquid kind).  It smells like coffee, it looks like coffee, but it tastes like hot, almost coffee flavored water.  I am so disappointed. I will never buy Timothy's Perfectly Pumpkin again!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0KG5K">Timothy's World Coffee K-cups Perfectly Pumpkin for Keurig Brewers, 24 Count Box</a><br />I've gone through half of the box and there's no improvement in taste.

review/summary: Easy to use and quite tasty
review/text: While I don't know a lot about Indian food, I was treated to some Indian food that was rated "very good" by some friends who know a lot more about that cuisine than I. I immediately went on-line to see if I could find a recipe so my wife and I could cook it at home, but the more recipes I found, the more confused I became about what would taste closest to what I had eaten.<br /><br />As I searched, this product came up, and on a whim, I decided to order a kit. It quickly arrived, and with the exception of meat or poultry and oil to fry the meat in and yogurt for the sauce, comes complete. Opening the spice packets, the delightful smell of cardoman, dried chiles, and garlic powder filled the kitchen, so I was favorably impressed (and surprised) with the apparent freshness of the ingredients. The jasmine rice, while not as flavorful as some I've used, was fine.<br /><br />Using organic chicken breasts, I quickly and easily cooked a very tasty meal. While I'm sure results might have been a bit better using freshly sauteed garlic, coconut, and onion, we enjoyed this flavorful meal that was both quick and easy. I will try the lamb soon.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED

review/summary: I Can't Believe I Almost Passed On This One!
review/text: This wasn't going to be one of the many flavored Matcha that I was going to order from Red Leaf Tea.  I mean, I love Matcha, sure, but I do not drink a lot of alcohol, and while I have enjoyed many of the various alcohol-infused flavored teas that I've tried, it just isn't a flavor that I usually go for.  So, I guess, you can consider this a "stepping outside of my comfort zone" moment.<br /><br />And I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />This is amazingly awesome!  It is really good.  The overall flavor is remarkably smooth - and while most Matcha tends to be smooth and creamy - this tastes even smoother than most.  The flavor is more "fruity" than what I'd call "alcohol-like" but it is a very smooth fruity tone, with a very smooth brandy finish.  It is sweet and delicious.  The matcha flavor here is more reserved, with the vegetative tones that usually coat the palate being a bit more in the background rather than front notes.<br /><br />A very enjoyable Matcha - if you're on the fence about this one, I highly recommend taking the plunge and getting it.  It's really very surprisingly good.  I like it a lot.

review/summary: Like Juicy Fruit Gum! Yum yum!
review/text: Okay so for those of you hesitating thinking this is going to taste too much like something a staunch old man sitting in a ritzy Victorian library would drink, its not. Its also not like the stuff the teens would swill behind the bleachers in high school during winter football games. Wait, maybe that was just at my school. Anyway this stuff is GOOOOOD!<br /><br />Someone else said in their review it reminded them of Juicy Fruit gum and they totally hit the nail on the head with that assessment! Had this not been named "Brandy" I would have thought it was a fruit blend - not a punch like Hawaiian Punch, not even a tropical mixture, but just a really yummy sweet fruit blend of some kind. I really wish I could pick out specific fruit flavor elements to relate to you but I can't. Fruit Medley is all I can think of but there is a whipped cream like aspect to it, something that really makes you feel like you bit into some ripe juicy fruit (no pun intended) and it really does taste like that gum! This is one your kids would LOVE! Seriously if you want to get your kids or anyone in the family into matcha I would suggest this or the butterscotch matcha! Just make a latte with some milk, and some vanilla or sweet cream non dairy creamer! Add ice, stir LOVE!<br /><br />Now as for the Brandy aspect here. Its really not all that present to me. Yes I do get a SLIGHT and I mean SLIGHT alcohol effect - sort of a little twang or ting, but not really so much warming as brandy is known for.<br /><br />When I was younger, in my teens, I rode both western and equestrian, and trained horses. That was another life time ago. We would always have some brandy on us to keep warm in the winter wether out on the ranch repairing fences or preparing for a fox hunt (we did not really hunt the foxes I would have no part in that so don't worry) it was more of a Mock Hunt. LOL This matcha does bring back some fond memories of that but its not the same, and I doubt that you really could get the same result from anything but brandy itself but for all intents and purposes this is a very good flavor, a really nice experience, and one I will absolutely be ordering again! I know I say that about a lot of the matcha I have tried, and I have tried a lot of them but this along with about 5 others are THE matcha I can't be without! The "alcohol" effect is just enough for those who have had brandy to recognize but not so much that those who do not like brandy, have never had it, or should not have it, won't even notice. Its like being able to recognize any flavor, you kind of have to have experienced it before to know what it is. Without knowing what it is all you will notice is this AMAZING fruit festival in your mouth!

review/summary: The Matcha is Mine...
review/text: And the sailor said 'Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be..." Okay, so, that song is the only real reference to brandy I have, and that's not even the right brandy. Well, that song and the singer from the 90s...anyway. In college, one of my roommates liked to mix (cheap, horrible) brandy with her cola when she drank, and so I've had a few of those, but that's really it. I'm a whisky girl, through and through. That's what happens when you go to high school in Tennessee and college in Kentucky. But it looked interesting and I liked the brandy I've had, so I thought "why not?" If nothing else, it will be good for mixing with the apple matcha. Or the cola matcha, for when I'm having a bad day at work and need a drink but can't have one just yet. At least I can pretend. But I don't really have a flavor profile in mind when I try this matcha, so it will be an interesting experience. For instance, when I try a pineapple tea, I have in mind what I think a pineapple should taste like and I can match the tea up to that flavor profile and see how it compares. With this, I'm just shooting in the dark, though I'm sure I'll be comparing it to whisky before this review is done.<br /><br />Oh wow, this is good. This is goooood. Yes, the unnecessary "o"s were necessary. It's fruity and smooth and...yum. I don't quite know how to describe it. It's not what I was expecting out of brandy, but I don't really have any experience with brandy, so what do I know? I can almost taste a touch of alcohol, but that might just be my imagination. It does seem warming, which is odd since I'm drinking it cold. I love cold matcha and how easy it is to mix. Add water to matcha powder, whisk/froth, and go! Done! Yum. Saves me a ton of time in the mornings when I'm barely awake and trying to get ready for work.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. If this is what brandy tastes like, I need to try some as soon as possible. I think my father in law has some...it might be time to hang out with the in laws. It tastes kind of like bubble gum but...juicy fruit gum, not double bubble. Definitely one I plan to keep around.

review/summary: I'd have to give up coffee without this.
review/text: In the last 2-3 years, I've starting having problems with acid reflux... and unfortunately realized that my daily coffee habit was a major part of the problem. I've been drinking Puroast for the past year, and it has truly saved me! Don't get me wrong. I can still enjoy a cup of normal coffee out at restaurants. But if I run out of Puroast and switch back to other brands, it only takes a day or two for the acid reflux to come back with a vengeance! In fact, I recently moved and couldn't find this coffee in stores. I went several week brewing normal coffee and had to pop acid reducers nearly every day. Once I got my hands on Puroast again, the acid reflux symptoms went away in no time!<br /><br />As others have noted, it's not the most delicious cup of coffee but it's decent enough if you're a coffee-aholic. I drank the regular roast for quite some time, but recently switched to the French Roast in hopes that it would have a deeper flavor. It does! I normally despise French Roast coffee, but not so with the Puroast.

Thus a really good quality extract will have a high alcohol content. And from an ethical standpoint, I probably should have been looking for a fair trade label rather than an organic one.

review/text: I am new to drinking tea and have been sampling many different kinds of herbal teas in the last few weeks.  Bigelow's brand peppermint tea is my absolute favorite so far.  It has a nicely strong peppermint flavor with a subtle sweetness that I love.  My current supermarket does not carry Bigelow's peppermint tea so I purchased Celestial Seasoning's figuring how different can they be...they both have "peppermint" as the only ingredient.  I was surprised to find the Celestial Seasoning brand has a much weaker flavor and lacks the slight sweetness.  I will be ordering a case of Bigelow peppermint tea from Amazon in the near future.

review/summary: Stacy's Simply Naked Pita Chips
review/text: The pita chips themselves are very, very good - flavorful, but lightly salted with sea salt and crunchy.  Almost addictive.<br /><br />However, when I received my packages, they were mostly croutons.  Very, very, poorly packed and were smashed in transit.  There was no packing in the box with the chip, therefore, they just sloshed around until they were small pieces of chips.<br /><br />I would hope that next time someone orders them you'd pack them better.<br /><br />I know that I won't get an answer to this as no one there really cares as long as you get your money, and that this review is just a formality.  I did contact Stacy's about the issue and got a lot of nonsense about being fragile, hard to ship (they get shipped to stores without a problem), blah, blah, blah, ad nauseam.<br /><br />Someone, somewhere, needs to do a quality check on packing.

review/summary: Best of the Pita Chips
review/text: Stacy's Simply Naked are the best of the pita chips available on the market.  They go well with a variety of foods from pate to spinach dip, yet are very tasty all by themselves. These pita chips are perfectly salted and are crisp without the heavy, doughy brittleness found in other pita chips.

review/summary: Broken in a million pieces
review/text: Chips were broken into small pieces. Problem isn't amazon's, it's Stacy's. Stacy (or amazon) needs to pack the original box of six better, the bags move around too much. There was room for at least two more bags in the box.<br />Amazon packed the Stacy's box in their box very tight and good.<br /><br />I tried to complain to Stacy, they make it very hard, no luck.<br />Chips taste great though, maybe I'll pour them in a bowl with milk for breakfast.

review/summary: Great chips, if any weren't broken
review/text: The pita chips were very tasty and addictive. But, I've gone through 3 bags out of 6 and so far, I think I've found a total of 15 chips that were larger than one square inch. Obviously, it is likely a shipping issue that broke most of the chips, but the impact to me is still the same: a bag of chips that are very difficult to eat.<br /><br />I think my local Sam's Club has these more reasonably priced, in larger bags, and I'm more likely to get unbroken chips.

review/text: This is one of my favorite chips! It is so good. I just take it in mornings or with lunch to satisfy the chip cravings if I have. I am certainly not a big chip eater, but when i want to have this ranks in top.<br /><br />It is not salty and has a good crunch feeling due to Pita. I like with no extra flavors and everything combined gives this a great feeling.

review/text: Everyone should order stay pita chips from amazon.com, I have such a hard time finding them in the store in the party size and have to pay more for the small bags and have to hunt them on top of that.  I live in a rural area and love these chips and have lost over 20 pounds using them.  I order them from amazon.com and they come right to my door very fast,  I will only order them from amazon.com and not buy in the stores anymore.

review/summary: best chips ever
review/text: I first had these while on vacation in Florida.  Heard you could buy them at cosco.  I do not have a cosco near my home.  Got on line and found them on Amazon for a great price.  They were delivered quickly.  About 1/3 of the bag of chips were small pieces the rest were large.  I don't mind the small pieces they all taste the same to me.  But not to nice for serving at a party.  I would highly recommend the chip.  I found them at Target but they were in the small size and more expensive.  Could use a better packing method but I Would buy them again this way.

review/summary: Great chips - buy them at the store
review/text: I've tried several different types of Pita Chips and I think that Stacy's are the best.  It is hard to find them in my area so I decided to buy them via Amazon.  That was a mistake.  They were pretty well packaged when they arrived, but still were crushed in transit.  This isn't Amazon's fault.  It's the nature of shipping chips through UPS.  So I would recommend these chips, but your best bet is to try and find them in a store.

review/summary: These are so good I am addicted.
review/text: These chips are delicious and addicting. I started eating them because I thought they'd be a good alternative and healthier snack. They do not have as many calories as most snack foods and just a touch of sea salt. The best way I can describe them is that they remind me of crunching a delicious edge of pie crust, just slightly salty and crunchy - yet harder than a pie crust texture. I started buying them at Costco but they quit selling them at the store near me so I bought a case online.

review/text: Was introduced to these while visiting in Vermont.  Could not find them in local area.  Ordered these favs online and am enjoying the salty taste in lieu of potato chips.  Chips are hard and crunchy and good eaten alone or with tuna salad, hummus etc. Ordered them in Dec. and expiration date was not until May so that wasn't too bad. I can consume them before May.

As one reviewer has previously stated, my shipment was "short-dated" meaning that they were close to expiration.  We have since gone back to buying them at our local warehouse store where they are much fresher.

review/text: If you like Stacy's pita chips, this is a good way to get them (reasonable price, free shipping).  This time the 6 bags were packed in 2 boxes one inside the other so there were no torn bags/spillage (which happened with an earlier batch).  My only concern was that the expiration dates on all the bags were 12/18/07.  This was OK at the time but I wouldn't want to order more bags and find out they have technically expired.
