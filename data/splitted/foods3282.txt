review/summary: Just Fruit Bar - Pear flavor
review/text: The Just Fruit Bar - Pear flavor is delicious.  These are a great substitute when you don't have a piece of fruit available.  I'm sure it would be better to eat the real thing, but these are very convenient for when you run out of fruit and don't have time to run to the store.  I do love fruit and eat it all the time.  However, I can't keep an extra piece of fruit at work for a "just in case" moment because the fruit will go bad eventually.  I am extremely happy that I have found this delicious gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free option.

review/summary: Finally a snack bar without apples
review/text: These are a great bar for those who can't have apples.  They are about the consistency of taffy, which is great because my son thinks its candy.  Easy to transport for on-th-go snacks.  Half of a bar is enough to satisfy my son's appetite for a snack.

review/text: I took advantage of the 50% off special last summer to try some new-to-me products, including 4 flavors of these sesame seeds, and loved all of them! Light wasabi flavor, adding a tangy touch without making the food inedible to those who don't like spicy. I've used them with sweet-ish main dishes to add a complementary tang and they worked very well.

review/summary: Surprise! Coffee from Amazon.com
review/text: I've purchased coffee from a very few other sources online with great success. Then my main source only had Hazelnut in decaf. I'm sorry, decaf it not why I drink coffee and I'm now more flavored coffee oriented. I checked Amazon.com on a, "what the heck," chance they may have coffee. Amazing! Not only do they carry my kinds of coffee the Folgers 6 pack was only $1 more than my previous source. Yea! I was excited but suspected it might be old stock. NOT SO! It was very fresh, well packaged, received quickly since I'm a Prime member and an overall outstanding experience with Amazon.com. You cannot lose using Amazon.com for coffee and now I will check the Grocery section more closely. I can't wait to try some of their other coffee offerings and just may have found myself a new permanent coffee source. Once again Amazon.com proves itself quickly becoming my "go to" source for almost everything I need or want with such a good reputation.

My blend is 40% Hazelnut to 60% regular coffee. The Hazelnut flavor is much better this way.

review/summary: FOLGERS HAZELNUT
review/text: I'm not as pleased with Folger's Hazelnut flavored coffee, but I had no choice since Amazon.com has suddenly discontinued the ONLY decent fair-priced Hazelnut coffee left; that being Maxwell House Hazelnut coffee.  Now you go online and when you do find Maxwell House HZLNT they're asking $129.96 for 12 cans; robbing the consumer so I refuse to let them cheat me for $10.83/can (last advertised price at Amazon.com, mind you, via some overpriced distributor) - hey, it's only ground coffee probably manufactured in China no less! Most I paid through Amazon before this discontinued notice was around $4.90/can at the worst price.  Last order it was $3.90/can "before" their decision to suddenly cancel or rather go up significantly in the price as I notice it's back on Amazon.com.<br /><br />MOST hazelnut coffees on the market have NO HAZELNUT flavor to speak of; from the best to the worst brands - not like they used to when it was first introduced, like ALL products - as soon as you like something and purchase it, down the quality goes.  A few of those that are horrible - Dunkin Doughnuts, 8'Clock, Choc full O nuts, Starbucks, Green Mtn, Millstone, which is the the worst, Pete's coffee, N.E. Coffee, no that's the worst(forgot the hazelnut syrup), and I could go on and on.  I am going to try the Hazelnut syrups next.  Anyone suggest a good one to purchase? I'm sure there are really good and really bad hazelnut syrups out there.<br /><br />A 3 at best from me.

review/text: How much is there really to say about salt?  The size of the ground crystals will depend on your grinder - I find fine to be good for some foods (like eggs) and prefer a coarser grind for other foods (potatos).  The Sea Salt has a more complex flavor than regular, "plain" table salt.<br /><br />For me, the flavor of the Sea Salt is much prefered over normal salt.

review/text: I've been picking up some of the gourmet items newly stocked by my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and one of these is a 5.3-ounce packet of Bahlsen Hit Cookies with a cocoa creme central filling. The outer cookie is light and fresh and tastes somewhat like a good fortune cookie. The center is a chocolate/cocoa creme layer of filling. I'd say it leans somewhat toward the bitter part of the chocolate spectrum and that's the way I like it. The cookies are manufactured in Poland by a German company.  They're quite a nice treat. I'm going to see if they have any other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I bought one of these at an high end gift shop, for a snack, and it was delicious.  I don't know much about the value of resveratrol or how much these actually have in them, I just know it was rich, chewy and smothered in dark chocolate.  I didn't notice any wine or alcoholic flavor.  It is relatively low in sugar, considering how rich it tastes!

review/text: Cha Cha sunflower seeds from China are bigger and crunchier than any American seeds. Also, I often get rancid American seeds, but never Cha Cha. Superior packaging, I think. Best of all, the flavor on these shells is wonderful in a sweet, salty, and savory way, but it does not rub off on your hands. This is a product clearly superior to its rivals. I eat a bag every week.

review/text: Tried this on a whim when we saw it at a local Asian grocery store in town.  Of course, we got hooked on it and, wouldn't you know it, the store stopped carrying it!  After hunting high and low, finally found it on Amazon.  It was a happy day!  Granted, this may not be the most nutritious thing for you but once in awhile, it's a yummy snack.  It's bite-sized crunch is slightly sweet, slightly salty and goes great with a sandwich.  Or break some up and sprinkle on a salad with some Asian ginger dressing.

review/summary: Good Tasting Sugar Free Dip/Topping - Recommended
review/text: The Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this "Marshmallow" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles marshmallow by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.<br /><br />I like the flavor and use it on other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with sugar free chocolate ice cream and with peanut butter sandwiches.<br /><br />Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really marshmallow. You might also want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026VPVK0">Chocolate Dip 12 oz</a>.

review/text: Sugar Free, Calorie Free, Carb Free, Anything but Marshmallow tasting free.<br />I think it's good to have on hand in case of the "gotta have something now before someone gets hurt" cravings that I get in the evenings.  It's much better cold in my opinion.  I just eat it right out of the jar with a spoon.  My family wouldn't touch it if their life depended on it so it's all mine...<br />The only other item I have tried is the Honey Mustard Dressing by Walden Farms and it too is laking in that "OMG, this is just like the real thing" taste sensation that you might expect just by looking at it in the jar.  But, for those us who are always at battle with the buldge, it works.<br />Walden Farms gets an A+ for effort, that's for sure.

review/summary: A Decent Diet Cool Whip...It is not marshmellow dip...
review/text: I have tried two the Walden diet food products and so far.  I have tried the chocolate dip<br />and the marshmellow dip.  I wasn't too crazy about the chocolate dip on my strawberries.  I<br />thought about tossing the chocolate in the trash however I hate to waste food and I almost<br />finished the jar...almost.<br /><br />The marshmellow dip is more like a diet Cool Whip cream to me.  I enjoy it on my strawberries.<br />A relative of mine tried the marshmellow dip and thought it was marginally decent however I don't<br />think they will be running to the store to buy it.  Me, I have purchased several jars for it<br />makes my strawberries more tasty...<br /><br />So should you buy it?  Well, It is a matter of tastes.<br />The no calories is a nice feature and they do a decent job of mimicing Cool Whip in its taste.<br /><br />I would advise sorting all the Walden diet foods by Amazon customer ratings and use that as your<br />guide...

review/summary: Thoughts on 'Marshmallow Dip'
review/text: Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip, an anomalous 'calorie-free' 'food' is interesting. Like others have noted, does not resemble marshmallow fluff in texture, and only slightly in taste perhaps. Its incredibly sweet to taste in itself, almost unbearably so. It's....meh... BUT, given its insignificant to no caloric profile, it actually makes a fantastic filler. I found that I could add my post-workout protein and creatine mixture to this stuff, with a small amount of fruit, and enjoy a pudding-esque concoction with calories being contributed solely from protein and miniscule amounts of fruit sugar. In this capacity, the stuff works wonders. Undoubtedly beats the alternative: water, protein, creatine. By itself? Perhaps not the best thing, but definitely a great way to experiment with other foods and still save on unneeded calories.

review/text: I would love to say I like this stuff.  Especially since I spent $3.99 on it.  I wasn't expecting it to be just like the real thing but...OMG.  This stuff is really not good.  About the only thing it has in common with marshmallow cream is that it's white.  I actually spit it out.<br />It's an awful texture and taste like an elixir of strange chemicals that are vaguely masked by a cloying sweetness.  I thought, as I spit it out, that it seemed illegal to be able to sell this as anything edible.  You decide.  But I warned you.  99% of people will find this<br />inedible.

review/summary: Yum, yum!
review/text: I fell in love with the taste of lingonberries because of IHop which offers a dish of Swedish crepes/pancakes served with lingonberry butter and preserves. The combination is divine. Now, because of Amazon, I just received an order of Hafi Lingonberry Preserves and can order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25S8U">Lund's Swedish Pancake Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and create my own version of IHop's marvelous dish!<br /><br />Ah, the taste of lingonberries--subtle, light, elegant, yet fruit-luscious in each spoonful. Items like preserves and cheeses can be served two ways: ambient room temperature or chilled. I prefer the ambient taste--the chill retards the full flavor.<br /><br />So what does lingonberry preserves taste like? Not strong like blueberry preserves. Not exotic like blackberry or heady like grape or tart like raspberry. Subtle. Sweet enough but nothing near cloying. Perfect.<br /><br />Until the pancake mix arrives, I'll have lingonberry preserves on homemade biscuits. Yum, yum!<br /><br />Note: As this is a product of Sweden and shipped from Sweden, I must mention the packaging. The jar was double-wrapped in bubble wrap. And as a little treat came a tin of peppermint lozenges. Delightful!

review/summary: Delicious - my new daily breakfast
review/text: I have to admit that I'd never heard of lingonberries prior to seeing a report on TV singing their praises.  The report said that lingonberries are higher in anti-oxidants than just about any other berry and that anti-oxidants may play a significant role in reducing instances of cancer.  Okay, so far so good.  But, where to find lingonberries?  I turned to good old Amazon and stumbled across these preserves.  Although a little pricey, I couldn't be happier.  I've ordered 3 jars so far and each has arrived quickly and in great condition.  The taste is wonderful, sort of like a refined cranberry, and it has become my daily spread on either whole wheat toast or a toasted bagel in the morning.  The calorie count is not too high, less than 40 calories per serving, so even though it's a tasty treat I don't worry about tacking on the pounds.  All in all, I'm very happy I heard about the lingonberry and even happier with the Hafi Preserves.

Sugar is the second ingredient listed.<br /><br />Truthfully, when shopping on Amazon you have to double check everything and cannot take Amazon's word<br />for anything.  In the last few years Amazon has grown so big that it has gotten very sloppy on the details.  When it comes to specifics such as content of sugar, gluten, etc., their filters don't seem to be doing the job.

Of course I add a lot of spices to them pre-cooking along with some olive oil.  The meat just readily falls apart when you touch it with your fork.  The taste I guess depends on the spices you use.  I mainly use garlic and black pepper but throw in a dash of several others too and the flavor is just remarkable.  I will be buying these again!

review/summary: OK Coffee
review/text: I purchased the coffee maker based on being able to get Starbucks. I purchased boxes of Starbucks, Columbian and Breakfast Blend, but am now running low. I decided I would try some others. I hated Grevalia, the Maxwell House is OK coffee, but like drinking flavored water, when I saw the French Roast, which is supposed to be DARK and assumed stronger and fairly inexpensive, I thought I should at least try it. It is hard to replace Starbucks, but the French Roast is OK, not wonderful. I tried the Narob and several different others, but FOR ME this is going to have to be my Starbucks replacement.<br />I had heard that Tassimo was supposed to get a better choice by mid to end of summer and it appears they have fallen short. I had heard that Starbucks was to partner with Cruinart, but so far it's not showing up. I'm not sure these single cup guys are so great, when you are forced to a limited brand of coffees. We are back to Corporate America manipulating our morning cup of wake up.

review/summary: tassimo t-discs
review/text: The cost is considerably less, however the loss of the Starbuck brand and African Kitamu t-discs was a real downer. I have tried many single serve coffees and Starbucks was the best. I'm sure it has had a negative effect on Bosch single serve coffee maker sales. At this time I'm considering a Nesspresso machine because of the bold, dark coffee blends available.

review/summary: Undiscovered gem
review/text: You've already discovered Tassimo, now discover one of their best and cheapest coffees!  This French Roast is just as good as the more costly Gevalia.  It's also better than the regular Maxwell House blend, I think it's called House Blend.  I used to buy it directly from Tassimo, but they have gone up a dollar per package so this is the best deal going.  Hope Amazon continues to offer it forever!

review/text: Kellogg's original All-Bran cereal has simply the most dietary fiber of any cereal known to me.  The fiber<br />is good for many digestive aspects.  I've been eating for several years, and it works.<br />  The cereal is almost tasteless; fructose makes it a bit sweet.  So add fruit to it.  I add bananas which makes the cereal taste fairly good.  But it's never going to be a great breakfast.  One eats this cereal for health reasons, and for this purpose it's the best.

review/summary: What a treat!
review/text: Ferrero Rocher is a morsel of milk chocolate with hazelnut filling.  The candy has a pleasant slighty crunchy taste.  Even though I generally prefer dark chocolate, I find Ferrero Rocher very tasty and not too sweet.  I also like the individual packaging of the candies.  Sometimes I can stop at one. However, more often I have to have a "chaser".  They are a satisfying treat!<br /><br />I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.

YUM!<br /><br />As for the Chocolate itself - it has a wide arrays of Chocolate textures and its flavors as you savor it; I can taste the simplicity of regular milk chocolate to the more expounded in depth the semi bittersweet chocolate inside - it all balances itself just perfect.<br /><br />ATTENTION: NUT ALLERGY WARNING - THIS BOX DOES COME WITH A WARNING THAT MAY CONTAIN PEANUTS (?); BUT THE CONTENTS CONTAINS HAZELNUTS / FILBERTS (Same nut - name depends on region).

review/summary: Delicious and perfect for gift-giving
review/text: These consist of a crispy chocolate shell with one hazelnut inside, nestled in a soft whip of chocolate. The combination of smooth chocolate and crispiness make this a very satisfying treat. Each is beautifully wrapped in gold foil, which makes them a perfect addition to a gift box or Christmas stocking. You can wrap a few in tissue paper and tie off one end, or simply leave one on someone's desk as a nice surprise. They are beautiful, luxurious and very reasonably priced. I actually prefer them over more expensive chocolates. They go perfectly with a cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you're buying them for yourself, the individual wrapping is great because you aren't tempted to eat the whole box. I usually have one or two at once, but am not tempted to have more, even though they're delicious. One piece has 73 calories, which is less than a lot of chocolate treats. I won't advocate chocolate as part of one's diet, but if you're someone who needs to indulge a little sometimes to stay on track for the long haul, these are great.<br /><br />The larger box is perfect if you're filling stockings, and the smaller box is nice for a small gift. This 5.3oz size is my favorite because there's enough to keep a few and give a few without worrying they'll go stale.
