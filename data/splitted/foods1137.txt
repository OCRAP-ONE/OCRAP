review/summary: Two words...AWESOME AND ADDICTIVE
review/text: I first ran across these in a hospital gift shop. White chocolate is my weakness and these kit kats soon became my obsession. I even persuaded the school bookstore manager to purchase them and once she did, I pretty much bought half of the box, lol. Price quickly became an issue so once I saw these on Amazon, somewhat cheaper, I was sold. Price was only a few bucks cheaper than if I'd bought the whole box from the store and I do wish it was cheaper, but it'll do.

review/text: Kit Kat White Chocolate Candy Bar 24 ct, I love white chocolate so I had to get this Item. Kit Kat is a great candy bar and 24 of them in a box, very dangerous, I got it for Halloween, after eating two of the bars I gave the rest away and I am glad I did because if I kept it at home as I wanted to, I would have eaten the whole box, really, is that good! It's not that chocolaty, it only has less then 2% of cocoa butter, however Kit Kat is very Creamy and Sweet...and crunchy of course! I love it. Thank You

review/summary: Surprisingly good milk chocolate
review/text: I tried my first Equal Exchange bar yesterday. The cocoa flavor is deep and lingers in the mouth, the mark of a good chocolate, beyond what you would expect from the middling 38% cocoa content (most premium milk chocolate starts at 40%, 50% is common and there are some bars with 60% cocoa). The fact their cacao is sourced from Latin America helps, as South America is the ancestral home of cacao, and American cacao (specially from Venezuela, Ecuador and Trinidad) tends to be better than the industrial forastero grades grown in Africa or Indonesia. This chocolate was also conched properly, with a very smooth texture. The hazelnuts it is blended with are hard to discern, however. They may contribute to the smoothness.<br /><br />This is world-class chocolate. I would not hesitate to put it in the same company as the best from Valrhona, Cluizel, Guittard or Hachez. The price is relatively moderate for premium chocolate.<br /><br />I tend to be suspicious of the Fairtrade label. Their certification is expensive, and most of the money goes to pay Western experts than the poor farmers it purports to help. I tried "Divine" brand chocolates, as the company is actually owned by cocoa farmers in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, but was disappointed with grainy and fairly insipid bars. The good thing about Equal Exchange is the product stands on its own, even before the feel-good factor.

review/summary: Healthy Treats that Dogs Love
review/text: I have a pet care business and needed a product that was safe for all my dogs who had allergies.  I also thought that it would give the dogs some extra greens since I often notice them chewing on the grass on our walks.  All the dogs loved the treats (except one very cranky, picky pooch) and I've had no adverse affects or allergic reactions.  Definitely a good heathy treat that works well for dogs with Chicken, Beef and Grain allergies.

review/text: I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.

review/text: While I prefer to eat red curry chicken at a Thai restaurant, this is a very acceptable ingredient to make the dish at home. After scouring the shelves at the local oriental markets this is the only canned sauce I found that doesn't have MSG. It doesn't have the intense flavor of the fresh curry paste, but it will do in a pinch. Note: it's not too spicy; just right for me and I usually order mild at a Thai restaurant.

review/text: If you're having trouble to eat your fish, this is perfect for it. I've tried it out with chicken as well, but fish and this are just perfect together, you just have to be careful to add it till the las couple of minutes of cooking time because the herbs might burn. If you love fish pair it with this and you'll se how different and delicious will taste. The price was very good though in supermarkets might be a little bit less expensive but it won't last for long in the shelves. (but I'm talking about cents!)

review/summary: FDA WARNING - Be Advised
review/text: Recently purchased a bag of Dogswell Chicken jerky Treats from PetCareRX. When received at home a friend informed us to make sure that the product was not made in China as the FDA had issued a warning in November 2011 of a foodborne illness that was traced back to jerky treats made in China. Apparently this is the second such warning has been issued. Dogs were getting sick and even dying. No where on PetCareRX's site did they present the warning nor indicate the product was made in China. The package is unopened. Asked for RA to return product for refund. REFUSED!  PetCareRX says to pay for return shipping ourselves and they will not refund the outgoing shipping. They continue to sell the Chinese made jerky treats to their customers regardless of the FDA warning still in effect. After putting our pet at risk to ask us to incur further costs just to get back to even is ridiculous. SHAMEFUL.

review/summary: Excellent Scoop. Well Worth The Money.
review/text: I bought three of these Van Ness Cat Litter Scoops at Wal-Mart about five years ago. I got excellent service out of them. I use the "clumping" cat litter and I tend to be somewhat negligent in cleaning the litter box. As such, a lot of the clumps can be stuck together. I've broken a couple of the scoops in attempting to break them apart. It's not the scoop's fault. It's my fault. Or maybe we could say that it's the litter's fault in that it has such a good odor control that I don't even notice the box needs freshening.<br /><br />Ah well, I paid less than a dollar each for these things at the time and they've lasted all these years, I'd say it was an excellent product well worth the money. I now bought a new one of a different brand and I hope it works as well. So far it has.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!
review/text: This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need.

review/summary: One of the best dog food out there.
review/text: I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!

review/summary: Yes, it's expensive but...
review/text: SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Looks gross, smells gross, my dog loves it!!!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this because it costs a fortune and venison and fish sounded pretty unappetizing.  But I was desperate, because I have a 16 year old dog who's always been a picky eater but had now lost a dangerous amount of weight because of a heart condition.  The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.  Maybe your dog just has a sophisticated palette :-)

review/summary: Great Product - Too Expensive!
review/text: I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them.

review/summary: raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....
review/text: I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.<br /><br />Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.<br /><br />Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).<br /><br />Fresh breath, no more doggy odor!<br />Stools do not smell (or very very faint)<br />One of the dogs - a Maltese - her tearstains have completely disappeared!!<br />Glossier coats<br />More energetic<br /><br />Etc etc.<br /><br />So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!

review/text: I have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie. He used to like the Paw Naturaw Grassfed Bison meals, but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it. I tried Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food. This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too. I order on Monday and received it on Tuesday. I am very pleased with the product and the shipment.<br /><br />I am sold on this product and will definitely order this again.

review/text: My dog started to become finicky with her Wellness Core dog food.  She must stay on it for allergy purposes so I really have no option but to encourage her to eat it.  I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat, I would strongly recommend this dog food.  It is quality through and through.  : )

review/summary: greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst
review/text: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!

Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.<br /><br />So we are huge fans!

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!
review/text: I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.

review/text: My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared-up.<br /><br />The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.

review/summary: Great substitute for raw diet, but expensive!
review/text: We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.

review/text: We are pretty happy with these product. the dog doesn;t have nearly as much gas as she did on other KIbble diet. The only thing that was better was a completely RAW diet, but with that you never know if the product you have purcahsed is the freshes it can be, and the pet suffers for that. where as the ZIWIPeak stay fresh for at lest 30 days after you open it and longer if you serve from the freezer.

review/summary: Best thing on the market (without the mess)!
review/text: My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!

review/summary: it's like crack for dogs
review/text: i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail-wagging, tunnel-visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.  it's grain free and super expensive but worth it -- it has helped curb the awful gas of our 13 lb chihuahua/min-pin. as a bonus, his coat is shinier too. (now if we could just make his breath & body odor better).... the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price.

review/summary: every dog should eat this!
review/text: This dog food is absolutely wonderful.  If I could afford to, I would feed my dog only this.  My 2 year old Vizsla is the pickiest dog I've ever met (won't even eat most treats) and she can't get enough of this food.  Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.  If you have a dog with any food sensitivities and have tried many different foods this will be the last food you will need to try.  My dog has never looked and acted healthier than she has on this food (and I have tried about 20 different brands).  You won't be disappointed, it is worth every penny!

review/summary: Venison Very High Quality Dry & Raw - No Grains
review/text: Have a miniature poodle and he is a very picky eater.  When we eat rib eye, leg of lamb etc that is what he wants too.  Well we love our dog but we were looking for a compromise that would not cost an arm and a leg. He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.<br /><br />Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot. And we can feel good about the quality.  Also this supposedly keeps the amount of poo down to.

review/text: If you had a lot of lamb in your life you'd be impressed with how "lammy" this dog food smells. Our little dog absolutely loves it too. Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.<br /><br />An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.

review/summary: My Westie loves it!
review/text: I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY

review/text: I have three puppy mill rescue Pekingese and I have tried about every other high end dog food that I could think to try.  This is by far the best dog food that I have found to date.  One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining, but when I asked around I heard various reasons why (I was told hard water- switched to deer park with no results) and after eating ziwipeak my dog's tear stains are GONE.  It's unreal.  Most importantly... they LOVE it!  Even when I walk past the bag, they go nuts.  Worth EVERY PENNY.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak Addict
review/text: My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say "you gonna give me some of that?" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.

review/text: My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...

review/summary: Great raw food that dogs love...and grain free!!
review/text: We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1/3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!
review/text: A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!

review/summary: Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It
review/text: I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line.

review/summary: 8 month Shih Tzu loves VENISON!!!
review/text: I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu breed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!

review/summary: Good supplement for raw diet
review/text: I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other "veterinary prescription" kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part.

review/text: I have two of the most spoiled, finicky dogs on the planet and they love this food. It is apparent this is quality food and if you buy the 11 lb bag, the price is reasonable.

review/text: The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak Peaks!!
review/text: My yorkies absolutely love this food.  Originally, I purchased this product because it was free of ingredients that would cause allergies.  Subsequently, I have learned that my dogs do not have food allergies but I kept them on ZiwiPeak because of its high quality content and delicious taste.  It is very expensive but I believe my yorkies are more than worth it.  I highly recommended this product to any dog owner who wants the best food for their pet.

review/summary: I will not take a chance with my dogs health
review/text: My dogs love the taste of it. my worry is the next day one of them vomit the entire food he just ate plus the one from the previous day. I have to said I did not gradually change to this food, so maybe that is the reason. but I notice lots of urine more than normal. I just don't feel comfortable feeding this food to my dogs.

I AM TRYING NOW THE NATURES VARIETY RAW FROZEN FOOD RABBIT  AND THANKS GOD HE LIKES IT. I ALSO FEED HIM RAW PORK  FROM THE SUPERMARKET. MY DOG LIKES FRESH RAW MEATS NOT DRY MEATS. HE ALSO EATS FRESH VEGETABLES LIKE TOMATOES, BROCCOLI, GREEN BELL PEPPER ETC.

review/summary: Great product (and very heavy)
review/text: I actually hurt my back carrying this up the stairs, but it was worth it! Haha  It really is great flour for making pizza or bread. I use it frequently. I used to purchase the smaller 2.2 lb. bags, but this was more cost effective, even with shipping. I hope someday that Molino Caputo Napoli products become Prime eligible so I can save even more money on the shipping.

review/summary: laxative cookies
review/text: Don't order these unless you need a laxative!  These cookies contain the sweetener "maltitol" which has a laxative effect.  THAT'S WITH ONE COOKIE!  This should have been stated with the nutrition facts on the box. The canister type container of Jennie's Brand macaroons is wonderful!<br />This BIG box contained 10 quarter-sized cookies, too.  I wouldn't have really wanted more after it's effect on my system, but for the price.....

review/summary: False advertising. Each cookie has 13g of non-fiber carbs.
review/text: The front of the box and their ads say "0g Net Carbs" but the nutritional label says 1g fiber, 1g sugar and 12g sugar alcohols. Eating one of these is the same as eating 13g of sugar for a diabetic. Unless their opinion that the diarrhea that the 12g of maltitol per cookie will give you will cause you to expel the cookie before it has a chance to be digested? P.S. Each of these 70 calorie cookies in miniscule. About the size of your fingertip.

review/summary: Small box, too expensive for what you actually get.
review/text: This is one of those situations where you really need to look at what you're ordering. I was expecting a large box of cookies but instead got this tiny 5 ounce box with a handful of macaroons in it.<br /><br />My fault, because it DOES say it's a 5 ounce box but it's not in the product name, features, or description, you have to scroll down to the shipping weight (5 ounces) to see that, or zoom in and read the box.<br /><br />The price is way too high for the amount of macaroons you actually get so be warned that unless you only plan on eating one macaroon at a time you're pretty much buying this for a one-time snack (maybe there's 10 macaroons in the box) and for the price? It's not worth it in my opinion and especially not with the shipping cost.<br /><br />On the taste side the macaroons are good (if you like macaroons but if you don't you shouldn't be buying this anway) but be warned that they are sweetened with maltitol which can have a laxative effect if you eat too many but in my opinion and experience there's not really enough in one box to cause that problem.<br /><br />I give 3 stars because technically if you read what you're buying there should be no surprises and the macaroons DO taste like macaroons even with the zero carb aspect so I can't complain too much because had I read the page thoroughly I would have known what I was getting myself into. But I also would not have purchased the product.<br /><br />There are better low carb snack products out there so unless you REALLY like macaroons and feel like spendg 75 cents for each one (which is roughly the size of an average strawberry) it's probably not worth it.

review/text: We have visited one Christkindlmarkt after another in Germany, Austria and Prague, savoring the incomparable experience of sipping Gluhwein in the bitter cold. This package is the closest we have come to duplicating the authentic taste in the simplest fashion: just adding water, sugar and wine to this amazing spice bag. Unless you really wish to hunt up all the ingredients and try to get the balance right on your own, buy this wonderful ready-made packet.

review/summary: The best I've had
review/text: I've traveled in Germany many times, and have enjoyed their Gluhwein many times.<br />My father-in-law recommended this brand, that he'd had in Scandanavia, and I must say it's even better that the German version!<br />I served it (mixed with German sweet red wine) to a NATO officer living here, and he admitted he'd only once tasted a version as good.<br />I suppose if you had the recipe, you could make the stuff at home for less money - but good luck finding a recipe this good!

review/text: Gluhwein is a staple in Germany during the cold months.  Freshly brewed, steaming hot, the blend of spices and warm wine invigorates the entire body.  This spice blend, once blended, is as close as you can get to strolling down ancient streets in quaint European towns and savoring the holiday season.

review/text: since living here in the states, christmas season has always been hard for me because i miss all the good things like gingerbread and of course the gluehwein.. i didnt know about this until i got it as a gift, being homesick for a german christmas market, and oh my god! i couldnt stop drinking!!<br /><br />this is he best i have had over here! if u have never been to germany but want to try something almost authentic - this is it! the only thing missing is the atmosphere of the market, the sights and sounds, the snow falling down and the winter cold..but when u close your eyes with a cup of this in your hand, just imagine it and u will have an idea..<br />i do it and it makes me smile..<br /><br />thank u so much for offering this! a lot of people will be just as grateful as i am of having a little piece of home during the christmas season?, :))

review/summary: Great little funnel pitcher!
review/text: I teach German and make funnel cakes with all my 6th grade students (about 175 each year.)  I used to do it the "old fashioned" way by covering the spout of a funnel with a finger and then pouring it. This was a MESS!  This pitcher makes it so much quicker, cleaner and easier!  I don't use the ring because it is pretty unnecessary in my opinion (plus it scratches non-stick Teflon off of pan.)  I also haven't yet used the mix because we make our own from scratch.  So I guess I'm just reviewing the pitcher, but it works GREAT!  Because the kids have more control over movement, they really can get creative with their cakes.<br /><br />The one con is that it is made of plastic, so I'm worried that one day I'll have a meltdown with either the bottom being set too close to the burner or the funnel tip going in the hot oil, but so far, so good.  This is great fun for everyone and my students LOVE it!<br /><br />A few tips:<br /><br />Add some cinnamon and almond extract--yum!<br />Flip using metal tongs--not a spatula--for less splatter and mess.<br />Plan to make several at a time--they are cheap to make, but the oil can be pricey.

review/summary: Great for at-home fun
review/text: I really only needed the funnel/pitcher, but it was easy and neat to make funnel cakes. I had been using a kitchen funnel, which made a big mess no matter how careful I was. I didn't use the ring because I made the funnel cakes in a small deep fryer. The mix was fine, but I prefer my own recipe. If I could have just bought the funnel/pitcher, that would have been fine and saved me some money, but I'm not disappointed.
