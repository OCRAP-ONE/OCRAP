review/summary: Beans are very fresh and oily, taste is nice and bold. This is my new favorite coffee
review/text: I like my coffee nice and bold. I normally drink Starbucks Sumatra blend which has been my long-time favorite. I decided to give the Organic Camano Island Sumatra Dark Roast Whole-Bean coffee a try and boy am I happy I did. The coffee arrived tightly sealed in a clear bag. I will warn you that it's difficult to impossible to open this bag in a way they you can continue to store the beans in it. I would be prepared with some type of storage container of some sort. I opened the bag and found the most fragrant, freshest coffee that I have found so far. The beans were nice and oily the way I like them. I ground them very fine like espresso and this is one of the best cups of coffee that I have ever tasted. I am absolutely very impressed with this coffee, especially since I had never heard of the brand before. Not to mention with the subscribe and save discount I was able to get a very good price on this coffee. I will definitely be a return customer time and time again. I feel very comfortable recommending this coffee to everyone.

review/summary: Doubled in Price & Beware of Subscribe and Save
review/text: This coffee is good, but I don't like the flavor as much as Starbuck's Sumatra.  It certainly can't compete at the same price as Starbucks.  I'd rather pay $11 per pound for Starbucks Sumatra than $10 (with Subscribe and Save) for this company's roast.  It was good while it lasted at half the SBUX price point, but I never thought it really competed with the old Seattle Stop Sign.<br /><br />I'm going to try this company before shelling out the full $11 per pound at SBX:  http://www.amazon.com/Indonesian-Sumatra-Mandheling-Whole-16-ounce/dp/B00486R24E/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1300373343&sr=1-1<br /><br />By the way, I'm sure it's all part of the Subscribe and Save terms and conditions, but I believe the vendor should notify you when the price changes on a subscription item.  I almost think it would be better for them to cancel a subscription for a product when they double the price that was the basis for the original agreement. I'm glad I caught it this time and cancelled the subscription.<br /><br />There was another hiccup on S&S.  This company "cancelled" a scheduled shipment last time because it needed me to update my address--which had not changed.  Then when I set it back up, I got and was charged for TWO shipments within a couple days of each other.  I didn't mind too much because I was going to buy it later anyway, but I certainly didn't intend on a double-shipment for an address change that hadn't actually happened.  Maybe it was their change from UPS to USPS that caused the error.  Fine.  But why is the product NOW doubled in price without notice for subscribers?<br /><br />I still give their coffee beans 4 stars.

review/text: My wife and I really enjoy drinking this coffee every morning.  Visitors to our home have commented on how good it is.  It is a nice dark roast. Maybe not quite as dark as a french roast, but plenty dark even for coffee lovers who really like the flavor of dark roasted coffee.  You simply cannot beat the price. I brew it in a Saeco automatic drip coffeemaker with a reusable filter.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: When it comes to coffee I am somewhat picky, but this is one of the better ones I bought on Amazon so far.<br /><br />While it is a dark roast, it does NOT have the clearly burned taste I had to endure with many of the dark roast whole beans I tested during the last months. Sometimes it was outright tragic in that I tested a new one and it was really good, just for the second batch I ordered to be so burned it was barely drinkable.<br /><br />I am using these beans in my Jura Espresso machine with settings for strong brew. They give me a pleasant and complex coffee; the only complaint is that is is a little flat in the end. But as I said, when it comes to coffee I am very picky, and these beans are definitely in the top 5 that I have tried so far, and amongst those give the best value. I ordered 2x 5 pound so far, and both were not over roasted, which seems to be a good sign too given my previous experiences.<br /><br />Bottom line: Can recommend, will buy again.

review/text: We have gone through a number of bags of this coffee and continue to enjoy it every day. It has a deep, rich flavor that we never get tired of.<br /><br />While the beans clearly are excellent, care in roasting is quite evident, too. Every bean is uniformly dark-roasted; not one is ever burnt. The result is the rich, bold flavor of dark coffee without any of the harshness or bitterness of very black beans.<br /><br />Brewing method: super automatic espresso machine. Have tried a number of different coffees in the machine over several years. This is the best.

review/text: I'd really give this Sumatran coffee 4 1/2 stars. I like coffee strong, full bodied, & this coffee is. The reasons for 1/2 point off is that the taste is for me not quite 100%, but I don't know how to describe the problem. It's way too subtle& of course ever so subjective. I've been buying a Trader Joe Sumatran for roughly equal price. For me that one is less satisfying than the one rated here.

review/text: Sprite lemon lime soda has always been popular; and there's no secret why. Sprite is a very refreshing soft drink with good carbonation that quenches your thirst no matter what! This six pack of Sprite is good for when you're on the go--it's easy to carry in a cooler during the summer, for example.<br /><br />The idea of drinking Sprite in cans means that the soda doesn't loose its carbonation as it would if you bought a large bottle of soda. Each can remains completely fresh to the moment you open it to drink it. You can carry the six pack with you or you can also remove the cans from the pack and then place the individual cans themselves into your refrigerator.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderfully refreshing soft drink that many people enjoy for many good reasons. It is particularly refreshing with a hot meal or on a hot summer's day when you've been working outside. The six pack makes it easier than ever before to store the individual cans of Sprite in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Thank you, Sprite!!!

review/summary: Not exactly what the name implies...
review/text: Because the point of using honey for me is to avoid the fast changes in blood glucose levels that come with refined/processed sugars -- this "not-all-honey" honey product does not work.  If you go to the company's website, it clearly says that this is only 60% honey -- the rest is maltodextrin, a fructose usually derived from wheat.  That's like paying for steak that is 40% breadcrumbs.<br /><br />Yes, you are getting pure honey in this -- but you're also getting filler.  Honey does not need a preservative or flavor enhancer, and it certainly doesn't need added fructose.  If it is impossible to make a powdered or granulated product from honey, companies should just say so, and not market something as honey when it's really just 3/5 honey.  A company that starts out its relationship to me by trying to deceive me, is off my list -- no matter what else they make.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Stale Granola Bars
review/text: The Granola bars, with about a month left before being out of date, were stale, petrified and inedible.  I returned the product to the original seller.  Amazon charged double what the original merchant charged for the product.<br />All in all, a very disappointing experience.  I have bought from Amazon many times in the past and was always pleased with the merchandise.  This was the first "FAIL" for me.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/summary: Rich, Delicious Snack Bars
review/text: These bars come two in a package (and two to a serving size!) and are absolutely delicious.  They are crunchy and rich. The peanut butter bars taste like they are made with actual peanut butter holding the grains together.  The white chocolate macadamia nut bars have little pieces of soy white chocolate in the bars and you can taste them when you bite in.  These bars can keep me full for a while and are a great snack.  Appropriate for a plant based diet.

I loved these though, and the white chocolate macadamia nut was so yummy! I would definitely buy these again! Great value. But very messy, so definitely not recommended for a breakfast while in the car! ha :)

review/summary: Best crunchy granola bar!
review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Probably the finest compliment I can offer is that if I was going to make a crunchy peanut butter granola bar at home, I'm not sure I could make them better than these. Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/summary: a dark chocolate lovers' delight, a blueberry lover's disappointment
review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

review/text: I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.  They are so good, however, I've continued to purchase them.  Even my children really like them and they usually only like granola bars if they are packed with so much sugar and covered in chocolate to the point you can't distinguish them from a candy bar.<br /><br />I like the Clif brand and what the company is trying to do, besides offering a more wholesome granola bar without compromising taste.<br /><br />The granola bars are certified organic by QAI and packaging is made from 100% recycled material.  Hey, every little bit helps when you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint.

I usually have clif bars in my school bag to stave off hunger during classes before succumbing to the call of a vending machine.<br /><br />The Chocolate Macadamia Nut flavor is a bit too sweet for my tastes which was a little surprising for a Clif bar (but it is chocolate). I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

review/text: These are so awesome. They have great crunch, without being really hard (like nature valley) and the little bits of chocolate throughout the bar are delightful. I would eat these for dessert instead of cake or brownies. Peanut butter is good too.

review/summary: Ridiculously delicious
review/text: These things are awesome!  I only ordered them because they were on a good sale on amazon, but now I'll gladly pay full price.<br /><br />They taste soo good!  No high fructose corn syrup, a big plus.  They do have "evaporated cane juice" as the sweetener.  I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: I love these granola bars!  I can honestly say they are the best granola bars I've ever eaten.  They also have protein, and I love eating them just as a snack as well as if I'm on the go or post workout.  My only problem is they are hard to find in grocery stores...and I usually don't like to wait around to fill out a "please stock this item" form.

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

review/summary: JBMC
review/text: I've purchased a few JBMC whole beans from different roasters over the years, and wanted to share my experience with this particular seller.<br />I was running low on my normal supply of JBMC and decided to give this seller a try, because of their slightly lower price, and they had it in stock and shipped it out immediately.<br /><br />My opinion is that the JBMC beans from this seller were either old, or something went wrong during their roasting process.  The grind has a slight sour smell when brewing, which in turn gives a slight bitter taste.<br />Good JBMC is very smooth; on the lighter side; slightly sweet and spicy with a nice finish.  Like good 100% Kona coffee, there is no bitter aftertaste.<br />I tried different grinds, #16 and #24, and prefer the #24 grind for a single cup brew.<br />The place I normally get this bean from (Lion Coffee) did get a fresh batch of JBMC beans in last week, so I was able to compare both; and the Lion JBMC roasted whole bean wins hands down.<br />My recommendation is that if you are willing to spend $30-$50 a pound for JBMC beans, make sure it's direct from one of their certified distributors like Mavis Banks.

review/text: Quick Review:  Island Roasters 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee<br /><br />I recently received a pound of this coffee as a gift, and looked forward to getting to sample some 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  The short version:  AMAZING!!!  I actually had to wait a couple days after trying the first sample to write this review... I was too giddy after that first taste to write an objective review.  Yes, it's THAT good.<br /><br />So, here's the review after a couple days of drinking the stuff and having some time to reflect on the experience.<br /><br />Before diving into the description of the actual drink, I need to describe the experience of simply opening the vacuum bag and inspecting the contents.  Once the bag is opened, there is this magical release of coffee perfume that is simply divine.  The smell is not something that one can adequately describe... it truly needs to be experienced.<br /><br />The beans themselves were medium-dark brown, and glistening in a uniform sheen...all were roasted perfectly and uniformly.  I quickly got down to business... ground some of the beans and started the brewing process.  The beans were so fresh and so laden with volatile oils that the ground coffee bits adhered to each other... it looked like you could have easily molded the grounds into shapes with your hands! This was really fresh coffee.  Once again, after grinding, another burst of coffee perfume pervaded the kitchen, bathing the air with an amazing aroma.<br /><br />Now for the moment of truth...tasting the stuff straight up....was...just... WOW!  Lots of coffee perfume with an incredibly complex mix of floral notes.  Very well balanced... just an amazing array of flavors, beautifully arranged with hints of sweetness along with a lovely backbone of acidity to keep everything in check.  Absolutely no hint of bitterness.  In fact, this was the most smooth coffee I'd ever had.  Delicate, complex, some ephemeral fruit notes, balanced, and most of all, just smoooooooooth.<br /><br />If you are a coffee enthusiast, give this stuff a try.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I originally gave this product a bad review. The same day I received an email from Hawaii Roasters saying that they stand behind their products and would offer me a full refund if I am not satisfied.<br /><br />This got me to thinking that if they are that willing to stand behind their products then perhaps I made an incorrect assumption about the coffee.<br /><br />I compared this to another bean I purchased and my comparison was NOT apples to apples. The person at Hawaii Roasters was kind enough to point this out.<br /><br />Also, I discovered that I was making the coffee too strong. My regular roast requires me to grind more beans. Using the same amount of these beans is not necessary.<br /><br />So, first I want to commend Hawaii Roasters for their quick response and their willingness to stand behind what they sell.<br /><br />Second, I apologize for jumping the gun with my review.<br /><br />I will definitely do business with them again.

None of us have tried it because it is cost prohibitive.<br />The coffee received was stale and bitter. We were expecting to pay a premium for this coffee, however, we were not expecting the Sanka style flavor. Because we were not able to return of exchange this coffee, we were essentially ripped off. Enjoy the forty dollars Hawaii Roasters, it is the last you will receive from any of us.

review/text: I have been looking for Jamaican Blue mountain that is reasonable for a long time. I used to get it from a certain coffee house but the price was insane ($45/ half pound) so I tried others here on Amazon and various places. JBM is acknowledged as the best in the world and it is marvelous to taste. I ordered this with some trepidation as I have been disappointed before but i just opened/ground and tasted this and OMG this is superb. The price is steep (although not highway robbery as some others are) but worth  it as a treat. I have ordered Kona from Hawaii Coffee roasters and it is also excellent.Love this seller. Will be back (gotta wait for my tax refund to afford the JBM and KONA together). Enjoy folks it is something special.

The quality was there, and the taste was great, but beware these beans are quite acidic. They have a very sour after taste and after about a week of using it for espresso, I just couldn't continue using them.<br /><br />I know that JBM beans in general tend to be more acidic, and overall these are on par or better than many other JBM beans that I've had before, but just beware as a buyer that they are rather acidic.<br /><br />No complaints about the seller - the beans arrived fresh, fast and well roasted.

review/summary: Great choice
review/text: I have tried three pounds of JBM coffee beans this year from Hawaii Roasters and Wallenford. It has become my favorite when I have time to make a cup in the morning before I go to office. Starbucks house blend and Peet's coffee are daily served in work. I limit to one cup each day in the preference order of JBM, Peet's and Starbucks. I use a Keurig single cup brew machine at home and have also tried a dozen different other brands from different regions with varied darkness. The medium roast JBM coffee came out to be exactly the coffee that I like - smooth and pure. I cannot tell much difference between the beans roasted by Wallenford and Hawaii Roasters. Bean size, shape, aroma, and quality look similar. Only difference is that beans from Hawaii Roasters will split shells to my grinder cover when I grind them while there are almost none with Wallenford beans.

review/text: I bought these to see if Jamaica Blue Mountain lives up to it's reputation.  I'll admit I usually drink tea, and normally take my coffee with cream and sugar, so these beans may have subtle qualities that were wasted on me.  The consensus in my household was that while very good, these weren't noticibly better than many beans a fraction of the price.
