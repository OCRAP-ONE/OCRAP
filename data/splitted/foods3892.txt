review/text: I am an Indian guy and a big fan of MTR products. MTR products which I like include: Chaana Masala, Bhindi Masala and Rasam Rice. However, I was not pleased with the "Pau Bhaji"<br /><br />We opened this package last night for dinner and there was a pungent horrible smell from the packet. We had to throw it in the trash and make paav bhaaji from scratch.<br /><br />Also, the contents of the package did not look as depicted on the picture on the box.<br /><br />I am going to try Kitchens of India brands.

Starbucks now sells something called "Verona Dar," which has a decidedly different taste.<br /><br />Amazon did what it could to find that last bag of the genuine Verona coffee.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags. The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever. Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet. I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer. On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour. Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/text: i'll start of by saying that i LOVE the Golden (Vanilla) Oreos and the original Oreos.  so, i thought i would try these.  best of both worlds, right? WRONG.  first off, they are not double-stuffed.  it just looks like there's more icing than usual because they've made the cookies thinner.  secondly, the vanilla cookie part does not taste like the Golden Oreos.  it virtually has no flavor at all.  thirdly, the texture of the cookie is really weird.  it's very hard and crunchy and just plain gross.

review/text: I got this on a "back to school" sale on the cheap, and I must say it was pretty strange buying food by mail.  All the weirdness went away after unwrapping the transparent packaging over this 4-pack to get to the real deal.  Lasted me a month (I love cookies).  I don't suggest buying multiples because when these lose flavor over time they taste like bread. I didn't have enough money to buy a display of candy, but hey, next best thing.  Tastes like Oreos, what can I say?

We would have one at Thanksgiving and the other one at Christmas.  I remembered how wonderful it was and how I had looked forward to us getting our seasonal fruit cake.  I had tried to keep up this tradition for many years however A&P stores have disappeared in our area in the NC, VA & SC.  I haven't had a Jane Parker fruit cake until last year because of this.  I found one on Ebay and purchased it.  It was not very fresh but still the same it was tradition and it was wonderful to my taste buds again.  I am so glad I found this web site and can order my FRESH fruit cakes again.  We will have the traditional fruit cake this week at our Thanksgiving Table and again Christmas.  This to me is the best Fruit Cake in the world. Dr. W. Jim Whitehead, DD

I've been jonesing for this luscious cake ever since but have been unable to find it.  Until now.  Or so I thought.  I got all excited when I found these Jane Parker cakes online.  I was anticipating a nice, moistish, flavorful cake with APPLES embedded within.  Yes!  The original cake of which I dream had actual apples which made it moist and intensly yummy.  I don't even LIKE fruitcake, but this stuff sort of transcended mere fruitcake.  Alas, the loaf I recieved at a cost of 25 clams bears no resemblance to my jones'd-for cake of yore.  I have read reviews in which people rave and climax over these disappointing cakes.  I am depressed.

The licorice taste stands out more than the anise; which is quite the interesting feat.<br /><br />To wrap it up. It is not too sweet (a good thing), and the licorice stands out more than the anise (though candy is light flavored overall; good thing depending on preference).<br /><br />Try it out either way.

review/text: I bought this licorice under the impression that is was organic.  I'm really trying to stay away from commercial corn syrup, which is a terrible genetically modified (Monsanto created) product when not organic.  They do use organic wheat, sugar and molasses. but the other 7 ingredients are not!  Otherwise I do like the taste and texture, which is why I didn't give this product a lesser rating.  I would strongly urge this company to consider an organic corn syrup.  I don't think I'll buy this product again.

review/text: I love this stuff.  Yes, it will give your jaws a bit of a workout, hence the Jerky title, but it's not that tough.  The chewing will slow down your propensity to overconsume.  It is not a heavy flavor compared to Zagarese if you've ever had them. It would be hard to call them sweet.  If compared to a wine, I would call them dry.  If you were to eat them side by side with most other licorice, you would find the others overly sweet if you ate them after the Newman's.  My only complaint would be the quantity for the money, but it hasn't stopped me from buying them.  I've also have eaten the Strawberry Licorice and found them disappointing. If you wanted something sweeter, that would qualify.

If you're interested in organic licorice, they are other options for that as well.

review/summary: Good and useful, strange texture.
review/text: These candies are ok, not mazing...but very useful.<br /><br />Bought these because it says these are made with 30% fresh ginger and are supposed to be helpful.<br />The taste is ok, the candy is kind of like a taffy-but harder.<br />There is a lot of ginger taste as expcted.<br /><br />I find when my stomach turns,which os often these help a lot.<br />I have a hard time with ginger capsules as they allupset my stomach and giv hearburn.<br /><br />For getting rid of stomach issues,these work and quite well.<br />The original ginger chews are goodbut no ida howmuch ginger is in them.<br />They are also super sticky too.<br /><br />The price for these is kinda high as ginger people website sells a large 2lb bag for $10 and it is more than in these small boxes.<br /><br />But amazon has free US shipping,and no tax...so not sure what is better?<br /><br />Ginger people also has amazing candied ginger!<br />It is never hard or bitter and easy to eat (my house ate  5LB BAG in 5 weeks!)<br />Just bought some "natural candied ginger" from a website, brand "The best of all".<br />And actually spat out the piece I tried to eat.<br />Sure it was a bit cheaper,but it was bitter,fibery (in a bad way) andtoo hard to eat.<br />Normally I can eat most foods easily.<br /><br />I will be ordering these by the tuckload too :)

review/summary: Lifesaver!!
review/text: I got a tip from a friend about ginger helping with motion sickness and tummy troubles so one weekend at my in laws (father in law is the worst driver ever and I get sick to the point of almost vomitting every time I ride in a car with him) I grabbed a box of these at a health food store...they saved the day! I couldn't believe how within three minutes of popping one into my mouth I was feeling so much better. I get car sick so very easily so I bought a big supply and given a few boxes out to friends as well.<br /><br />Last month I went on a roller coaster (let me insert here that I do NOT do roller coasters bc of my extreme motion sickness issues). We got to go on Harry potter ride at universal for free through work so I had to get on as I was buckling in I popped a gin gin and wow did it work! It totally helped me survive the coaster!

review/summary: Surprisingly Chewy
review/text: I know the description of these ginger candies noted a caramel-like texture, but I did expect them to be a bit more firm -- something to suck on for a short while, like a ginger-spiked Worther's...  But these candies become chewy in your mouth, almost immediately.  The ginger flavor is slight, too, in spite of the "ultra strength" promise.  On the plus side, this candy may still prove effective at easing indigestion.

review/summary: SO HAPPY THEY MAKE THIS!!!!!!!
review/text: Everyone is CORRECT about the amount of starch rendered from the cooking/boiling process! :-(  I thought I had made a huge mistake ordering 6 boxes of this stuff but I quickly discovered otherwise. YES...you HAVE TO RINSE the pasta after boiling as if preparing "regular" wheat pasta because you will have the THICKEST,  most PROFUSE accumulation of starch around the noodles you have EVER SEEN after cooking! :-(  I was SHOCKED!!! However, I went ahead and rinsed as INSTRUCTED (I NEVER rinsed wheat pasta even when advised) and the pasta was returned to a "normal" single noodle state which we were VERY, VERY happy with---both TASTE & TEXTURE-wise. :-)<br /><br />It tastes WONDERFUL and has a GREAT mouthfeel. As I mentioned in a comment, I use this pasta in dishes that I WANT to thicken up directly boiling noodles in pot w/broth/stock. I made the most AMAZING Turkey Tetrazzini recipe that way. DELICIOUS!!!<br /><br />DON'T be thrown off by this particular phenomenon when cooking this pasta or you will cheat yourself out of a REALLY, REALLY good pasta!

review/summary: Convenient, but middle of the road
review/text: I had a chance to make Aunt J's Coffee Cake this afternoon. I have some note worthy thoughts i'd like to share. For one, it comes with a bag to mix the batter in, has a baking tray, AND the cinnamon topping is premixed ready to sprinkle. So I have to give them some high marks for thinking of this. I'm sure they are not the first to do it, but still they did a great job at it. The cake did not stick, i did not have to use oil. So it works.<br /><br />The coffee cake itself after baking comes out pale and fluffy (view my photos). I like a dense coffee cake, so that was a minus. The topping itself didn't really come out crunchy, which is a must for me (ie coffee cake from Boston Coffee Cake, Fantasicakes, or even Entenmann's). It was exactly like if you mixed oil, sugar, and cinnamon and placed it raw on the cake. Keep in mind, I do bake on the regular, have a thermometer in the oven, and use a timer.<br /><br />Will I buy this brand coffee cake again? If i was in a situation where i wanted to bake a coffee cake without a baking pan or bowl, sure. It's convenient that way. Is this a great coffee cake? I don't think so. It's just ok imo. What would I do different if i was forced to make it again? Maybe 1/2 the milk it called for, maybe add some melted butter to give it richness, maybe add some cinnamon or vanilla to the cake batter. But if I had to do all that, why am i buying a mix? On to the next coffee cake mix...

review/summary: False Advertising
review/text: I'm making strides at removing High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) from my diet by reading labels and bypassing the offenders while searching for juice from fruit grown in USA. Although this is from USA fruit, I knew cranberries ARE NOT grown in FLORIDA. I expected some of the description to be somewhat misleading when I made the purchase. This product IS NOT as advertised! HFCS is the second ingredient on the label behind WATER. There is only 10% cranberry juice :( Having called Amazon Customer Service, I did receive a refund.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT probably needs to be labelled "Cranberry DRINK". FYI: This product contains Citric acid and Ascorbic acid, CHEMICAL additive versions of Vitamin C. So if you were looking to get your Vitamin C just from the actual natural fruit juice this is not the product for that!<br /><br />I notice COCKTAIL is now added to the description. A famous brand has 15% juices in their "cocktail", and not necessarily ALL 15% being the cranberry or blueberry juice, YOU THINK the cocktail is. It usually is a combo of juices and they're listed on the label. So please read labels carefully.

And, just like fresh-squeezed juice, there's no water, sugar, or preservatives added, only 100 percent pure premium pasteurized juice"<br />In reality the plastic bottles (not cans like the ad says) say 10% juice from concentrate. The first ingredient is water. Second is high fructose corn syrup. Third ingredient is cranberry juice concentrate.

I don't usually comment on the bag, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />As for the candy, these ARE the sour cherry cola bottle gummies you are looking for! They're my boyfriend's favorite candies and I've been having a lot of trouble finding them in local stores, so I finally ordered this on amazon. The gummies are chewy and soft, and not hard/stale at all (sometimes you get those in local candy shops if they haven't restocked carefully enough!).<br /><br />I only wish I could use Amazon Prime on this product, or that shipping cost less than the price of the candy itself. Unfortunately, since I can't even obtain the product elsewhere, this will have to do for now, so I'm not complaining!

review/text: This item was a bit of a disappointment. I expected better flavor. It has a sour start but that is it. The cherry and soda flavor is very faint and difficult to taste. The texture is what you would expect from a quality gummy, soft and slightly firm but chewy. The sour is spot on, it will make you pucker. e.frutti normally has wonderful products with abundant flavor, sadly this product was not one of them. I ordered 4 bags (8.8 pounds), opened one and ate a few and gave the three remaining bags away to less discriminate gummy consumers. I rated this product low because I expected better flavor and not just sour gummy. If you enjoy sour and are less concerned with flavor, this product may be right for you.

review/summary: The Best in Store-Bought Taffy
review/text: I love taffy; it's my favorite candy. Next to homemade taffy, Wonka has the best. There's a bit of a history lesson about this kind of taffy, though. It was originally known as Tangy Taffy, and I assume that Wonka bought it it out. Because of this, there are now two separate kinds, but they both go by the exact same name. The major difference between this brand and the more common version is that this brand of taffy is in a thin bar shape form; it's about the length of candy bar, and about double or triple the thickness of an Airhead. The other more common version is usually in small, bite-sized, individually sealed packages. Originally, this brand, also formerly known as Tangy Taffy, came in three flavors including: Grape, Cherry (with candy sprinkles), and watermelon (with edible candy seeds). I believe the Tangy Taffy version has expanded to include a few more flavors, but I couldn't tell you what they are. The more common version comes in many flavors such as but not limited to: banana, strawberry, raspberry, sour apple, and grape. Personally, I prefer the Tangy Taffy version because the taste is vastly superior, but that isn't to say the more common version isn't good. In conclusion, it's great taffy, and unless you go to a specialty candy shop where the taffy is made fresh daily, you really can't beat it.

review/summary: Great cherry, Ok grape, Meh watermelon
review/text: I freakin loved these candy bars as a kid, most especially the cherry that has the sparkles on it.  The sparkles really add to the texture and flavor and make it stand-out from similar products.  I hadn't realized that I hadn't seen these around, but after stumbling upon them on amazon realized this.  I had very high hopes for the watermelon flavor as I love watermelon candy, but it's very underwhelming.  It doesn't even taste much like watermelon, and falls more toward the "faker" tasting of flavors.  Does not have "seeds" on the bar as is advertised on this products description and picture.  The box graphics are different than the one pictured, and so i'm thinking this watermelon is a different flavor that was improvised.  This is a 24-pack, and so there are 8 of each flavor; 8 watermelon's I don't much like is sort of a disappointment.  The grape is better, worth eating but too tangy in my opinion for a grape flavor.  Grape should be satisfying and sweet, not wince-inducing.  The Sparkle-Cherry flavor is far-and-away the best of the bunch, and has its tang factor present but at a slightly more reasonable level.  The taste is nice and isn't massively fake tasting, and the sparkles as I mentioned earlier add a great element to the consistency.  Overall I'm happy to have these nostalgic cherry taffy bars that I haven't seen for years, but for $20 it's a steep investment for a bunch of extra taffy that doesn't do much for me.  Oh well.

review/summary: Tangy Taffy Disguised!
review/text: I used to be able to find Tangy Taffy just about anywhere candy bars are sold.  It slowly disappeared, and all I could find was the Laffy Taffy in the little individual chews.  They are "ok" but nothing close to the "tangyness" of Tangy Taffy.  One day I decided to look for it on the internet and Wha La, based on the reviews, I was able to determine this is Tangy Taffy packaged as Laffy Taffy.  I have even found it now occasionally in a few stores, but a box like this is the way to go.  I felt ridiculous ordering it, but it sure hits the spot when you want something tangy and chewy for a treat. These are big bars, nearly a $1 in the store for one.  I recommend eating half at a time to satisfy one's craving due to the fact they are full of useless calories! One taffy that is kind of similar, that I have only found in assortment bags with other SweetTarts (sp?) is the SweetTart taffy.  It is delicious but unavailable most of the time, and always in a mixed bag.  They are in bar shape too but much smaller.  Enjoy this product in moderation!

review/summary: Not quite as described.
review/text: First, as others have noted, the picture doesn't quite match the product.  As of 10/24/12, what you will get is a mix of cherry, watermelon, and grape taffy.  They also do not have those disgusting watermelon seeds or sugar crystals (EDIT: Apparently I hadn't eaten a cherry one yet, they DO have the sugar crystals, in my book that's one star off) that some of the Laffy Taffy has.  For some this is a disappointment, but for me, it's exactly what I wanted.  My only complaint with the product is again, as others have mentioned, this Laffy Taffy has been in a hot environment and melted into irregular shapes, not the nice flat "bars" that they normally are.  What this means is that little drops of the melted taffy have made it into the corners of the packaging, then when they cool down, they turn into crumbs that make a mess when you open it.

review/text: This package that is sold on amazon for $20 is $5 less in the big box stores if yours have one. Another thing to think about is taffy get very soft with heat and these things are transported in a non-airconditioned UPS truck. Mine were all smushed and melted into different shapes and no longer resembled the starting product. Still tasted fine just hard to open the package.

review/text: Listen to me!  I've got nothing to gain by writing this, but I need to tell you to give this chocolate milk powder a try.  I lived in Spain for a year and had been craving this for 5 years until I stumbled upon it here at Amazon.  This stuff is amazing.  It's very rich and real cocoa.  Almost tastes like you melted a chocolate bar in hot milk.  Great cold, but hot is where it really shines.  Give it a try, you won't regret it. Just think how cool you'll sound when you have friends over who try it and say, "Man, what kind of hot chocolate is that?  Where'd you get it?"<br /><br />That's when you look them straight in the face and say, "oh, that stuff, just a little something I picked up in Madrid last week."<br /><br />You 1, Friends 0

review/text: Jones is known for it's quirkly flavors. So it's a little surprising to see them come up with cream soda, which is a pretty regular flavor. It's not bad, the only thing is that Jones comes up with their own take of cream soda. To me it tasted a little metallic, certainly it's not your regular cream soda taste. So if it's your run of the mill cream soda flavor you're after, this isn't it. If you're a fan of Jones and want their take on their cream soda flavor, then it's definitely for you.

review/summary: Who knew ChickPz would make for a healthy and tast snack?  They are great!!!
review/text: I was sent the follow ChickPz flavors to samples:  Chai Vanilla, Honey Roasted, Dark Chocolate and Pepper and Spice. Out of the 4 flavors, I have to say my favorite was the Dark Chocolate.  Again, I am a sucker for chocolate, so usually lean towards products with chocolate as favorites.  A close second was the Chai Vanilla.  At first I was hesitant on eating these "healthy" snacks, as I had never thought of ChickPz as a snack.  And, throwing flavored ChickPz into the mix only made me question sampling them even more.  But, needing to provide my readers will an honest review, I tried each and every flavor.  After the first bite, I couldn't believe how tasty these ChickPz snacks were.  Like the company website says, you can't just eat one.  I ended up finishing off 2 sample packs in one sitting, and then that night ate the two other bags with my husband.  He, too, thought they wer addicting, and get reaching into the bag to get more.  His favorite was the Pepper and Spice, as it had a little kick to it, with Chai Vanilla being his 2nd favorite.<br />My favorite part of this snack was the crunch factor. As for the flavor profile, you could really taste each flavor.  These two combined made for great snacking.  And, because they tasted so good, you wouldn't have thought that they were actually good for you.<br />I have since ordered more of these snacks from Amazon.com, as my husband loves grabbing a bag or two to snack on at work and during his commutes.  And, if we are heading out for a weekend drive, we will throw a few bags in the diaper bag in case we get hungry on the road.  This prevents us from stopping at a convenience store to pick up unhealthy snacks just to feed our hunger pains.<br />With the holidays around the corner, why not pick up a few bags to serve as appetizers/snacks at your planned holiday parties, or to have on hand for those unexpected guests.  They also make for great stocking stuffer gifts!

review/text: My husband always said that the two greatest inventions were duct tape, and WD-40, and many people share this view. Now add to this gg crispbread!!! Some people say they make great sandwiches with peanut butter, tuna salad, or cheese, I even heard they make good pizzas, so I tried these. I didn't like any of them, but not wanting to waste my money, I decided to try some other ways of enjoying these. They really are wonderful after all!!! Throw them on the pond and they make wonderful little rafts for the frogs to sunbathe on, even baby turtles will enjoy a nice sun bath on them!  Why not use them to repair holes in the barn where the grand children decided to try out the old brace and bit and drilled holes? I know mice chew through wood, but believe me it is going to take them awhile to chew through these! Cigarette burn on your coffee table? Just sand it down with with these rough little squares, {Just finish with a fine sandpaper to smooth out the roughness) and re-stain. Glue a few packs of these together and you have a great bulletin board, and if you don't have enough muscle to push the pins into it, just lay it outside the front door to scrape mud off your boots. I like to keep a stack of these on my night stand in case a burglar breaks in. Fling a few of these at him and if they don't do serious injury, they will at the least hurt enough to send them flying for safety. I am thinking of putting in a new patio, mm, I wonder!!!

review/text: I use these for several reasons.  They are great if your 'throughput' is a little sluggish, they will help you up your water intake (because they are VERY dry), and they stop carb cravings because they fill your stomach.  I spread a little sugar free jelly or Walden Farms sugar free chocolate sauce on them to help ease the dryness.  Don't get me wrong, you need to like the taste of bran.  They are sort of like all-bran got stomped by an elephant and made into a wafer.  I eat them to stop my pacing the kitchen late at night or to cure the same thing around 3:30 in the afternoon, which allows me to stay on my eating program.

review/summary: Dry, but Surprisingly Palatable
review/text: I have been a fan of GG Scandinavian Bran Crispbread for years.  Most people get too little fiber.  Fiber is essential for flushing toxins and other junk out of your system.  Fiber helps lower cholesterol and reduces the impact of high glycemic index foods.  While some people choose to take supplements like psyllium, I prefer actually eating food...or the next closest thing.<br /><br />The crispbreads have a somewhat cardboard taste, but mainly tasted like toasted grains, with maybe a hint of cinnamon (but i'm probably imaginging that).  They are not sweet or salty or anything else appetizing.  However, they work great as a vehicle for just about anything. My wife and I enjoy making little peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with them for a filling snack.  If I just want to get some extra fiber, I'll eat a crisp or two with some cheese or honey.  So the flavor is not an issue at all if you put something yummy on top.  What is an issue is how incredibly dry these things are.  make sure you have something to drink with these; that should go withotu saying though, when you are eating something that's mostly fiber.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend these to anyone looking to get a little more fiber, which should include a ton of people.  I got into them because I was drinking protein shakes after working out and thought i should increase my fiber on balance.  Fiber really does have a noticeable benefit to your health and well-being, so definitely give these a try!

review/summary: AMAZING APPETITE CONTROL
review/text: This cracker curbs appetite like no other. I have it in the morning with some low fat cheese on it, in the afternoon with some peanut butter and jelly on it and then in the evening with some cream cheese and salmon on it. I make sure to drink plenty of water too as it expands in your stomach and gives you the full feeling. It truly is a great product and it's quite a deal being sold on Amazon - especially with the free shipping! I'm looking forward to their new product which they are going to release soon called Sprinkles. It's the crushed up version which you can have on salads, yogurts, and ice cream. It's much better than granola, especially if you are trying to lose weight.

review/summary: Ok but SUPER DRY
review/text: I got these to supplement my daily fiber as my favorite powder drink mix seems to be discontinued. they are recommended by Dr. OZ so I bought these. You get a good amount in each package. The serving is 2 crackers a day so they'll last a few days. You MUST put something on it like jelly or butter or something cause if you eat them plain you'll choke! They are incredibly dry (probably cause they are mostly fiber). They don't have much of a taste, kinda like a cross between melba toast and a triscuit. Not bad for what they are, but for me its all about the fiber...lol

review/summary: Okay - they're awful....but they serve a purpose
review/text: Do they taste and feel like you're eating a piece of MDF?  Yes.  I admit it, they taste awful and have a horrible texture.  That aside, I like them.  It's not about enjoying the crispbread, it's about using it as a vehicle to deliver something I DO enjoy for very few calories, and that fills me up.  To me, they're too dry to eat with peanut butter, as some suggest...I feel like I'm going to choke and can't swallow.  But I like to put tuna (mixed with light mayo and mustard) on them instead of bread. I had been eating my tuna sandwiches on thin buns - which are 100 calories per bun.  By substituting 2 of these, and having my "sandwich" open faced, I save 76 calories, and am left much fuller.  Same goes for breakfast...instead of a piece of toast (100 or so calories) with jam, 2 of these with jam saves another 76 or so calories.  They fill you up and save you some calories, but do NOT try to eat them on their own - you'll wonder how anyone can say they "like" them.  Add a topping that you like...tuna, jam, Laughing Cow light cheese wedges (the French Onion is great), etc.  You'll take in fewer calories than you would with bread or crackers, and feel fuller afterwards - meaning you'll probably reach for even fewer calories elsewhere.  I've even dunked them in salsa when I was craving chips and salsa, and it satisfied the craving.  Just think of them as a vehicle for eating something you DO like, and don't judge them on their own.  I will continue to purchase these and substitute them for bread, crackers, chips, etc. whenever I can.

review/summary: Great Fiber source!
review/text: This is definitely a health-nut's choice for getting in extra fiber. As a stand alone snack, they are okay. Add a thin layer of natural peanut butter with dried blueberries ... yum!  Be sure to drink plenty of water as adding in fiber to your diet requires this :)

review/summary: How to improve flavor 100%
review/text: I have found if you smear your crispbread with a little spicy mustard, or flavored mayo, salsa - or any favorite spread - even a thick low carb salad dressing - and let them sit for about 5 min before you prepare your sandwich with meat or cheese or tuna salad, etc - the dryness is reduced by about 75% - and the cracker itself takes on the flavor of the spread you used, as well as picking up a lot of moisture. Doing this makes these crispbreads really edible and on par with regular moist crackers.  Until I started doing this pre-spread thing, I thought I would never be able to eat these on a regular basis, and now I actually look forward to eating them and keeping my carbs low.  try it!!

review/summary: Great weight loss cracker!
review/text: I have been eating these crackers in place of chips for the past 8 months or so.  They taste pretty dry by themselves, but I usually eat them with a wedge of Laughing Cow lite cheese - 2 of these crackers with one wedge of cheese is a very filling snack for only 50 calories.  I have also had them with hummus, a slice of light swiss cheese or piled my eggs on them in place of toast.<br /><br />The best part about these crackers is that they are filling.  I am trying to lose weight and constantly fight hunger - these are excellent healthy snack that keeps you filled up for quite a while.<br /><br />A great snack if you're trying to lose weight.
