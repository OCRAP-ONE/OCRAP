review/summary: Better than Hickory Farms
review/text: I ordered my Beef Summer Sausage from Old Wisconsin because my previously favorite Hickory Farms website only sold their stuff in packages and charged $9.99 for shipping making my order of two small sausages come to $30!  I had previously ordered the pickled eggs from Old Wisconsin and I knew their products were of the highest quality; so I tried their sausage and now I like it even better than Hickory Farms version.  The most important thing to note was that it has the same flavor and taste as what I was used to at Hickory Farms but it tasted fresher and better.  I'm not into new flavors and changing the basics of this sausage and I was actually surprised that I liked it better. I've tried many other brands and just threw them away after the first bite.  To top is off, they sent me three 1 lb packages for $20 and on Amazon the shipping was free.  So I ended up with one extra beef sausage for $10 less and it tastes even better (although the same in many ways).

review/summary: Get the non-plastic wrap version if possible - dries nice & hard like German salami
review/text: Delicious salami/summer sausage, BUT this packaging version requires refrigeration after exposing to air/opening. They sell same sausage in delicatessens, giftshops and probably direct, with a NON-plastic wrap and STRING so you can HANG it and let it HARDEN as long as you like. I let it get very hard and crunchy, like the great sausages I buy when in Germany. Great price here as 3-pack though.

review/summary: Very Fatty With Bone Chips
review/text: The flavoring in this was just not very good but tolerable. I ordered the 3 pack from Amazon so we had three to get through. We were really put off that it seemed like each slice we had was half fat. We ended up cooking it off before we ate it. There just is no excuse for it to be so full of grease. Also we were very turned off in the fact that we would occasionally hit a bone chip and one got stuck between two of my teeth and I thought there was a dental trip in my future but I was able to work it out.<br />We gave up on it and I would say they are careless in what they grind in the sausage. I really wanted to like this sausage but just couldn't get around all the issues with it. We will be going back to our old brand which is a little more expensive but I guess with sausage you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Perfect for the evening...
review/text: Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams.<br /><br />This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I was really not prepared for the difference between this potato chip and the regular ones I've always bought.  They are very flavorful and don't taste salty or greasy like regular chips do but they are very THICK and slightly hard.  I am still trying to get use to and accept this variety as A potato chip.  I am not sure if I really like them or just love their wonderful flavorings.  I'll have to do a follow up review after I've tried them a few more times.  They are different.......that's for sure!

review/text: Update August 2012:  I changed my mind about never ordering again and signed up for regular auto shipments.  They must have paid attention to the post because the boxes are now sealed much better.<br /><br />*******************<br /><br />Original review:  I love this product in the large bags so I ordered the small bags for portion control.  Product is great but was shipped by the manufacturer whose shipping department wasn't careful enough with the sealing tape.  The box arrived totally open with the bags showing.  None were missing; the chips in the one bag that I've eaten weren't even crushed.  But I'm not taking a chance again on such poor shipping practices.

review/text: I don't know why these reviews seem to cover more then just one type of TERRA potato chips, I think amazon should have seperate reviews but this review is in regards to "Terra Yukon Gold Potato Chips" I think these chips are really good, I like them a lot. If I eat them for too many days tho I think it gives me the baked chips sensation/taste and I am not into that. I have not eaten them long enough but they are very good. You  might be able to get these cheaper in store then amazon.

review/summary: Wasn't what it was supposed to be...
review/text: I have bought these particular chips at Whole Foods. Although I haven't seen them in the store for awhile, I jumped at the chance to purchase them while browsing Amazon.com grocery section. When I received the Terra Golds Onion & Garlic Potato Chips and opened a bag, I was truly disappointed! Although the bags were labled Onion & Garlic, the contents were just plain potato chips with no hint of garlic or onion flavor. I was really anticipating the garlicky and oniony taste of the of the yukon gold chips. I was looking closely at the packaging and noticed that the plain chips were pictured. I remembered from the picture on Amazon.com & from past purchases that the chips had a speckled look to them. I had other people try various bags in the shipment and all were plain chips. I don't know if I would ever purchase these chips online again.

This is the second time I have ordered the Terra Gold Onion & Garlic (12 bags at $30). The first time they were great, exactly what I have tasted when buying single bags from the grocery.  This time they have virtually NO TASTE, they are small, broken chips and I am completely dissatisfied.  I called Terra Chips with no result, they said to contact Amazon.  I looked all over your web site to try to locate a place but couldn't find one. There was NO Sales Slip in the box. I really feel a refund is in order.

review/summary: Firm, tart and briny, bolsters the great Yukon Gold to new level
review/text: The Yukon Gold is one fine spud, and these fairly thick-cut chips manage to negotiate a fairly bold but natural-tasting dose of seasoning without losing the authenticity of the premium potato taste. Maybe it's a rather silly reason and often I am quite beyond the temptations of alluring packaging, but for some reason the shiny mostly black bags of Terra products make me feel like I'm noshing on something other than, uh, packaged and processed convenience snack food, to put a fairly fine spin phrasing on it. Will buy again. Would serve to snoots.

review/summary: Good ham, but not exceptional
review/text: I had always heard of Smithfield hams, and so when I saw that amazon.com had them listed, I wanted to try one.  I ordered the smallest one I could find on their site.  Shipping was fast and the ham very well packaged for what that's worth.  (I know this is the product review page, but I did want to mention that here as well).  The ham, well the glaze was nice, sure.  Bit of a cinnamon flavor in it, along with honey if I had to guess.  The ham itself, tasty..but I can get just as nice locally from let's say CostCo or Honeybaked Hams.  Three stars seems low, but four doesn't quite seem right either given it's not exceptional.  Maybe I was just expecting too much and maybe based on that it should be a four or five star product, it very much is tasty.  But I just feel like I got an above average product that can be had locally from another retailler or reseller.  Would I order again?  Basically if ordering online ended up as cheap or cheaper then local purchase, then sure.  Otherwise maybe not.

review/summary: Great sweet paprika!
review/text: I was really happy to see this organic paprika offered as an option in Amazon's Add-on program.  I use paprika in many ways: spice rubs, stew and goulash, sloppy joe mix, sauces, or any dish that needs a boost.  For example, it's great to sprinkle on french fries (after frying, as paprika can burn, or before I've baked them), along with salt and black pepper.<br /><br />This particular product is a "sweet" (not spicy or smoked) paprika, so keep that in mind when reading or creating a new recipe.  Also, since it comes in a glass bottle, I recommend keeping it in either a pantry or, as my grandmother advised, the refrigerator; sometimes light can affect the flavor of spices.<br /><br />Recommended!

It's perfect for cakes, brownies, biscuits, quick breads and muffins.<br /><br />Here's a tip for any White Lily lover who can't find it in their local stores:  DON'T buy it from Amazon.  This is way too expensive.  You can go to Smuckers online store (they bought out White Lily) and order a 2-pack of these 5# bags for $16.95, including shipping.  Yes, that's a lot.  But at least you get twice as much as Amazon's offering here, for less money.

You can order up to 4 5 lb bags of whatever flours you choose for $16.95.  Shipping is still free.  Therefore, if you want 2 bags of self-rising, 1 bag of regular and 1 bag of buttermilk cornmeal flour, or get all four self-rising if you want - you can mix and match.  Great hint!

BUT........like the other reviewer, this product arrived damaged...one of the three bottles was shattered and the product was in the bottom of the box all mixed together with the shards of glass...nice.  I give the product 5 stars and the package protection 1 star..that averages to 3 stars, but since it ticks me off that I can't return it...I give it 2 stars. I feel better now.

review/text: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Much to my surprise i received only one bone. the item weight is 36.2lbs and the original pricing is $103.2. when i called the company the gave me the run around for 3 days before i threatened to file a claim. within 5 min a manager called me back and said it was falsely marked and she would refund my money. when i told her i do not want my money back i want the correct items i had ordered. she said she was not willing to take the loss. This company does NOT hold to its word or advertising.... they tried about 10 different excuses to appease me. i will be reporting them to the BBB.

review/text: Love these cookies.<br />Having been stuck in an elimination diet sadness for the past few months with our food-sensitive 1 year old, was thrilled to find these yummy cookies. They are reasonably good for you (as far as cookies go). Only problem is keeping my husband and I from eating them all before the baby gets many.<br />Nice to have such a delicious alternative, even when avoiding common allergens.<br />Oh yeah - and our 1 year old likes them too - easy to hold and nibble.

review/text: The cookies were fresh and packaging was fine, but the cookies were a little over done (darker than usual).  They tasted okay.  I used to buy them at a store in my area until they stopped carrying them.  They were 1st quality there, never overdone or dark.  That's how I was able to see the difference.  Don't know whether my shippment was the only one like that.  It may have just been that batch for that day or week?

review/summary: A staple for my 2 year old since he was crawling.
review/text: My 2yo son is extremely picky, but the will always eat these.  The rest of the family loves them too.  They are whole grain and not too sugary, really not any more of a "treat" than most cereals or flavored oatmeal we eat for breakfast.  You feel like you've eaten food, not junk, after snacking on them.  So, if the toddler is having one of those days and will only eat these and milk and some fruit for dinner, I feel ok about it.  I figure we have enough to argue about right now!  Even my 12yo son enjoys them, though won't, of course, eat them in public :)

review/summary: BEWARE-- this is NOT Gluten Free
review/text: If you have a Celiac Child or must be gluten-free, BEWARE.  I was taken in by the fantastic packaging, which mentioned wheat free/dairy free/ soy free. I stupidly thought this meant it was gluten free, and it is NOT!  It is full of oat and barley flour, which are not ok for Celiacs.  I wish this product would mention that it does contain gluten, or that they would make it with gluten-free oat flour, which is available (but this is not that). Dear Healthy Time: Either label this properly, or change to gluten free flours. You are misleading customers, and it has potential to hurt kids.

review/summary: This Tea is Awesome!!!
review/text: I love tea, and lemon is one of my favorite flavors, so putting the two together makes a very good product!<br /><br />This tea has such a good flavor, I would highly recommend it to any tea and lemon lover.  There is no caffeine in this herbal tea.<br /><br />Even though I normally drink my tea cold, I am currently drinking it hot due to a sore throat and slight cold.  I don't take medicine unless I have to; I try natural soothing and healing agents first.<br /><br />But as soon as the sore throat is over, I will go back to drinking this lemon tea the way I really prefer it - really cold with ice shards!  I do not put sugar in any of my teas or coffees - that's just my personal preference.  I know true Southerners are supposed to drink their iced tea with heavy sugar - but that's one thing I don't do.  I prefer unsweetened tea and coffee.<br /><br />I think lemon tea is really awesome.  But I am a lemon lover.

review/summary: My favorite lemon flavored tea
review/text: As the "zinger" label indicates, this is not your standard lemon flavored tea. It has a bold taste that will "zing" you with lemon and other herbal ingredients that produce a strong and aromatic tea.<br /><br />This tea is great on a cold winter day, and works well with honey to sooth a sore throat or a mild cough.<br /><br />Although there is no string attached to the tea bags, that does not matter to me because I like my tea very strong and usually leave the tea bag in the cup the entire time that I am drinking the tea. However, it is not difficult to fish it out with a spoon if you don't want to leave it in your cup.<br /><br />If you enjoy herbal teas and like a nice lemon flavor that is modified with other ingredients, you will love this tea.<br /><br />I buy this in my local supermarket for about the same price as on Amazon, so I don't need to buy six boxes at a time.

Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable.  Zinger really is a great description of the product.  It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match.  It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas.

review/summary: Lemony and decaffeinated!
review/text: This tea smells like lemon sours! What a great fragrance. This auburn shaded brew tastes lemony with a slight hint of lemon peel bitterness. I imagine it would taste good with some sweetener. Pretty good but not my favorite.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to ourselves." Montaigne.

An emulsifier for a cup of herbal tea?  Why?<br />The taste isn't as lemony and clean tasting as before, slight difference, yet noticeable, I checked the back of the box to see why.<br />The change went in effect a few years ago as the old stock was replenished. The original formula was better.<br /><br />Also, is the soy GMO or GE free?

review/text: This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great lemon taste to it that is not overpowering and if you let it steep about three minutes you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains the natural ingredients of dried whole lemons with hibiscus, rosehips, and lemon grass. There are no artificial ingredients! The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want simply by using a spoon to get them out. I also recommend using to spoon to stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also gluten free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want gluten in our diets. It is decaffeinated, too, which is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a lemon flavor to your tea, this is highly recommended! Enjoy!  SMILES

review/summary: Almost could be called oil with sardines
review/text: The can itself is steel making it harder to open; careful when you  hit the end because it snaps and sprays oil. There are typically two sardines per can and plenty of oil. These are lightly packed which is why they are priced lower. They are a nice firm fish with scales.  I'd keep buying them until the Matiz and Belas return.

review/summary: Good sardines for the money
review/text: These are not your $2+ per can sardines. Nonetheless, they are pretty good. Tasty and firm (not mushy like some other sardines). I drain the oil and eat them right out of the can with a slice of whole grain bread. These sardines are on the larger size (not smaller like more expensive types of canned sardines) and with skin. So while these would probably not be considered gourmet sardines, for a buck per can I think they are a very good buy.

review/summary: Got Scales
review/text: These are basically 2 large sardines in each can. I was turned off by the scales. Never seen scales before with sardines but the scales are very pronounced with the pack I received, about quarter of an inch in diameter.  I ended up giving away 10 cans to the food bin and slowly eating the rest.  Wonder if scales are edible as these seem like they might be but still getting reflexive reaction to being grossed out by the sight of them.  When I gently wipe/scrape the scales off, sometimes the skin just comes off easily with it.  Otherwise meaty part and bones are fine.

review/text: These are pretty tasty, if you like the taste of Merlot that is. I feared that the taste would be over powering, but to my surprise it was subtle flavor that that was just right. Now I don't think you would want to eat them all the time but for special occasions with friends it's great, and it also makes for a nice conversation snack.

review/summary: Gluten Free
review/text: I've tried every gluten free pasta, and this one is by far the best! It also tastes good.  Even my husband loves it, and he eats gluten.  Most gluten free pasta gets very hard when refrigerated, even with a sauce.  Not this one though.  We now eat all of it, even on left over nights, and I don't have to throw it out like I used to.  I always used to throw out so much pasta.  I would recommend this to anyone, and they won't be sorry. It's so good, that it's worth paying the shipping.

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/summary: like stale popcorn
review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

review/text: Although labeled "Black Bean Chips," unlike the (now unavailable) Trader Joe's version these are CORN chips with some black bean thrown in.  That's misleading.  They should be labeled Corn & Black Bean chips.  They don't taste bad, as far as chips go.  But they are definitely nowhere near as good as the old Trader Joe's variety.

review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.
