review/summary: The foundation of a good hot breakfast cereal is Wheatena
review/text: As a child growing up in Philadelphia, PA, I always looked forward to breakfast, because I knew that mom was in the kitchen cooking Wheatena.  There were only three cereals that I grew up with, ate all the time, and never strayed away from during my childhood.  They were Kellogs Corn Flakes, Quaker Oats, and Wheatena, with Wheatena being my favorite.<br /><br />I was able to capture a very important part of my childhood when I rediscovered Wheatena.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for carrying my cereal.  You don't know how much I missed it!

When it became unavailable in stores, we were glad to find it online.  I like the free shiping offer, have found the service straight foward and fast. We plan to continue ordering from Amazon so as to enjoy this nutritious and tasty product.

review/summary: A Different Hot Cereal
review/text: My first impression of Wheatena was that it tasted like coffee grounds. But then I realized that if they were more filling I would in fact enjoy eating coffee grounds. Wheatena is clearly an acquired taste. Furthermore, the claims of this product being healthy are somewhat neutralized by California's claims that roasted grains cause cancer. Wheatena is a nice change from oatmeal, but it is not as wonderful as the reviews of Wheatena devotees would have you believe.

review/summary: Moist, plump, exquisite
review/text: I spotted this exquisite treat at a local gourmet food store and had to give them a try. Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique. And now I can't find them locally anymore, so glad to see them here.<br /><br />St. Dalfour raisins and cranberries are completely different from those which are packed dry. These are moist! And tender and truly delightful. The ingredients listed on the label are: "raisins, cranberries and 'a touch of sugar.'" No preservatives (other than the sugar, of course).<br /><br />These raisins and cranberries are vacuum packed in glass jars and remain moist and plump. I don't know how St. Dalfour achieves this, but the resulting product is simply delectable.<br /><br />A tasty treat right off the jar, but even better in desserts (ricotta torte, clafouti, bread pudding).<br /><br />Made in France.

review/summary: Best Cuppa English Tea (In My Book)
review/text: First off, I'll let it be known that I'm English. That means I have spent my lifetime drinking lots and lots of tea, which I think is compulsory when you're English. I've had many different types of tea (mostly tea from England such as PG Tips and Typhoo) and when I finally stumbled upon Yorkshire Tea on a trip back home about 6 years ago I've been hooked. This is by far my favorite tea and I drink 3-5 cups of it a day.<br /><br />Although many reviews say a bag is meant for a pot of tea that is not truly the case. A bag is meant for a single cup of tea. Now, some people may prefer a weaker cup of tea, like my mum who will use a bag twice since she prefers a weaker cup, but one bag is really meant for one cup. Alas, to each his own. I personally like a very strong cup of tea so I use one bag per cup and I allow it to steep for a minimum of four minutes. Then I use a bit of half and half (whole milk at the minimum) and a half teaspoon of sugar. Wallah, the perfect cup.<br /><br />As for price, well, Amazon cannot be beat! I have searched high and low for this tea and have not once been able to find it for less than what Amazon sells it for in the States.<br /><br />Grab a cup and enjoy this very fine tea. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Yorkshire Tea, the best secret in tea
review/text: I discovered this great tea in Harrowgate, England. It is smooth, not bitter, and is great hot or cold. The bags are for a pot of tea, not a cup. I can find the tea in a local specialty tea store but pay three times as much for it. Amazon got it to me within 3 days, making it comparable in price to other teas, but so much better. There "gold" tea has also won multiple awards. Give it a try.

review/summary: The BEST Tea
review/text: I've always had to acknowledge that I can drink bad coffee but I can't drink bad tea. That means, when I go to a restaurant, I always order coffee as I can live with it if it's not great. I can't do that with tea so I only drink tea at home.<br /><br />The blend of teas that Taylors have put together for this bagged tea is phenomenal. Nothing comes close in my opinion and I drink about 5 cups of THIS tea a day. I've given up trying other blends as I'm invariably left disappointed and always end coming back to the original "Yorkshire Tea".<br /><br />For years I've asked my parents who still live in England (actually in Harrogate since they retired) to ship me boxes of this tea regularly as it wasn't available over here in the US (unless you wanted to pay a fortune for it). Now Amazon has made it easy for me to get the ONLY tea I enjoy drinking and at a price comparable with the junk you'll find at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Buy this tea, you won't be disappointed. Don't get the Gold blend thinking you're getting something special. It's an entirely different blend and not as good as it tastes very bitter in my opinion.<br /><br />To enjoy to the fullest, drink with milk and sugar. Oh, and buy a tea pot as the bags make up two cups.

I'm a coffee drinker normally, but when I am not in the mood for coffee, this wonderful tea gets me through the day. I prefer the Red to the Gold, personally - it seems a bit stronger. Like the other reviewers, this is the only tea I drink now - I used to have a cabinet full of various English Breakfast Teas, Irish Breakfast Teas, various brands - now there's more room, because this one beats them all. Once you've had Yorkshire, you can't go back!

review/text: I sample many teas when I can, but always return to a dependable cup of Yorkshire. It's smooth, not acidic when steeped properly (please don't squeeze the bag, friends and neighbours) and tolerates much cream when making a strong cup.  It will yield a rich, dark golden colour when displayed in a clear glass.  A very flavourful black tea blend, and never tire of the taste. Also seems forgiving if you steep too long. The teabags, which I estimate are approximately 3 grams, are larger than the tiny American variety, and without the staple and string, so you are getting a genuine British cuppa. Blended and Packed in the UK.

review/summary: Quality English Tea
review/text: After drinking Tayors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea on a trip to the UK, I was hooked. For those of us who are true tea conneseiurs,American brands don't cut it. I discovered that it was next to impossible to purchase this tea where I live. On subsequent trips to the UK,I would purchase several boxes of Yorkshire and transfer it to zip storage bags for easier conveyance. I did locate it in a small tea shop a few miles away but at a considerable cost. I had tried to purchase it online but the price was about the same. I, recently, decided to go to Amazon and there it was. I was ecstatic. I purchased 12 boxes and am enjoying my genuine English tea while watching the snow fall. For those who have never had a real cup of tea, I encourage you to try Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire.

review/text: I LOVE this tea....  furthermore the company that produces it is a wonderful group of people that give back to the community.  And because it is the richest, smoothest, most velvety and fragrant cuppa that I have ever found, I've even signed up for a subscription of regular deliveries to prevent the horror of running out.  I am all the happier to read about the charity fundraisers and community events they sponsor, which of course makes me even gladder to support them. They even have a lovely page on FaceBook.  As for this tea, I just got a delivery yesterday, which I might add arrived promptly and well packaged... to my utter delight.  I'd write more but my kettle is going and I'm eager for more tea.  YUM.  =-)!!

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: Tea taste, like anything else to do with flavor, is completely a matter of opinion. Yorkshire tea is strong, smooth, malty and rich. Irish Breakfast is vaguely similar to it; most quality black teas (PG Tips, Barry's, Lyons, Typhoo) are grassier and more herbal than Yorkshire, though charming in their own ways.<br />Yorkshire tea is specially blended to brew well in hard water. I use filtered tap water, but in the area in which I live the water is hard. The alkalinity of the water may account for the delightful taste of Yorkshire tea to my palate (compared to other teas).<br />That being said, I do enjoy other teas such as those mentioned above, yet Yorkshire Tea remains my perennial favorite. I can leave it to brew an amazing 8 to 10 minutes and it gets strong without being bitter.<br />If you enjoy rich, strong black tea, you will not regret trying Yorkshire.<br />My grandmother would balk at my use of tea bags, but they are so convenient, especially in the mornings. I have also used the loose leaf version of Yorkshire Tea with even better results...smooth, deep, and almost creamy. If you are as pressed for time in the morning as I am and take tea rather than coffee (yech), you will appreciate the convenience of the bags.

review/text: A girfreind fomr the UK brought me a large 100 bag box during a recent visit to the US. I was quickly hooked on this excellent afternoon "pick me up." No sugar required, Harrogate's Red LAbel, Black tea is a sure winner. And so glad to find it available through Amazon. The "local" English Pub overcharges in exce$$ for the same product.

review/summary: My Favorite English Tea
review/text: E! Network aired Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" movie, the one with Keira Knightley, tonight. I've seen this movie many times over the years, and the Oxygen Network and E! love to air this movie several times, but it never gets old for me. I could watch anything Jane Austen-related numerous times and still be a happy camper. Anyways, anytime I watch anything Jane Austen or British-related, I always find myself grabbing my Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea. Out of the English tea companies out there, Taylors of Harrogate, is my favorite English tea company, with Twinings of London and Ahmad Tea, second and third, respectively. Taylors of Harrogate's Yorkshire Tea is one of my favorite teas. Like many of the other Amazon reviewers have said, this is a dark, robust, bold black tea. It's like the strong black coffee of teas. This Yorkshire tea smells and tastes wonderful. Even though the Amazon description said that this tea is served best with milk, I find that this tea tastes great alone. I don't need to add anything, including cream or sugar, with this tea. This tea is truly top quality and tastes perfect the way it is. I consider this Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea an essential tea to have for anyone who drinks and serves tea to guests. Out of all the tea companies out there, Taylors of Harrogate, Harney and Sons, and The Republic of Tea, are my top three favorite tea companies based on the quality of their teas and the comprehensive variety of teas they offer. I also think it's awesome that Taylors of Harrogate are committed to environmental issues such as deforestation and climate change. It's nice to read that Taylors of Harrogate teas are Rainforest Alliance Certified. On the bottom of their tea boxes, they say that they have their own rainforest project, and that they have assisted in helping plant three million trees across the globe. I love that Amazon sells this in packs of six boxes. I have one box at my workplace, and I gave some tea boxes to my co-workers and friends during the recent Royal Wedding of William and Kate. Anyways, this is a nice affordable tea to drink and share with friends and family.

review/summary: For the perfect English 'cuppa'
review/text: Over many years, I regularly brought back English teas for my family of tea drinkers to sample including Fortnum's Royal Blend, Twinings English Breakfast and, more often than not, this Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea which became my family's overwhelming favorite. Now we share bulk orders of this beloved tea supplied by Amazon which arrives to my doorstep in perfect condition - the true UK product with a whopping 3+gr of tea per bag and a very favorable expiry date so the 6 individually wrapped cellophane packs of 40 bags will stay fresh for 18 months.  This Yorkshire Tea makes the perfect breakfast tea - the Assam/African tea leaves common to English Breakfast blended to create a rich, smooth, golden brew standing up well to a generous spot of lowfat milk (my English friends NEVER take whole milk with their tea!) In comparison with its rivals, Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea has 50% more tea per bag than the Twinings USA English Breakfast product. (Twinings USA cuts down the strength of its tea bag from 2.5gr per UK bag to 2.0gr for the USA product.) For eco enthusiasts, Yorkshire Tea is Rainforest Alliance certified. The Tea also holds a the Royal Warrant and is served in the renowned Bettys Cafe Tea Rooms in York. Now if Amazon would only import crumpets to complement my perfect Yorkshire cuppa!

review/text: This is a very good tea, but does not outplace my favorite tea from the UK (PG Tips). I found the taste of the tea bag material to linger in the tea, so be careful not to let it steep any longer than needed. Yorkshire certainly is better tasting than the average US tea brands, so try it if you are looking for an upgrade, though I would also order a box of PG Tips for a treat!

My only problem with it is that I ordered this twice from Amazon in the last 4 years or so, and each time the bottles leaked during transportation. I am not sure what they could do to prevent this from happening in the future. But it is a concern. Do not order any books with it, they shipped everything in the same box, and everything got soaked with it.

review/summary: Way better than soy sauce
review/text: I don't like stuff to be very salty, so I've always been hesitant when it comes to soy sauce. But, I tend to cook a lot of asian influenced cuisine and of course run into soy sauce and fish sauce very often, both being almost completely made of just salt. So, a friend of mine suggested this alternative and I'll never go back. It's a way more subtle than soy sauce, so it doesn't over power your meal with one salty flavor, and even helps with your digestion. 4 thumbs up. I ordered the 6 pack and I'm glad I did.

review/summary: Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Flavored Commercial Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

I would not hesitate to buy this item, but not now since I am trying to lose weight.

review/text: A friend told me about the Windee Rings and how her dogs adored them so I bought some and gave them to my 4 little Shih Tzus.  They are totally obsessed with these treats!  It takes the small breeds a while to eat them thus keeping them happily preoccupied while you watch your favorite show or catch up on email!  They are relatively soft and break off in small bits making them good for small dogs.  Try them and you'll receive lots of adulation from your canine friends!

review/text: I am a ginger fanatic and this is the best candy I have found. Soft, chewy, full of great ginger flavor and 'heat'! And the packaging is the best. With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!

review/summary: Inedible chemical flavor. Our guests unanimously agreed.
review/text: We purchased a three pack of chocolate caramel, strawberry vanilla, and lemon poppyseed because the package looked so attractive, and I thought it would save me some time. The flavors sounded very appealing.<br /><br />Reality couldn't be farther removed from the picture. The cupcakes were practically inedible. The chemical flavor of the additives was unbearable. I actually spit out the first bite I took of the chocolate caramel. I asked several guests to try a bite of all three flavors (because I wondered if there was something wrong with me. Couldn't imagine three flavors of such an attractive looking mix could be THAT gross), and not a single person liked them. I ended up throwing everything away, and having to buy something else in a hurry.<br /><br />Furthermore, I'm not someone who likes much frosting on cupcakes, but the package provided barely made enough to thinly cover the cupcakes. Very thinly. If you were to put as much frosting on your cupcake as is shown in the picture, about a third of your frosting would already be used up. This is probably a good thing, since the frosting had that horrible quality of coating the roof of your mouth in a layer of revolting grease that is hard to get rid of. (And I used strictly fresh ingredients that I had just bought, added according to the recipe.)<br /><br />What a waste of THREE packages of cupcake mix and fresh ingredients!!

review/text: I would politely disagree with the above reviewer- I bought each of the three Cobblestone cupcake varieties on a friend's recommendation, and am so glad that I did!<br /><br />I made these cupcakes for my girlfriend's baby shower, and everyone loved them- they were easy to make and were much higher quality than other gourmet brands I've tried. The cupcakes were very light and were the prefect size for a cocktail-like party. One suggestion I have would be to make double the amount of icing they recommend- The amount they suggest is sufficient to cover each cupcake, but I made double the icing so that I could pipe it on (...they ended up looking just like the high-end cupcakes you see in fancy shops.)<br /><br />These delightful cupcakes helped to make my party a success...and the packaging looks so pretty that you are not afraid to hide the box in the recycling bin!

They love all the flavours but they especially love the beef and the seafood medley. So if you have a bunch of unopened and unfinished cat treats in your cupboard and have reached a point of exasperation as to what next? Go with any of the Whiskas Temptations products. You will not be disappointed, and neither would they.

Other reviewers have tried various versions ("natural" and regular) of Whiskas Temptations as treats with similar results. I can echo their critiques in regard to using this line as an appetite booster or flavor enhancer as well. For more detail on my search for an effective "enticer" take a look at my separate review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES.

review/text: My cats are wild about these treats.  I wish I knew what whiskas put in them to make the cats love them so much.  These treats are supposed to be nutritionally balanced and have 2 calories a snack.  They have a nice little crispy crunch that you can hear when your cat chomps on them.  My two cats are especially crazy about the savory salmon flavor, although they love them all.  You'll probably like that they don't smell horrendous like a lot of cat treats out there.  You might even be able to train your cat to do tricks for these treats.

review/text: There is not much to say other than I have tried every treatt imagineable and these are the ones my cas LOVE.  They are small but I don't think that matters.  They are treats so why do they have to be big?  They are hard and crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  My cats try and lick my fingers when I finish giving them a set amount.  If they hear the bag, they come running.  I only tried the beef because I do not think giving fish to a cat is a good idea.  I might try another non-fish flavor but if they love the beef, I may just stick with it.  My only hesitation is the first ingredient is by products but I suppose as a treat once in a while, it cannot hurt.

review/summary: Great product, good supplier, fair price
review/text: I love Devil Dogs. Unfortunately, here in the Seattle area they are not for sale. For the last few years I have odered them online. The product you are viewing is sold by an affiliate merchant with Amazon. Shipping is done by the seller. I wouldn't be surprised if the seller buys the Devil Dogs at a local supermarket, boxes them, and ships. In terms of the product itself, well Devil Dogs are really wonderful. This review is more about buying them than extolling their value as a treat.<br /><br />The first thing to know is that Drakes Cakes short dates Devil Dogs. They have an expiration date less than a month after manufacture. This is their way of assuring freshness. Expect the product you receive from this vendor to have a week or less of time before the "sell before" date. This is not a problem. As long as you get them before the sell-by date, you will be fine. One really nice thing about this product is that you can safely freeze them in their package. I just open the carton, unpack, the retail packs and put them in the freezer. I then pull them out one box at a time as needed. They don't get stale that way and the taste does not change due to freezing.<br /><br />As far as this seller goes, shipping is pompt. In this case they came in a Priority Mail package. No damage of any kind. My one complaint is the shipping cost. As I recall it is nearly $8 per order of 6. Now that isn't too bad all things considered. What did bother me is that when I priced a double order (12 retail packs), the shipping price doubled! There is no savings if you order more. What this means to me is that I will only order 6 boxes at a time. So, if you figure the cost: $26 for the product and $8 for shipping, you are paying $34, which turns out to be about 71 cents each. Well worth it to me.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great treat, fairly priced, and promptly shipped. A good deal all around.

review/text: While they have a few mustards to choose from I picked this one solely as a dare, to the Fallot people, to disappoint me.  I've had their Dijon and their Dijon with Peppercorn so I knew that they knew what they were doing.  When I saw the Gingerbread variant I figured it was the LEAST appealing.  For me that is always a sign of a way to expand my horizons so I went for it.  It is excellent.  The more detailed ingredients include wheat and spices.  It's not the gingerbread taste I was expecting, which is a good thing.  It is dijon with a very unique zip to it.  I put it on ham with a whole grain wheat bread.  I prefer high tech ingredients like Boar's Head rosemary & sundried tomato ham but it's too delicate for this particular mustard so just use a basic high quality meat.  Serve it to yourself though, unless you know someone who is a total "foodie."  I paired it(LOL) with a French beverage in the form of a Citadelle gin martini.  Look to the French for food and art and you won't be disappointed,

review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/summary: too yummy
review/text: These were so delicious that I ate the entire contents of six tins in less than 2 weeks.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, they dissolve very quickly, unlike Spry mints.<br /><br />Although they taste better than Spry lemon-mint flavor, I'm re-ordering only the Spry because I'm just interested in using a few xylitol candies after meals for improved dental health, not losing all control and pigging out night and day.

review/summary: not great
review/text: I am trying to find a little candy that is not bad for you but these are not the ones!  They have an aftertaste that is unpleasant and just don't work for me at all.

review/summary: Move over Smarties!
review/text: I love the citrus and the raspberry flavors of the Ricochet Sours.  They are shaped like Smarties candies, but are a bit more crumbly.  I love sweet and tart, and these certainly fit the bill.  I bought them to help stop my out of control afternoon sweets cravings.  I love that they are good for my teeth.  Yay xylitol!

review/summary: Worst buy ever
review/text: I love sour candy and since Altoids are not in the market anymore, I gave a try these candy, and boy it was the worst experience ever, they were unedible, the candy wre broken and powderish inside the can, I thought it was only one can, but I opened the six of them and they were same, I called Amazon right away and they refunded me and the candies went to garbage

review/summary: Great fun for kids (and adults)
review/text: In a word: FUN. You would not believe how a pair of eyes can transform a bowl of ice cream. And if you really get into it (whip cream hair, sprinkles for a beard, candy for the mouth) it can bring ice cream sundae parties to a whole new high. Plus, they taste good.
