review/summary: Really great protein bar
review/text: I unfortunately work in a job setting where we do not just get to take breaks when we feel like it or snack while working. This can be a problem for me, as I tend to get hungry every two hours and sometimes only get a 10 minute break. These bars are small enough to eat quickly and keep me full til I can have a real meal. They are tasty too!  A bit like a chocolatey rice crispy bar. Only downside is price. On sale they work out to be about a dollar a bar, which is about the same as most protein bars, I just wish I didn't have to resort to an extra $20 a month protein bar to keep my stomach happy.

review/summary: Low fat, high fiber meal replacement bar
review/text: I eat a high protein meal replacement bar every day for breakfast, and I have lost several pounds. The bar is high in protein, which does keep you fuller longer. By lunchtime I am usually pretty hungry, but I can hold out until lunchtime without a problem. They are a bit dry, so I always have a drink on hand while eating them. The chocolate flavor is great, not that cheap tasting chocolate that usually comes with diet products. The bar has a nice chew, but isn't overly chewy, nor does it stick to the teeth. They have a good flavor - not the best bar I have ever eaten as far as taste goes, but better than tolerable for sure. These bars are lower in fat content to some of the Slim Fast meal replacement bars, which is why I tried them in the first place.<br /><br />This high fiber bar will keep you feeling full for several hours, and replacing a meal a day with them does create results. Following their diet plan of two meal replacement bars a day with three snack bars will more than likely increase weight loss from the few pounds I have lost eating one bar a day.

review/summary: We eat WAY too many of these!
review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now, and my boyfriend finally tried them and now he eats them more than I do!  They're great.  The only issue I have with them is that sometimes the quality is different -- not sure if it's something that happens during manufacturing or afterwards during storage/shipping, but occasionally we'll get some that don't taste as chocolately or are gritty or something.  On the other hand, it helps keep them from all tasting the same.  They're particularly great on the go!

review/summary: Yummy taste!
review/text: I was really surprised by how good these taste, as most protein bars tend to be a little bland.  But these are anything but--as another reviewer commented, they almost taste like candy!  The 10g protein is satisfying enough, although lower than most protein/meal bars; the 5g of fiber, however, helps out with filling you up.  They actually have 170 calories, not 190 like Amazon says - not a big difference, but still a nice surprise :)  The bars are also pretty long compared to Luna, Balance, and others, making them a little more of a filling visually, if you know what I mean.  Overall, I like them!

review/summary: Special K...tasty and chocolately  meal replacement
review/text: My supermarket ran out of the Double Chocolate at the old price of $5.99.  When I re-checked again, the price was $7.25 a box.  I got 3 boxes for $19 on Amazon (including shipping) and within 2 days so I think that's an okay deal!  I love these after a workout or before going to the movies.  It curbs my appetite for up to 3 hours so I don't crave food during the movie or raid my freezer after a strenuous workout.  I also like the pink lemonade protein powder but I haven't been able to find that on line.

review/summary: These are awesome!
review/text: So, in my long search for meal bars, I have tried any I have ever seen on the shelves. My general reaction to most of them is that they are like eating cardboard. Also, the "flavor" that most claim to have is not there. So, from childhood I loved double chocolate granola bars. Not healthy at all, but I was a kid. I saw these on the shelf, and decided to try them, despite the many other double chocolate bars I had tried recently. To my surprise, these taste amazing. Has a very chocolaty taste, with no awful after-taste. Also, eating them is just like eating my granola bars I remember...except these are much better for you.<br /><br />I of course don't promote these to people who are on diets that need to watch more than calories, as the fat content and sugars may be a little high for many people. But I can tell you I am male, 5'11", and weigh about 180. This bar with a piece of fruit will keep me full for my entire 5 hour morning.

review/text: When the men are away, the women don't want to cook. These are really great because the taste is good (driiink something with them), they satisfy your hunger for a meal, and they are healthy. Plus it doesn't involve heating anything up or cooking. It's helped me stay at my regular weight because without it, I was just munching all the time because I didn't want to cook.

review/summary: Delicious and filling
review/text: I have tried these and the Chocolate chip and the chocolate caramel.  They are each delicious.  They are the best tasting "protein" bar I have ever tried and I have had many.  These have 10 grams of protein which is plenty to give most people a relatively healthy  snack that also somewhat fills you up.  They each have 170 calories, not the 190 that this product information says.  Now if you are watching sugar carbs, there are 15 grams of those so probably not good for that type of "diet".  In most stores they cost $6.99 per box of 6 so this price of $14 for 3 boxes of 6 is pretty good.

review/summary: Another high protein bar
review/text: This is one of many high protein bars on the market.  I would not call it a meal replacement, but it does have (according to the wrapper) 10 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and some amount of vitamin and mineral content.  It is something that you can eat quick, if you did not have time for lunch, or something to fill in during a long afternoon.  It has a light crunchy texture and a good flavor.  170 calories is not overly high, and is less than some other energy/protein bars with similar amounts of protein and fiber.

review/text: I am a chocoholic trying to watch my calories/fat/carbs and still enjoy life. A friend recommended these bars for breakfast.  I saw the price in the grocery store and thought maybe not. BUT the price with free shipping at Amazon made the cost per bar much more appealing so I decided to give it a try. LOVED IT!! They taste better than most of the other breakfast bars and they have more nutritional value that almost all of the others. For Weight Watchers, they're only 4 Points (PP)which is a good choice for breakfast.

review/summary: Meal Replacement Bars
review/text: My husband is on a Doctor supervised medical meal replacement diet.  I'm doing it with him with over the counter products.  This bar is really good.  I use them as snacks, as well.  I eat half a bar for a mid morning and mid afternoon snack.  Sometimes I skip the afternoon and eat the second half for an after dinner snack.  It's very tasty - not at all griddy, and satisfies the body's need for protein, and my sweet tooth.  I eat a regular food meal (low cal!) for dinner.  Please do NOT do this without letting your doc know - especially if you have diabetes, or any other medical issues.  My doc has done bloodwork and is monitoring my progress so she can cut down my diabetes and other meds as needed.  So far I've cut my metformin in half, and my cholesterol and triglicerides have come down amazingly!  Enjoy!

I can easily see these being a good daily breakfast if you're busy or trying to diet, or as an addition to a meal if you're trying to gain.

review/summary: BEST tasting protein bar!!!
review/text: I need to eat 1 or 2 protein bars every day as a post bariatric surgery patient to ensure that I get enough protein every day. This double-chocolate Special K protein bar (10g protein, 180 cal), is my very favorite protein bar, since it tastes more like a chocolate candy bar with crunch. I've been eating 4-5 per week for over a year and I still don't get tired of them. There may be bars with more protein, or ones with more fiber. but none with better taste in my opinion. Buy one box and you'll be hooked.

It's like biting into a ground-up mixture of styrofoam and dirt that's been compressed into a semi-solid then dipped in overly sweeten chocolate. The beach sand residue left in my mouth from this thing is horrible. I've got half the bar sitting here in front of me, and I really don't think I can finish it off. Yuck!<br /><br />Judging from the other reviews, maybe these gross, awful things are an acquired taste or maybe my taster is just seriously out of whack. Whatever the case, they're downright nasty!

review/text: I love(d) these bars. They taste like a candy bar, have fiber, fill me up, whats not to like!<br />Oh wait... they use SOY PROTEIN.<br /><br />I'd heard about the dangers of men/boys eating soy protein before from friends/colleagues and pretty much dismissed it as tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. But when Men's Health had a large report on it, I figured it was worth the time to do some independent analysis.<br /><br />Long story short (and don't just take my word for it, I could be a crazy person on the internets) if you are a man, you are essentially taking large doses of estrogen every time you eat one of these. Note only does estrogen not help out in the muscle building department, the soy phytoestrogens have been linked (through legitimate research) to a whole lot of bad things, namely behavioral, pulmonary, circulatory diseases.<br /><br />So eat these things if you'd like, but I will be running not walking away from them. And it REALLY bums me out because they taste great... I just wished Special K would have ponied up the couple extra cents to whey protein...sigh.

review/text: I put this kit together tonight with my two young sons and we had a ball. (We paid $10 for it at Fred Meyer, which was $5 off their normal price, so beware that the cost on this site is ridiculously high). The pieces were easy to assemble and the tray that comes with the kit is handy (beats having to find some cardboard to cover with tin foil. My only complaint is the frosting because it got overly gooey before we could finish our assembly and it wasn't tough enough to hold some of the heavier candy. I kept putting it in the fridge to firm it up a little. I'd also recommend cutting the tip of the frosting at less than the 1/4" that the instructions recommend. I'd say 1/8th" would have been better. Overall, I was impressed with the finished product. It was easy to clean up the mess, there was plenty of candy and some to spare, and the kids had a blast. I bought a similar kit in the shape of a train and we look forward to putting that one together as well.

review/summary: Best Kit ever!
review/text: By far, this has been the best kit ever. The frosting is already made to go (unlike some others where you have to mix the powder). Also, the frosting is truly sticky and holds the gingerbread parts super well. Every other kit I've ever worked doesn't do so good. Also, there is this tray where the base of the house goes and holds it well. It was just the best. I plan on buying the same one next year.

review/summary: Wonderful Gingerbread House!
review/text: This house was quite large and comes with more than enough frosting and candy.  Everything is high quality and very fresh.  We got 3 houses and had a contest between our children with grandchildren. It was easy and fun for all ages.  After a while, we couldn't resist and decorated the extra cookies, then ate them.  All the flavors of candies along with of the frosting are delicious!  This is a new tradition for us and can't wait to do it again next year.  Merry Christmas!

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This is the second gingerbread house I have bought through Amazon - and this company - and I was extremely satisfied both times. The kits arrived on time and in good shape.  One broken piece the first time (which was easy to fix) and totally intact this year.  My granddaughters and I spent time "gluing" the pieces together with the frosting that comes with the kit, then decorated them with the enclosed candy.  The kit includes everything you need, so when it arrives it is ready to go.  I will definitely buy from this company again to continue our tradition.

review/summary: Nice gingerbread house kit
review/text: This house kit is really nice! It comes with a tray that holds the gingerbread and makes assembly real easy. The icing is plenty, so it will satisfy the most creative of gingerbread architects. ;)<br /><br />My only problem was that some of the candy was gum balls. So, for those children who can't hold gum without swallowing it (as is my daughter), this is not the most optimum kit.

review/text: I ordered two of the houses for my grandchildren in Seattle to be delivered before my visit for Thanksgiving.  We had fun putting them together.  There was more than enough candy and white frosting to make beautiful houses.  Although we won't be together for Christmas, it was fun doing something special together to prepare for it.

review/text: I bought this gingerbread house to make with my 3 & 6 year old and it was excellent!  Both kids were able to build and decorate themselves.  I was impressed with the amount of frosting and candy.  In fact, we had lots of frosting and some candy left over.  It turned out so cute.  I can't wait to do it again next year.  The tray that the house sits in is really nice and sturdy and helps the little ones be able to decorate the house themselves.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Tasty and fun gingerbread house
review/text: Gingerbread house was easy to make, frosting was very tasty. I used cardboard instead of the plastic tray so that it would be more stable. I used some other candies (hershey's kisses, sour patch candies, & used chocolate raspberry cookies for the roof) because I didn't like some of the candies included.The candy canes were broken, which I guess happens during shipment. There was a minor break in the roof, which was easily repaired by putting frosting and leaving it in the freezer for 15-20 mins. I had a lot of leftover candy and green frosting. Wish there was more white royal frosting, but it was sufficient to make the house. All in all, I was very pleased and would buy again.

review/text: This is actually the second year in a row I bought this, so this bad product experience has been confirmed.  The roof just does not stick on.  It mentions to hold it in place for 1 minute while the icing sets, but that just doesn't do it, before we knew it, the roof was slowly sliding down.  Tried propping it up with sticks, but messy and difficult.  Thought we had it, came back 15 minutes and the whole rotten structure had fallen down like a cheap house of cards.  I haven't tried eating this current one, but the last one was not very tasty either.  It was a frustrating time for us, and a sad time for the kids to see it fall apart.  Do not buy!

review/text: The kit was great.  I really liked how our house turned out.  I would not recommend this if you're looking to eat the pieces that comes with it.  The frosting is very close to glue which is great for actually making the house.  If you're making this with kids I would recommend buying some candy to either rather than what comes with it.  Again it's great for making the house but not really made for eating.

review/summary: Breaks Easily! Not Worth It!
review/text: This gingerbread house kit is a P.of.S! While working on the first one with my daughter, one of the roofs collapsed as we were GENTLY putting candy on top of it. Had to run to the store and buy another one. Same thing happened! Re tried using unbroken parts from both houses to piece it back together and the whole thing just fell apart! I followed directions meticulously, waiting nearly 30 minutes instead of the suggested 15 for the frosting to solidify. I didn't put any more pressure on the thing than necessary but the thing still broke apart.<br /><br />$20 later, I'm stuck with a sloppy, sticky mess in my kitchen, no gingerbread house and a disappointed 4-year-old on my hands! This product sucked!

review/text: Most pieces were broken upon arrival. I knew, from baking our own gingerbread houses in the past, that broken pieces could be reassembled using icing. But not the icing that comes with this kit! Ultimately, we tried cutting the broken pieces to form a new gingerbread house. Again, the icing failed -- it wasn't strong enough to keep the pieces together.<br /><br />Tasted good, though.

review/summary: Almost every piece arrived broken
review/text: I bought this when my three year old daughter asked to make a Gingerbread house. I saved it until today, a week before Christmas, as a fun thing to do on a lazy Saturday. When I opened the box I was really disappointed to see that almost every piece of the gingerbread house was broken. I tried to glue them back together with the icing provided, but that didn't work. I also noticed that the pieces didn't seem to fit together very well, despite the handy tray that has little supports built in. The side walls were't long enough to fit onto the front and back panels and eventually the house caved in (without the roof, since those pieces were damaged the most and could not be repaired with icing). Thankfully my daughter is distracted enough with the icing and candy provided that she's not too upset that we don't have a gingerbread house, but I am very disappointed.

review/summary: Our First Gingerbread House Together
review/text: My girlfriend (Ash) and I have never made Gingerbread Houses before. After checking out the reviews for the various houses we settled on this one. It was shipped promptly, so we set out to make an amazing house (while watching holiday movies). The first thing we noticed was a corner of one of the walls had broken off. This was easily fixed by smearing some icing on the edges. It held well and you could not even tell that it was broken. The key is letting the icing dry long enough, so it acts like glue.<br /><br />Constructing the house was not too hard. We let it sit and then we started to ice the roof. This was hard. The instructions say to cut a 1/4 inch hole in the bag of the icing, but this is too big. It made gobs of icing go on the roof. Ash ended up having to use her fingers to smooth the icing out. We could not outline the windows, and we did not achieve the thin spray of icing the picture shows on the box. This is the one thing that prevented me from giving this kit five stars.<br /><br />The frosting tastes great. The candy does too and it is plentiful minus peppermints. We are still eating candy pieces. They stuck well to the house thanks to the frosting. The Gingerbread tasted good for Gingerbread. We aren't huge fans of it, though, which is something we discovered after attempting to eat a house.<br /><br />We had a lot of fun making this house. I outlined the process (with pictures) on my blog here:<br />[...]<br /><br />You can see how easy it was for us to construct our house.<br /><br />Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience and plan to continue the tradition of making a Gingerbread House next year. This kit is great for beginners, so long as you cut a smaller hole in the icing bag.

review/summary: 2 years in a row ...
review/text: Two years running I have purchased this kit from Walmart or Target for my kids to compete against each other in creating their holiday houses. (My daughter always informally wins the competition as my son eats too much of his candy before it's done ;) ) The Gingerbread is far to hard to eat for anyone with an ordinary bite, but that didn't stop the little guy. It's a cute kit, well made, each year there are slight differences in the supplies, but same house design - which is starting to bore my kids, so we may try another box kit or get bold an and make our own template & "ginger bread".<br /><br />BTW - we get ours at Walmart or Target for about $6 less than on Amazon, however with free Prime shipping here and not needing to run off to the store to buy this isn't a bad price.

review/text: We ordered this house to assemble before Christmas. Unfortunately, 2 sides of the house arrived broken in half. We thought we could use the frosting to glue it together but after putting it all together, the cracked pieces caved in. If it hadn't been so close to Xmas, we would have returned it before attempting to assemble it.  One other issue is that the kit did not come with a frosting tip (like kits we've used in the past) which made it difficult to apply the frosting.

We had to throw away the left over icing and it was quite a bit. The candy was plenty, they didn't use it all because they didn't know where else to put it hajajajjaja.  The box was intact and parts were not broken.  From reading the other reviews I was afraid it was all going to be in pieces, but I was very wrong. All the pieces were in perfect condition. And the gingerbread was delicious. I am definitely going to purchase this again next year - we've started a new tradition :)

review/summary: Cracked
review/text: As others eperienced, my Gingerbread house had a rough journey. The packaging was a little loose and caused the box to shift around easily and ended up cracking several of the cookie panels(front and back). I was able to use Elmers glue to fix them for assembly but only after allowing to dry overnight. The cracks were still visible, but It was my only option as there was not enough time to return it for an exchange before Christmas. I must say that had I known how hard the icing would be once cured, I could have just used that instead of the glue. That stuff could be used as mortar mix to build a brick house. Even though this is made of edible materials, I would not attempt to eat any of it after assembly as it would probably chip your teeth.<br /><br />Overall this was a good experience, but just know you are gambling if you have it shipped. It would have to be packed in peanuts to arrive safely. The bubble packing they use now just can't protect it unless they overstuff the shipping box, and that could crush the contents as well.<br /><br />AVS

review/text: Honestly, you do get a lot of "food" for the price which is awesome, if you plan on snacking on the gingerbread after you build it. The frame for building the house really helps with the whole process, so the house doesn't fall down while you're making it. Unfortunately, the candy that it comes with isn't the greatest, but the frosting is yummy! Just make sure not to over-frost the roof, or it WILL collapse, it's inevitable haha.

review/summary: Arrived broken
review/text: I don't know if this is an issue with the seller or with the product.  I'll say it could have been either, and most likely both.  We opened this with my 4-year-old granddaughter on Christmas Eve.  The roof pieces were broken beyond repair.  I bought it at a good price ... only about $10... very close to Christmas.  A last-minute decision.  We were going to skip it, but amazingly, my granddaughter remembered the house she got last year (from an uncle), so it clearly now will be a tradition.  It wasn't the money so much, of course, but it was too late to do anything about it.  I recommend ... if you're going to purchase a gingerbread house kit, get it in-store, where you can see it's in good repair, and spend the extra money to get a good one.  Luckily, my granddaughter was a good sport about it, but I'll be careful/wary in the years to come.

review/summary: Have bought this several times, and it's best to get it locally, often missing or broken items
review/text: The kit is nice. I like it. Good size, not too small, not too large. Everything needed, etc. Good assortment of colorful candy for looking at. Our kids enjoy it year after year. They even eat it, but I wouldn't. Doesn't taste good. It's just candy and items meant to last a long time on the shelf. Not great for eating.<br /><br />But my main issue is that since they do sit on the shelf and get handled a lot or shipped a lot, they often have broken items. And somehow they often have missing items. This time our box was missing the best and most useful candy, the little ball candies that act as the Christmas lights on the house. So that was sad. Of course we got ours too late this year to deal with returning it. So our house was incomplete this year. So either order it early enough to deal with returns and exchanges, or get it locally.

review/summary: Tasted great! Everything broken
review/text: The shipping box arrived in great shape. The gingerbread house actual container was in perfect condition. I had a clue that something might be wrong though when jelly beans started to fall out when I picked up the gingerbread box. It turns out, every single piece of gingerbread was broken, and the jellybean bag was ripped open. There were loose jelly beans everywhere. I still give the product a three star (instead of one) because it tastes wonderful. I try to teach my kids to make the best of every situation, so we still decorated the gingerbread anyway. We couldn't make it into a house, but we had beautifully decorated flat gingerbread pieces. It's some of the best gingerbread I have ever tasted. The company did a wonderful job with the actual creation of the product. I'm not sure what happened that so many of the items were broken, but we still enjoyed our Christmas treat anyway.

review/summary: Best Gingerbread House!
review/text: This by far is the best Gingerbread house there is, and compared to the other store kits, this is large and made of good quality ginerbread.  I have done a few, and this is the freshest,easiest and so adorable.  It comes with a tray to help the house stay in place, which is wonderful.  It also comes with plenty of candy and ready frosting and it is all fresh.  It was packed very well with no broken pieces.  We had so much fun putting it together and decorating it.  They do carry it in some local stores for about $10. I will definately get this again next year.

review/summary: Great Project to do Together
review/text: I bought this gingerbread house as a Christmas time project for my 3-year-old and I to do together.  I had never decorated one before so this was going to be a new experience for both of us.  In short, she had a great time... I had a great time! It was ultra simple... no mixing... easy set up, etc.  The frosting was a bit sticky and a little tedious to handle, so I did that part. But my daughter could easily decorate the house with all the beautiful and colorful candies. Our little imperfectly piped and decorated gingerbread house was one that she was absolutely proud of... we will definitely do this again next year.

review/text: AS far as gingerbread houses go, this one is as solid as you would hope ( within the realm of a gingerbread house). Every year for the holidays, I get one and I use it in my therapy practice with kids ranging in age form 2 to 15. At least 8 kids a day are adding candies to it over a 2 week period and I've never had one collapse! The kids are bursting with excitement when they come in to have thier chance at adding some decorations! A great product and solid construction! BE sure to build it first and leave it several hours to dry before starting the decorating- it will be much easier this way!

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: I purchased this $49.99 Gingerbread house kit at the deeply discounted price of $19.99.  I wish I had not paid more than $10.  When it arrived, it was broken in several places, and the candy canes were smashed.  I realize anything can happen during shipping, but it could have been packaged more safely. In addition, the house was much smaller than I had expected for the price. The sides of the house are no larger than graham crackers at the most. The biggest issue I had was with the icing.  The instructions say to knead it to soften it for use. I kneaded, and kneaded, and finally resorted to running it under hot water to try to get it soft enough to use.  Every few minutes I would have to run under hot water again, or else the icing would be way too hard to be able to squeeze.  There is not nearly enough icing included in order to decorate the house as it is shown in the picture.  My son and I made our own patterns as best we could, and ended up laughing about it and simply eating the house unfinished.  We had an enjoyable time, but that was due to our laughter at how horrible this kit was.  I would not recommend this kit. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the ginger bread was actually delicious.

review/text: This is the worst product.  Not a product to put together with kids.  The problem with the product is they don't use royal icing.  Their icing is the worst.  It may be reasonably priced but put the coffee on and find that it falls apart and the family has a nice treat.  If you want it to work make a batch of royal icing.  Wilton's is $2.00 more and worth it.

You can buy a Halloween house after that holiday and decorate it for christmas - cost 2 bucks.<br /><br />Just saying.

review/text: Ordered this product for a candy dish I keep for my fellow employees at work. I like to have a mix of hard candies for them so they can choose for themselves. Cherryfield Candy sent this product very fast... very good response to my order. Wrappings are cute, easy to open, nice sized small drop. But the one thing missing is the coffee taste. It's almost tasteless. My problem, I guess, is that I'm comparing it to another more expensive heavily-coffee-flavored larger hard candy. From the good price, I thought these might be smaller items, but with an equally strong coffee taste. I was wrong. I liked Cherryfield's service, but do not care for this product; I will not order these candies again. Out of 5 possible stars, I would give this product a 2 1/2.

review/text: I purchased the Butterball Turkey Fryer for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He was really excited about trying everything.  The fryer never worked out of the box. I returned it a few days later. We ended up baking the turkey in the oven. He had injected it already with this seasoning kit, according to directions on the package.  Now I don't know if it would have tasted differently fried rather than baked, but it was horrible.<br />We ended up throwing the turkey out.  It was inedible. Fortunately I am the mother of an Eagle Scout and I am always prepared with a Plan B.  I purchased a glazed ham the same time I purchased the turkey.  Christmas dinner was saved.  So I don't know whether it was baking the bird that made the difference or what, but beware if you don't fry your turkey.
