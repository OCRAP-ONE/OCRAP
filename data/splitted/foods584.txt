review/summary: This is what you need for a great taco. Trust me on this!
review/text: For years ... and I am not kidding, literally for YEARS... I have been trying to figure out why I can't get a taco shell at the grocery store when I want to make tacos at home that is like the thin, light taco shells we can get at places like local restaurants such as Hacienda, El Maguey or El Nopal. They aren't even as good as the shells used for tacos by Hardees or Taco Bell!<br /><br />When you go to the grocery store you get offered heavy, usually stale, and "tough" shells from Old El Paso or other "brand" names that are huge, "thick", heavy and almost always hard and STALE! Then one day I spotted this simple box of taco shells on the shelves of my local market and thought, "Why do you assume that simple packaging and a brand you don't recognize is unacceptable?" So I tried it for a taco dinner with my adult kids this evening and, without exception, they LOVED these taco shells and so did I! This was, at long last, what I was looking for<br /><br />Now, understand that I have been making tacos for my children for about 35 years, but fussing about sub-standard, heavy, stale shells for about 34 years. But they STILL ate and loved my tacos! But tonight, with La Tiara taco shells, they seriously just RAVED! I heated the shells in a low oven (250F) for a few minutes and then let each taco lover put the amount of meat they wanted in their shells. Then we went to the dining room and everyone "dressed" their taco to suit themselves - tomatoes, salsa, olives, lettuce, sour cream. Without exception, they recognized the superiority of the La Tiara shells over the Old El Paso, Taco Bell and other popular shells we have been using for DECADES. I am SO pleased to find these light, delicious taco shells! Even my daughter-in-law, who always opts for a soft tortilla because she doesn't like "hard" shells, thought these were amazing!

review/text: We used to live in Kansas City, Mo, where these shells are made.  Unfortunately we moved back East, and relied on friends to keep us supplied.  These are hands down the best taco shells we've ever had-very thin and cripsy, made with white corn and always fresh.  I could, and have, eaten them by themselves.  SO HAPPY to be able to order them online.

review/text: I never thought I would be able to get any more Field peas with snaps like I grew up with until now. Having moved out west where no one had heard of them, nor could one grow them, I thought my old southern favorite was lost forever.... until now. WOW, Thank you Sylvia !!! These are the real deal too !! These aren't blackeyed peas masquerading as field peas thank goodness.... There IS a difference and any true southerner can tell at first bite. They have the flavor right too in these field peas and snaps. Sylvia has seasoned them to perfection. One would think she is at the stove cooking them herself. What a treat !! Wonderful treasure. Will certainly buy again !!

review/summary: EXCELLENT for a side dish!!
review/text: With my grandparents owning a large farm in South Carolina, I grew up on field peas and were by far my favorite side dish.  After my grandfather's death in the early 90's, the farm became too much to maintain and shut down.  My parents tried growing them in the clay-heavy soil of North Carolina but didn't have too much success, and I couldn't find field peas anywhere else.  After my move to Maryland, I discovered Sylvia's Field Peas with Snaps at a grocery store, read on the label that she grew up on a farm in South Carolina and had to try them out.  They were outstanding!!  Granted, I'd never had field peas with a smoked flavor, but they were the closest to the real thing!!<br /><br />They are a very tasty pea with a great smokey flavor.

review/summary: Hard and crunchy - NOT like the ones I grew up eating and still eat.
review/text: I guess I'm in the minority here.  I bought a case of these (spent over $41.00) based on the reviews and the fact that I love Sylvia's greens and the Hoppin' John.  Mine, however, are awful.  They are NOT like the ones I grew up eating.  I grew up on a farm in the Deep South and these are nothing like the peas I'm used to, and I know peas, having not only eaten tons of them, but spent years planting, weeding, picking, shelling and freezing them.  These, aside from being a different variety of pea (as you can tell from the can, they are a brownish-red and have an eye), are not flavored well and have a weird, kind of muddy, taste.  But, the worst part is that they aren't even fully cooked!  They are still partially hard and have crunchy bits.  WHAT!!!  Southern peas should be cooked until they are fairly soft.  It makes me wonder if these are prepared from dried peas, another thing Southerners do not do to field peas.  I'm glad the other reviewers are happy with their purchase. Maybe they have changed since then or perhaps the peas they ate in S. Carolina are just radically different from S. Alabama peas (I doubt it.)  In any case, none of my family would ever serve peas that tasted like this, we'd be too ashamed. I am very disappointed (peas and cornbread are my all-time favorite comfort food and still what I request when I visit my parents back on the farm) and angry at the amount of money I've spent on these and I would caution anyone to buy a single can or two somewhere else to try before plunking down this much money on a case.

I ordered a replacement. The second one leaked again! This time UPS delivered it (to let me see for myself?) It was BAD. I did not want to return leaked oil so I tried to use the leftover but NO mist came out - only big drops!

review/text: When I get cold, I always get severe sore throat (normally lose my voice and bad coughing afterward). Same pattern everytime. I tried many cough drops, spray, etc. to erase the pain but those work for really short period of time only. This time, I tried this tea immediately when I felt my throat getting sore. Oh my goodness, it really worked! My throat felt much better just after one cup, and didn't get that severe pain like I normally do. I'm truly  amazed. I'm not a big fan of the taste of this tea (I thought it's similar to Aveda tea), but it was well worth drinking.

review/summary: Singer's Panacea
review/text: It was four hours till the gig, my chops were shot from a throat infection and I was the lead singer for the night. I shared my plight with the trumpet player and he told me about this "Throat Coat" tea that he heard of on some daytime variety show.  A famous singer and Vegas headliner who was on the show mentioned this tea and how everyone in the biz used it. So I ran into the local health food on the way to the gig and picked up a box.<br />The bartender gave me a funny look when I asked for hot water instead of my usual 7&7.  I could barely talk, but no kidding, the first song went without a hitch. It was like my voice was on auto pilot.  I even hit high notes I sometimes struggle with.  It was amazing.  My head was still stuffy and woozy from the other meds I took and my ears were stopped up, but vocal wise I had a great night. I think I drank 4 cups that night.<br />The taste took a little getting used to. Its not bad and it is actually naturally sweet.  It just tastes different from anything I've had before.  I keep a handful in my gig bag everywhere I go and share with fellow singers without hesitation. I just bought a case on this site. I drank some at the gig last night as a matter of fact. I didn't NEED it, I just like it now.

review/text: This tea has a delightful flavor. Lightly sweet and just lemony enough to be refreshing. I added a little bit of honey and it was like candy. Despite being scrumptious I feel no effect on the soreness of my throat. I spent time with my boyfriend over the weekend and apparently caught whatever bug he was carrying. He's been home sick with a fever and sore throat for two days and my symptoms have just started. I was hoping to head off this cold at the pass by loading up on some herbal teas (which usually does the trick) but I'm half way through my second consecutive cup with no change what-so-ever. I may just have a super bug that requires something stronger than tea but I was hoping for at least SOME improvement. Back to Halls it is!

review/text: You know how you get thirsty when you have a sore throat but it's much too painful to drink anything? This is the answer to that. Which makes it, in my opinion, nothing short of a godsend. It's extremely soothing -- feels like cotton candy going down your throat -- and the hydration probably helps you get over your illness faster. Not sure if this one really tastes that different from the original Throat Coat flavor, since the licorice taste in this one is very strong, too (which I love!)

This is something I miss in many hot sauces, they burn your mouth but it's not always they actually add lots of taste.<br /><br />A bottle of the Kutbil-ik lasts a long time since you only need a little to spice up your food.

It's scoville rating is a little over 11k as found on their website.  The flavor is very smokey.  When I saw the color, I thought to myself that it couldn't be that great.  I tried it.  It's now my favorite of the three Chile Habanero sauces that they make and my favorite overall hot sauce. It's my personal opinion of course, but while I love Tabasco sauce, it has nothing over on this stuff.

review/text: I've been loving hot sauce for decades, starting out on Tabasco and moving on from there.  I use all kinds of peppers and spices in my cooking and love spicy, flavorful food.  This hot sauce has been my favorite by a margin since I tried it.  I've given bottles out as gifts/party favors and folks who love spicy food invariably love it.<br /><br />It has a great habanero kick but also really good flavor and after-taste.  I add it to almost anything that is good spicy.  I does have a bit of a mexican food aspect, so if you are cooking asian food or something you'll have to judge if it will alter the flavor you are looking for.  I am always disappointed when I decide I have to use something else!<br /><br />The price is right, too - should be able to get it for less than $2!

"Free shipping" (at $79 a year) isn't exactly free when you pay three times as much as you would elsewhere.

review/text: When I first tried this sauce it was at an airport in Denver...man I was hooked! This sauce has a delicious, mouth-watering habanero flavor. Overall I was very pleased at the spicy kick this sauce has and I would recommend it!<br /><br />I'm considering buying it again and will do so soon for summer barbeque.

We finally got a Mexican Tienda in our town and i buy this from him everytime i visit this family owned and ran store. I have ALOT of it put up for survival / food storage reasons, and inflation fears. I had quite a few Mayan salsas during our trip to the Yucatan and this is pretty close to the same flavor. I pack a bottle to work with me for a couple reasons. Be careful with it, it really is fire in a bottle!

review/text: The sardines arrived well packaged with no defects or dents in the can.  I have been doing sardine taste tests (for no reason really)since I heard sardines from places outside of my region and the states taste much better.  When I opened the can there were two fish, I somehow expected more, but two proved to be enough.  I ate them just as they arrived in the can.  The first taste was typical, stiff and a bit dry.  Then there was this aftertaste that almost tasted of liquid smoke.  The taste lingered and was very unpleasant.  But because I bought them, I finished both fish.  I won't buy again but hey, maybe its just me.

review/summary: Hard hearted candy manufactured all year, sold now.
review/text: For some reason I love this chalky, vaguely fruity flavored confection. I've been waiting all year for Valentines day so I can go out of control and eat these things for no apparent reason. I purchased six of this exact product in this exact size (7oz) and label: five from one supermarket and one from another. The candy seems stale. The purple ones are rock hard and I'm afrade I'll break a tooth so I throw those away, and the green ones are almost as bad so I've given up on them. That leaves the yellow, pink, orange (usually) and blue ones as safe to eat. These aren't supposed to be hard candy, are they?<br /><br />The Necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the Valentines holiday period. They are supposed to be soft candy. So it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago. Good luck! I think I got the from spring 2011.<br /><br />By the way, I got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here, so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first.<br /><br />Also, I bought a bag of the Brach's Conversation Hearts and did a comparison. The Brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts, but the flaver is a bit more bland. It's difficult to tell if the different color Brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors. They're more like just fresh sweet chalk.

review/text: This product is great tasting and holds true to it's Cree derived legacy.  Certainly, not true (Native American) Pemmican, it is as close as any mass market jerky product has come.  This, along with its 3 brothers may be a bit expensive, but it's a great splurge every now and then.  Great tasting cut pieces of jerky paired with an separate berry composition..  Be sure to try and eat meat and its counterpart together for an semi-original Pemmican taste.

review/text: The first bonita flakes I bought my cats were the Cat-Man-Do brand.  My two cats are pretty picky but loved the flakes.  I bought this brand next because it was cheaper but the cats won't eat it.  I had large long flakes of this brand out and put the very last crumbs of the other kind down next to them and my cats both tried to lick up the crumbs and ignored this brand.<br /><br />I compared the ingredients of the two brands, and the only difference is that CittiKitty contains Ash.  Whatever that means, it was a deal breaker for my cats.<br /><br />Also, if you have a Japanese or Asian grocery store in town, you can purchase katsuobushi, which is pure Bonita flakes meant for human consumption, so a better quality, and they are much cheaper.

review/summary: Kitty Love
review/text: Rain and cold weather go hand in hand, especially because they make our pets go crazy. When it's cold out, the cats can't decide whether they want to go in or out and every time the dogs come in from outside, they're hyped up and full of energy. When it's raining, everyone goes stir crazy from being cooped up inside. Since Texas winters don't see much in the way of snow, we tend to get a lot of rain. Thankfully, we now have TunaTreats to help keep the kitties calm.<br /><br />TunaTreats are dried flakes of 100% pure bonito fish. The first time the container was opened, the cats went wild. The pieces, thinner than paper and light enough to blow away if you're not careful, came out of the container in manageable clumps. Next thing I knew, five cats were swarming me, looking up and meowing, trying to climb my chair. I had a captive audience! What I didn't expect was the moment the dogs joined in.<br /><br />TunaTreats are completely healthy and a good "anytime" treat. Our kitties get a good-sized pinch of their new favorite TunaTreats a couple of times each day. With this, they stay nice and calm as they munch. They've also learned to eat all their TunaTreats - our dogs are just waiting for a cat to leave a little bit behind!

I honestly, in my opinion, do not feel that there is anything that can even come close to comparing with this treat.  Way to go, CitiKitty!

review/summary: Buy these chocolates NOW! They're so good!
review/text: You know how some manufacturers overstate how delicious their products are, and you're disappointed and angry when you actually taste them?  Well these guys are telling the truth when they say the Peppermint Meltaway Truffles are a confectionary masterpiece!  They are a silky-smooth, minty chocolate delight!  They're so good I'm almost speechless.  They literally melt in the mouth.  So soft, so creamy, with just the right amount of mint.  And I love that they've blended the milk and dark chocolate so you don't get the bitterness you usually taste when eating dark chocolate and mint.  Three pieces (a serving) has 230 calories and 16 grams of fat, so that's probably why they're so delicious.  But it's worth it!  It's so worth it.  And the package really is beautiful.  But I'd buy them even if they were wrapped in a brown paper bag.  If you're ever in Seattle, make sure to pick some up.  Otherwise, pay the shipping to have them sent to you.  Now excuse me while my friend and I finish off the rest of this box....

review/text: Omanhene is a single-source chocolate made from cocoa grown in Ghana. My wife is a chocolate lover, but she'd grown weary with most milk chocolate, finding it too dumbed down and one-note. Omanhene's 48% cocoa milk chocolate gave her a new appreciation for milk chocolate. It's complex, earthy, and flavorful.<br /><br />It's a bit expensive to be an everyday chocolate for us, but this box was an awesome Christmas gift. The chocolate bars are attractively packaged and the backstory on the creation and operation of the Omanhene chocolate company gave the chocolate a significance beyond its quality and flavor.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: My local food co-op had a sale on various tortas de aceita from Ines Rosales.  I picked up some of the rosemary and thyme as well the cinnamon.  While I like the cinnamon flavor a bit better than the rosemary and thyme, both are very good.  Each box has six individually wrapped (in wax paper) tortas.  I like to place a couple in the oven for a few moments before eating them.  The rosemary and thyme flavor is a great soup or salad accompaniment.  If you want a treat to pair with a tea, go for the aforementioned cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />I will also note that these appear to be a hard-to-find item.  Before locating them at my co-op, I didn't even know they existed and I frequently pick up foods from the international foods sections of large grocery store chains and at local ethnic groceries.  My co-op sells these for 5 dollars a box.  I purchased them on sale for 3 dollars.<br /><br />These tortas are made in Spain.

They are adequate and well priced but frankly, they do not even come close to these.  Seriously, these are addictive like candy.  And by Candy, I mean insert whatever addiction you suffer from.

If 1/3 of the can was macadamia's then it would not be too wholesome now would it. As many noted, the almonds represent the largest percentage of this mix, with macadamia being the least. This coincides pretty well with the nutritional health benefit of each type of nut. I have come to realize that it seems the harder the nut, the better it is for you. So if you are looking for a healthy snack, then look no further, and enjoy.

review/summary: Way too many ALMONDS!
review/text: This container had so many almonds in the mixture! A few almonds would've been ideal but the whole container was almonds 75% almonds! I counted the macadamia nuts in each can and there were about 4-5, and about 10 cashews, and the rest were those horrible almonds! I would've preferred peanuts! If you love almonds this is the best option for you! But if you're looking for macadamia and cashews you will be deeply depressed! I will not buy again! I cancelled my subscription because I can't keep eating cans full of almonds!

review/summary: Where are the Macadamias???
review/text: I opened my first can of NUT-rition SOUT BEACH DIET and poured some in a small dish. Almonds, lots of almonds, and some nice looking cashews. Macadamias? Just one, well, two halves in the serving.  I decided to dump the whole can onmto a big plate. The total was FIVE & 1/2 macadamias in the whole can! Actually, it was 11 halves, no whole ones. I considered this a blatant rip-off and will not buy this product again

review/text: These cups were purchase firstly because they were Jiffy Brand, and secondly because they were the largest individually wrapped cups that I could find.  They arrived in 8 packages of 12 cups.  Package honestly was heavier than I expected.  I purchased them to be used in the student weekend packpack program supported by our local church.  They will fit the bill well.  If there is one drawback, it was the shipping cost.  Roughly 1/3 of the total purchase cost was for freight.  In the future I will look locally or elsewhere for this exact product and hope that I can find them somewhere else with a lesser freight cost.

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/summary: Good chips, terrible packaging
review/text: Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original "ready to ship" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters; miraculously, the chips survived relatively intact. Hopefully will continue to be so lucky in the future.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/summary: you won't miss the salt
review/text: I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order "with added salt." I know, not a healthy choice but hey, I love salt! So, I ended up with a whole case of these unsalted chips. My wife said, hey these aren't salted! She was pleased. She worries about my diet. So, I had some chips. They're delicious! Good crunch. Very fresh corn flavor. Excellent with salsa. Sometimes a guy has to be wrong to do right!

review/summary: No more non-GMO on label
review/text: Bought the nacho chips regularly for my kids but the last delivery came and there was not a non-GMO label on the package anymore, they still use organic corn but use non organic canola oil and any non organic canola is most likely Genetically Modified, which is something I do not want in my body.  Will not buy this product again.
