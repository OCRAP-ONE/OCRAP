review/summary: My dog is getting picky
review/text: We have tried multiple types of chews from this company, my older dog just doesn't go after them with any gusto, out of the three we tried mini congo is her middle choice.<br />I do like the design with the slits in the raw hide and treat center, is something to work for. They could use more natural ingredients inside, starting with real peanut butter, not flavoring.

review/summary: My dogs loved it!
review/text: I have two big dogs at home, and I try to keep them fit. So, giving treats to them is not very simple: there's the small kind that lasts a second, the big ones that cost a lot and are full of calories, or the very expensive kind.<br /><br />The fun bites seems to be another category. My dogs chewed on this treat for a while (I'm thinking at least a couple minutes), they LOVED it, and upon reading the back I can see it's not very caloric. Perfect!!!<br /><br />I can't speak for the digestive part of it, but they were doing fine before eating, and were still doing fine after they ate it, no issues with their stool. It's better than some treats (like the big busy bone) that will make their stools soft.

review/text: Not sure if it was just my dog's reaction to these (he's a 13 yr old Beagle) but I'll just say I wish I'd worn a gas mask about an hour after he ate his first one.  Didn't agree with his stomach at all, and made a mess on the floor because they got really gooey as he was chewing them.

review/summary: dogs wouldn't eat these
review/text: I hoped my dogs would like these.  They eat most chews, but I thought these might last longer, and be gentle on their stomachs, based on the description.  One of my dogs is fussy, the other will eat almost anything, and they both turned up their noses at these, and I tried on a few different occasions.  Therefore, I cannot recommend them or comment on their digestibility.

review/text: OK....did my dog like these???  Yes!  Did I feel they were a healthy option for her?  No.  Honestly, unless I was home with her I would not give these to her.  I am concerned about choking or that a hard piece from the outer treat will be a problem.  These may help digestively, I don't know but when I am choosing to feed my dog Wellness Core why would I give her treats that were not of the same quality?  Dog nutrition is the most important things for your pet.  If I could afford to feed raw I would but since I can't I do my best to find high quality dog treats that I know will benefit my dog.

review/summary: My Dog Loved This Treat!
review/text: My dog loves bones of any kind and rawhides are normally hidden around the house until she decides to dig them up and chew them.  She absolutely loved these bones, although it didn't take long for her to chew through them (definitely not as long as a rawhide).  I can't say much about the digestive affects.  I didn't notice much of a difference.  She didn't seem to be in pain or have diarrhea (as some owners have said).  Her outside routine didn't seem changed and there was no need for her to immediately get outside when she was through with the bone.  These are definitely a treat for our dog and one I would consider buying in the future

While she had no upsets during that time, we didn't do anything to challenge her, like giving her a pound of beef fat.  But more important, she loved them, seemed to look forward to them, and they didn't cause any digestive upset.  Since there is nothing wrong with these, they have to get five stars.

The fact that the outside is covered in rawhide with the yummy stuff in the middle made my canine's work for the treat and let me tell you, they were occupied trying to get to the chewy center of these FunBites.<br /><br />By their enjoyment alone I would buy these treats again. Most definitely.<br /><br />Natalie S.

review/text: I picked these FunBites MiniCongo bones for my puggle.  I am pretty picky about what kind of chews I give her.  Sometimes she has a hard time of chewing them so she gives up and swollows them whole.  This usually makes her sick then.  She was able to chew these bones goodand into small edible pieces.  She would chew on them for hours.  Sometimes she would leave an unfinished chew on the floor.  If I would find it I always picked it up and would hide it from her and then tell her she had to find it.  They must smell really good because she always would.  I will be buying these again for her.

review/summary: Another Love of Tippy the Pampered Poodle!
review/text: Although I have not personally tasted them, Tippy the Pampered Poodle loves them.  As a matter of fact, she caught me bringing the bag upstairs to write the review, so she started her performance (spin around dance and jump with a high-five).  I am so happy I do not have to perform for food.  I would probably starve!<br /><br />Anyway--there are 7 to a bag.  They smell like a doggie chewie.  Each is about 3 1/2 inches long and about 1 inch in diameter.  It is a hard circular chewie mix of particles, covered with a perforated raw-hide looking cover.<br /><br />The wrapper says it is a mini congo and contains artificial peanut butter flavor and good for digestive support.  It says it is high protein, and low fat, and contains a source of papain enzyme.  (Papain/papaya is a digestive aid for people too.) Net weight on package is 7.9 oz. and it says it helps to clean teeth while chewing.  Primary ingredients are beefhide and rice flour.  How long it will last depends on your dog.  Tippy disappeared with hers and will probably chew on it for days.

review/summary: tasteless
review/text: I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:<br /><br />Me:  opening the bag "you want a treat?"<br />Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently<br />Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her<br />Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. "sniff, sniff".  She looks back up at me.  "sniff".  She walks away and lays down in her bed.<br />Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside "wrapping".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.<br /><br />I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly "bite of cheese" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.  These treats don't even get the honor of being buried.

review/text: Not sure what the problem was, but neither of my dogs accepted these treats if an option was available.  If this was the only thing offered, they seemed to take them with a disinterested attitude.  They were made in such a way that the dogs didn't devour them in a few seconds, so were long-lasting, and were a good size to take up some time when you want something to occupy your dog for a longer amount of time.  I may try another flavor of these, as I did like the long-lasting aspect of these treats.

Just an FYI. He really seems to like the treats but not the outside. He works on squeezing out the insides and then discards the husk, which I thought was pretty funny. So the dog definitely likes them, he just doesn't love them.

review/text: A lab can be a bottomless pit; so I thought these would be a good way to make sure his digestion stays healthy. After a couple days I'd given him about three of these, when he suddenly started puking everywhere, little white bits of rawhide, and he couldn't keep anything down. I was so worried that something in these treats was to blame, until we realzied he'd dug up some rhododendron root and that was likely causing his digestion problems, as it is quite poisonous. A can of pumpkin pie filling and some TLC later, and he happily chews on these treats without a problem. So not a cure for landscape plant poisoning, but still a tasty chew treat for your mutt!

It certainly hasn't caused additional problems.  However, my dog is somewhat picky and I couldn't get her to touch these.  Even broken up and put in her bowl it was of no interest to her.  Tried it with four other dogs, one other wouldn't touch it, the other three ate it but certainly didn't seem to be over the moon for them.<br /><br />It may well help with digestion but they don't seem to be especially attractive to eat, certainly not on the level of a Bonz or coated rawhide.

review/text: Our 70 lb boxer likes to chew on things.  The biggest problem we have is that he goes through treats in a matter of moments.  Pigs ears and similar rawhide bones just don't last more than a few minutes.  These bones, however, seemed to do nicely.  They certainly did get eaten, but at least it took our guy a little longer than most treats, and he was very, very into it.  He seems to like these a lot, and with 7 in a pack, we found them just right for us.  They are about 4 inches long (we'd love for them to be longer, but that might be too much "treat" for consumption in one go).  We like this product.

review/summary: Two Paws Down -- or Four.
review/text: My English Springer Spaniel absolutely loves food. It doesn't matter what it is - if it's edible, she's game. My cockapoo is more of a picky eater, so you really have to try hard to find anything she'll try. When the package of treats arrived, I made a big show of opening them for the dogs who were very excited to see what they'd be getting. They readily took a treat each and promptly dropped them on the floor. I picked one up to try to give it to the cockapoo and she took off down the stairs and out the dog door. Turning to my springer who, as I said, never turns down anything edible (in her opinion), I tried to coax her into giving it another try. Being a sport, she took it in her mouth once again then trotted away and dropped it. She came back as if asking, "okay, so now where are the real treats." I finally gave up trying to coax either dog to bite into the treats and just left them laying on the floor for them when they wanted them. Yeah, that never happened. I can understand my cockapoo not eating the treats because she's really picky, but my springer not enjoying them shocked me. They smell like normal dog treats to me! No, I did not try them and nor will I ever be tempted to taste a dog treat. I do plan on trying them out on other dogs and will post an update if one of the pups actually eats one. It's impossible to know if they really support the digestion if you can't get a dog to digest them.

review/summary: Another Great FunBites Product
review/text: With four dogs of varying sizes, it is difficult to find a bone they can all enjoy. From the biggest to the smallest, these bones were a hit. Keep in mind, the bigger dogs "wolfed" them down, but the little dogs took their time.  These were more substantial than expected.  They have an "easy digest" center wrapped in a raw-hide shell. Though a great quality product, I would not recommend this particular SIZE for anything larger than a cocker spaniel. These served as a good time killer for the babies.

review/summary: Overpriced, but at least Chewy will eat these.
review/text: Chewy is a 70 lb doberman/sheppard mix who is what is called an "aggressive chewer."  So he likes crunchy treats (and anything else he can chew up).  Our previous try with a FunBites product,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X3VQ5I">FunBites FlatSticks Calcibone, 60-Count (Pack of 5)</a>, did not go over well.  He would hardly even try to eat it.  He seems to find these treats more interesting, however.  They break up pretty quickly so the treat doesn't last long, but he seems to enjoy it and it didn't upset his stomach (though he is a mutt, so unlike some purebreeds he isn't prone to a sensitive tummy).  But for what they are, they are overpriced.  The ingredients list isn't really anything different than what you would find in a store brand dog treat.

review/summary: Our Picky Dogs Rejected These
review/text: Given that our dogs don't get rawhide treats often, we thought they might like to try these. However, both our 70 lb Aussie and 10 lb. Papillon rejected them. The Aussie eventually gave in and tried to bury one in the back yard, but never bothered to cover the hole. This is pretty important, because our boys will eat nearly anything! These were a nice size for small or large dogs, but neither seemed interested, despite that fact.  That said, these two dogs of ours love dehydrated cow lungs and organic carrots for snacks, so perhaps their pallates are just too refined for cardboard filled rawhide chews.

review/summary: My Dogs Loved 'Em
review/text: We have four dogs, so each one received a FunBite. And each one loved it. However, due to the size, I would recommend large dogs only be given these rawhide treats.

review/text: I have a large shepherd and a beagle. Both of the spent a long time finishing this treat.  My big dog can handle anything, the little dog not so much.  But his BM's were more solid, and he didn't have his normal gas. I recommend this.

review/summary: WOW!
review/text: When I opened the pack, I was a bit disappointed as the bones are quite large and I have a miniature dachshund. BUT the send he smelled the peanut butter hidden inside the rawhide bone he went crazy! He had the huge bone torn apart and the peanut butter eaten out of it in just a couple of hours!<br />I not only recommend these rawhide bones to any dog owner, but so does my dog, he gives it a big 5 paws up!

review/text: My dog is a chewer. She loved chewing on them but I'm pretty sure it's what upset her stomach. I am going to give her another one today and change my review if she doesn't get sick again. It could have just been a coincidence. For now, just 2 stars.

review/summary: Exciting chew for dogs, wish there were more in the package
review/text: These funbites are the perfect size for my medium sized dogs. it does take them a little bit of time to chew for it and they really enjoy these. I would suggest not letting them eat this on the carpet as it can get very messy. It also does not make them too gassy like other treats I've tried.<br /><br />I just wish there were more in the package than just 7. Because I have two dogs, one of them is going to be getting one extra funbite.

review/summary: For LARGE dogs only.
review/text: I have two pugs and thought I'd try these since one of them has on going digestive problems which results in soft strong smelling stool. We received the package in the mail and were surprised at the size of these things. When they were puppies we gave them large size Greenies. These are Twice as thick and very tough to chew. So large that our roughly 20lb pugs couldn't open their mouths wide enough to chew unless we sat there and held them up for them to gnaw on.<br /><br />I considered cutting them down to size but one of my dogs has a tendency to swallow and after the last vet visit we decided to give these a miss. Our two Pugs loved the taste and were quite happy to chew if we held them but we simply don't have the time.<br /><br />So as I said, these are only really suitable for large size dogs and are bigger than the two meals combined that my pugs have daily. I'll give this a average score because I could not test them properly.<br /><br />Remember, get these for your large dogs, probably at least 40 - 60lbs. They are simply too thick for small dogs to get their chops around :) the packaging says they are funbite mini chews which suggests they are small, but they simply aren't small at all.

review/text: It's possible my pup is too young to enjoy these, but the first one, he ate up pretty fast.  He is a lab pup, and loves to chew.  He does particularly like thinner chews; we finally threw the one away he has now been ignoring for weeks.  We have one or two more in the package we will try giving to him when he is older, and if he likes it better, I will revise my review, but so far, I am not too impressed with this product.

review/text: I have 4 Chihuahuas. Although they seem to like these I find them too large for them.<br />I think these snacks would be better for dogs 20 pounds and up.<br />I worry about my smaller dogs eating so much rawhide. Unfortunately these things are so tough it's very difficult to cut<br />them into smaller pieces. I tried with a saw and it took about 10 minutes. Too much work for me but<br />if you have a larger dog I'm sure them will like them.

The first I'd tried were the soy and I thought the peanut butter flavor would entice my dog, but no such thing.<br /><br />I ended up having to put the one I'd offered him in the trash after a couple weeks of it lying on the floor.<br /><br />I just cannot get my dog to like this chew at all and I've given up completely.

review/summary: My Dog Won't Eat Them
review/text: I got one bag as a sample for review and tried giving one of the treats to my dog, but she wasn't willing to give it a serious try. I let her keep it for a week and every once in a while she'd toss it around the living room or pick it up and carry it around for a minute, but she never made any real effort to eat it.<br /><br />I ended up giving 2 of them to my nephew's dog, and he seemed to like them all right. I took the remainder to a playdate my dog was having with 3 other dogs and out of those one chewed on one a little but didn't seem awfully interested, one took no interest at all, and one really liked them. I tossed the bag after the playdate, forgetting that I'd want it for reference, but I seem to remember not being very thrilled by the ingredient list either.<br /><br />The final tally for me was 2 dogs out of 5 who seemed to like it, 1 who thought it was okay but nothing special, and 2 who didn't have any real interest.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with these at all and I can't see myself recommending them to anyone. Given that my own dog wouldn't eat hers, I definitely won't consider buying them in the future.<br /><br />Edit: Leaving my original review intact, but reducing from 2 stars to 1. I just heard that the dog that liked these the most was chewing on it a while after I went home and started whimpering. Her owners found that her gums were bleeding. It might just be a random thing that she bit at it wrong and no fault of the treat, but given the other problems people have reported having with these I wouldn't want to gamble on it. I'm definitely not going to be recommending these to anyone.

review/summary: 4 stars from a "hound" Family
review/text: Our basset hound recently tried FunBites Skin & Coat Congos 5-inches / 4 in a pack dog treats.  She did pause a bit first as if she was hoping for something better, but when nothing came, she went at the FunBites bone.  She ended up liking it a lot.  There is an outer layer of rawhide and an inner layer of pressed bits of rawhide.  The large size and thickness made it last a long time.  In fact, after she had worked the outer layer open a bit, ate out the inside, I took away the soggy outside for another day.  We ended up getting 2 days out of one chew.  The bones are large, but appropriate for the bigger dogs.  Yes, the bits inside the chews do fall out and around the floor, but our 2 little dogs were eating those up and no vacuum was needed.  There is no carpet staining and really no smell to them, dry or wet.  4 stars from our hound family.

review/summary: Our dogs really liked these healthy treats
review/text: We love our pets and always look for new, healthy treats for them.  We have been using various FunBites products lately because they contrain things that are good for our dogs while being a treat they really enjoy.  One of our dogs has a very "sensitive" stomach.  He loves these things and tolerates them without any signs of upset. In fact, when he is given one of these as a treat following his normal dinner he becomes very content.  Even though he is not an older dog, he is missing several of his chewing teeth due to an operation.  Unlike some rawhide treats that tend to make him tender in the mouth, these treats are fully enjoyed.  He REALLY loves them!!! They are a great treat that I'm sure will be enjoyed by any dog.  Healthy, tasty completely enjoyed... what more can I ask for in a treat for my dog.

review/summary: Not the Original Formula No Sugar Version!
review/text: Despite the box color and misleading labeling Muesli, don't be fooled as I was.  This is not the same as the No Sugar version of the Original Formula with the muesli consistency that expands when soaked with milk or soymilk and which has the wonderful date pulp flavoring.  This is a new hybrid muesli-flakes version that I have never seen for sale in stores especially created for American taste which is used to lots of flakes and raisins.  Now I have to finish off six boxes before I can go back to Original Formula or No Sugar Original Formula.

review/summary: This is not the real thing
review/text: This is not the original Swiss Muesli that made this company famous and I've found that in a lot of the stores in this area this is now the only Familia Swiss Meusli available.  In my opinion, what they've done is an attempt to make a less costly product ( for them that is} by adding large volume puffed type cereals to the mix. This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product. Unfortunately, this results in an inferior product, both in taste and nutrition. The real original product is still available in a red box , but I fear they might phase it out if they can get people to go for this cheap imitation.

review/summary: The perfect food
review/text: Back in the 60s and 70s I used to eat the sweetened version of Familia muesli -- now I don't tolerate sugar too well, and also my sweet tooth doesn't take as much to satisfy it as previously.<br /><br />This unsweetened version is perfect for me.  It has lots of oats, as well as other grains and chopped nuts and dried fruit.<br /><br />I add some more stuff (walnut pieces, almonds, hazel nuts if I can get them, and raw cashews, along with extra raisins) and keep it in a plastic container.  Usually for breakfast at work I will line a plastic container with plain yogurt, then put in a helping of Familia, then fresh fruit, maybe bananas, apples, or peaches, and maybe a little nutmeg or cinammon for variety.<br /><br />This is living!  And it's excellent for your health!  I'm tickled that Amazon carries this, because it's harder to get in stores than previously.

review/summary: Label changed but hurrah! I found my favorite quirky ingredient!
review/text: What IS pomegranate molasses, some probably wonder? In the case of this one, "Ingredients: concentrated pomegranate juice" (someone asked in a comment a year back). 'Tasting notes' are below, but first, I'll address why I came looking on Amazon for it in case anyone else happens to be seeking what I was.<br /><br />I've been using this stuff ~12 years; the chef who introduced me to it has used it over 25; once I stopped buying it off him when he'd get a case in, I bought it at middle eastern stores. The brand of it was, for a long time, simply "Indo European" because that is the importer down in Glendale, Cali; Al Wadi is one of their brands, and that is the brand they attached to this particular product for retail use whereas restaurants seem to get bulk cases of the Indo European branded ones. Seeing this one, I had a hunch it would be the same thing; their website made me almost certain. My last bottle was about a third of the way down and I've been using it a lot lately, so I decided to browse Amazon and here it is, that quirky octagonal "domanco anjar" vessel with the "superior quality" foil label and gold aluminum lid... Glad I looked online before calling around! I tried both side by side, and it's definitely the same stuff--same geographic source, distributor, texture/thickness, and taste (label excepted).<br /><br />What I'm a little confused by is the size here vs in the stores, which I'm guessing is just an Amazon error I figure is worth mentioning--here it's listed as 14oz vs 10oz being what it is cataloged on the site and in the store and what I own for *both* brands. Don't be surprised if your bottle is 10oz; while my two labels differ in how they express contents (one says net WEIGHT, which would, at 18g per tablespoon, be 12.7oz; the other just says 10 ounces), the volume matches: 20tbsp=295mL=1.25cups=10 fluid ounces. Regardless, Indo European is the parent company to Al Wadi (I have plenty of other stuff by them, too, and most are quite yummy), so if you suddenly can't find this OR Indo European brand, you can always check their site to see if they streamlined it into another line. ;)<br /><br />While my 5 stars and review title should say enough about my opinion of it, I saw some curiosity over the use of this stuff, so here are some thoughts/experiences.<br /><br />My most frequent (though not quite my favorite--see checklist below) use for it is LAMB. Instead of mint *ick* I like my lamb stuffed with port-soaked cherries and the like... I get local (super fresh), sustainable, grass-eating lamb cut to my liking at the butcher and immediately take a Ziploc freezer bag and shove herbs aplenty (sprigs of thyme being something I never omit), Meyer lemon peel and some of the juice and often a few slices of it, too... sometimes Maille coarse whole grain mustard (the whole seeds--it's NOTHING like yellow or even brown or Dijon really), vinegar--red wine vinegar from Italy and sometimes local honey wine vinegar... some vanilla extract with a bit of the bean scrapings (home made), and really as it is mood dependent, the rest often changes--sometimes raspberry balsamic vinegar, Benessimo making a nice clean cheap one, sometimes grade B Vermont maple syrup drizzled in, sometimes unsulfured Uwharrie molasses--it's all a quirky, ever-changing mix, spices also changing often in contents and proportions. I ALWAYS let it marinade at least 48 hours in this vinegary mix that is essentially air-tight slush (oh and I trim all the fat off the lamb before marinating, using the fat separately)  and in cooking,this often comes into play. I'll have whatever fruit--cherries or some kind of berries--simmering if they weren't wine-soaked, sometimes in balsamic depending on how much vinegar and what kind OF vinegar I used in the marinade (condiment quality aged balsamic isn't sour like you'd expect, and no matter what goes in with the lamb, it's never a LOT of acid, just enough to make the fruit and savory flavors bold and binding)... and no matter how I cook it--oven or lately on the stove right in with the fruit reduction--at the end, this gets drizzled on it, often when in the pot I'm slicing the lamb into strips--I leave it medium rare. Blackberries make it gorgeous and purple; strawberries bring its sweetness out more; I've noticed the "sour" cherries (ie Chukar) in the PNW aren't sour at all to me so while my preference is to get intense types already, if I use local kinds, they often are made more tart with this... this zings like tart cherries SHOULD. Oh, when I stuff lamb with the cherries-it all depends on the cut--it's a baking project, and a light zigzaggy drizzle of this makes a nice crusty top when, after getting it almost to temp, I broil it VERY briefly.<br /><br />Anything high quality balsamic or raspberry balsamic can do, so too can this. It's also great for zinging up sweet or bland things. Ice cream topping, check. Salad dressing base, check (and it's already thicker than vinegar bases and if seeds bug you in raspberry vinaigrette, this can sub nicely if you tone down the vinegar a touch). Making "tarts" actually tart, check. Same with "energy bars" with those kind of pitiful dried craisin type things (I always go unsweetened), check. Swirling into fruit smoothies that aren't quite as strong as you wanted, check. Pretty homemade pop component that freezing doesn't make too weak, check. Helping sad dehydrated fruit seem like it's fresher than actual when cooking with them (fruit-dependent), check. Adding to drinks-alcoholic fruity ones, lemonades, stuff you buy blue/blackberry syrups for, even some teas with either hibiscus or fruits or that you wish had those things, check (also: cold weather: fruiting up cheap gloggi/gluhwein that you're heating up, hopefully with lots of whole spices in the bottom of the pot and some golden raisins in the mugs, check). Being the 6th spice to 5 spice powder for certain recipes, possible check. Candying almonds and other nuts toffee-like with a light dusting of spices and sugar on the outside, check. Candying those nuts sans spices and bringing a fantastic surprise to a dessert they get used in, big check. Using with savory warm herbs and a bit of merlot for simmering then quick-searing duck breasts, oh lord yes, check and a golden star for a job well done! Finally, while potentially not "kosher," making your lover taste even more delectable ... CHECK, PLEASE!

My Turkish hostess gave me the recipe, in which this was one of the ingredients.  She told me she gets half dozen bottles from Turkey every year when she visits her mom.  She didn't know where to get it locally.  I had ordered specialty food items from Amazon in the past, so I searched on Amazon and voila! I found the same brand name that my friend had shown me.  I am glad that I ordered two bottles! It's a great addition to your pantry if you are in to trying ethnic recipes.

review/text: I wanted to make a Bobby Flay recipe for Pomegranate Molasses turkey for Thanksgiving, so I bought this exotic ingredient. It has a pleasant bitter flavor (doesn't sound appealing, but it's true). Turkey came out great.

review/summary: Use it as a facial scrub
review/text: I am all about "natural" ways to take care of your skin, so after i read several articles online about how baking soda is a great exfoliator i had to try it.  I just put some facial cleanser on a round facial sponge, put a tiny bit of baking soda into the facial cleanser on the sponge and scrub, scrub, scrub.  The baking soda is so gentle and like a micrscrub.  You feel it working but not beating the heck out of your skin.  For years I used St. Ives and their scrub particles were very large and harsh on my skin. No need to buy a large box just for your face because a tiny bit of BS goes a long way.  I scrub even all below my neck and almost behind my ears too.<br /><br />check out the other things you can do with baking soda:<br /><br />http://[...]

review/summary: A Perfect cup of Tea
review/text: I tasted Souchong tea several years ago and became a fan.  I have not been able to locate it in local stores.  In the back of my mind, I would consider "hunting it down" but only recently decided to find it.  Wow, this tea has all flavor and aroma.  I look forward to enjoying this tea after a day filled with chores and stress.  The scent is smoky and the flavor is bold, but not overbearing.  To some it may be an acquired taste, but it is a tea that does not need any help from lemon, sugar or anything else to make it an enjoyable break in your day.

review/summary: Avoid this tea
review/text: I ordered the tea on December 5th and it finally found its way to my house on the 13th. I think it took a detour through a waste dump before ending up in my mailbox.<br />I have had Lapsang Souchong at Pete's Coffee & Tea  and was very impressed by the smokey flavor. So I tried it from other blenders and most often liked it (Twinning's bagged version of the tea isn't bad, but it's like listening to an opera by echo). I took a chance on this brand and really wish I wouldn't have; this has got to be the worst flavored Lapsang Souchong I have ever had. The flavor of the tea is as if it was smoked over construction waste and rotten wood. I've tried 8 cups of it so far using different steeping times and water temperatures and am continually disappointed. I am not sure what I'm going to do with the rest of this tea other than to help acidify my normally  base garden soil.<br /><br />Yuk!

review/summary: Upgrade Your Instant Noodles with Nong Shim and Add-ins
review/text: More flavorful than the instant noodle brands sitting on most supermarket shelves, Nong Shim's Big Bowl Noodle Udon is an excellent base for a quick meal.<br /><br />Before you start wagging a finger at me, I know instant udon is no substitute for the real thing. During my years in Japan, I ate bowls of hot noodles: soba, udon, and ramen - shiyo, shio, tonkatsu, miso, and butter corn - among others. On occasion, I ate instant noodles, too. There was a time and place for everything.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick, inexpensive, hot lunch that is relatively healthy (vs. a standard, fast-food combination lunch), Nong Shim is a good start. If sodium is a concern, eat the noodles and leave the broth. Add seasonings, vegetables and either eggs or meat to finish it off.<br /><br />J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, recently posted an article, "Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles." I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you'll never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I've distilled his tips down to these four areas:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins - Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br />* Vegetation - Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions "should wilt in a matter of seconds."<br />* Eggs - Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br />* Simple Simmered Meat - Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />In addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a>, I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Japanese Style Instant Noodles</a>. All of these varieties have great flavor but are mild enough to serve to both kids and adults. Another recommendation is for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a>, which is too spicy for young children but excellent for anyone who enjoys a hotter soup.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.

review/summary: Delicious value on "keep it stocked for quick eats"!!!
review/text: 5-stars for convenience and taste, better than expected from an asian-noodle inspired instant (just add hot water) product; the noodles are "udon", slightly wider than the usual instant noodles.  I also appreciate the thoughtful higher-shouldered design of the bowl as this consideration allows for adding of other ingredients to make it even more fancy and more enjoyable, such as meats, won-tons, pot-stickers, perhaps some kim-chee and/or whatever else your taste-buds desire.  I would add caution for parents of little ones who love noodles that this may be too much food, better for a teen or adult.  Keep one handy at work for when you cannot get away from the pressing deadlines to get lunch, head to employee lounge/kitchen and use the hot water tea tap.  It's enough in and of itself to satisfy lunchtime hunger.  Having grown up on the boil the water package method and instant cups, these are a pleasure to have purchased by the case to have handy.

review/summary: SON LIKES THESE VERY MUCH WITH SOY SAUCE ADDED
review/text: After eating the regular store cheap ramin noodles for years he was just sure no others could satisfy his taste.  I personally did not understand how he could like those at all.<br /><br />I bought these first in the spicy chicken and although a little spicy for his tummy, he became addicted to them and said he could never eat the old ramin noodles again.  He just  usually had to take his tummy medicine after eating. This time I ordered these not noticing that they had fish in them. This was  a larger size bowl which I thought would fill him up better. He said they are not spicy and good if he adds  soy sauce to them and he would like for me to order them again.  He says his favorite is still the spicy chicken and the ginger beef.  Ginger beef was not quite a spicy. We just wish these came in more  non spicy varieties particularly a non spicy chicken. Flavorful, but less spicy. Also, a little more of the added veggies in sauce mix would be nice.<br /><br />We have nothing against spicy , in fact, we come from New Mexico with the best in the world Hatch green chilies. It is a different kind of spice though and you can buy them in mild, medium and Hot. Some peoples tummies are just' fussy' when it comes to certain kinds of spicy.

review/summary: Nong Shim's fresh udon is a better product
review/text: These noodles are thicker than regular bowl ramen but not as thick as the plastic wrapped fresh udon. As such, to me, they just don't taste right. The hot water doesn't seem to cook them thoroughly enough, so no matter how long they soak, they're still al dente. Bonus points for not being spicy (seems like 98% of Nong Shim's bowl noodles are spicy) or too salty. I'm sticking with Nong Shim's fresh udon for now.

If you can put in some green vegetables, it will make the noodles better flavor and more nutrition. The good price, especially when it is combined with extra 15%+15% pleased me more. Generally, I will buy it again.

He told me to dump the remaining bowls.<br /><br />Previous comment:<br />So far, I've gone through 2 bowls.  Unfortunately, the next day (including the 2nd bowl) I get this sharp pain running up and down inside my left chest.  I thought I was getting a pre-warning that a heart attack was on the way.  I would have to guess that there is something in the flavor packet which is to blame.  And what are those gray pieces of something floating on top of the soup?  Looks like reconstituted whale blubber.  I think I will "regift" these at Xmas time.

Now back to the snackin'...<br /><br />Prunes aren't just for relieving constipation, they're delicious to eat and really good for you. Prunes are the best food source for antioxidants. Compared with apples:218 and oranges:750 Prunes score 5770 on the antioxidant scale.<br /><br />FYI: Antioxidants are special compounds that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. When healthy cells are damaged, they are more susceptible to aging, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. Diets that contain fiber-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables, and are low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Prunes, which are dried plums, are a good source of fiber and make an excellent choice.

review/summary: These delicious prunes (dried plums) reduce bowel transit time & feed friendly bacteria
review/text: Newman's own Organics California Prunes (dried plums) are the best tasting prunes I've ever had.<br /><br />Prunes are well known for their ability to prevent constipation. In addition to providing bulk and decreasing the transit time of fecal matter, thus decreasing the risk of colon cancer and hemorrhoids, prunes' insoluble fiber also provides food for the "friendly" bacteria in the large intestine. When these helpful bacteria ferment prunes' insoluble fiber, they produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyric acid, which serves as the primary fuel for the cells of the large intestine and helps maintain a healthy colon. These helpful bacteria also create two other short-chain fatty acids, propionic and acetic acid, which are used as fuel by the cells of the liver and muscles.<br /><br />The propionic acid produced from prunes' insoluble fiber may also be partly responsible for the cholesterol-lowering properties of fiber. In animal studies, propionic acid has been shown to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in the production of cholesterol by the liver. By lowering the activity of this enzyme, propionic acid helps lower blood cholesterol levels.<br /><br />In addition, prunes' soluble fibers help to lower cholesterol by binding to bile acids and removing them from the body via the feces. Bile acids are compounds used to digest fat that are manufactured by the liver from cholesterol. When they are excreted along with prunes' fiber, the liver must manufacture new bile acids and uses up more cholesterol, thus lowering the amount of cholesterol in circulation. Soluble fiber may also reduce the amount of cholesterol manufactured by the liver.<br /><br />A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine confirms that eating high fiber foods, such as prunes, helps prevent heart disease. Almost 10,000 American adults participated in this study and were followed for 19 years. People eating the most fiber, 21 grams per day, had 12% less coronary heart disease (CHD) and 11% less cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to those eating the least, 5 grams daily. Those eating the most water-soluble dietary fiber fared even better with a 15% reduction in risk of CHD and a 10% risk reduction in CVD.<br />Lastly, the insoluble fiber provided by prunes feed friendly bacteria in the digestive tract, which helps to maintain larger populations of friendly bacteria. In addition to producing the helpful short-chain fatty acids described above, friendly bacteria play an important protective role by crowding out pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria and preventing them from surviving in the intestinal tract.

review/summary: Best Prunes Ever
review/text: Newman's Own prunes are simply dried plums, distinctly different from the slimy packaged & preserved prunes I used to buy. These are chewy, slightly moist, dried fruit. Consistently high quality.

review/summary: good taste, but a little tough at times
review/text: I don't know if I got a "bad" batch or maybe just have odd standards of my own. Hmmm. I'm used to eating Sunsweet prunes, and they're sweeter and softer than these organic ones.<br /><br />I like that these are not so sweet, but sometimes I find them a bit tough, and I wish I weren't eating them straight from the bag but instead cooking them with oatmeal or something like that.<br /><br />I don't use them for any real physical problem or challenge; I've always really liked prunes in general. My dad needs these for regularity, and I must say they've been really good for him. Better than the generic or Sunsweet ones we used to get for him. Dunno why that is, but it is.<br /><br />Anyway--solid four-star rating.<br /><br />Ooo, little tip--put a few in a food processor and mince them up, then use them as a spread on toasted whole wheat or whole grain bread. Yummy!

review/summary: Hard, dry but organic and flavorful
review/text: These prunes are flavorful but are not soft and moist like the best selling grocery store brands.  Because they are organic, because the profits go to charity and because it is so easy to buy from Amazon I do rebuy them and either stew them or soak them overnight in the Fridge.<br /><br />I wanted to give them 3.5 stars.

review/summary: Ingredients: Prunes, Potassium
review/text: The pack I received from Amazon has another Nutrition Facts sticker put there to cover or hide the original one.  Out of curiosity, I pilled off the sticker, and found the following:<br /><br />Ingredients as: prunes, potassium sorbate as a preservative.  Product of USA, Argentina, Chile, and France.<br /><br />So the prunes I got is not only not organic grown at CA but also contains preservative?  Is it an okay practice to put another sticker on original nutrition facts label?

review/summary: Great prunes, convenient package, watch for pits
review/text: As an occasional (but not, um..., regular) prune eater, I have found these to be my best trade-off between buying in bulk at the natural foods store (sticky prunes, never sure whose hands have been in them) and buying in smaller packages (waste of plastic, etc.). The bag has a ziplock closure, and goes right in the fridge after opening.<br /><br />The prunes themselves are soft and sweet. I agree with the others who warn about pits - it doesn't happen too often, but I have found hard shards. This isn't a dealbreaker, but I wouldn't give these to an invalid or toddler without cutting them open first.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I'm not an expert on prunes, in fact I can't remember the last time I bought or ate any.  But this product made a prune lover out of me.  They are moist and sweet but not overly.  A word of caution, beware of small bits of pit, so far it hasn't been common place, but boy does it ever put a halt to your chewing when you do bite down on a piece.  So far no lost fillings but sure gave me a fright, chewing more slowing now.

review/summary: Newman's Organic Prunes
review/text: I am very happy with the price and service Amazon provides with its subscription service.<br />Now, the quality of the Newman's Organic Prunes leaves a bit to be desired: I keep getting chips of the pitts.  At least a couple of chips per bag.  The other brands (not organic) never have chips of pitts in them.<br /><br />Amazon: great!<br />Newman's Organic Prunes: OK (three stars and not more).<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dave Weekley

review/summary: Just keep a wet cloth or water tap nearby
review/text: These organic prunes are my favorites for snacking at home. Their softness and intense flavor makes them downright sensuous.<br /><br />Because of their high fiber content, I eat only 2 or 3 prunes a day. One bag lasts me a week or more. So I refrigerate them.<br /><br />Only once have I encountered a pit. I have never noticed pit "chips".<br /><br />There is one catch. Whenever I touch even one, it leaves a sticky mess on my hand. Before I touch anything else, I need to wash it off.<br /><br />In search of a less messy prune, I tried one bag of (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0HO">Made In Nature Organic Plums, Pitted, Dried and Unsulfured, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>). They were dry to the touch, but cost more than Newman's Own and didn't have as much flavor.

review/text: These are simply the best prunes I have ever eaten.  They are moist, chewy, and chock full of flavor.  Oh yeh, they're really good for you,too, and they left out all the poisonous chemicals and unnecessary additives.  They are reasonably priced, and the profits go to charity.  What more could you ask for from a humble piece of fruit?

review/summary: Meaty not Slimy
review/text: These are the best prunes.  If you don't like slimy, wet prunes buy these.  They are drier than others, like a raisin would be.  But, you have to buy them in this type of container.  If you buy them in a foil, zipper package, they are slimy (even the Newman's Own brand), but for some reason, if you buy them in this container, they are not.

review/text: I started giving these to my son about a year ago - just to keep things running smoothly, if you catch my drift :) Well, it turns out he LOVES them - so much so that every day he points them out in the fridge, yelling "Poons! Want poons?". I have to limit him to 2 a day or else things get ugly ;). But I am really pleased that he enjoys these and that he thinks of them as treats. Either these are some damn good prunes or I got lucky with my kid ;).
