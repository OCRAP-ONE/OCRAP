review/summary: THESE BERRIES ARE EVERY BIT AS YUMMY AS THE OTHER REVIEWS LED ME TO BELIEVE.
review/text: Really moist, chewy and intense blueberry flavor. I think they are sweetened but they taste really good. I eat them on my muesli and out of hand. I am thinking of getting some of the other dried berries too, I like having snax on hand that don't spoil and add flavor to my life. Highly recommended based on superior taste.

review/text: These blueberries are the best. They are not too dry, but soft and easily rehydrated.

And I'm happy to have another dried fruit in the house for snack mixes and lunch boxes.

review/text: I followed the directions (2.5min) and very few kernels popped before everything started burning.  I usually pop Pop Secret Homestyle brand (4min) and it produces a few duds at the bottom but without any burning in my apartment sized microwave.  Orville PopUp Bowl just didn't pop.  It just burned.  And I tried 2 boxes before I threw everything out.  No more Orville for me. Back to Pop Secret.  Nice idea, epic failure in execution.

review/summary: Good idea but this design didn't work well......
review/text: First off; I love Pop Secret Homestyle butter popcorn. To me it's as close to movie theater buttered popcorn I've ever found.  Still; I keep a look-out for new ideas like this one.  The 'bowl' idea appealed to me.  Sadly; the design failed to open properly and I had to cut it open.  The popcorn inside was buttery but mediocre in flavor.  Definately; not my Pop Secret Homestyle!  I'm sorry this didn't work out for me.  Somebody will like it though.  Different strokes for different folks; that what my dear Dad has always told his children.  I'm laying in a huge supply of Pop Secret Homestyle and buying a new bowl to put the cooked popcorn in.  Sure; I'm still on the look-out for that perfect theater taste.  I'll have to keep looking and tasting.  I'm sorry this didn't even come close and the newly designed bag that opens from the side (mimicking a bowl but it's still a bag); just doesn't work.

review/summary: Not real impresed with this thing.
review/text: It might be just this one flavor, since the other flavors seem to be getting good reviews. My bowl popped, but the bottom layer of popcorn was burnt. I was paying attention, too. I followed the instructions on the bag to the letter. The unburnt kernels on the top came out fluffy and coated in a butter that I am absolutely positive is not good for me (tasted good, though). Another caveat, though: when I went to rip off the plastic film, it did not pull off like magic as in the ads. The right side came up, then I had to fight with the left side (but carefully, so as not the rip off the entire side of the bowl). Then I had the "bowl," which is shaped uncomfortably like an upside down paper hat from a fast food joint. On the whole, the popcorn that came out right was tasty, but I'd still rather pop it on the stove and then dump it into a mixing bowl myself.

review/summary: Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave
review/text: The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again.

review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/summary: Great idea, works well
review/text: I was hesitant to try this as other reviews mentioned that they had trouble getting all the kernels to pop.  I'm using a GE Profile Microwave and it comes out perfectly for me, the directions say 2-2.5 minutes, but it said to listen for the popping to slow down.  I found 2 mins and 15 seconds to be perfect.  The bowl that was formed was sturdy and great for me now I don't have to wash the oily/butter grease off the bottom of the bowl I would have regularly dumped the popcorn into.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, these are definitely a lot saltier than the movie theater butter snack sizes by Orville Redenbacher, I would prefer less salt but these still taste good.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After going through about 5 of these I wanted to mention that the popping time is not very consistent, so you really do need to do as the instructions say and wait till the popping slows down or else you'll burn them.  The popping time has varied from exactly 2 minutes to 2 minutes and around 25 seconds for me.  Once its done I've found if you grab it from the edges and shake it up and down really hard a couple of times it helps a LOT to mix the butter and salt inside so everything is evenly coated.  Also after eating several of these I've found the salt content is fine, it's not too much like I noted earlier.

review/summary: Bran Fiber Crackers are effective and not too bad.......
review/text: Each pack has 10 3"x3" (approx.) squares.  If you try to eat these dry, you will most likely gag.  But, try it with anything moist (mayo, mustard, PB, etc) and savory, and it's pretty good.  My favorite is light mayo on two squares, extra thin cold cut and sprouts as a sandwich.  Just that and a big glass of water, and you'll feel full.  They keep their crispiness very well, and they don't fall apart when you bite into them.  They're very effective in terms of keeping me regular and work pretty fast in that way! I ordered from Amazon the 15-pack carton, and they came within the week in perfect condition -- not a single one appears to be broken.

review/summary: Low carb good, but not great outside of that.
review/text: These crackers are great, if you are on a low-carb or low-calorie diet and have something to put on them. Otherwise, they are very crisp and lacking in familiar flavor. Bran doesn't give you the satisfying carb load of a cracker, but it does deliver crispness. The odd bran flavor is offset well with some almond butter, cheese and mustard, or meat, but don't expect miracles. If your diet is so extreme that you barely get any fiber and you miss the texture of something crispy, these are a good option. Just don't go in expecting anything as grand as saltines (or even wasa bread) and you won't be too disappointed.

Instead of the mystery meat flavor you get with the standard Slim Jim's - these have a much better balanced flavor of actual "meat" and spices. Sure, you can get better snack sticks - but these are truly the king of the slim jim line.

review/text: I was very satisfied with my order of these Slim Jims. I mean, who doesn't want 24 Burning Hot Slim Jims!? It is a great deal, at slightly less than $1 per Slim Jim! If you love spicy snacks, or anything that will set your mouth on fire, I definitely recommend this product to you. Enjoy, and I hope you don't sweat as much as I did!

review/summary: Great flavor, nice heat
review/text: These are the best Slim Jim flavor ever.  Great flavor and heat, without any of that "heat for the sake of heat" strangeness you get with a lot of hot products.  It has a nice smoky flavor to it.  Less greasy-feeling than the other varieties I've tried.<br /><br />I love extremely hot foods, and find these decidedly hot but no unbearable.  However if you think that Tabasco sauce or similar things are too hot, you will NOT like these!

review/text: This has to be the best slim jim out there, but come on people, it isen't that hot. Now, I will say that I am alway's eating hot food's, but these don't deliver. I would say, 5 min. short burn, not 1 whole hour of heat. If you read the ingreadent list, you will see "less than 2% of" and then Hab. pepper'. For any one looking for a nice hot snack, I suggest these, but for a real chili head looking for a challenge, try some thing else.

review/summary: Best Slim Jim out there!
review/text: I'm a heat freak, i devour hot sauce every day in some form and was very happy to see a Habanero Slim Jim at the gas station the other day. It's got a decent tingle to the tounge, but definitely no "Habanero Heat".<br />a raw Habanero pepper will make a grown man cry. This Slim Jim is far from the real Habanero burn, but still a tastey treat! I dont care much for the other tabasco and nacho flavors. This is my favorite out of them all.

I like habanero when it is tasty with a few minutes of sustained burn, but not scald the tastebuds hot.

Worst part, I can't find a way to get my money back or get in contact with them to state my case. It's only 1 missing slim jim so it's not a big deal, I hate being lied to and ripped off. This also makes me wonder, are all the boxes only containing 23 but states 24? That's false advertisement. Regardless, not satisfied and wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Welch's Strawberry Spread
review/text: I bought this spread looking for good strawberry flavor instead of just a blast of sugar. I have to say that I really do like the taste a lot; however, there are whole strawberries instead of chopped or pureed fruit. The problem wish this is that it makes it REALLY hard to spread. After all, how do yo spread a whole strawberry? The result is that you can have a teaspoon or a tablespoon or however much you would usually use of jam or jelly, but all of the spread ends up in one small spot on your bread. I like my spread to be even distributed over the whole piece of bread.<br /><br />I'm going to take the bottle that I bought and run the contents through my food processor to make it more spreadable, and then I won't be buying this spread again. I'll stick with brands that have a texture more conducive to making an even taste over a larger area

In fact, there is not much one can do wrong with good fresh crab legs, just steam/boil, and freeze to ship.

There are 2 sizes of legs, larger and smaller [usually referred to as A's & B's] with the larger being approximately $2.00 a pound more.<br /><br />Considering that there's more shell weight than meat weight, $25 a pound is completely outrageous.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for your crab legs. I hope Amazon takes note of this review.

review/text: I had a simple lunch today. It consisted of  a 10.5-ounce serving (one can) of Bar Harbor New England Style Lobster Bisque and a couple pumpkin seed cheddar crispbreads. Very good, and just the right size. The Lobster Bisque was excellent. Nice flavor and nice mix of ingredients, including the minced lobster, of course. I've been trying out the Bar Harbor seafoods of late and they're quite excellent, as was this lobster bisque. It's a little high in fat and cholesterol so I'll watch the intake on my other foods of the day. The sodium is a bit high too. Alas, if something is really good, you can just bet it overindulges in the wrong ingredients.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I like to eat this with my vanilla almond milk which makes it taste even better, as the maple flavor then pops. This cereal does not get overly soggy it holds own no matter how long it is in the milk. I have even eaten this as a snack,this is just how much I like the flavor and the texture. I highly recommend this cereal if you like the Quacker Oatmeal Squares...it is oh so good.Take advantage of the subscribe and save as well this bargain cannot be beat,not even at my local store.

This price is a great value considering how other outlets charge $10 for shipping. Overall this is a great hot sauce. There is nothing but heat here. No waste of space here. No unnecessary vinegar. This is great for soups and chillis, and is great for heating up other hot sauces that have the flavor, but not the heat. Even if used regularly, one bottle can last for 2-3 months or more. The only weakness that I saw was that the bottles did not have the plastic dropper tip the Original bottles had.

review/text: Thanks to goat milk my son doesn't have asthma. Two months ago he was having problems sleeping and eating. He would drink cow milk and in a half hour he would start to have what doctors call dry cough syndrome. He would cough nightly, have  mucus in his nose,will cough out a heavy clear saliva when he coughs it out. First they stated he had allergies. he was prescribed with singular for his allergies. My wife and I went to a specialist and he came out negative. He was then prescribe with pulmicort to inhale. Even 911 ambulance declare he was asthmatic when we  explain to them his syndrome. Then one night my wife went on-line to do research about cow milk, and behold a pale horse the site stated the allergies systems is similar to asthma. So parents if your child is acting totally different when he drinks cow milk. Don't jump to conclusion that your joy in life is asthmatic just because the doctor says so .Doctor's are not always 100% right. Do your research and they will be a answer waiting for you not a "I think he has" answer. Your judgement can be just as important. THANK YOU goats for being just as delicious and helping my son to be correctly diagnose by doing research. 1 point for parents zero points for the medical field.

review/summary: Powdered milk versus evaporated
review/text: My wife and I have relied on Meyenberg for goat milk for many years, and though we normally buy it refrigerated, when in the US, we also purchase it in powdered form when traveling abroad, usually for several months out of the year. I was recently unable to purchase it in its powdered form from the Meyenberg supplier on Amazon, as it was out of stock, so I opted for the evaporated milk cans.  It's still very good, though for easy transportation powdered milk is hard to beat, as I find the evaporated milk a bit bulky and thus more expensive to ship abroad.  On the other hand, the drawback with powdered milk is, once it is opened, the milk powder becomes harder to dissolve the longer it is kept . . . that's the compromise.  Still, my wife and I are happy to have the option.

The goat's milk here is fed a kosher diet and the goats are not pumped up with antibiotics and hormones! This goat's milk is closest to mother's milk!!!

review/summary: try Goat's milk instead..
review/text: we moved to NY where we could not find fresh Goat's milk., so we ordered the canned milk to see how it would be. After trying it, I will now never return to the fresh. No need to. This is wonderful. I have it on blueberries every morning. It's like desert. A true treat.

review/summary: An alternative to cow's milk.
review/text: Since I am lactose intolerant, I have been looking for a substitute for cow's milk.  I often heard my parents talk about goat's milk so lately I decided to purchase some.  Well that is actually harder than imagined since a lot of stores don't carry it.  I finally did an internet search and voila, this is what I found and at an affordable price too.  I absolutely love it.  No stomach upsets, no gas, no bloating and I am like a kid again.  Drinking milk!!!!!!!!

review/summary: evaporated goat milk better than powdered
review/text: I used this product as a supplement for my dog and her puppies for almost 4 months. Its high fat and protein content is needed for her ability to produce milk and keep healthy, and their energy and growth. I preferred the evaporated in cans rather than reconstituting the powdered version.

review/text: This can be a life saver for your puppies. If you have puppies that need extra milk that the mother dog cannnot give or has too many puppies<br />to feed them all. Give this milk using a medicine dropper to puppies once every two hours or sooner if needed. This milk is most like the mother's<br />milk.  The puppies will live when given this milk. The puppy milk sold at pet stores are inferior.

review/summary: Only thing our son could eat
review/text: Before I go further, I have received the approval of our physician to use the goat milk formula and my son gets blood work every three months to make sure he is not deficient in anything.<br /><br />With that being said, I have been using the goat milk for my son since he was three months old due to my son's GI issues. When Neocate and Nutramigen AA were being forced on my son, he threw up constantly and stopped gaining weight. When we switched to a goat milk formula, he started gaining weight and has never been healthier. I attempted to use the powder and I found it to be hard to use because it doesn't dissolve in the water without clumping if the water isn't the right temperature and with the cans, it's just simpler. He goes through approximately a can a day and for us, the only place we can get the goat milk is online because our local stores have stopped carrying it. We wouldn't use the fresh goat milk that some stores carry because that goat milk doesn't have the added vitamin D and folic acid and since we have to add the supplements to the milk, that's just one less thing we have to worry about.<br /><br />I personally like getting the case of goat milk because it's much fresher than what we were getting in the store and we are able to have three cases delivered to our door.

review/text: This is a very good alternative for people who have difficulty digesting cow's milk, but keep it to mixing in your coffee or baking/cooking needs. Just like evaporated regular milk it is not really suitable to reconstitute and drink normally or use in cold cereal (it's great in oatmeal and cream of wheat though!). If you are looking for a drinkable version I recommend the powdered variety offered by the same company.

review/summary: bitter plain but fine when mixed with food
review/text: It's difficult to rate the taste of food because everyone has unique preferences. This milk has a bitter taste that I don't like, but it tastes fine when added to food. I add it to omelletes, cocoa, V8 (to make tomato soup), and oatmeal. It adds a rich, creamy taste to foods with no detectable bitterness.  I assume this milk is healthy and I called the company and was told that the goats graze in the fields for some time, so I guess this brand is more animal-freindly than most.<br /><br />EDITED: added one star because it tastes much better when added to foods

I was going to use it for her to drink in her bottle. I mixed the milk with equal parts water and put it in her bottle. She absolutely hated the taste!!  I tried adding liquid goats milk to the bottle, but she still did not take it. I do not recommend evaporated milk for drinking. The taste is not the same and actually made my daughter sick.

You can probably also use it for your hair. If the smell is too much, add a little rose water, lavender water, iris water (if you can find iris water), violet water, etc....

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: Who needs vitamins when you can have goat milk? The goat milk from amazon.com is fresh and has not set on some shelf for over long periods of time. When buying this brand of goat milk from retail out lets it often is on the shelf a long time and has had time for it to settle and get nasty inside the can and you end up having to dig it out of the can and remix it. With Amazon.com it is not that way. It is liquid of goat milk and is great tasteing and very good priced for what comes from Amazon.com compaired to the local stores you drive to. In fact if I sign up for the automic shipping of the product it is cheaper by more than a dollar per 12oz can to get from Amazon than to buy it at the local stores. I love the stuff and can not get enough of this product. It is not got the fat content that the cows milk has and it is just much better for all people. I sleep better and have wonderful dreams. I have lost weight just from drinking the first 12 cans I purchased and recieved around the 2nd of May 2012. It did not last long. I drank all 12 cans by the morning of the next day. However, all in all the health benifits I can feel and I believe people whom might have problems with dibetic issues should try a diet of goat milk. It is not the sugar content of the cows milk and contains better stuff for your health than cows milk. Thanks Meyenberg and Amazon! It also has caused me to have less anziety and seems to of improved my mental health and emotional health. All I am saying is, "May be you should try a diet of goat milk if you suffer from any kind of health problems" It is your call.

My son drinks this in place of cow's milk because he has a temporary lactose intolerance.  He doesn't mind the taste and it tastes OK to me, too.  Not too salty or sour as others have described.  I think the powder might have a slightly richer taste, but they are pretty comparable.  This is a good cow's milk alternative and it is nice that it is shelf stable.

review/summary: Very Salty!
review/text: I appreciate a few things about this milk, but the off-putting flavor of it overrides the benefits. The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the strong "evaporated milk" odor that you smell when you're using evap. milk from a cow. It's an unpleasant odor no matter the source. When I reconstituted the goat milk according to the directions (1 can milk to one can water) it tasted absolutely DREADFUL like a mouth full of thick, salty grossness. I tried diluting it with approximately 3 more cans of water, which seemed to cut the awful saltiness. What's left is a slight "barnyard" taste/smell with a little salt on the side. I imagine it might be alright if it's mixed in something, but it's certainly no substitute for the flavor of cow's milk. I would only use this product for cooking if I absolutely had to.

We had just about given up until we tried THIS.  The smell is stronger (similar to feta cheese), but the taste, when warmed up, reminds me of those little creamers in restaurants that come with coffee.  My daughter has been doing wonderfully on this.  She went from 4 oz. at a time of the formula to 8-9oz at a time of goat's milk.  We're very pleased.  Great quality, good shelf life, great taste (when warmed.  It's a little strong when it's room temp or from the fridge), and has all the same nutrients as regular milk!

I honestly thought these were going to taste like cardboard, but I was pleasantly surprised! They are very coconut-y, so if you love macaroons, you'll love these cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are slightly soft, but not chewy, and I don't feel deprived of "normal" cookies when I eat them. Best of all, my blood sugar doesn't go haywire after eating them! They use fructose rather than aspartame, so people who can't consume phenylalanine can eat these, unlike other low glycemic products.<br /><br />The serving size on the box is 4 cookies which is good because I usually feel like my sweet tooth is satisfied after just 2 cookies, and 4 cookies is a REAL treat!
