review/summary: Brilliant Bread Substitute!
review/text: I've been eating these for years now and they've been a convenient, versatile bread substitute for wraps of all kinds. I once tried Mission's version of low-carb, and found they were a poor imitation, full of extra chemicals and too "doughy" for my taste.<br /><br />The LTF tortillas are perfect and come in neat sizes and flavors. Made with oat fiber, they are not only tasty but very easy to digest compared to other types of tortillas made with the dreaded, gassy psyllium husk or (ick) acacia fiber (why would I be able to digest a tree?). These are soft and yummy and have really helped me feel full over the years will keeping my blood sugar level and helping to keep off 17 pounds of fat from my petite frame.<br /><br />Brilliant product and NO ONE makes them but LTF. Do not be fooled by imitations.

review/text: These things don't give you the "effect" that they are high is fiber. I really question how much fiber are in them. After purchasing them recently, me and mom felt bloated and like crap the next day. The culprit<br />I believe are these tortillas. Also one of the ingrediants is gluten. Not good. Really too good to be true.

review/summary: Lacking in flavor, whether eaten hot or cold
review/text: I bought these locally when there was a coupon attached to the front of the package. The nutrition label indicated that they are a healthy choice, so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />My experience with food products targeted toward healthy eaters tends to have two outcomes: they are good tasting and good for you, or they are merely good for you. These La Tortilla low-carb whole wheat tortillas fall in the latter camp. I suspect (based on personal experience, naturally) that when any bread product is reduced in carbohydrates this much and/or has such a high percentage of fiber (as in these tortillas), you end up with food that tastes somewhat like straw. I have bought a number of healthy cereals that had so little flavor as to make me feel like I was eating dead grass. I have also found some real winners at the healthy end of the cereal isle.<br /><br />And LOL at people who think that how many carbs you eat will determine whether or not you lose weight. There is only one method to lose weight: burn more calories than you eat, whatever the source of those calories. I mean, what next: low-carb pasta?<br /><br />I managed to go from 200 pounds to 135 pounds in the first six months of last year largely by keeping track of everything I eat. I used these two diet journals:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0963796836">DietMinder Personal Food & Fitness Journal (A Food and Exercise Diary)</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593596707">Diet & Fitness Journal: Your Personal Guide to Optimum Health (Diary, Exercise) (Little Black Journals)</a><br /><br />I have maintained my 135 pound weight for the past 9 months by paying attention to what and how much I eat and by regular exercise (mostly walking). And I certainly do not concern myself with *how many* carbohydrates I consume as opposed to how many calories they contain. No. But I do pay attention to *what kind* of carbohydrates I consume, preferring complex carbs and shunning sugars.<br /><br />For more on what is good to eat and what is not, you might read these books:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743223225">Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865477043">What to Eat</a><br /><br />More general information on healthy eating can be found in these books:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470041153">American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592574394">Complete Idiot's Guide to Total Nutrition, Fourth Edition</a><br /><br />P.S.--My favorite tortillas remain the Mission 96% fat-free medium soft-taco whole wheat tortillas. But of course they are *not* low-carb at all.

review/summary: Impossible to Find-Thank You for Having These Available
review/text: re:  Lifesaver Hawaiian Fruits Hard Candy 6.26 oz. bag<br /><br />My cousin mentioned how much she & her grandkids enjoyed these candies, but the candy was not available in any stores here locally.  My cousin is so helpful to me, taking me to dr's appointments, etc. and she will not accept anything in return, not even taking her out to lunch or dinner, gas money etc.  So when she mentioned not being able to find one of their favorite candies, I decided that I would take on the challenge.  I decided to surprise her with the candy.<br /><br />I searched quite a few of my trusted on-line sites for candies that may not be available locally.  All those sites had the candy listed as a product they normally carry, but they all listed the candy as out of stock.<br /><br />Finally I checked Amazon and they had the elusive Lifesaver Hawaiian Fruits Hard Candy.  My candy order arrived very quickly and in wonderful condition.  I really surprised my cousin when I told her that not only had I found the Hawaiian Fruits Lifesavers, but that I had a dozen bags (minimum amount required per order) for her.

review/summary: SPICY and flavorful
review/text: The 6 pack of bottles equals just over a pound of peppercorns so the price is on a par with Tellicherry peppercorns but we like this MUCH better.  The Malabar has a bolder flavor and a good, spicy heat to it.  I ground up almost one bottle's worth of the Malabar pepper and coated a beef brisket with it and some Kosher salt, then smoked it for 12 hours at 200 degrees over Black Walnut wood and this was the BEST brisket I ever remember making... and I've smoked down many a brisket in my 54 years!  If you don't use pepper as fast as I do, don't worry, it's six small bottles of pepper that are very well sealed.  Open one at a time and the others will remain perfectly fresh for many months, if not years.

review/summary: Good for dry skin
review/text: If you have dry skin, give this a try. A doctor recommended I try this when I complained of itchy skin due to dryness. It's definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps I used to use.<br /><br />As someone already mentioned, the packaging design is horrible. I used to keep almost empty bottles propped upside-down in my shower caddy, but then decided to use a pump bottle instead, which I refill.<br /><br />Dove -<br />If you're reading this, please redesign these bottles so that they are more user-friendly. In Japan, you sell liquid Dove soap in pump bottles, and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag, which are far more eco-friendly and less expensive. Please consider doing the same for the North American market.

review/text: I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please.

review/text: I'm a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs. Until I found this stuff, I was using various other body washes with my loofah. I always felt like I could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over. Since I started using this stuff (for a few years now), I haven't looked back. This stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah. It goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth. And it rinses off nice, without leaving my skin rough. It works well, has a nice subtle smell, and I won't use anything else.

review/summary: Thick body wash that lathers easily--sometimes I use it for bubble bath (Deep Moisture)
review/text: High quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. It has a very pleasant, flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. You only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. So even though the product is expensive, you will get a lot of use out of it. It seems that the cheaper, dollar a bottle kind I sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because I have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower.<br /><br />I would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday, "You always smell so good. What do you wear?" I wasn't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before I had done my morning routine and I had to run something over there to her. I told her that it must just be the body wash. If you have ever used Dove shampoo or conditioners, it is almost the same smell.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the cucumber/green tea kind when I run out of these 4 bottles. I would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt, mother, girlfriend, wife. I know many women who would never buy this Dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves, ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. I intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them.<br /><br />I also use this as bubble bath when I take a nice hot bath. Excellent product. A+ from me.

review/text: yes, i have bought this before. i like the smell and detest the bottle design. i do agree with one of the reviewers that the Dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in Asian countries and sell the refills for them as well. i would like it if they have that... but i must make due with what i CAN get at this point in time.<br /><br />i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming. it takes almost an hour to take a shower.<br />so i'm on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routine.<br /><br />like i said before, i have bought this product in Walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale. i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky. the scent is pleasant. not over powering at all. light.<br /><br />i don't buy lotion, they're often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin. i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i don't like the way i feel after putting on lotion, so i buy dove body wash, deep moisture. i get clean, moisturized and don't feel greasy after i get out the shower.<br /><br />**EdIt!**<br /><br />i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem, buy or find one lying around the house, a soap pump for hand soap.<br />i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product, their product is thick. i've read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what not.<br /><br />if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the Dove soap, and use in the shower, if you can find a 24 oz bottle (maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out,) they're 25oz, big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this. (25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle...

I was eating a handful of whole caraway seeds daily, behind every meal, for almost a month and the stomach issues that I were having prior to the seeds, still exists. I did discover that these seeds are great for bad breath.

review/summary: Excellent product at a good price
review/text: I am an avid bread baker and Caraway Seeds at the supermarkets are either non-existent or being sold in tiny amounts like spices at high prices. Used to be able to buy it in larger packages in some special stores but even that has disappeared by now.<br /><br />The amount Amazon sells is huge for occasional rye bread baking but the price is very reasonable.<br /><br />It will last for a long time.

review/text: Bought these to make some Sauerkraut and rye bread. I love the taste of these seeds and they were fresh. It came in 3 packs of 16oz, which I will probably never get through all three packs so I gave one to my sister and to my mom. For the price it was a great deal as I doubt I will have to buy seeds for a while.<br /><br />Smells great, tastes great, just an overall quality product.

review/text: The caraway seeds are a really good value. I did encounter a problem with the time it took for the order to arrive. I bake for a farmers market and was depending on receiving the seeds on the date that I was given. Apparently there was a problem with the bags and had they just let me know I would have not kept expecting them. I finally contacted Amazon concerning my order and was then advised of the delay. I would order these caraway seeds again as they are fresh and well packed to stay that way.I hope I never have to resort to buying them in the grocery store again.

review/summary: Good seeds
review/text: Haven't tried to grow them, but they taste great in my rye bread. I went here looking because the last caraway seeds I bought at my local market had a nasty taste for some reason. 3 pounds are a lot of caraway seeds, however I'm baking a loaf of rye bread around every 5 days now, using about 1/3 ounce each times. Let's see, this order should last me 2 years at that rate!<br /><br />Hey, I may as well share my rye bread recipe, which works wonderfully in my Breadman Ultimate Plus TR2500BC bread machine. I measure by weight whenever possible instead of volume measurements. It's so easy:<br /><br />0.6 oz olive oil<br />4.95 oz. rye flour (been using the organic from Berkeley Bowl, currently $0.99/lb)<br />7.15 oz whole wheat flour<br />0.24 oz salt<br />0.6 oz sugar<br />0.66 oz non fat dry milk powder<br />0.3 oz caraway seeds<br />0.55 oz wheat gluten<br />0.12 oz active dry yeast (can vary depending on the potency of your yeast)<br />14 oz. water<br />1 teaspoon molassas<br />7.9 oz bread flour<br /><br />Put the 14 oz water in microwave and heat 15-40 seconds depending on initial temperature, leave in microwave. Add oil to pan. To separate weighing container (plastic quart container), add the other ingredients except the last 3. Stir a little, then pour water in pan, the molassas, then the dry ingredients in the quart container, then measure the white flour and add, place pan in machine.<br /><br />First cycle in the Breadman, large white, says 3:10. Set timer to 1:27. That goes off about 2 minutes before the Rise 3 cycle starts, and when that happens press Pause for a few seconds and the machine pauses. Remove pan and using spatula to push dough aside, remove the paddle, position the loaf in the center of the pan somewhat (don't push flat!), replace in machine and press Start. Set timer to 1:42. This will go off 2-3 minutes after the Bake cycle ends, twist the spindle on bottom of pan a few times, and the loaf will remove easily from pan. Rest loaf on side on wire rack for preferably at least 6 hours, 8 is better. Slice with very sharp knife and store in plastic bag in refrigerator.

review/text: I totally dig this Lime & Salt popcorn from Orville Redenbacher: I picked it up to try on a whim (hey, I like Chipotle's use of lime & salt), and this stuff is fantastic!  First, the smell is great and the flavor lives up to it: I would honestly like it a little stronger, but I'd say it's just right for the average lime & salt lover: delicious!  Second, it's mini bags/snack size: perfect when you're craving just a bit of popcorn, a bit of salt, or a bit of a snack...perfect!  And third, the nutritional value is good: 100 calories, 11g fat, 19g carbs and 3g protein...yum!<br /><br />Yum...I don't get sick of it either: this is a great snack for someone who wants a bit of flavor in their snack, to help them pass up on the snack that's really unhealthy...this does that: I eat this instead, and it totally satisfies, I would highly recommend Orville Redenbacher's Natural Salt & Lime Microwave popcorn!

review/summary: Love love love this lime popcorn
review/text: Target carried this for a while but recently discontinued - I guess people are put off by the "lime" idea but this popcorn is simply delicious. I can't eat most micro popcorn due to the dairy ingredients and love this - it smells so wonderful when popping and the lime flavor is very very delicate.  If you're not sure how it could taste good, take a look at the ingredient label on a bag of corn tortillas or tortilla chips and you will see "lime" listed because lime and corn go together beautifully.  Also, just as an aside, a great way to eat corn on the cob is with a little fresh lime squeezed on it, and then used Lawry's seasoned salt. no butter needed at all. Makes it very low-cal as well.  So happy to find this item on Amazon today and I'm ordering the case.

Unfortunately, when I bought this item on Amazon, it did not have the same tanginess as the item from the grocery store. It actually tasted buttery.  The packaging looks the same and the item has not expired, so I'm at a loss for why it is not as tangy.

review/text: I'm a runner who, until recently, used gel packs for my fuel during half and full marathon training. I discovered chews, which were better than the gels but lacked decent taste.<br /><br />My buddy introduced me to Honey Stingers and I've been buying them by the box here on Amazon since. I'll usually start my runs with a Gatorade prime juice pack and start sucking/chewing on these around the five mile mark. I tend to eat 1-2 per mile so I get the benefit of sustained energy. It also does quite a bit to occupy the time.<br /><br />These things are delicious and seem to have the right melting point that allows them to be really juicy and hold off dry mouth during a run. I've used plenty of other brands, but love the Orange flavor of these. For the price, buy a box and give them a try. It'll be worth it.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please recommend it. Thanks!

review/summary: Good, but needs a few improvements
review/text: I tried the Honey Stinger Orange Blossom Energy chews while training for my first marathon.  I had tried energy gels first but didn't like them because the packaging always cut my lips, I could never eat the whole package at one time, and they always caused a sticky mess.  The energy chews tasted better and were less messy.  They were still a little sticky, but manageable.  The energy gels gave me a much more noticeable boost in energy, though.  I also disliked the packaging of the Honey Stinger chews because it was too difficult to open while running.  The top of the bag is too thick and the force needed to tear it open would cause the rest of the bag to tear and make the chews explode out of the bag.  I ended up just cutting open the bag beforehand and putting the chews in a Ziploc bag.  I got the Clif Shot Blok chews at the marathon expo and thought they tasted slightly better.  All of the chews and gels I have looked at have been overpriced.

review/summary: Good product - Purchase locally for freshness!
review/text: My husband and I are runners and have tried many "energy booster" nutritional products.  This one (orange) is my husband's favorite for taste and consistency. (It is WAY too sweet for me.  I prefer the cherry flavor.)  We can highly recommend the product itself.  However, while we are loyal Amazon.com shoppers (too loyal! LOL), do not purchase this product here.  We ordered two cases in anticipation of a heavy race season and they arrived REEKING of cigarette smoke.  The smell was nauseating.  As it was an edible item, it is not eligible for return so into the garbage it went.  Buy locally.

review/text: I have ordered from OS in the past and recieved fantastic meat. This shipment has been dissapointing so far...The Fillet's were small (my own fault when ordering) and one of them was riddled with so much fat, I broke it down and fed it to my lab-she was impressed. I recall ordering from OS years ago, receiving fabulous fillets that could be easily cut with a fork-this was not the case. For the price, I will likely have better luck requesting special cuts from the local supr market.

review/summary: Fantastic and worth every penny!
review/text: I received a Christmas gift coupon to Amazon, and decided to splurge on The Fantastic Feast. Everything in it was beyond expectations.  The hot dogs were the best we have ever had. They are HUGE!  So tasty too.  The stuffed sole was better than restaurant fare.  Great juicy beefy burgers.  I wasn't expecting much of the chicken breasts, I figured boneless chicken breast is boneless chicken breast... but they were unbelievably moist and delicious.  The center cut pork chops were flavorful and juicy!  Of course the sirloin steaks were wonderful as well, and the potatoes were a quick and delicious side.  So much in that magical cooler!  The quality of Omaha Steak products is truly exceptional.  I would not hesitate to purchase one of the combo packs again.  My only negative is that the shipping prices are high. I was actually ordering 8 hot dogs earlier today for 9.99 and they wanted 14.99 for shipping!  I decided against that purchase... Money is tight, and lower shipping costs would help us all out!  Fortunately for me there is a retail store nearby my home, which I plan on visiting soon!

review/summary: so disappointed ~ will not order Omaha steaks again
review/text: I finally decided to order a variety package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought "Ohama Steaks" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back "just to see" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it.<br /><br />I would have left this review on their website but, oh my, I couldn't find a page to do that on their website. I wonder why??

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I don't drink flavored coffees that often---hot or iced. I usually find the flavor is over-powering or not quite right. But this makes a pretty good iced coffee, with just the right amount of French Vanilla. However, with just one K-cup, you're not going to be able to make one of those giant cups you might be used to buying. I would brew this at the 6 or 8oz setting, anything more and it's going to be too weak. A legit question is whether the Keurig iced coffee cups make a difference over using just regular K-cups. I think they do. I've tried making iced using regular K-cups. Way too weak.<br /><br />A couple of things to try as you experiment with making a good iced coffee: 1)I lower the temperature setting on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System</a>. It's only a few degrees, but it seems to help. 2)I'll brew over ice, and then refill with ice. 3)I sometimes go crazy and actually use 2 K-cups for my large iced coffee fix. A lot cheaper than the $2 at the counter or drive-thru!

I have played around with them to get the perfect cup of iced coffee and I have found it comes out well if you fill your tumbler to the top with ice, add creamer, and then brew. I have used both the 6oz and the 8oz brew options, and I believe the 8oz comes out better. Overall, I believe these K Cups are great and the best option for iced coffee from a Keurig machine.

review/text: I had been buying French Vanilla Iced Coffee K-Cups for about 2 months now, and was completely addicted. A nice amount of cream and equal or splenda would spark this baby right up into a cold coffee nearly as good- possibly better than a cold bottle of Starbucks iced coffee.<br /><br />However, I was spending just a few dollars more for these K-cups in comparison to regular hot brew K-Cups... and then it dawned on me.<br /><br />DUH!<br /><br />Why not brew regular hot brew cups instead, and just add ice and cream as I would to these?<br /><br />Well, that idea saved me some money and worked just as spectacularly as the ice brew K-cups did.<br /><br />All in all, these are good, don't get me wrong, but you can do the exact same thing to ANY flavor of K-Cup coffee's, with the same results.

My suggestion, lots of ice and use the small brewing size--that leaves me with enough ice that it stays chilly for a while.<br /><br />If you like, leave room for a splash of milk and some sugar, maybe a little caramel, and voila, homemade frappuccino knockoff on the cheap.

review/text: I like this salt with its color, and medium sized crunch. However, after tasting it in the 7 seas sampler pack, I thought I remembered it to be a bit more flavorful, which this is not. It does have great visual appeal, and taste, just not that "winey" taste I thought I remembered. That said, the sampler pack has alot of different salts, so maybe I was confused.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I like all the Hodgson Mill products I have used but I never had couscous, Hodgson Mill or any other brand.  I wanted to start to eat healthier so when I saw this was whole wheat and and on subscribe and save I ordered it. I thought I would give it a try.  If I hated it I could always add it to home baked goods. Well I love it. I sauted an onion and added some beef broth and 5 minutes later it was done.  It was a side dish tonight but it would make a nice lunch. I am happy I purchased this.

review/summary: Great couscous at a good price
review/text: This whole wheat couscous is excellent. I'm not going to say it tastes just the same as regular couscous, but it certainly tastes no worse, and not even very different. I am tempted to say it's healthier than regular couscous, but since I use butter in the couscous I'm not going to pretend that it is an absolutely healthy product. Still, it's better than a lot of other processed carbs, and butter in moderate amounts is just fine as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />This is quite a bit of couscous, however. I'd say go down to your local store and just pick up one or two boxes of whatever's on the shelf, if you don't think you'll be able to use 8 boxes in a reasonable period of time. That's the main downside here, but I'm good with 8 boxes.<br /><br />I did a lot of shopping around for couscous and I found this to be one of the best in terms of price performance -- a quality product in a whole wheat version, packaged and delivered at a good cost. Recommended!

review/summary: Quick, easy, healthy, and GOOD!
review/text: I've tried a few brands of whole wheat couscous in the past year after finding out how much healthier it is than regular couscous.  Most of the other brands that I've tried have had the worst texture.  Either they were mush or they were a giant blob.  When prepared according to package instructions, this brand cooks up light & fluffy.  It's also insanely easy to make...boil water & a bit of olive oil, add couscous, turn off flame, let sit for 5 minutes, fluff & eat.  It's a great substitute as rice, or a great side dish on its own.
