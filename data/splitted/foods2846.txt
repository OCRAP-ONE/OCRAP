review/summary: Love this pancake mix!
review/text: I eat a lot of pancakes and for health reasons wanted to start using a wheat blend. Tried a few and Hungry Jack is my fav. I typically use a little less water than they recommend as I like my pancakes thick. Also, they recommend leaving the mixed batter to sit for 3 minutes before cooking. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT as it gives the flour time to rise and creates that light pancake feel that you want. I recommend this to anyone looking for healthier pancakes.

review/summary: Chewy, rubbery dough
review/text: I usually buy Aunt Jemima, but I was craving Pancakes and the store didn't have AJ, so I bought a box of Hungry Jack. Never again. When cooked the pancakes were like I mixed water and flour; they were very chewy and unlike any pancake I've ever had or made.

review/summary: A disaster
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be good & even though I followed the instructions, it was horrible. The brownie mix seemed really dry that I added extra water in hopes off saving it & that didn't work. The cookie mix was looked like clumpy bread crumbs instead of cookie dough. By the this I thought of throwing everything away but my bf was insistent. I greased the pan for the brownie bars & there wasn't enough brownie mix to cover the entire pan & that's considering we used a really small pan! The cookie mix was difficult to place because it was dry and crumb like. After I took it out of the oven it was really hard to take off the pan. I had to really use force with a spatula to take it off. The edible parts tasted ok, the cookie mix didn't really taste like cookies and the brownie mix didn't really taste like brownies, both kinda plain. In the end it wasn't worth the hassel and it was just a complete fail.

review/summary: Complete Trainwreck - Threw out Pans
review/text: I love to bake, and I love Nestle Tollhouse, so this would be a great treat for bakesales or roadtrips, right?  NO.  I followed the instructions to make the muffin cup style.  As I was mixing the two batters, the brownie batter came out as dry and hard as paste.  I tried adding a little more water to at least make it mixable, but I still had to scrape it off the spatula and press it down into the muffin cups.<br /><br />The cookie mix - well the instructions said it would be dry & crumbly at one point, but mine never progressed off of dry & crumbly.  Since both the brownie & cookie batters were so dry, I figured that this must be intentional, and that somehow it would magically resolve itself via baking.<br /><br />The muffin pans were thoroughly greased with shortening (not spray), and the "brownie blob with chocolate chip streusel topping" went into the oven.<br /><br />When they came out, they looked great, but they were not coming out of the cups.  I tried loosening them with my trusty loosening spoon, then a butter knife, but they were permanently adhered to the pans (even after leaving them overnight in sheer desperation).<br /><br />The pieces I managed to pry out of the pans just didn't taste good, either.  I had such high hopes for this product, but ended up having to chuck the pans into the trash and buy new ones.  It's a great concept, and I may try to come up with my own version using regular brownie mix and "I measured & mixed it myself" Toll House cookie dough.  What a bummer.

Normally, I prefer the "real deal", but after trying one of these I think I found a new addition to my favorite sweets. If you read my review on Pillsbury Surgar-Free Bownie Mix, you will see that I'm not always so open-minded to foods that use subsitutes (in case you're wondering, I gave those a 4 star rating).

review/text: As every chocolate, this is high in fat and saturated fat. I'm a choco-holic and can't live w/out eating chocolate every day, and since I can't control myself, I ordered these. The taste is really good. If I didn't know it was made with Splenda, I wouldn't have guessed it's made with sugar substitude. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the high price and high saturated fat. But after all, better than eating regular milk chocolate!

review/text: I bought these directly from Russell Stover since the shipping cost of two packs was the same as one pack and made them a little less expensive.  All four flavors are quite good-tasting though obviously not as good as the premium brands.  I am not diabetic but wanted a low calorie sweet.  These have about half the calories of regular chocolates.  Here is an approximate breakdown for one piece of candy:<br /><br />  Toffee  0.5 oz.  70 calories<br />  Pecan  0.6 oz.  80 calories<br />  Mint  0.5 oz.  60 calories<br />  Coconut  0.5 oz.  55 calories

review/summary: Better than I'd imagined
review/text: Were you one of the inventors of the Double Stuf--you know; people who unscrewed their Oreos then combined two? Has sugar become a no-no since those days? Then you might LOVE these Sugar Free Oreos. The chocolate cookie part is just as crunchy as the original recipe and really tastes like an Oreo. The cream center is lighter than an Oreo, feeling like it's a little more whipped. (I resisted the urge to eat it first as I'm no longer a kid... but I was tempted.) It doesn't coat the roof of your mouth with a heavy, oily texture of some cheap cookies. The consistency is still firm and very Oreo-like. The frosting is somewhere between the thickness of the original Oreo and a Double Stuf. They even soak up milk in the same "not really; but yeah, enough!" way as an original Oreo. Wow--is it great! There are 18 cookies in the box. (Don't you hate guessing what you'll get by weight? Now you know.)<br /><br />The bad news: it's still not health food... but you knew that, too (and the package reminds you of this all over it). There's 90 calories in two cookies (and they're approximately the same diameter as the original Oreo), 17g of carbs (1 "carb choice"; 8 in the sugar alcohol of malitol) and 5g of fat. If you're not familiar with the intestinal gasiness and possible laxative effects of malitol--this would have to be your first sugar free goodie, most likely--look it up online. Over eating these WILL have that effect. Three are my limit and have little such effect.

review/summary: Better Earl Grey (Decaf) than Bigelow
review/text: I compared the reviews for all of the Earl Grey teas on Amazon, and the reviews said Bigelow (Decaf) was better than Twinings and Stash, so I purchased it.  I also purchased Choice Organic (Decaf) at the same time.<br /><br />I have been comparing the two, and I find that Choice Organic is actually stronger per bag and tastes better.  Even though it is in bags, it almost is as good as loose leaf.  It is a little higher in price, but it seems like it is good quality.  They must've changed the formula since skacleve's review in 2009 below, though not sure.

Bigelow's is better.<br /><br />Addendum: After a few months of trying four boxes of this tea, we decided its flavor is inferior to Bigelow's Earl Grey Decaf.  Not only is it a bit weaker, but too floral, in a perfumy way.  We won't be buying it again.

We used to be able to get it in any grocery store, but gradually the tea became harder to find, and currently, it's only available on line.  This tea is full-bodied, fragrant, light, lemony, but not "herby, or grassy or with hay overtones".  I drink it day and night, summer and winter, hot or cold, with no additional sweeteners.  It's perfect the way it is.

review/summary: Ugh.
review/text: I went to Publix earlier today and bought this dressing. Let me start by saying this is absolutely NOT Caesar dressing, at least not by any standard I'm familiar with. There is no flavor here whatsoever, no anchovy, no parmesan cheese, no black pepper, barely any garlic. There is no tanginess either.  The only discernable flavor is that of cheap vegetable oil and bad egg. It tastes as if someone took generic mayonnaise, watered it down, and then added more oil to it. It really is that bad! I have never reviewed anything on here before (although I come here often for good advice), but this dressing was SO AWFUL ,I felt compelled to share my story. You  would be far better off buying any store brand for half the price. Incidentally, we threw the entire salad out, and went back to the store to buy the ingredients to make a new one.

review/text: I've been purchasing this brand for years in Grocery stores... but it's getting hard to find (can sometimes be found at Wal-Mxxt.  I ordered the case - no differant than grocery.<br /><br />However, this does have a short expiration date - so if you don't plan to eat Caesar Salad Frequently, a case may not be the way to go for you.

review/summary: dressing
review/text: I am very picky about salad dressing.  It is few and far between that I find a dressing that I like.  I must say I could eat this dressing by itself! It is that good.  In the past I have resorted to making my own dressing, as I am that picky.  Another plus is this dressing has no sugar in it.  Buying this at the store is EXPENSIVE!!!  My store sells it for $5+ a botte, so finding it here at this price was awesome.

review/summary: Tastes like egg salad
review/text: I love Caesar salads. So when my favorite dressing (Marzetti's refridgerated Caesar vinaigrette) was no longer carried by my local grocery stores, I purchased every bottle of Caesar dressing I could find in order to replace it. I had hoped that because both Cardini and Marzetti are manufactured by the same company that I would be in luck. I did eventually find another I liked, but this one came nowhere near.<br /><br />It tastes like egg salad. Seriously. Just to be sure, I went and tasted it again right before this review. Yup. Egg salad. Which is great for when I want to make egg salad (seasoning in a bottle without having to mess around with mayo and such), but I couldn't eat this on a salad. No way. No how.<br /><br />For a creamy dressing, I actually ended up liking Newman's Own the best. For a vinaigrette (no, it's not traditional but saves on a ton of fat and calories), Girard's Light Ceasar (also made by the same as Cardini's) won out.

review/summary: Beware--the beans are not whole beans!!!
review/text: I ordered this item as it was described "Whole Bean".  My 3 bags came each were in a vacuum sealed foil coffee bag with "Whole Bean" printed on the label.  However, over the "Whole Bean" wording, there was a transparent sticker that said, "Drip Ground".  I found this coffee at King Soopers when I was visiting CO in June, and wanted to keep drinking it at home in my own French Press.  I grind my coffee fresh immediately before I make it.  The coffee is the Nordic Blend, just not whole bean as described.  I contacted Customer service and they were lovely about refunding me (they don't accept returns on food items) and are looking into seeing if this was an error/inventory mistake.  I hope I am able to order this coffee in it's whole bean form in the near future!

review/text: We repeatedly tried Muesli # 11 but it smelled (and tasted) rancid. In response to our complaint, the US distributor confirmed that the smell is due to a problem with an unrefined sunflower oil that was used when toasting: Quote "Now there should not be anything you smell upon opening a bag of the muesli. If you tasted it, even with the smell, you would see<br />that nothing tasted wrong, old or rancid. It was only the smell." Unquote. Buy it if you don't care about the smell (or taste). We won't anymore.

review/summary: Great Kit for the price point
review/text: I bought this kit along with a Cab Style back in October. I bottled them January 2, 2010. So far the wine is aging nicely. It has started smoothing out considerably. With a couple of more months of aging I expect it to be a very drinkable wine. Considering that it is $40-50 less than other kits I have made, it holds up well against those kits. I bought this one not only for the price point, but also because it is one of the only Dolcetto kits available.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that no oak was included in this and the Cab kit.<br /><br />All-in-all, one will not be disappointed with the results, and a little tinkering may make it even better.<br /><br />Update 12/20/2011: I have subsequently made another Dolcetto, this time adding oak chips for a week after stabilizing and fining. This has really added some body to the wine and has improved the finished product immensely.

review/summary: GREAT STUFF!!
review/text: The D'Amore Frappacino mix is great for those cool coffee flavored drinks that are now so popular. I have been using this product for about a year and have tried making the drinks without it. Not the same. This mix gives the iced mocha drinks a very distinctive and delicious flavor that can't be had without it. As for the price, I believe it to be way too high. Especially considering that the cans are not full (settling during transport I'm sure is part of the reason for that) plus the fact that it does not last long when the drinks are made as often as I make them. I can get this same product in the same size cans for much less at a warehouse market. I will probably order again, though, since I don't have easy access to a warehouse market but I won't buy as often as I would like to. Would be great to get some kind of a deal for repeat orders.

review/summary: Just Like Home-Baked!
review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tasted one of these cookies!  They were soft and tasty--much like my home-baked peanut butter cookies--only better since I tend to over-bake mine!<br /><br />I have many allergies so it's difficult for me to find pre-made cookies I can safely eat.  Barley and corn starch, which I am very allergic to, find their way masked in many ingredients for pre-made food products.  I was very glad to find the ingredients in these cookies are safe for me:  Peanut Butter;  Molasses; Eggs; Rice Syrup and Grape Juice; Flour Base (Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Sweet Rice Flour, Xanthum Gum); Dry Roasted Peanut Pieces; Gluten-free Natural Flavor, Baking Soda; Sea Salt. This means they are gluten-free as well.<br /><br />With only 11g of carbohydrates, 7 g of sugar, and 3 g of protein, I can indulge with 2 for a mid-day snack without the guilt!<br /><br />If you are too busy to make home-baked cookies yourself, these are certainly a viable alternative...and they're quite healthy, too!  Highly recommended!

review/text: These cookies were awesome until early spring 2009.  As of right now they no longer have a fresh baked oven crispness which melts in your mouth and the espresso flavor is lacking.  I keep trying out different box dates and unfortunately they are not like the original receipe.  Being an ex-addict of these cookies right now, which might be a good thing, I'm so disappointed that they aren't like the original cookies. I'll keep watching the boxes to see if they have the old look again one day.

review/text: This cookie has a wonderful taste and an aroma of fresh coffee. It had a nice amount of espresso flavored chocolate chunks. The cookie was smaller and the box was smaller than the Pamela's Chocolate Chip Cookies I buy in the supermarket. I had no problem with that. They were not mealy or crumbly. They were hard. I had to break them with a sharp knife point in a small dish, but that makes them a good dunking cookie, if you like that style of cookie eating. My supermarket does not carry the espresso cookie anymore so I was delighted to see them available on Amazon. I plan to order more right now.

review/summary: The best of the energy chews!
review/text: I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones.

They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars.

review/summary: Good substitute for candy but Sharkies are healthier
review/text: These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.<br />Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a "sugar crash". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.

review/summary: Most awesome tasting Energy Chews we have found!
review/text: We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!

review/summary: Skip this if you don't want to Bonk!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Stinger products. However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water. Conceivably, this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert (Moab, Fruita). It is my guess that these are not intended for exercising. Maybe, people just use them at work to keep from eating Starburst or something less healthy?!

review/text: Heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast.  An avid hiker, I have used other energy gels with limited success.  Taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb, they provide the extra boost you need.  The chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy.  Highly recommended.

review/text: These taste great!  And it's true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth.  However, as an energy boost for running, they don't do a thing for me.  In fact, they actually cause a stitch.  So I just eat them whenever I feel I need a sugary 'fix'.

When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run.

review/summary: Great for Marathon Training
review/text: I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy.

review/summary: Great tasting with help keeping energy up.
review/text: I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.

I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-)

review/summary: Honey Stingers....the perfect natural energy
review/text: These are the most awesome little energy snack possible!  Brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time...along with a box of Sharkies. Prior to this, Sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement.  Have to say, even the Sharkies fan in the group had to admit Honey Stingers fairly surpassed Sharkies in both taste and performance.  Will still probably bring both next time for variety, but definitely twice as many Honey Stingers.  Honey IS the perfect food!

review/summary: Obey Training Treats
review/text: These training treats are good, but there are some problems that I noticed with them.<br /><br />I have a pitbull, and 8 pitbull puppies, so I thought I'd give these a shot. I know it says, "puppy" but I figured they could all share. The box claims that they are non-greasy and non-crumbly, which is true to a point.<br /><br />The problem that I have with these is that it is too hard for my pitbull. (Who would've thought?!? :)) I tried some new tricks on her (the adult) with the clicker and she did really well, but it took her a good minute+ to eat the treat because they are so darn hard. I am more of a quick paced trainer, and waiting two minutes inbetween reps is a bit too long and the dog loses interest. I think after the first two she liked them okay.<br /><br />The puppies aren't old enough to start training (two weeks), but I can't imagine using these on them. If my adult is having trouble, I know it would be a lost cause on the puppies.<br /><br />So far, the best training treat I have ever used is those pupperoni sticks that break into segments. You can buy them anywhere they sell pet stuff. They are chewy and quick to train with.<br /><br />Dog kinda likes them, but I won't buy again. I'm not paying this price for training treats that aren't really effective as training treats.

They are a really tasty, low calorie, healthy little snack to have and can keep you from binging on the first unhealthy fattening thing you see when all you need is a taste of something.<br /><br />I'm a sushi eater and I really love Wasabi. The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 star rating is that this particular variety is "wasabi flavored". When I read carefully it looks like they use "mustard" and flavorings to immitate wasabi. If you like wasabi you might want the real stuff!

We felt that we would get a unique flavor over the single corn style. We are very pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the blend. It is not too spicy and yet not too mild. It has just the right blend. We are very satisfied.

review/text: I am not a fan of pepper, never have been.  Salt has run my life for many years and in some ways still does, however given that my family has a history of maladies, I decided to get a little better with my diet, starting with the additives I put in my foods.  The first thing I looked at was trying alternatives to plain salt as I knew it wasn't doing my body any good, but plain pepper just doesn't do it for me.  This pepper was highly recommended by a number of people, and grinding one's own pepper into a fine blend was the recommended method of spicing one's food.<br /><br />I use it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LLOE8K">Cuisinart SP-2 Stainless Steel Rechargeable Salt and Pepper Mills</a> (which have issues - see my review on that), and set to fine, the pepper has a unique taste to it, far superior to black pepper.  IT's hard to describe, but it just tastes like a sweet peppery...something.  Not too strong, but enough to give you that different flavor you might crave.<br /><br />Recommended if you're a fan of grinding your own pepper or you just want to try something new.
