review/summary: Good value - even with price hike
review/text: Our cat absolutely loves this stuff, and it seldom has a sale price in stores.  Definitely a great Amazon buy if you subscribe, but I hope there are no more price hikes.  By the way, we always have dry food down for our cat and this serves as a late-afternoon treat.  He usually starts asking for it mid-afternoon.  Heaven in a pouch.

review/text: I'm sure this food tastes very good (although I've never tasted it myself) because it's the only wet catfood that I know of that my cat will eat. He's a very picky eater and I'm glad to have him on this food... What's nice is when you subscribe on Amazon with the free shipping it comes out to a couple bucks less per box than at my local grocery store.

review/summary: My  cat loves this value
review/text: My cat loves this cat food. He comes to me when his bowl is empty and meows, which is what I call yelling, or he taps my leg or head with his paw then runs to sit in front of his bowl. Once the food is there he eats all the liquid or what I call gravy then finishes the rest over time. He eats early AM lunch and dinner and late PM. This 48 pack is a very good value since at my store it's about $24 for the same thing. The biggest plus is it's usually two days after I get an email it's shipped that it's at my door. No lugging home bags loaded with 12 packs. So my cat is a happy customer.

review/text: I have two cats, and they both LOVE this food. After trying several different brands, including other types of Whiskas, I am glad to have found one that they really enjoy.<br /><br />The packets are the perfect size for two small cats to share. They can be a bit messy, but by the end of the box I was able to divide the packets evenly without using a spoon or making a mess.<br /><br />For less than $.60 a packet, it's also very affordable.

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: Pros:<br />-  Packaging keeps portions noticeably fresher than cans.<br />-  Portions are (for my cats) ideal servings.  They are not large cats, but not kittens either.  Each pack seems to be just the right amount.  I no longer have opened, half full, cans of food sitting around that sometimes go to waste.<br />-  Dispensing into the bowl is a much more clean process than with cans.<br />-  Variety of flavors in each box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  Despite the Pros, I had to give it 3 stars because both of my cats (and a catfood eating dog, don't ask) will only eat the pouches that contain tuna.  That means 1/2 of the pouches seem to end up going to waste. I can remedy this by purchasing differently, but felt it was important since 3/3 pets agreed at my house.<br />-  If your cat is large, the portions will most likely be too small.<br /><br />Tip: Shake the pouch by holding it at the top before opening the top.  This pushes all of the juice down to the bottom of the pouch.  There is a chance when you rip it open that you'll get catfood juice on your hands if you don't.

review/summary: The Truth, According to CSI:Snapple
review/text: I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing.<br /><br />The ad wags at Snapple tell us their tea is 'made from the best stuff on Earth'. Fair enough. But saying so is one thing. Subjecting a sample of their beverage to rigorous scientific scrutiny using an industrial mass spectrometer, it turns out, is something else entirely.<br /><br />I called in a favor from a friend who works at a molecular testing laboratory, and we got to the bottom of Snapple is indeed made of. Apparently, the component analysis identified compounds consistent with natural substances -- like those in tea leaves and peaches, for instance.<br /><br />However, the analysis did not find ANY discernible traces -- at parts-per-billion sensitivity levels, mind you  -- of Cuban Cohiba cigars, Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool, or the dancing outfit Salma Hayek wore in From Dusk Till Dawn.<br /><br />So it's clear -- nay, it's scientific *fact* -- that Snapple is NOT made from 'the best stuff on Earth'. But for tea -- sure, it's pretty tasty.

review/summary: Awesome with extra awesome sauce!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended. A 6-pack of Ramune will run you about $6.99 to $7.99 in most Asian markets.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/summary: Slowly Smoked Pork is Delicious
review/text: I buy Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin regularly at our local Hungarian grocer, and have found it delicious. It serves well as a quick snack, or as a sandwich fixing (with a little mustard or light BBQ sauce).<br /><br />Imagine the aroma of a nearby campfire, after pork has lingered on the grill, but not burnt. Somehow, that flavor, through careful smoking and salting, is infused into the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />I prefer it in thin slices, eaten cool, but it is also an ingredient in various Hungarian soups. It goes well in a kind of pigs-in-a-blanket crescent roll wrap. Take an uncooked crescent roll, place a thin slice of the karaj, and bake as usual. Very fun for parties -- something different in the midst of something familiar. We serve it guests when we need a quick, tasty snack.<br /><br />It isn't spicy even though it is packed with taste. Fans of BBQ joints and smokehouse steakhouses with find the flavor familiar.<br /><br />It keeps around six months unopened. I fully recommend the Karaj Hungarian Pork Loin.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

review/summary: Amazing Pepitos!!
review/text: When I was a kid, you could go into a drugstore and sit and get fountain cokes and floats.  Aboslutely one of my favorite memories as a child, was to get a bag of my pepitos (it was about $.25 for bag--and my sister and I got a quarter each) and they were fresh roasted.  Then we would go see a movie--the theater was on the other side of the drugstore.  Yes, over the years I have tried others types and brands only to be very disappointed.  THESE ARE PERFECT!  As the other review said, not too salty, just absolutely right.  My husband as already confiscated 2 of the 4 bags from me--he loves them too--so I am having to order more!! LOVE THEM!!

review/text: This is tough to pick a rating. The seeds deserve a four-star rating. I have been buying them elsewhere for a while, but Amazon's price is very good, so wanted to try them.<br /><br />For my taste, they are a bit too salty, but the flavor is fine as is the consistency of the seeds.<br /><br />The shipping deserves a one-star or less. I have bought hundreds of items from Amazon for years, and this is positively the worst shipping time I have ever encountered.<br /><br />From the day I ordered it until they finally came, it was 16 days. They did not ship for a week. I told a friend about these, and he ordered two days after I did and got them several days before I received mine.<br /><br />I emailed Amazon about this, as their customer service is usually excellent, but all I got was some canned response that with the Super Saver free shipping, it sometimes takes a longer time.<br /><br />I have used Super Saver free shipping for many products, and they usually ship within a day or two.<br /><br />After a week, I emailed again,and got the same feeble reason that it takes longer. They never explained how my friend who order later got the shipped before mine.<br /><br />Bah, humbug!<br /><br />Very annoying and disappointing. At least the pepitas are good.

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: These are hard to find in any local stores and the gut health variety seems to be the only one of these that does not contain carrageenan.  My dog enjoys these very much.  They do not last as long as a rawhide or a Zuke's Z-bone, but they are certainly cheaper than the Z-bones, so I like to alternate all 3 with my dog.

review/text: My dog loves these and he no longer has salmon breath from his food.  I give him one a day and his teeth also look super clean.  I actually have not been brushing his teeth- he refuses to let me and he is 85lbs and the vet commented on how clean his teeth look.  They are made with healthy ingredients and no fillers.  I will continue to buy these.

review/summary: Great treat
review/text: At 18 calories per stick, and only a single grain source (rice), these are great treats. Dogs love them. However, please be aware these treats do not contain probiotics like the company claims. Instead they contain a PREbiotic, fructooligosaccharides, which is still beneficial. Fructooligosaccharide is a natural sweetener and helps 'feed' the flora already existing inside a dog's intestines. This is great, but the dog needs gut flora in the first place. If your dog has a damaged digestive system (for example, from antibiotic usage) then the fructooligosaccharides won't be too beneficial.<br /><br />Compared to similar products and prices, this is a great product for a great price.

review/text: My dog is a very picky little lhasa apso. He will not chew bones, or other chew toys. He does not like most treats, he'll do the trick to pacify me, take the treat and spit it out.<br /><br />However, when I came home with this one, he sat for his treat, took it, and ran away, greedily chewing on it. I have never seen him have more pep in his step. This is the best product I've purchased for him to date. I especially like that it is low in calories and full of quality ingredients. I highly recommend this to anyone.

review/summary: Best Dental Sticks I've Used By Far !
review/text: Get Naked Gut Health is an amazing product. Low cal, low fat, high moisture and high fiber ! A perfect combo weight control and digestion. Sodium content is a bit higher than I would like but with all other things considered it will do.<br />My 2 Papillons absolutely love these things ! They recognize the bag and come running and bouncing around as soon as I have it in my hand :) They are easy to please but they have never responded to anything like these things.<br />They smell good as they contain cinnamon,ginger and peppermint. I guess they like the smell and they taste good too.<br />I was mainly looking for a healthy dental chew. My vet recommend Get Naked but didn't say they came in so many different choices. Neither of my dogs have digestive problems but my little girls is 10 going on 11 and I thought this would be a good choice for her for weight control and to keep her digestive track healthy.<br />I have been using them for about 3 months and have already seen a difference. Some say they are higher but compared to the similar sticks in the supermarket<br />they really aren't that bad since they are twice as long much much healthier and one a day is sufficient for my dogs.<br />One thing I have found over the years, the more organic the food,treats,and chews the healthier the dog. I spend much more overall on my Paps<br />but they go to the vet for shots only. They never get sick. For a 10 + year old that is saying something and I contribute a lot of that to their diet !

review/text: I like this treat for my dogs as it's human grade product. Though all treats need like this should be supervised as some dogs eat too quick and can choke, I find this is definitely  safer and MUCH better quality than greenies or anything by pedigree etc.. none of them are human grade product.

review/summary: Good product & properly spicy
review/text: I can't say I am a beef jerky connoisseur, I can't even recall the last time I had some. With that said this seems like a decent product. It has a good texture and it's not hard to chew. In terms of burn it's on par with eating chips with habanero puree, but the heat is not overbearing and a good amount of beef flavor prevails. The aftertaste burns, of course, but with the subtle overtone of smokiness. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but this is flavour country. Enjoy!

review/text: I was looking for actual "hunks" of honey to satisfy sweet craving- didn't want any artificial sweeteners and such.  Well, these came up on my search and I immediately liked that there are only 3 ingredients, all of which are organic.  Then I read the reviews and everyone seemed to like them- Ive been basing a lot of purchases lately on reviews and its working quite well... Anywhoooo, they arrived on my doorstep literally 5 minutes ago and I could not be any more impressed!!  They really do taste like fresh honeycomb (without the hassle of wax).  They are also only 15 calories a piece, made in America and their little round size is just perfect!  When is the last time you tried to talk with a jolly rancher or lifesaver in your mouth?  Way to big!  I feel good giving them to my kids as a sweet, too.  The only problem I have now is I'm gonna hate to run out!!

review/summary: Very mild ginger flavor, does NOT help with nausea
review/text: The only candies I really like are hard candies, and I've been addicted to them since I quit smoking a few decades ago (back then the selection in my local bricks-and-mortar stores was mostly Life Savers - bah!).  These GoNaturally candies are pleasant enough, but they would not satisfy a true ginger fan.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the flavor is very, very mild.  I do not suffer from motion sickness, but I AM one of those people who gets nauseated very easily.  These candies do NOTHING for nausea.  I would definitely recommend the Ting Ting Jahe ginger candies (also sold by amazon).  They are labeled as "chews," but you can suck on them like hard candies - and they are about the closest thing to chunks of candied ginger that I have found in a "hard" candy.  I don't want to buy the actual candied ginger (unless I'm using it in a recipe) because I could go through it really quickly, and the calories add up fast!  That's one of the reasons I like hard candy - it lasts quite a while, and gives you that sugar high without accumulating a lot of calories (my weight is in the normal BMI range, and no one in my family has ever had diabetes - so I don't worry about that aspect).  My dentist is not too happy, though - he had to prescribe a germicidal rinse for me to use three nights a week because I was STILL getting new cavities; I also started using a fluoride rinse (my own idea) on the other four days.  No cavities now for about two years, and I'm still consuming hard candies during at least half of my waking hours.

review/text: When I buy grapes I get several kinds, so I really like getting raisins that are a mixture of more than one kind. That recloseable pouch Sunmaid uses keeps them moist. No worry about hard fruit if you do not use an opened package right way.<br />The flovors are enhanced by being mixed. This is just a great product, for cooking or just eating by itself.

review/summary: Good product, faulty bags
review/text: I am disappointed in Amazon for selling this product. The "resealable" bags that the raisins come in are defective. I've opened 4 of the 5 packages in my order now and all have faulty resealable zippers that come detached from the packaging making the bag useless once it is opened. I normally never have problems with Amazon products but I will be seeking a refund or replacement on this one. If Amazon expects its business model to survive it needs to uphold higher product standards than brick and mortar stores since customers aren't able to easily inspect items until they arrive.

review/summary: Favorite Snack!!
review/text: I was a little weary about buying 5 packs of raisins at once for fear that they may be dry and hard and I would hate them. That was not the case at all!! I am so glad I went ahead and ordered and subscribed for set deliveries. These are plump and moist and sweet- everything you could want in a raisin!! They are fantastic and have become one of my favorite snacks.

review/text: I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!

review/summary: My Yorkie Likes It, So I Like It
review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/summary: Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, 95-Percent Lamb, 12-Pack of 13.2-Ounce Cans
review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)
