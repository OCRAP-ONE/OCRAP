review/summary: Loving hot chocolate in Denver
review/text: The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.I have never tasted anything this good. I took down the name of the product, googled it, and quickly ordered it from Amazon. I will now be ready for the first snowy day in Denver. It is the best hot chocolate mix ever!!!

review/summary: Mexican Hot Chocolate
review/text: I first tried this product after visiting the Chocolate exhibit in Chicago six years ago and it reminded me of a tasty coffee I had in Canc&uacute;n in the late 1990s.  It makes a great cup of hot chocolate and I occasionally enjoy mixing some with coffee to make a mocha.

review/summary: Overpowering spices
review/text: I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first.

review/text: This is a great treat for the Fall and Winter months hunting, camping or just snuggling up to watch a movie. The cinnamon is not too overpowering with the chocolate and has a rich cocoa flavor. My wife drinks it as an alternative to coffee so she can sleep at night.

review/summary: Mostly a bag of sugar
review/text: To me it seems like too much sugar, not enough chocolate, a little heavy on the spice. Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1/2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from "the best hot chocolate ever" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with.

review/summary: delicious, full-flavored cocoa mix
review/text: This is probably the best-tasting cocoa I've ever had at home.  A friend gave me a small tin of it years ago as a holiday gift.  We enjoyed every bit of it but had trouble finding more until it turned up on Amazon.  Smells great, tastes great, and is made with real ingredients (not artificial sweeteners and weird chemicals).  Really fantastic stuff.  It's also great in brownies and cakes - adds some spices above and beyond what most people expect.  Tastes like fall, in the best way possible.  Here's a recipe to try:  a few frozen bananas (for chill and body), about a  cup of crunchy peanut butter, about half a cup of almond or regular or soy milk (more milk if you like a thinner shake), a scoop of this cocoa, and blend.  Drink it right away.  Filling, lots of vitamins, and naturally sweet.  I know people who swear by it as their daily breakfast.  Yum!

review/summary: Tasty Iced Spiced Chocolate
review/text: I got the 3lb bag and the recipes on the bag call for "scoops." A scoop was not provided in my bag, but they say that 2 scoops is equivalent to about 8 tbsp. However, the nutrition information is given by 38g serving, not by tbsp or "scoop." I measured it out with my food scale and 38g came to exactly 3 level tbsp, so if I made the Iced Chocolate as directed (2 scoops/8 tbsp), I'd be getting almost 3 servings of chocolate mix (420 cal before the milk!). I cut the milk in half (3oz hot and 4oz cold) and use one serving (38g/3 tbsp) chocolate, served over ice, and to me it is delicious with a nice strong spicy chocolate flavor, and it is a reasonable 217 cal when using skim milk.<br /><br />Different palates are going to have different preferences as far as the balance of spice and chocolate, but I can tell you that I like it. My husband does not care much for cinnamon but he also likes it, and my children like it too. We have only tried it cold so far and are looking forward to trying it hot!

Having just returned from a trip to Santa Fe where I had purchased it originally, I introduced him to the pleasures of morning hot chocolate.  He was hooked!!  Now for the other use, today , the day after Thanksgiving clean up we were at breakfast without any milk in the house, but an abundance of leftover decaf coffee from the celebration, his long face was brightened when I spooned in a bit of MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate into a cup of decaf.

You can get 69 servings for $32.67.<br /><br />I have yet found a better prepared Mexican hot cocoa, seven years later.

It *is* very sugary, but what reasonable person believes that a chocolate drink should be anything other than a treat?<br /><br />I give it four stars because while very yummy, it does not send my consciousness into the higher stratosphere of the realm of pure, abstract deliciousness.  It is, however, a product I will purchase again.<br /><br />It tastes sweet, cinnamony, and chocolatey and has some other flavors I cannot identify.  I recommend it if you like or are curious about such things.

review/text: This product is great if you like the particular spices used in the mix.  Unfortunately, although I am drinking it, I am not enjoying it as the flavors just don't jive with my palate.  If you really like the spice combination (I like cinnamon, for example, in almost everything, but in the chocolate mix it just doesn't make it for me), you'll love it.  I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.  I have this huge quantity to consume, and I rarely partake of it as I don't really care much for it.

Not knowing what to expect [I speculated that the hot chocolate would have a touch of heat], I made a cup as soon as it was delivered. To my surprise, it has a strong cinnamon [and probably nutmeg] flavor - it is a good hot chocolate.<br /><br />I mix the chocolate powder with steamed/frothed milk from my espresso maker - I find this makes the drink much better. It takes a couple of cups to really make an opinion, but I think it is a good hot chocolate to drink every day.

Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.<br /><br />Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.

review/summary: Love the cocoa, not the packaging.
review/text: I found this cocoa at Bristol Farms while looking for a healthier cocoa without the partially hydrogenated oils in most of them.  I love the spiciness of this cocoa and put half a scoop in my coffee every morning.  I don't drink straight coffee so I carry this powder with me when I travel too.<br />I was thrilled to find this item on amazon after Bristol Farms ran out for a while.  I have received a few of the 25 lb boxes with no problems, but my last $113 box is in the trash after I cut the plastic tie and found baby silverfish in it.  These bags are not sealed, just have a plastic tie aroung the bag opening so lots of tiny things can crawl in.  I know we have silverfish here at my husband's house, but now that I have just thrown $100 in the trash I wonder why they can't seal these bags?  I'm going to have to start buying a smaller quantity and just pay more per ounce so this doesn't happen again.  Unless a few people are drinking this or you only have one serving a day you need to plan for storage of this powder for quite a while.

review/text: I just tried the nutty marshmallow and it is awesome.<br />I have problems with some bars due to acid reflux and also gallbladder problems, but this hasn't bothered me yet. Plus at 150 calories it is a pretty lightweight snack, though a little small. Vegan too for those who want vegan treats. It's not made from real marshmallow root (which I was hoping for), but then almost no marshmallow snacks are.

review/text: This tastes so delicious. It's about the size and texture of a Larabar--maybe a little bit bigger. Especially if you enjoy other PROBAR bars, you will like this taste and blend of goodies. There are big chocolate chunks in it and marshmallow patches, too. I just wish the ingredients were all organic and that the marshmallows did not contain "soy protein" (AKA hexane-rinsed soy protein concentrate/isolate). However, it is really, really good.

review/summary: can't taste the "smore's"
review/text: I eat a lot of nutrition bars and I like this style of chewy whole food bar, but I think the packaging and name of this bar is very misleading. It tastes exactly like every other ProBar and I cannot taste any of the "Smore" elements. It also is smaller than the Fruition bars which have the same number of calories. I was very disappointed because I thought this would have more of a dessert-y flavor.

review/summary: I like that it is vegan, but hate that it has a boring flavor
review/text: I tried the Rocky Road flavor and while it is not awful, it is nothing to rave over.  When something is described as a "sinfully healthy snack", I expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories.  These small bars are not decadent or sinfully healthy.  They taste like unsweetened no-bake cookies to an extent and have a slight vitamin aftertaste that frequently accompanies protein and nutrition bars.  Inside the bar, I found a couple of nuts but everything else melded together and if it were a blind taste test, I would never guess them to be rocky road inspired.  Nutritionally, I don't think this bar is great.  For a small 140 calorie bar, it has a good deal of fat (8g) and sugar (9g).<br /><br />If you insist on trying these and they are out of stock here, you can get your halo bar fix on iherb.com.  You can use code LEK375 for a discount.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

review/text: I have tried many healthy bars and this is probably the one that I would never get sick of it.  All the infredients used does not leave any over-powering taste. I also like Lara bar which I also eat everyday, but I some time got sick of Lara bar specific flavor .  Lara bar though is healthier due to the raw ingredients with no sugar or other processed food.  Based on the taste and the ingredient, I some time treat the rocky road bar as healthy desert. Try eating it with vanilla or chocolate ice cream..... Yummy!

review/summary: honey graham is excellent
review/text: This review is for the honey graham flavor. I have not yet tried the other flavors. These small bars are very tasty and not overly sweet (even though rice syrup is the first ingredient). The nutrition profile is as good or better than most bars although a single bar does have 8% RDA of sodium which means this is not a low sodium snack. These bars are small, compared for instance to kashi go lean bars and cliff bars, but very satisfying. I find these bars are great for overcoming a craving between meals when fruit or veg is not available or won't satisfy. I would not rely on these bars for performance events or in a post-apocalypse survival kit, but the Halo honey graham bars are a nice alternative, especially if you're burnt-out on other bars.

review/text: I'm a such sucker for sweets. So when I saw these "candy bar alternatives" at REI during their labor day weekend sale, I just couldn't resist! I snatched up a few flavors (honey graham, smores, and rocky road) along with some other bars to try out. I couldn't believe how delicious and low in sugar these bars were. The fact that almost all their ingredients are organic and recognizable ingredients (no crazy chemical names) was a major plus. It's also vegan and dairy-free, but does have peanuts and wheat.<br /><br />These are definitely a great little afternoon snack that's between 150-160 calories each. Now, I'm on Amazon searching for a cheaper way to get more of them!

review/summary: A little pricey, but worth it
review/text: Although I am something of a circus peanut connoisseur, this was my first experience with colored (as in "other than orange") circus peanuts, and it was quite a good one. The peanuts arrived in good shape in a cellophane bag with a "Sweet Gourmet" sticker on it. (A little confusing, as the listing shows them "by Spangler.") I didn't realize until I read up on the history of circus peanuts that they're supposed to be banana-flavored; I always thought it was just some unique circus peanut flavor. In this case, the orange peanuts are regular flavor; the yellow ones are obviously lemon (and my least favorite, despite my love of lemons); the pink ones are a subtle cherry; and the white ones...oh, the white ones. Vanilla. Creamy, sugary deliciousness. Wow. If I could order just vanilla, I might never go back to pseudo-banana.<br /><br />The price was reasonable for such quality, but the shipping (twice the price of the product) was not. But I suppose that's the fault of the shipping company, and it's probably a good thing anyway. If shipping were, say, free, I'd be well on my way to diabetes. This way, I'll only order these peanuts as an occasional special treat. And a treat they are!

review/text: The peanuts arrived to me in a timely manner along with the rest of my purchaces. As soon as I looked at them, I realized that they had been over-heated along their journey. The colors had bled onto one another and some were even sticking to each other. (The white peanuts had the most color transfer of all of them.) I had wanted to use these to decorate cupcakes, but with all of the sticking and bleeding it'll make them hard to use for that purpose. I'm sure they'll taste just fine, I'm just disappointed about the way they were handled during shipping.

review/summary: Delicious with Organic Milk and Honey
review/text: I've been using this brand of Turmeric for as long as I can remember. I use it when I make Bobotie, a dish I learned to make in Africa. Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties, detoxifies the liver, helps to prevent cancer, is a pain killer and has many other wonderful healing uses. A delicious way to take Turmeric (If you hate swallowing pills) is to sprinkle it into a cup of hot organic whole milk. I also add some honey. It is absoutely the most pleasant drink. I also sprinkle some Tumeric onto mashed cauliflower and add in some parmesan cheese. It is really delicious.<br /><br />I thank Dr. Weil for telling me about the health benefits of this spice. You may want to read some of his books or watch his DVDs.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060959584">Eating Well for Optimum Health: The Essential Guide to Bringing Health and Pleasure Back to Eating</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316129445">Spontaneous Happiness</a><br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I have triplets, all girls, and hair balls are just something you have to accept. Plus the fact that everyone loves big cats, and my girls are all pigs and were all topping 13lbs. with their bellies dragging the ground. It may be cute, but no better for them than us, but ya can't exactly get them to the exercise room! You have to go thru 20 lb's and then start a second sack, but by then I would say it has cut hairballs by 60%+ and they have all dropped a pound or more. after 4 months. I just wish it had free shipping, as I'm disabled and it's one less 20 llb. item I have to carry from the car.

No, a good 1/3 of the shrimps still had their digestive track intact and ready to add to the taste of these little things.<br /><br />As to taste, there really was none, save salt.  The texture was horrible, more like eating a soggy bean than a shrimp.  Very mushy with no snap at all.  At the time of this review the amazon.com title for the item is "Shrmp" not "Shrimp" so perhaps this is like crab with a "K" who knows?<br /><br />Waste of money, after opening one can we threw the rest out.

review/text: Oh my!  What an awesome pickle!  This pickle is a perfect blend of heat and sweet.  I love hot and spicy food so don't mind the nice bite these pickles have.  First sampled at a gourmet store and was addicted immediately.  I would not hesitate to put these pickles out for appetizers at a gathering along with cheese and crackers.  They are extraordinary.

review/text: Wickles, like probably most food products, do not have the same appeal to everyone. I happen to be one of those who finds Wickles to be my favorite pickles. There is just the right amount of "bite" that greatly enhances the taste of a sandwich. I use Wickles when I make my favorite dessert of a cup of cottage cheese topped with a couple tablespoons of these wonderful pickles. These Wickles are a bit on the pricey side but they are so versatile that it is rewarding to fit them into the budget. Highly recommended to those who want more than blandness. However, a word of warning seems appropriate - they are addictive!

review/text: Wickles pickles and relish are incredible. They are the perfect balance of sweet and heat that you have to try to believe. I have introduced them at work and everyone agrees they are five-star. Wickles turns any tuna or pulled pork sandwich, or hot dog into something special. Try 'em, you'll like 'em.

review/summary: Not what they advertise
review/text: Wickles advertises "sweet" pickles. The product they sent was not sweet but extremely hot. It even had a red hot chilly pepper in the jar. When contacted they told me that the product I received was a sweet pickle because the box it came in said sweet. Nowhere on the jar is the word "sweet". Nutricity did nothing to remedy their mistake and now I am left with 12 jars of "hot" pickles when I ordered 12 jars of "sweet" pickles That I paid over $50.00 for plus shipping. I will never do business with this company and would not recommend anyone else to do so.

review/summary: Good for larger cats, and cheaper too!!
review/text: SECRET:  If you have larger cats and are feeding them the Prairie Homestyle canned cat food, you can feed them this too!!  I know I sound like a terrible pet owner, but this is high quality food and thus more $$$$ than your run of the mill canned food.  My 2 Bengal cats are a healthy 15 lbs each (solid muscle, not overweight).  The dog food ingredients are the same but the pieces are a bit larger.  I STRONGLY suggest monitoring your animals while testing out the food, but my animals have no issues with the larger pieces.  I have spoken to vets, animal trainers, pet sitters and no objections from the professionals.  And the dog food is literally 1/2 the price of the cat food on a volume basis.  Great way to feed my babies well and save some money!

review/summary: A popular product from a major movie
review/text: Although these delicious delicacies can stand on their own merit, they have a know reputation.  Everyone remembers the red stapler from "Offices Space" (1999). But only a connoisseur would associate gummy bears with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986). While Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) was making his principal getaway on a school bus, a young lady offered him a gummy bear. It was warm and chewy as she kept them in her pocket.<br /><br />You do not need to keep these animals in your pocket to enjoy them. Just be aware that they may not blend well with temporary fillings. You can just suck on them in that case.

The price for this small box is $1.99. That's for 1/2 oz-- 1 oz would be almost $4.00.  Not worth the price or the trouble.  The shipping and handling is over $7.00.  Would it be too much to ask to put the size in the product discription?

A little high for shipping but cheaper than a 200 mile round trip to Los Angeles at $4.00 a gallon + for gas. Thanks Amazon. Oh by the way the noodles are very tasty, good with chicken broth, crispy chunks of pork, halved hard boiled eggs and soy sauce to taste. Yum!

review/text: I (like another review that I read) enjoyed this tea while staying at a 4-star hotel recently.  I just loved it and was sorry there was only one in the 'coffee/tea' wooden box available in my room.  I saved my tea wrapper/package (well wrapped for freshness) and I immediately looked it up on Amazon to order for home use. I wasn't surprised that it was a little more expensive than the usual tea bags, but it was WELL WORTH IT.  The Pepperment is subtle and aromatic.  The plus is that it's decafinated and won't keep you up at night.  I highly recommend it!!

review/text: Bravo for Taylor's. This tea is a gem! I'm yet another person who fell in love with this delicate, wonderful tea during one of my hotel stays.  I'm a coffee-holic, & I don't even like peppermint. But it was bedtime & I wanted something light, so decided to take advantage of sampling something different for free.  I was pleasantly surprised. Soft, delicate, soothing... it's just wonderful! I do have a sweet tooth, but this tea needs no embellishment; I didn't add a thing to it. There seems to be no acidity wanting me to add sugar, & the peppermint is delicate & soft, not overpowering.  When I came home, I picked up a quality peppermint tea, & just now had a cup. Actually, I tried a cup... it's still sitting here. It can't compare. So I made myself some coffee to drink while searching for this lovely tea. I'm so glad I found it!

review/summary: My favorite tea, hands down
review/text: I was at a hotel the first time I tried this tea.  It was in a little basket in my room, next to the coffee pot and I thought "Organic Peppermint Tea, hmmm... that sounds different..."  I was not a big tea drinker at the time, but it sounded so quirky I though "Why not?"  When I took my first sip I actual said "Wow!" out loud.  I could not believe how good it was.  Over the next four days I drank eleven cups of tea.  The cleaning lady had to refill the little basket in my room three times.  As soon as I returned home I hopped on Amazon and searched for my Taylor's of Harrogate Organic Peppermint Tea.  I was so happy when I found it!!  As the previous review states, it is a little pricey, but well worth it.  It is so good, I drink it plain--no sugar necessary.  Before I would douse my teas with sugar, but this one is very fresh and minty; delicious on its own.  I also like that it is naturally caffeine free and I can drink it at any time.  I cannot say enough about this little tea-- I feel like I am splurging every time I have a cup!

review/text: This tea is truly amazing.  Actually, I shouldn't call it tea, since there are no tea leaves.  This is just plain 'ole mint leaves.  In Arabia, you find that people will drink na'naa'a maghribi (a certain type of mint leaves) by themselves with some sugar.  And it really is nice.  But this tea actually tastes better, as it seems quite similar to na'naa'a hasaawee, which is the tea only available in Madeenah.  So enjoy it.  It is expensive, but with it.

review/text: I have two small dogs and order the lite teenies as rewards for them.  If they think they will get a greenie, they will come when I call them no matter how far away they are, and will even open their own kennel door at night in a hurry to get in their beds so they can have their nightly treat. I know some other people said their dogs didn't care for these, but I, personally, have never seen a dog who didn't love, love, love them.  Even my giant shepherd and my schnauser love them, although they get different sizes.  I also noticed that my dogs' breath has improved since I've been giving them these.  Yes, they are expensive, but if your dog is one who loves them, you will not have any disclipline problems if you train them with these greenies.
