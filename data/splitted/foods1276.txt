review/summary: What are you people smoking?
review/text: I know why they have zero calories/carbs etc... Its because this is not food. It tastes like nothing and the texture is utterly revolting. If you are someone who is sensitive to textures of foods (mushrooms, for example) stay away. And if you aren't someone who is sensitive to textures of foods, you will be after you try these.

review/summary: Great concept... poor flavor, texture, etc.
review/text: I bought this when I saw them on Good Morning America, thinking they would be a great sub. for pasta.  They are low calorie, low carb and looked as if they would be at least ok to try.  I was WRONG! When I got these I was excited to try them, but when I opened the first bag, I got the fishy smell others have described, so I rinsed them until it was gone.  I then, blanced them in boiling water (as directions stated) and when I took them out they were congelled together in knots.  Well I thought I would still give them a try, hey how bad could they be? I put pasta sauce on them, and onto my plate (still excited to try!)... but when I put them in my mouth.... it reminded me of a frozen pasta (like a Healthy Choice) but much worse!  I threw the whole plate of food away and the other bags of the so-called "Pasta"!<br />I would all in all not recommend these!  Save your money, and just limit yourself on the real thing, trust me it's worth it!

review/text: I don't normally rate things, but I feel I owe it to the public to write a review.  My husband has a gluten sensitivity.  I can eat just about anything.  I'm Asian. I've never heard of these noodles.  I saw them on Eversave and decided to try them.  Some of the reviews were good, so I decided to buy them.  Expensive as heck!  I don't mind the fishy smell.  The texture is a whole different story.  And I eat just about anything!  Balut and durian, for goodness sake!  But these are gelatinous and crunchy and aloe vera like texture.  I've only tried it with marinara sauce.  I will try to cook them other ways, but dang!  Good luck!

review/summary: At first a bit weary but they taste good!
review/text: I bought these as an alternative for pasta or to help create simple and quick meals for one.  I still use pasta when I cook for the family but decided to try these as a low calorie option for me.  The smell was bad and if I hadn't read the packaging first, they would have been thrown out.  But, I followed the instructions and emptied the water from the package.  Then I put them in a strainer and rinsed them in COLD water, while swirling the noodles around so that each strand was thoroughly rinsed out.  (about 20 seconds)  It already smelled better! (It smelled like nothing)  I heated up some low fat chicken broth and water.  Then I added fresh veggies, spices (salt, pepper, garlic, and cayenne pepper).  I brought it to a boil and added the noodles.  I stirred a few times and then poached an egg in the broth.  This was a DELICIOUS meal!  A few important things to remember!<br />- If you don't rinse properly then they will probably be gross.<br />- They are VERY SIMILAR to rice noodles- tasteless.  If you don't season them it will taste like nothing!<br />-also if you don't like rice noodles- YOU WILL NOT LIKE THESE! They have the same texture!<br /><br />So, in the end I really like these.  They are pricy but there are deals out there- so keep your eyes open!  Add any spices that you like and some veggies and maybe some protein and it is a low calorie, DELICIOUS alternative.  THIS DOES NOT REPLACE PASTA for me!  So, if you think this will taste the same as regular semolina pasta- you will be disappointed!

review/text: These are really gross.  They taste like rotten fish and have the strangest texture ever!  That being said, I wasn't put off Shirataki Noodles forever so I tried another brand.  The House Brands Tofu Shirataki Noodles are actually pretty good.  I guess the addition of tofu tempers the strange texture and it definitely gets rid of the smell if you follow the directions and rinse them well first.  The angel hair are better than the spaghetti.

review/summary: Amazing!!!!
review/text: At first after looking at some of the reviews on these noodles I was very worried that I would be disappointed, but after just having tasted this amazing product I am completely overjoyed! As an Italian girl who loves her pasta, giving it up to lose some weight on the hcg was very discouraging. After trying these today I am SO excited!<br /><br />To all those out there who are cautious and wondering if these things are really worth it, they are! It depends on how you prepare them. I rinsed them thoroughly and then dried them in a pan over medium heat. After preparing my vegetable in a bit of sauce I added the noodles and TADAA!!!! They tasted amazing- a lot like ramen noodles. I'm very happy with this product!!!

They dont upset your stomach and you dont feel sluggish after eating them like you do with pasta...WHAT MORE CAN YOU POSSIBLY ASK FOR????????????????????? They are amazing and if you are counting calories, they make life so much easier. Follow the instructions and they don't taste or smell fishy. They can be used for all kinds of dishes, not just Asian inspired ones.

review/text: I thought that I would try the noodles to help me on my HCG Diet. Not only do they stink, they are hard to swallow. The texture is disgusting. It seemed as though no matter what I but on the noodles to try and make them better, nothing worked. And if you try to contact someone about the noodles, NO ONE GETS BACK WITH YOU. So by that, I feel the seller has horrible customer service.

I just added sauted veggies to it with a soy sauce with baked marinated chicken and the family loved it.  These are a winner and will be trying the other versions as well.  It's worth the extra money (being that pasta is cheap in the store) for cutting out the bad stuff!

review/text: These were really a great find. I've been eating low carb for 3 months now and was missing having a noodle dish. These are kind of off putting when you first open them because of the fishy smell, but i soaked them in cold water for a few minutes then boiled them for about 2 mins as the package says, dried them off and added to a stir fry of meat and veggies. It reminded me exactly of Ramen noodles!! My husband loved them, which is saying a lot because he is picky when it comes to 'replacements' for his normal comfort foods. I did not find them rubbery at all...maybe its how i prepared them? I will be ordering these again.

review/text: I just tried these for the first time in a low fat, low carb, healthy Shirataki Chow Mien dish. These are fantastic for Asian style dishes. The texture would not work at all for Western style noodle dishes like Spaghetti, I think, but I don't even feel the need to try because they are so good used in the cuisine they were meant for.<br /><br />As far as the fishy smell many people complain about, I didn't have any issues with this. I rinsed them off while I was preping the veggies, and they didn't have any smell AT ALL after that.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more of these!

review/text: I certainly had my doubts about this product, but because I'm part of the low carb crowd and ready to lose a few more pounds, I ordered them.  What a delightful surprise!  The odor isn't that bad and rinsed out easily, although I did rinse well and then soak the noodles in clean cold water for a few minutes before then blanching them in hot water as the directions state.  I tried them with spaghetti sauce and true, they aren't like spaghetti but were very good.  I'm going to try them in a stirfry and a Philipino recipe for Pancit ...they remind me strongly of rice stick noodles or silver noodles. How can you go wrong with 0 calories!!!

review/text: This is my new favorite food to implement into my Weight Watchers routine! The noodles totally soak up whatever flavor you stir-fry them in - so I use potent, no calorie flavorings like garlic, ginger, miso, and hot sauce to create a base and then let them soak up the flavor while cooking. They TOTALLY fill you up - so you end up completely satisfied, taste wise and filling wise. Don't expect them to be an ordinary white wheat noodle - just be thankful that they are what they are and you can eat a whole bowl of them for 0 calories.

review/summary: Best marinade ever!
review/text: I LOVE this soup mix and use it often as a marinade for chicken. Easiest recipe: Spray a 13x9 inch pan with Pam. Slice peeled potatoes paper thin and line the bottom of your pan with two layers of your potatoes. Put boneless, skinless chicken over the potatoes. Take two soup packets and combine them in a bowl with 1/3 c. olive or vegetable oil and about 1/3 c. water; mix. Pour marinade over chicken and then bake entire thing for an hour. SO EASY AND SO DELICIOUS! Every time I make this, I get nothing but compliments; it's even my husband's favorite. Lipton nailed it with this one and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves garlic and zesty spices.<br /><br />This was also a pretty good deal since the packets can sometimes be difficult to find at the store and usually aren't on sale for less than $1.50. I'm very happy with my purchase!

review/text: I use this soup mix in several recipes that I have been making for years. A couple of years ago Lipton quit selling it in stores. You can order it directly from Lipton, but the price and service are not nearly as good as Amazon. This soup makes a great sauce, marinade, crock pot base, vegetable glaze and several other things. I truly use it a couple of times a month, and wouldn't know what to do for a replacement. If you love garlic (and who doesn't?) you should try this soup. It comes with recipes to start you out too.

review/summary: Not Just A Soup
review/text: I have used this soup mix almost 20 years.  It is my secret ingredient for my greens (Collards).  People who have eaten my greens say they have never had greens so good.  The "Secret" is out.  I also use it for a personal recipe, Cabbage Stew.  It goes well in gravies, over roasts, and even in BBQ sauce.  It is a very nice flavor for anything you want to add it to -- even spaghetti.  This is as common an item in my cabinets, as a box of salt.  If you have not tried it, you do not know what you are missing.<br /><br />When the only store in my city was discontiuning this item, I bought the last 13 boxes.  That was over 7 years ago.  I buy a case of this (10 boxes) every three months.  Now that the holiday season is upon us, I have bought 3 cases, yes 30 individual boxes.  The first time I bought this item, I made the recipe that was on the box -- savory herb and garlic potatoes.  I have been hooked ever since.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE this soup mix!! I have tried the mix on roasted red potatoes with olive oil, the oven baked chicken recipe on the box as well as the white pizza dip recipe & all three are Fabulous!! As other reviewers have said, I haven't been able to find it locally in a long time so I am really happy to see that I can still buy it in bulk on Amazon.com! Please don't ever stop carrying this item!

review/text: I have used this product for years and then it was gone from the shelves of the stores I shop in. I forgot about it until my daughter asked why I never cooked the "special"  pork that I did when she was younger. So with the help of the computer I found it again and ordered 2 cases because my scattered family also loved whatever I cooked using it. It's good on pork, beef, chicken, and vegetables.

review/text: I love cooking with "Savory Herb with Garlic," but for some reason my grocery store quit carrying it and I've never been able to find it anywhere else. I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Now I don't have to go from store to store looking for it, it's delivered to my front door. I use this in a lot of dishes, but where it really shines is in our "roasted potato, carrot and onion" dish. It's also excellent with wild rice pilaf or any kind of rice. Thank you Amazon!

review/text: I stumbled upon this years ago, but can no longer find it locally.<br /><br />I make a lot of soup. Sometimes I don't want to get creative with my own herbs and spices. This stuff fits the bill when I'm lazy & all love what results.<br /><br />I also have used this stuff on breadsticks, on top of bread, in low-fat sour cream to make dips, and in mayonnaise. Each time, it's been a hit.<br /><br />It works nicely on oven baked potato skins too! I'm not saying we use it exclusively -- but as I mentioned prior, sometimes the ol' creative juices in my brain want a break. It's nice to have this on the shelf for those times.

review/text: Davidson's has done an outstanding job of combining the teas and spices in this Tulsi tea. It is delicious with or without a sweetener. (I often add a touch of Stevia which makes the spicy, sweet flavor of the tea pop.) And the smell of this product is so good, it could be kept in a pot on the stove to scent the house. In addition, the product comes in a 100-bag size so there isn't the waste and cost involved in the pretty, individually wrapped bags you see in the smaller-sized boxes. This has easily become my favorite tea. In fact, I'm going to order another box right now!

review/summary: different labels - same great peanuts
review/text: I have purchased The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg brand peanuts with several different labels.  They are consistently perfect, with a taste and texture as close as you can get to the old fashioned "just cooked, hot out of the oil" peanuts of my youth.<br /><br />This brand is the only one I've found that uses peanut oil rather than the genetically modified cotton seed oil that is used for most other brands.  I think there are a couple other brands "out there" that do not use toxic oils, but I'll stick with this one!!!<br /><br />I like things more salty than a lot of people so I usually sprinkle a little extra sea salt on the nuts when eat them but I think they are just right out of the can for most people.<br /><br />If you really want to splurge and have a good food processor -- these nuts make the best peanut butter anywhere!

review/text: Our two Miniature Schnauzers love these treats.  They are small, flavorful, and not too hard, like some chew treats are.  I wish I could find a retailer in the Washington, DC, area (in Virginia, that is) who sells these at a decent price and doesn't charge an arm and a leg for shipping, like the Amazon shipper does - Companion Caterers charges more than 50% of the cost of the item for shipping, and they have the lowest price.  I will not buy these treats with that kind of cost:  it is outrageous and unacceptable.  I'll go to a competitor of "Etta Says!" and "Companion Caterers" before I'll pay that ridiculous price.  Our Minis aren't that crazy about the treats.

review/summary: Tastes very much like fresh homemade pasta
review/text: Now of course no dry pasta is going to taste exactly like fresh, but I've got to say, this is as close as I've come. Pay no attention to the title description. This is not spaghetti but a very large (nearly lasagna size) and thick strip of egg noodle. The packages are 10-ounces. The flavor is deep and natural. A-lot of dry pastas these days have very little flavor, this stuff has tons. The texture is also great. These noodles are very "toothsome" they are chewy (in that great homemade sense of the word). One thing to watch out for is the packaging. As soon as you open the box, check the bags of pasta for holes. The stripes of pasta are so thick that their corners can punch through the plastic. I found a couple of bags that had been breached. I used one right away and popped some tape over the other one.

review/text: You will always find these in Chinatown because Chinese people and Filipino people love these, and why not?  So buttery is the toffee!  The little nutty covering feels funny on your tongue and I think they just put it there to keep the toffee from being sticky as it does not contribute much to the overall flavor.  These are not the deformed ones that they sell cheap--each one is beautiful and perfectly-formed.  Buy a can for yourself and any Chinese or Filipino friends you have, and even for your girlfriend for Valentine's--the pink tin practically SHOUTS "Happy Valentines Day, I love you like a little toffee candy!!!!!"

review/text: Wow, I never thought that I'd actually be writing a review on confectionaries, but as soon as I did a successful search for Brown &amp; Haley in the Amazon Gourmet Food shop, I just couldn't wait. The fact is, Brown &amp; Haley, the makers of Almond Roca, beloved by millions of fellow sweet-toothers, is based right here in my hometown of Tacoma, Washington. That's right, the place of the infamous &quot;Tacoma aroma&quot; is also the home of the very sweet aroma of Almond Roca, and has been for over one hundred years!<p>Almond Roca is a bite-size combination of milk chocolate with crushed almond pieces surrounding a core of rich butterscotch almond brittle, so it's kind of soft-but-crunchy &amp; chocolatey on the outside, and hard &amp; crunchy &amp; almond-sweet on the inside. My mouth is watering just describing it! I've got to get some right now....luckily, I can drive just three miles down Pacific Avenue to get it wholesale right from the source!<p>My hometown should be proud of the rich tradition of Brown &amp; Haley; if you're located nowhere near Tacoma and you've *never* tasted Almond Roca before, then what are you waiting for? Order the 7-ounce tin today, and give yourself---or the one you love---a treat that you or they will never forget!<p>MOST RECOMMENDED

review/summary: Excellent treat at an excellent price
review/text: These candies are wonderful. They are really rich and melt in your mouth, with a crunchy almond and toffee center. The danger is that they're really easy to eat. I often have 5 or 6 of these at a time before I've realized how many calories that is.<br /><br />They're very popular in the Chinese-American community as gifts, especially around Lunar New Year. They're made in Tacoma, Washington and if you're traveling abroad, they make excellent souvenirs if you want to give something made in the USA (very few things are these days). Almond Rocas are exported all over the world and I found them in Japan at the gourmet import store (but very pricey). They're also popular in Hong Kong. I've never seen anyone who does not like these!<br /><br />I paid $30 for 2 boxes (each 21 ounces) at my local grocery store. This tin is $22 for the same amount of candy, and sold directly by Brown & Haley, the manufacturers. That's a fantastic deal! I wish I had bought mine here.<br /><br />Nutrition information from the side of the box: 3 pieces is 200 calories, 130 of which is from fat (15g). Cholesterol: 15mg, Sodium: 115mg.

review/text: This tub contains almond toffee coated in chocolate. Very addictive. I can confirm that $20 bucks for a 42 ounce tin is about what you'd pay in stores. I do enjoy it, but I'm docking one star on account of the quality seems just little bit below what you'd expect for the price. Overall though, it's a great buy.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: How can anyone not like these?<br /><br />For some reason, people like to give chocolate as gifts. I don't know why because taste is a very personal thing and you never know what people like. We usually re-gift Russell's or See's but I like really Almond Rocas. First of all they're all individually wrapped so it's not like you feel you have to finish a can quickly when you open it. Then, there's the taste, there's a layer of nuts on the outside, then chocolate, then crunchy caramel on the inside. I suppose you can melt this in your mouth but I always crunch it. It's not overly sweet which is a major plus and they say nuts and chocolate are good for your health so that's two major positives.<br /><br />This is a 42oz can so it's mainly for aficionados, but the great thing is, if you've never tried this before you can go to your local drug store and chances are they'll sell a small pack of these for you to try. It's great, because they only used to sell this in one size, but now they sell it in small packets to large tins like this. And tins like this are great as gifts, especially for dentists!<br /><br />Lastly, the tins are great and you can keep them in your pantry for putting things in. All in all, a great product in great packaging.

review/summary: Taste Perfection! (and a Great Value)
review/text: When enjoy a piece or three of Almond Roca it is easy to see why they haven't changed the recipe since they started cranking them out some 90 years ago. It is a delightful mix of buttery toffee and chocolate with just the right amount of almonds sprinkled on the outside.  It all melts in your mouth with just a perfect amount of crunch to make it all work.<br />A funny little bit of history is that Almond Roca was the first candy in the world to be sold in a sealed tin (way back in 1927). You can also get Cashew Roca and Mocha Roca if you want to try some other flavors but I prefer the classic Almond.<br />I give the 42oz size an A+ for value. I am a huge lover of See's Candies but a 16oz can of the product they make to compete is $16 so a comparable amount would be $42 from See's.

review/text: Almond Roca is for you if you love English Toffee.  Made even better with a nutty crust, it is almost impossible to eat just one buttery, crunchy piece.  If you enjoyed these in your childhood, but just haven't treated yourself lately, they are better than you remember.  Get yourself some and do a happy dance when you enjoy one.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: ate the whole thing myself
review/text: a coworker brought in the 42oz canister and over the next week, we enjoyed them.  i had eaten these before, but didn't realize they came in a giant tin like this.  i was even more surprised when i looked up the price on amazon!  a box of sees candy is about 14 bucks and you get some good, quality chocolate, but a box of sees candy does not compare to a seemingly endless can of almond roca candies for about $22 bucks!!<br /><br />ok, i love candy.  i did buy a canister and took it home and ate it and did not share a single piece.  even when i had company over, i hid that canister, because i know if anyone has one piece of this almond roca, they will want another, and another, and another until they are gone.  these candies are excellent in almost every way and i need to place another order!  :)

review/text: I ordered the 42oz. canisters for a party.  We needed a certain amount so when they said 100 pieces per canister, I ordered just the right amount...however, the first canister was short by three...the second short by two, the third short by five...a total of 10 short.  Why??? Not pleased.  Yes the candies are good but if you say 100 pieces, makes sure you put 100 pieces in the canister.  A ripoff...

review/summary: Attention All Peanut Putter Lovers - Great Flavor!
review/text: I couldn't wait to get this flavoring to enhance my morning protein shake! Peanut butter can be an 'iffy' flavor when it's artificial, but who needs the extra calories from the real thing? I wasn't disappointed in the least in this great tasting product! I even have been using it in my coffee and on my cottage cheese. There is no chalky aftertaste, just a smooth peanut butter flavor. Give it a try if you are a peanut butter lover, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Didn't taste like peanut butter to me.
review/text: The product didn't taste bad but to me it was more of a caramel / butterscotch flavor, not peanut butter.  I wanted to try this to replace real peanut butter in chocolate protein shakes.  I made a small test shake and added a small amount of the flavoring.  I could taste it for sure, but it wasn't a peanut butter taste.  When smelling the liquid it doesn't smell like peanuts either or taste like it (at least to me) when putting a small dab on my finger and trying it. If I was looking for a caramel / butterscotch flavor then this would have been okay.

review/summary: Truly a dream come true!
review/text: I am a chocoholic, but I am also a triathlete and have to be careful with my cholesterol, so I have to limit my chocolate consumption. In the past, trying to find alternative that satisfied me, I came across the Skinny Cow ice creams, especially the chocolate fudge cones, which I love. A few weeks ago, I was at the grocery store and these candies caught my eye and I decided to try them.<br /><br />The reason I bought them was that each pouch (which has 5 or 6 candies) was only 120 calories and the fat content was pretty low (6g of fat per pouch). When I tried them, I was in heaven, since they deliver the experience that I had come to expect based on previous purchases of this company's products. The chocolate flavor is full and rich, without making it overbearing, and the caramel softens the texture and add to the balance of the candy. The only drawback I can see is that every time I get a serving of these I fell like I could eat a couple of more servings! :)<br /><br />Highly recommended, try it, since you won't feel like you are eating "low fat" chocolate, it is just a great product even when compared to traditional chocolate candy.

The spices work well with the tomatoes in chili and it adds a lot of great flavor. This bulk size is a great money savor since it's almost $2 per pack at the store. If you have the chance to try a single packet at the store, it's a must try and then when you love it, just order the bulk size from Amazon!

review/text: I buy this stuff every single time I see it in the store. I did resort to buying a 12-pack online because the store was sold out. I use it in vegetarian chili since I don't eat meat and it is still really tasty. If I want to kick it up a notch I will use some extra chili powder (organic) and a dash of organic cayenne pepper. But if I want to tone it down for my 1 year old that loves spice, I will use a little less of the packet. I think that I will be making a big pot of this and bringing it to the yearly Christmas get together with my meat eating non-organic eating family. I also like the vegetarian and spicy version of this. I will be buying again once it starts getting chilly out.

review/text: I got hooked on Green Mountain Southern Pecan coffee when my husband and I lived in Maine. I stocked up on it when we moved back to the South and continued to order it in bulk until a couple of months ago when I got my Keurig. Brewing it one cup at a time is the next best thing to living in Maine and being able to go to just about any convenience store and take my pick of the flavors (I almost always chose Southern Pecan). I've ordered the K-cups from Amazon three times now and just placed my fourth order, the second with this company. The last arrived in record time and the price can't be beat--believe me, I've checked. Add in the free shipping and you have a definite winner!

review/text: I was a little hesitant at first since they didnt have a small sampler of it.  The Keurig web site is always out of it.  But from the first cup to the last little bit in the mug it has proven to be worth the gamble.  In my opinion it is a very smooth coffee.  Perfect for those Saturday or Sunday Mornings sitting on the porch.  It has a nice flavor with a nice hint of pecan but not overpowering. Doesn't seem to leave a unpleasant aftertaste just a craving for another cup.  If you are on the fence and not sure, just jump off and give it a shot.  Worth the money.

review/text: I gave this four stars based on the flavor (according to my own taste preference of course) but I would give ten stars to the aroma!  It fills the kitchen with such a wonderful scent.  Back to the flavor though, it's a gentle pecan taste with a just under medium roast flavor.  So to many I believe it would be considered weak.  You could brew a smaller cup or more likely if you like your coffee strong, you probably are not looking at this product anyway!  If you are looking for strong order a variety that is bold or extra bold.  I like to have a variety of K cups without paying the sampler pack prices and this fits the bill for my home.  I have started with a 50 pack of a known favorite and then 24 packs of other flavors that I think I would like to try and have to offer to company.<br /><br />UPDATE: After running through a number of varieties I can tell you we ran out of the Pecan pretty quick.  I still love the aroma and like the flavor and it's definitely one I would order again.
