review/summary: Super fresh and very high quality
review/text: The sauce is delicious. It's restaurant-quality and tastes so fresh they might cook and ship it on the same day. It is by far the best prepared sauce I've ever found.<br /><br />I have ordered this several times and have no issues with packaging. Somebody wrote of a problem in 2007 and 2008, but this seems no longer the case. The jars are re-usable plastic and work great for storing many things. I pop them in the freezer as soon as arrive, and thaw when needed.<br /><br />The Puttanesca is my favorite, spicy and reasonably low in calories. The Vodka sauce is also terrific. Not just great on pasta, try them on fresh vegetables too.

review/summary: Scarpetta ready to use sauce
review/text: Scarpetta and Sauces'nLove are just the best sauces ever. Puttanesca is my favourite.<br />Being Italian, I am really picky on pasta and sauces; working late hours in the hospital I often bought pre-made sauces when in Italy to use them for "emergencies", and it's funny I never found anything so good over there!..<br />Once my parents were visiting me here, I had not prepared anything and we were hungry so I used a puttanesca form my personal "reserve": they thought I had just prepared the sauce from scratch!<br />Highly recommended...<br />PS: this company takes it very seriously to ONLY use products (including cans, labels, etc) made in the US; its Italian CEO managed to make it grow, and save jobs, during the crisis - an example to all of us!

review/text: I bought a case of this sauce because a lot of reviewers said it was good tasting. The seals on two of the jars were broken or possibly broken and I was too chicken to try them so I just threw them away. Overall, I thought the flavor was good but not great. After chucking two of the four I obviously felt I overpaid. This will go down as probably the worst food I've bought through Amazon and I definitely won't buy it again.

review/text: I am in a 20 week medically supervised weight loss program to drop 60 pounds and this product is really helping me stay on track, 2 weeks in and 15 pounds down!  I will be traveling quite a bit for work in the next quarter and I was worried about staying on this program while I'm out of town.  I have had one of these dressing packets with my dinner salad every night since they arrived.  The dressing is tangy and the raspberry is sweet.  For only 40 calories per packet there is a TON of flavor!  I am only having greens in my salads, no cheese, no croutons, no seeds, no protein.  This dressing has made me look forward to my naked salads.  I am planning on buying a bottle for home so I don't keep using these travelers up.  If you typically like Vinaigrette dressings and Raspberry specifically you will like these packets.

I tried one brand and the packaging was terrible, so I went with these even though they have less syrup in them (these are 1.39 ounces versus the 2 ounces in the other brand).<br /><br />The packaging on these is great - none of the cups broke or burst during shipment. The taste of the syrup is fine and has worked well with the waffle mixes I've purchased.

review/summary: Pleasing taste
review/text: I have tried virtually every variety of the Body Armor brand.  I have to say that the Raspberry Blueberry Goji has become one of my favorites.  First off, it has a very pleasing taste and is very refreshing, especially when you are quite thirsty!  I drink them before and during my gym workouts.  It does a good job hydrating me throughout and I definitely notice a difference when I forget to drink it before activity.  I feel like the formula also helps me to decrease inflammation after my workouts as well.  It is my subjective opinion, but again I feel a difference in the recovery mode.  My only gripe is the sugar ratio...it is definitely too sweet.  I would prefer a bit less cane juice.  Being so sweet, I use it as a concentrate for my drinks now: 1/3 Body Armor drink, 1/3 Green Tea drink and 1/3 Seltzer Water.  It may sound like a weird combination, but it is yummy.  You can add almost anything to it and mixes well.  Add some to a smoothie to power up your drink.  Overall, good product...they need to come out with a reduced sugar variety.

review/text: I could only find these drinks at one random convenience store (which was far away and not convenient) for months and every-time I went there, I stocked up. So excited to see them on amazon. These taste great, but are a little too sugary (17g a bottle - Gatorade is 15g depending). Though they do make you feel great if you feel dehydrated, sluggish, or need a non-caffeinated pick-me-up. Hopefully they will create a "light" version of this drink that is less sugar, but still makes you feel great and hydrated.

review/text: I tried these after reading all the great reviews.  While the taste is pleasant, the flakes and the little fiber sticks get soggy very fast.  Because of that, I tend to eat the cereal too fast which takes away from enjoying the flavor.

review/summary: Chispy Flakes & Fiber...Great!!!!
review/text: I have been eating this cereal since 2008. It was recomended by my doctor. I put this recomendation at the top of my list. Five days a week, I have for breakfast; 3/4c of Crispy Flakes & Fiber, 1/4c all brand buds, fresh cut up fruit, a high fiber english muffin. I sprinkle a sweeter on the cereal and fruit and use soy milk. With this for breakfast, I have gotten 25g of fiber, well over half of the recommended daily fiber one should consume. This is how my doctor recommended it to me, and I must say I have never been been this "regular in my life" (I hope you know what I mean).  I am saving money and time by getting this sent to me by Amazon. I don't have to worry about going to the grocery store. Try it, you might like it.  Edie48

You'll love the "S" cookies too, I think they're described as the original cookies but I grew up eating them and always called them the "S" cookies. Those are my favorite. If your going to try any then start with the "S" (original) cookies then the anisette toast, then the almond toast. Enjoy!

review/summary: Odd
review/text: I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, "I will not give out the names of my suppliers". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health.  Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm?  The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies.

review/summary: great craving-crasher
review/text: I have loved these peanut noodles for about a year now, relying on them whenever I have a craving for Thai food. Granted, I'm pretty sure it's not the most authentic Thai taste on earth, but it's as close as I can get when pulling a long shift at work or eating dinner at ten o'clock. The noodles have a good peanutty flavor and there are enough carbs to make you feel more than sated.<br /><br />Originally, I thought it was a pretty good choice nutrition-wise, too, until I realized that each box holds two servings. Oh well. Everything in moderation, so I view it as more of a guilty pleasure now instead of eating it every day. And even as a guilty pleasure, it's not all that bad: 20 grams of fat, 660 calories (if you eat the whole package). A little high in sodium, but I'm usually eating this in place of a meal and a half, so I just make sure it all balances out.<br /><br />But if you're at this page, you probably know all that already. So I will just say: Yum. Microwaveable peanut noodles. Easy and delicious.<br /><br />This is definitely the cheapest way to get them, too, if you're already placing a Super Saver order, since -- at least around here -- the boxes run around $2.50 each individually.

review/text: I love these!  They're the closest thing I've found to actual Thai food in an instant form.  The sauce is a little spicy, which I like a lot.  One caution, though: put the noodles, water, sauce etc. in a bowl instead of making them in the carton.  I made it in the carton the first time and they tasted like the cardboard container with Thai flavor.  Made in a bowl, they're awsome.<br /><br />Also, I've noticed a couple of people saying that the noodles aren't soft enough.  Be sure to let them sit, as that's when they soak up much of the liquid.

review/summary: Quite tasty for such a quick meal
review/text: After first trying the Coconut Ginger noodles and being a bit disappointed by the flavor, I was really pleased with this peanut variety.  It's got just enough spice to be noticeable but not an overpowering amount. Spice fans will want to add some zing to it themselves.  After a few attempts I've got a little advice for the unexperienced:  first, don't skimp on the extra minute at the end of the instructions or you'll have some really stiff noodles.  Second, after it's cooked you should let it stand with the box open for about 5 minutes.  They don't mention a timeframe for that step, and this will really let the noodles soak up the broth.  I think this crucial period of soaking is what I screwed up with the coconut-ginger, so I ended up with watery broth and bland noodles.  Add the peanut bits right before you take the first bite and I think you'll be really impressed with this product, considering it's an "instant" kind of dish. This is miles ahead of Thai Kitchen's instant peanut noodles.  I'm looking forward to trying Taste of Thai's boxed Pad Thai.

Wow.  Is this really how lazy people have become?<br /><br />Buy this product if you like Thai food.  Just don't expect instant gratification.  It take about 5 minutes.  If you can wait that long.

review/summary: Ridiculously good!
review/text: I was highly skeptical, but I bought this stuff because I've liked other Taste of Thai products that I've bought in the store.  I wasn't sure it would translate into a microwave product though -- but it does.<br /><br />The noodles cook up really nicely, although it's important to stir well between the two cooking phases.  The sauce is very flavorful, and thickens nicely as it cools.  It's a bit spicy, but I like that.  I wouldn't think that it would be too spicy for many people, but if you REALLY dislike spicy food, this might not be for you (then again, if that were the case, you probably wouldn't even be considering this product).<br /><br />The only downside of this product is that it's fairly small.  The container is huge, but that's just to accomodate the noodles before they cook.  Once cooked, the noodles take up much less space.  The portion is decent for a lunch, but you may want to cook up two of these for dinner.<br /><br />This stuff is addictive like Asian crack -- I just ordered 3 more cases!

One suggestion - after the second microwaving (there are 2 steps) I let them sit for 10 minutes before I start and the consistency is perfect.

review/summary: BEST I've found so far
review/text: As of this review, I've also tried the Thai Kitchen and Thai Pavilion versions, as well as Dr. McDougals RightFoods version. This is BY FAR the best tasting and isn't loaded with sodium (just 320 mg compared to 650 for Thai Kitchen, a whopping 810 mg for Thai Pavilion and 480 mg for the supposedly "healthy" Dr. McDougal version - which is probably higher in sodium than Thai Kitchen since McDougal's is only about half a serving, so multiply by 2 to get the real comparative sodium).<br /><br />I made two Taste of Thai's last night and served (as a topping and in a separate bowl) some sauteed jumbo prawns and fresh veggies in olive oil, fresh garlic and a little Asian stir fry sauce. Our party of four devoured my dish, going back for seconds, then asking if there was any more. One said I should open a Thai restaurant ! That's how good this stuff is.

review/text: Quite simply, one of the best microwave meals you are likely to ever eat. This is probably my favorite of the flavors in the series, although it is not the healthiest one. The only caveat is that it must be prepared with care. Cook it too long and its a sticky mess. Not long enough and you get a watery mess with crunchy noodles. It's worth the effort to find out what your microwave needs however. Mine is old and weak, so I generally cook it for two minutes, mix it, and then another 3:45. Preparation method is key as well: break the noodles in two inside the package, then open it up and they'll fit horizontally inside the box. Then add the other two spices, *then* the water.

review/summary: A healthier pasta that also tastes good!
review/text: Ronzoni Garden Delight Radiatore may be a more expensive pasta than others, but I think it's worth it.  Having a full serving of vegetables per 4 ounces of pasta makes it a healthier option than plain pasta.  Plus, the veggies add a bit of flavor to the pasta that changes things up a bit, in a good way.<br /><br />I like the radiatore shape for macarroni and cheese.  It makes a good base, with lots of crevaces to fill with cheese.  It feels heartier, too.<br /><br />You can taste the veggie powders used in this pasta.  To me, there is a flavor of mild tomato soup and mild vegetable broth, as though you've cooked the pasta in a concentrated vegetable broth.  I tastes pretty good, and actually makes the mac and cheese taste great!  Even my hubby liked it!<br /><br />Along with the vegetables, you also get fiber and protein with the pasta.  There's a good amount of Vitamin A, which usually isn't in pasta.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend at least trying Ronzoni Garden Delight in place of regular pasta in most any dish.  It adds a different flavor, but it isn't overpowering and blends into your meal.  Whether it's a hot or cold dish, using this radiatore in it makes it healthier and tasty.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- good flavor, can taste mild vegetable flavors<br />- cooks up well and easily<br />- provides extra nutrition regular pasta doesn't<br /><br />CONS:<br />- more expensive than regular pasta

I can feed a whole one as a special treat -- but often cut them into smaller pieces as treats and rewards.<br /><br />Amazon gave me the best pricing and shipping options.

review/summary: Unaccommodating, Poor Customer Service, Awful Product
review/text: I ordered these steaks for a dinner party. I contacted the seller to let them know that my guests had more than enough negative comments on the steaks. They had said that they were inedible, that they were grainy and fatty. There was also a comment that they had shrunk considerably in size. We spent well over $300 for this product only to be extremely disappointed. We wound up throwing the half eaten steaks out.  When I contacted the seller, they could careless on what my guests had said. Couldnt care that we wound up throwing away over $300 in steaks and did not want to credit my account nor re-ship the product to satisfy a commitment.<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE.....DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  VERY EXPENSIVE FOR POOR QUALITY.

review/summary: So-so
review/text: Bought this for my bento boxes, since it was getting exhausting packing up everyone's unused ginger in a takeout container every time I visited a Sushi bar.<br /><br />Yes, this tastes like ginger, but its just mediocre. Not outstanding. It lacks the potent ginger flavor that most pickled ginger has. It's also not dyed pink like it is at restaurants, but I didn't deduct stars for that. I'd rather have it un-dyed.<br /><br />I don't really think it's worth the money, and it's especially not worth the money if you go through ginger quickly, like I do. I make my own pickled ginger at home now. Very simple, and much cheaper. Unless you urgently need pickled ginger, I'd highly recommend googling a pickled ginger recipe.

review/summary: Not Up To Expectations.
review/text: I was looking through the Asian section of my local grocery store and found 6-ounce bottles of Sushi Chef Pickled Ginger. I love this stuff in Asian Restaurants, and I'm thinking mostly of Japanese food.  Well, these bottles are not nearly as good. They seem to lack the crisp taste and zest of ginger. Plus, they have kind of a yellowish color, particularly up against the bottle margin, rather than the pink color I associate with ginger. I'm wondering if I didn't get a jar that had aged too long on the shelf. There is no expiration date on the bottle, I might add. Alas, I was happy to find this, but I will not be purchasing it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: SUPER salty!
review/text: These have really increased in salt over the years - I've been using them occasionally for about 20 years now and after buying them for a quick dinner, that certainly won't be happening again!  The salt, UGH!  May as well go to the ocean and swallow a mouthful, or even the Dead Sea.  I don't normally buy prepackaged items like this because of all the preservatives, but this one is quite ridiculous.  It would really be nice if someone could invent a prepackaged item like this without all the salt and whatever else you don't recognize on the label!  It's just SO unhealthy for kids and adults, especially those with high blood pressure.  PLEASE, we're busy moms.  SOMEONE invent something that's quick, easy, and HEALTHY!  Can't recommend this one - I was asked to not buy them again from a family of hungry boys.  You know, that says about everything!

review/summary: Fatal Flavor Flaw
review/text: Roland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce have a strange and unpleasant, vaguely chemical taste that is hard to describe, slightly metallic, perhaps an artificial smoke flavor or dried spices. Roland doesn't generally manufacture their own products but private-labels those from other manufacturers and I have to wonder who cans these.<br /><br />Other brands that I have tried like San Marcos and Casa Fiesta are much better and cleaner tasting. My advice is to buy one of those brands or at least try one can before committing to a case of these if you haven't tasted them.<br /><br />Besides this fatal flavor flaw they are pretty much the same as any other chipotle in adobo, nice whole peppers swimming in sauce, smoky and addictive to people who like to eat hot peppers. They will squirt when you bite them so I usually cut them in half in the kitchen.<br /><br />Bottom line, I have been using them in recipes where they lend heat and the flavor will be buried but I can't eat them with chips or use them as a sauce on top of anything because of the flavor and I won't be ordering them again.

Pricing can seem a little steep because an item like this is heavy to ship so I always try to compare first keeping in mind gas and Costco memberships cost money too; subscribe and save is often a really good deal.<br /><br />It's worth hunting this one down though because it has such a creamy flavor that it does the best job in recipes, sandwiches and the like for me. No strong salad dressing tastes like with Miracle Whip stuff, which is *not* mayo IMO.<br /><br />The only mayonnaise I've had that I could say was better tasting was a homemade version but that's an awful lot of trouble and then I have to worry about the eggs. This is as close to perfect as I've been able to find.

review/summary: Flavorful, Delightfully Textured Strawberry Jam. Maybe Even Worth the Price.
review/text: I first heard of Tiptree Little Scarlet when Bonnie S. Benwick raved about it in "The Washington Post" in 2004, claiming that the little jar of preserve "happens to be worth the $10 to $13 it now goes for". Really? A jam? I've never cared much for jams. I find them too sweet for my taste and of invariably poor texture. Gross texture, really. But my curiosity was piqued when I found out that James Bond had Little Scarlet  on whole wheat toast for breakfast in Ian Fleming's "From Russia with Love". The book, not the movie. Tiptree brand is owned by Wilkin & Sons, Ltd., a family business that has been farming in and around the town of Tiptree in Essex, England for 300 years. They started producing preserves in 1885, and the company considers Little Scarlet "the jewel in the crown of Wilkin & Sons delicious range of jams and marmalades."<br /><br />Wilkin & Sons make a large and diverse line of preserves, jellies, and marmalades, including 6 different strawberry preserves and one strawberry jelly. Little Scarlet is distinguished by the berry from which it takes its name. The Little Scarlet is a particular variety of strawberry that originated in the United States. It's a fickle crop, and Tiptree is believed to be the world's only commercial grower of the diminutive berries. They are described as "a tiny, intensely-flavoured strawberry", no more than 2 cm in length. They're the size of raspberries, and you can see whole berries in the Little Scarlet preserve. They're grown on the Tiptree estates, which makes their quantity limited, and the company awards "vintage status" to the years that produce particularly good crops. 2006 was a vintage year.<br /><br />Little Scarlet preserve has a stronger flavor than other strawberry jams and an excellent texture. It is very sweet. Even though I normally cringe at sweet stuff, I am attracted to Little Scarlet by the rich flavor. And the texture is incomparable to supermarket and most "gourmet" brands of jam, which tend to suffer an unappetizing gelatinous texture, the product of too much pectin. Tiptree adds pectin only when necessary, and they are careful to add no more than is needed. Little Scarlet has a smooth, substantial texture whether you're eating a berry or the stuff in between. It costs twice as much in the US as in the UK and is labeled "preserve" here and "conserve" there. But it's not Tiptree's most expensive jam. That distinction belongs to the Mulberry preserve, whose fruit is picked from fewer than 20 trees that grow behind the company's factory.

Little Scarlet seems to be a specific variety of fruit that they grow only at Tiptree.<br /><br />This must be the most expensive preserve I've ever tried and it's way, way ahead of anything else I know of.  You can see the tiny individual berries suspended in a rich red jelly before you even open the jar.<br /><br />Under the lid, mine said "Peter Wilkin, chairman, is the great grandson of the founder".  Aren't family businesses just wonderful?<br /><br />I tried Little Scarlet with fresh croissants and it was quite simply the best!

As I write this, I am visiting friends in England.  I am heading back to the States tomorrow with quite a few jars of Little Scarlet...at a price that, even with the dollar tanking miserably against the pound, is quite the bargain (though the most expensive preserve on the shelves here as well)!

I grew up eating my grandmother's homemade scones with this precious Little Scarlet Strawberry Preserve. It was always a special treat. It truly is an experience of flavor intensity. This is NOT the kind of preserves used for a PB&J! Little Scarlt needs to be the star!! For  those who are "preserve enthusiasts" if you will, Little Scarlet is a must try...if only once. The price is a bit of a shock to say the least, but it truly is worth it. The Little Scarlet is a rare and precious crop. Enjoy it. Feel special while you eat it. The Queen of England has it with her tea every day! (or so I've been told!)

review/summary: Damn good jam!
review/text: In short, Little Scarlet is the one of the most delicious jam I've ever eaten. I used to disregard strawberry jam in favour of raspberry as I usually found strawberry to be cloyingly sweet and short on flavour. LS is certainly the exception.  It's intensly flavoured and, for me, only rivaled by the homemade jam my friend's Mother in Law makes from wild strawberries picked by hand in Prince Edward Island.<br /><br />I first tried Little Scarlet @ 10 yrs ago on my first trip to London at a *very* fancy hotel's, outrageously expensive, High Tea. Everything at that tea was exceptional (as one would hope after taking out a mortgage to attend) and, even then, this fabulous jam stood out.  I inquired, expecting to be told that it was hand-made, in single pot quantities, by magical fairies ;-)  I was shocked to learn that it's a commercial jam and could be purchased retail at the gourmet shops in Fortnum & Mason, Harrods, Selfridges and other such fancy-ass shops.<br /><br />My next stop after tea was Fortnum & Mason thinking Little Scarlet would be an ideal souvenir for friends & family. I should have braced myself for the sticker shock.  Even back in 2003, with the British Pound at almost $2.25 Canadian, LS commanded a price of over 7 Pounds.  I'd never seen such an expensive little jar of jam but it was my first time in England and I was feeling high-falootin (how does one spell 'fallootin'?) so I scooped up several jars to wow the folks back home with.  Thank goodness the airlines hadn't yet cut back so severely on luggage weight!<br /><br />No big surprise, everyone LOVED it and the search began to find LS in Canada & the States.  It turned out that it is produced in small batches (although, disappointingly, not by magical fairies)and its' availability varies drastically depending on the size of the year's crop at Tiptree.  Entire years have since gone by where I couldn't source a drop of it by any means :-(<br /><br />I ended up bribing coworkers from our London office to be buy it up for me whenever they could find it at UK shops (yes, at any price).  They'd then send it over to me with the next business traveler heading back 'across the pond' to Corp Head Office in Canada (where I was located).  I'd send the traveler home with a king's ransom in Canada Grade A Light Maple Syrup (a big hit "over'ome" where corn syrup is the standard)or a fistful of cash, whichever they preferred.<br /><br />I was delighted (and truly shocked) recently to find this gem of a jam at a new gourmet shop in, of all places, Niagara Falls NY!  At only US $14 a jar it was an relative steal and I stocked up :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />I just enjoyed my breakfast toast & jam (on yesterday's Ace Bakery baguette, yummo!) and felt the need to extol the virtues of the Little Scarlet. If you're on the fence about spending big bucks for a little jar of jam I recommend treating yourself to the LS - it's very much a treat indeed.

review/summary: Amazing value
review/text: This is a way better price, especially for organic seeds.  They have a great flavor and will last a long time, because they are in three separate bags.  These are great for making your own mustard, pickles, or indian food.

review/text: I make a fresh prepared mustard using Frontier Mustard Seed (brown which I grind coarsely and ground yellow). You can't get the same intense flavor from highly processed recipes that you will discover with freshly prepared mustard.  Frontier mustard is of the consistent quality and flavor I demand; I'm proud to use it in my product and gladly award 5 stars.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: The flavor is wonderful.  I use them all the time.  I wasn't sure how much 48 ounces was, it is a bunch.  More mustard seeds than I could use in years and years.

review/text: Adds a lot of flavor. Really good value if you have a spice mill or a Vita-mix to grind the seeds into a powder.

review/summary: "You don't smell it son, you drink it."
review/text: Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.<br /><br />There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. "And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit." (1 Nephi 8:12)<br /><br />If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.<br /><br />After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you! Let the sakura petals fall and the joy pebble dance commence!
