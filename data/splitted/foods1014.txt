review/summary: Best pectin ever!
review/text: With regular pectin you usually have to use a lot of sugar to get your pectin to gel.  With Pomona's, sugar is not required to ensure your jam gels.  The box comes with a packet of calcium powder that you mix with water.  The calcium water and enclosed pectin are what create the gel when added to fruit, so you can make jam or jelly with low or no sugar.  This is a real win because most jam/jelly recipes with regular pectin call for A LOT of sugar.  With Pomona's, you can omit sugar, or go with limited sugar, Agave, or honey.  Your end product tastes like fruit, not sugar.  I made pluot jelly, and my son made hot pepper jelly, and both were delicious.  I'll use Pomona's next year with berries, too.  If you are new to canning, I highly recommend Pomona's.  It's more forgiving than regular pectin, which sometimes fails to gel. In terms of cost, Pomona's is comparable to regular pectin, in that you can get 2-3 batches from a single box.  I love this product!  Just wish I'd found out about it years ago, when I started making jams and jellies.<br /><br />I'm anxious to try some of the other Pomona's recipes, like jello made with real fruit juice and low/no-fat salad dressing.  Pomona's is the only pectin I'll buy.

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: I had found this product last year at Wegmans, I bought it but was reluctant to try. However, since we as a family have been trying to reduce our sugar intake I decided to try it using honey. The results were fabulous, my jams received many compliments, my friends have been asking for more. So far I have made cherry, strawberry, blueberry and "Bluebarb" jam (blueberries and Ruhbarb). I am getting ready for the peach and apricot season.  I even tried a "Cherry Elderflower liquor" jam...again I keep amazing myself with the results. I will never go back to any other pectin.....I bought six boxes to keep me well stocked for the winter too. Who knows what other bright idea I may get.

I like how easy it is to make small batches when needed.  I love how easy it is to not use any sugar or just a little to help keep the color of some fruits.

review/summary: Price has almost doubled in less than a MONTH......
review/text: I purchased this Pectin on April 16, 2012 (this year) and paid $23.58 for the (6) 1oz packages (with Free super-saver shipping). Its a GREAT product, and I love being able to have all my creations *sugar free*.  HOWEVER, I guess since the spring harvest has officially started and canning of jams/jellys is offically underway, the price has been jacked up by almost 100%.  I had come back to buy more, (remember I place my first order just over a month ago) but I was shocked at the price increase. Instead of buying from Amazon I'll be buying from the manufactuor, where I can get 2lbs (32ozs) for under a hundred dollars, including shipping. I know the star system should reflect the product, which in my opinion is top notch.  But in this instance I think the consumer should be made aware of the price gouging being done, which happens to alot of *canning items* from May-September.

review/summary: The BEST pectin - don't bother with the others!
review/text: Pamona's Pectin was a late find for me after being frustrated for many years with the "low sugar" pectins still having tons of sugar and having problems gelling.  I have used this to make jam with alternative (healthier) sugars like Agave nectar and they still came out great!  At first glance, you might think that this quality of a pectin will run you more money (and it would still be worth it!) but each box of pectin makes up to 4 batches of jam!  This is so much more economical and easy to add "just a bit" more of pectin if you want a certain recipe a tad thicker.  They have great basic directions in the box and a very friendly and knowledgeable jam line to help with any other questions.  Don't hesitate to give this one a try!

review/summary: Best option for low sugar jam
review/text: Most pectins (Sure-Jell, etc) require as much or more sugar than fruit to gel- 8 cups crushed fruit and 10 cups white sugar does not inspire me to want to make jam!  But with Universal Pectin you can cut that as low as you like- I usually go around 8 cups fruit and 2 cups white sugar.  You can also use honey or other sweeteners.  DO KEEP IN MIND that sugar is one of the reasons canning jam is very low risk (botulism wise) so if you use low sugar you need to be very careful to boil your filled jars for at least 30 minutes.  Acid also prevents botulism, so I usually use 1/2 cup lemon juice as well, just to be safe.  I don't can vegetables, too risky, and remember that rhubarb is a vegetable so you can't make low sugar strawberry-rhubarb jam safely.  Honestly, with sweet fruit, some sugar, and lemon juice in my jams I usually don't bother boiling the finished jars, just flip them over to get them to seal, but my sister the biologists frowns on that.

review/summary: Don't bother with this, just use corn starch
review/text: I've been making jam for years using low-sugar Sure-Jell (you can get away with using even less sugar than listed on the package if you're generous with the lemon juice).  My jam always comes out beautifully.  Unfortunately, I ran out of Sure-Jell tonight, and used a packet of Pomona's Universal Pectin that was sitting in my cupboard instead.  BIG mistake.  The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded.  I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch.  Ick!  Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell.

review/summary: Excellent & healthy chocolate option
review/text: As a diabetic on a calorie counting weight loss program, I initially bought dark chocolate sugar free bars from YC chocolate, and fell in love with them immediately to get my daily sweet tooth fix. I also give it to my toddler son to increase his calorie/protein intake and he actually loves it (albeit I have been very careful not to give him any non-dark or sugared chocolate so far). This bulk pack have bite size pieces and saves me the work of breaking up the bars. They are also slighly cheaper than the bars. These chocoaltes as a whole are more expensive than other brands, but the taste more than makes up for the cost.<br /><br />Dark chocolates are an acquired taste, so it would help to first buy them from a local grocey store and acquire a taste before moving up to these ones. In my experience, any chocolate is best consumed prior to having milk tea/coffee/chai/hot chocolate and allowing them to melt in the mouth rather than chew on them.

review/summary: Dark, sugar-free & oh-so-yummy! Can't lose!!!
review/text: This was an impulse buy after fruitlessly searching my local organic food stores (and non-organic stores too) for many weeks trying to find affordable dark (at least 70% cocoa), sugar-free chocolate. Not an easy task! Saw this item on Amazon, whom I always turn to when solutions seem slim, and ordered it immediately... the previous reviews looked good...<br /><br />The "tiny tabs" are just the right bite-size so I don't have to whack a big bar into smithereens to have a small portion. The 3-pound size lasts for a good while in the fridge. The mouth-feel is excellent and the taste is just as good as sugary chocolate. I'm happy! Gotta have my dark chocolate! When can I order some more, Amazon! Don't fail me now!!!!

Enjoy 3 or 4 tabs each day (about 1/3 of an ounce) great with a cup of coffee... a great treat!

review/text: This is a wonderful dark chocolate for those who are looking to get their chocolate fix with minimal calories and without sugar.  Each of these tiny tabs are only 13 calories, and it only takes a couple to really satisfy that "need" for chocolate.  It melts slowly in your mouth and is a rich, creamy chocolate.  I would NEVER know it was sugar free.  On top of all that... because it is 70% cocoa, it is FULL of antioxidants.<br /><br />The company is excellent.  I needed some additional nutritional information, sent them an email, and got a very prompt reply.<br /><br />One more thing... sometimes, just for a special treat, I will drop one or two of these into a hot cup of coffee.

It is absolutely delicious mixed with some vanilla yogurt. It's also good tossed into the blender with a banana, chocolate syrup, ice and water for a smoothie. Chia seeds are good for you and provide lots of protein. I have mild hypoglycemia and need to eat often but this paired with greek vanilla yogurt keeps me feeling full for hours. It's a deal if you subscribe and save too. This is $10 for a single bag on Amazon, about $8 for a single bag at Whole Foods, and $4.50 per bag if you buy 12 at once.

I have recommended this food to others and their dogs LOVE this food. No grains and that it is certified kosher for Passover make this an added bonus.

review/summary: Evangers' has questionable practices. Search the internet
review/text: I stopped feeding Evanger's to my German Shepherd. I do not trust their products because the owners have done some very dishonest things and violated FDA manufacturing procedures. Search the internet the info is out there. The company can say whatever they want but I personally feel that if a person is dishonest in one area of their life, then most likely they will be dishonest in all areas. People need to make responsible choices for what their pets eat. It can be inconvenient, but so are vet visits and pet deaths due to poor manufacturing.<br /><br />My GSD did try the Evanger's lamb and rice and the beef flavor, but did not like it very much.<br /><br />Just an FYI: I have changed ALL his food and put him on a grain free diet. I did it for his itchy skin but soon realized that his diarrhea and vomiting/nausea went away completely.<br /><br />I feed him Orijen dry kibble. It cost me more to feed him, but I save a bundle in vet visits. This is what I am sticking with.

review/summary: More like Extreme Wing Concentrate...
review/text: This stuff is awesome.<br /><br />I followed the recommendations from Ashley Foods "This wing sauce possesses heat from Hell for the wildest heat-freak, but can be tempered for more civilized folk by mixing it with any favorite sauce or marinade."<br /><br />I mixed it with Frank's and it's delicious.  I mixed about 2 parts Frank's to 1 part Mad Dog.  The next time I mixed about 3 to 1 and the last time I mixed 1 to 1.  I would let them marinade overnight.  Each time they were delicious.  I would make up a whole batch and I would only get to eat about two or three before everyone else snatched them up.<br /><br />I've only tried them with this sauce on the grill.  The first time they were on a Coleman griddle type grill.  Every time we would close the lid and open it back up we ended up coughing from breathing in the sauce.  I thought they would be unbearable, but they turned out great.<br /><br />The next two times, I cooked them on just a regular grill surface and I think a lot of the sauce burned off but they were still really spicy.  The nice thing about cooking them on the grill was that they turned out really crispy.<br /><br />I bought 8 more bottles of this stuff.  I'm going to try a baked and fried recipe to see how they turn out.  I'm also going to try different dilutions and possibly all by itself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce to anyone that likes spicy wings.  I would start off by mixing it with your favorite wing sauce first.  It's definitely potent.

review/summary: What's Not To Love
review/text: These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories (130 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving) and they taste great.  Simply put I love everything about these chips.  The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time.  I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it.  They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.

review/summary: Get real salty, real fast...
review/text: We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.

review/summary: Great Low-Fat Snack
review/text: I love chips but don't love all the fat and calories they have.  These are a great alternative.  One serving (one ounce) has 120 calories and 3.5 grams of fat.  These taste great and have a nice satisfying crunch just like chips do but are much better for me.  My only complaint is that the butter flavor sometimes leaves a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  I've also tried the sea salt flavor and the white cheddar flavor.  Neither of those leave an aftertaste.  My favorite is the white cheddar flavor.

The texture can be compared to how hand tossed and thin crust pizza are the same. Its a thinner rice cake meets a pita chip. Could have a stronger flavor but I'm just that kind of girl. 4 stars on the muchy rating scale. Feels like you get more in a bag than you would potato chips. Plus they "feel" healthier, which definitely helps when youre slinging back airline bloody marys. Came in a huge box of many but don't threaten me with a good time, They are being whittled down as we speak. Only shame is you can't buy a variety box. Ah well, *munch munch munch*

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I've tried all the Popcorner flavors, and for a while I was completely addicted to the cheddar ones, but now the Sea Salt ones are my absolute favorites.<br /><br />They taste very similar to tortilla chips or baked corn chips- but with a slightly airy texture. And the salt is divine- I LOVE salty things, so the extra sprinkle of salt is much appreciated. These are light, airy, healthy snacks that pack the same punch as a treat that wouldn't be as kind to your body. They truly satisfy a craving for crispy and salty snacks without making you feel as if you liked a giant crystal of salt and scorched your mouth (the drawback to eating Fritos...)<br /><br />Here's a tip though- since the salt isn't baked into the chip or coated on with oils, it's best to REALLY shake the bag of Popcorners before eating- that way all the salt that had settled on the bottom of the bag get sprinkled back on the chips.<br /><br />Great everyday treat that satisfies and doesn't make you feel parched and guilty for indulging. My whole family loves them.

review/text: This product has been waited for, I can personally say all my life. I love popcorn, but hate the things that usually come with it. It always gets stuck in the teeth or in the back of your throat. Not with Pop Corners, here you can eat and eat and never have anything get stuck or choke you. I love it, and I wish I could keep buying it. Sea Salt is my all time favorite and I try to get it as much as I possible can afford it. Buying by the case made it great, having as much as I want, when I want it, but it can get a bit expensive. But when the time is right I will be buying more to enjoy. If I could scream this out my window, I would scream for everyone to buy Pop corners.

The 5 ounce bag is almost the size of regular chip bags, not individual bags.

review/summary: The only problem is, after the first bite, you cannot stop.
review/text: I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors. But this bag of Popcorners is no typical popcorn. First of all, I purchased it on line, attracted by the packaging of course (one really eat with the eyes!), which jumps out of the usual bright pink or yellow colors you see when it comes to popcorns. Also thinking it might be just an alternation of "baked chips," already quite popular in the market. Even after I received it, I still thought "The wrapping's really lovely. But I'm just gonna try out a bite...".<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop after the first bite. Who knew something so simple, with only three ingredients for this flavor, could be this sensational? It's crispy yet thick in the texture. The size of each piece is not too big nor too small. The natural scent of corn is just delightful to the palate. Don't need to lick the fingers....I'm completely amazed and will be venturing into the other flavors. This is one snack food I'd be munching out. Ditch the bags of chips at lunch, try this!

review/text: Like quite a few other reviews, I discovered these on a JetBlue flight. I did try to find them when I landed too. But, it's really not so easy. I did find them when I got home though and have been eating them ever since. The Sea Salt are my favorite by far. I was lucky enough to get that flavor on the flight. If it had been one of the others, I may have never eaten them again. I've tried the Butter (way too salty) and Kettle (too sweet). So, I went back to Sea Salt and stayed there. My favorite thing about them is there are only 3 ingredients all of which you can pronounce.

review/text: Popcorner chips taste great, but don't be fooled by the "low calorie" bit.  They are low in fat compared to regular potato chips, but the calories are fairly close.  For example, the calorie count for 1oz of Popcorners is about 120.  The calorie count for 1oz of Kettle Chips is 150.<br /><br />That being said, if you aren't thinking you're eating them for health reasons, they're great and tasty as a snack!

review/summary: Popcorn lovers -- you really should try this
review/text: I love popcorn but after trying these, I don't know if I should ever bother popping corn again.  The taste of these is wonderful and I really like the crunchiness of the chip.  Best of all, however, one can have them anytime by simply opening a bag.  While popcorn can be popped, stored and eaten later, good as it is, it is never quite as good as it is freshly-popped.  These taste great however, and I would rank them very close to freshly popped popcorn -- add convenience and crunch and they pull ahead in my eyes.<br />Note that I am really basing my comparison on the Kettlecorn variety so I, perhaps, shouldn't be comparing it to plain popcorn, but I would rate this against regular kettlecorn similarly, and I suspect that the regular popcorn varieties would hold their own.<br /><br />The additional sugar in the Kettlecorn version weighs in at only 3g in a one-ounce serving so despite the great taste, it isn't exactly drenched in sugar.  If you love Kettlecorn or popcorn, you should give PopCorners a try.

review/summary: I love this coffee, but it is very mild.
review/text: I have recently switched to decaf most of the time, and love the convenience of K-cups for making a fresh cup. Only a few K-cup coffees taste as strong as I used to brew a pot (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL4ZY">Tully's Coffee Decaffeinated French Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> (extra bold) is the only decaf variety that can make that claim, and can be brewed in 10 oz. size!) and these Green Mountain flavored varieties are on the weak side. I brew them in 6-oz size to get them as strong as possible, and they aren't bad. I don't like sugar in my coffee and love flavored varieties, and these are very nice and elegant tasting. My husband can't abide flavored coffee so the K-cup machine (ours is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049NVR3S">SS-780SA Single Serve Brewing System</a>) has solved the problem of freshness, decaf vs. caffeine, and flavor vs. unflavored. He prefers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZE83FA">Tully's French Roast Extra Bold Coffee For Keurig K-Cup Brewing Systems 18 K-cups Count</a>.

review/text: These gummy bears are tasty and slightly larger than the standard ones.  I don't know how authentic the pineapple flavor is, but if you're the sort of person who always pulls the clear looking gummy bears out of the bag first, these are the ones for you.<br /><br />One complaint: there is no product information on the bag.  No ingredients list, no nutritional information, nothing.  If you go to the seller's website, the ingredients and nutritional information are listed there. (Ingredients: corn syrup, sugar, gelatin, citric acid, sorbitol, natural & artificial flavors, vegetable oil, carnauba wax, 120 calories in a serving (all from sugar), which is 12 gummy bears.)  The packaging is clearly custom and well made, so I can't think why they wouldn't include something so basic.

review/summary: Everyone Loves My Gravy - Beef, Turkey, Chicken, Pork
review/text: I love to make simple roasts with gravy for mashed potatoes, bread stuffing or Yorkshire Pudding - Gravy Master and a touch of dissolved corn starch in stock are the secret to success with any of your pan drippings. Gravy master is not a thickener, it adds color, clarity and flavor to your gravies.  It is a blend of caramelized vegetables, no meat products.  I think the flavor is superior to Bisto and Kitchen Bouquet and it gives sauces a better natural browned color.  My significant other is working on maintaining a vegetarian diet but loves gravy - I'm going to give this a go with Kitchen Basics Vegetable Stock, mushrooms and carmelized shallots and see if I can come up with a great gravy for him and I bet it will be good. This product wasn't available on the west coast for many years - I used to bring home 4-6 bottles in my suitcase from trips back east.  Now I've been able to find it online and even in stores in California. Sorry to see it is no longer made in Branford, Connecticut - where it was a small family business for years - looks like the product has gained a new manufacturer and distribution though and maintained it's superior quality.

review/summary: Far ahead of other, similar products across the board
review/text: This is a first class product. It nicely colors gravies which would otherwise be a bit pale, and does this with a natural-looking dark brown coloring. It does not look artificial and does not add an unrealistic, shiny appearance to the gravy. It also has only a very faint aroma, and the slight aroma it has is quite pleasant; some of the other competing products have, in my opinion, a clearly unpleasant odor to them, a major drawback. Lastly, a little bit goes a long way, and one bottle lasts a very long time. Fortunately, the product seems to have a very long shelf-life. The only drawback I'm aware of is that it is hard to find in stores, the competitors, unfortunately, are clearly more popular with the retailers than this high-quality product is.

review/summary: Love the soynut butter.
review/text: Just over a 1 1/2 yrs ago, we discovered my son had a peanut allergy.  My introduction to soynut butter came after that.  I was curious about what the chocolate flavor would be like.  The only place I could find it was here on Amazon.  I took the plunge and am VERY glad I did.  It makes a tasty sandwich with jelly or my favorite is with bananas.  Plain is great too.  I use this as a substitute in recipes that call for peanut butter in them.  My only wish is that Amazon would offer the subscribe option and keep this (all flavors) in stock regularly.  They were out for many months and it was expensive buying it anywhere else.

review/summary: It grows on me
review/text: My youngest daughter was just diagnosed with a peanut allergy. The doctor also said she was reactive to tree nuts, so we are staying away from it all. I tried Sunflower Butter first and found it so disgusting I gave the jar away to someone else. This was my next try since my oldest daughter recently discovered Nutella from a friend. It's not Nutella, but it's not bad either.  It's a mild chocolate taste, and I guess the soy has a very different taste than peanut butter. More grassy or dirt like - I know that sounds gross, but it's not as nutty tasting as peanut butter. It is still smooth and the grassy undertones aren't horrible like I found the sunflower butter to be. I find myself eating it on bread or crackers like peanut butter. After a while it's a pretty good taste, I don't notice it's not peanut butter.

review/text: Having tried the creamy soy butter (same brand) and loving it, I thought this could be amazing as I am also a chocoholic. Unfortunately, the whole family found it repulsive. It tastes nothing like chocolate! If you want the flavor combination then I recommend the regular soy butter (the crunchy version is also delicious!) and either sprinkle chocolate chips on it (try it! you won't regret it!) or for some serious indulging drizzle with a little left over ganache! Now that's YUM! As for this "chocolate soy butter" concoction, our jar is still sitting in the pantry, uneaten and unloved.

review/text: I normally go for Fiber One or Kellogg's Fiber Plus bars when I need a "grab and go" snack bar. By comparison, these are less tough than the Fiber One (Oats & Chocolate) bars, and much larger than the Fiber Plus bars. The main content of the bar is comprised of tiny rice puffs (think Dip'n Dots, but smaller), with cashews and cranberries mixed in. The Chicory Root Extract holds it all together, but I imagine if they stayed in the sun, they would not hold together well. Tasty treat if you need something on the go; and 11g of fiber is nearly, if not double the content of other fiber bars. 7g of sugar is also low by comparison to competing brands as well. Definitely recommend trying them :)

I didn't even know they were supposed to BE this soft. Guess my local corner market in Sherman Oaks didn't always stock the latest supply.<br /><br />The tubs these come in are extremely sturdy yet super easy to open.  Having each twist individually wrapped rules too as it cuts down on the mess and promotes sharing.  That way, hopefully you won't inhale ALL of these yourself because, buster... it'd be easy to do!  The mix of flavors is very uniform throughout both containers.

review/summary: THESE ARE THE BEST
review/text: We used to buy these at a local store, they quite carrying them, and Amazon saved the day!  You get a LOT of these in an order, but it's good thing, because they are addictive.
