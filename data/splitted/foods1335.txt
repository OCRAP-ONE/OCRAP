review/summary: Not awful
review/text: Three stars cawz Amazon don't allow 2.5  The flavor is good, salty, iodiney, and savory. But the problem is, tiny bits of shell or other sea debris--tho not as much as the kelp product has. The bits are not hard shell, and can probably be chewed, but I don'y advize.  After sprinkling take alook for tiny white particles and, uh, fish them out. If you use this stuff to get iodine, don't. Take a pill or liquid with'ich you know the dose. "Whole" dulse is a better product, which you can rinse and clean yourself.

review/summary: Dulse - Great for Pets, too!
review/text: Another quality product available from Amazon!  I used dulse for our dog and cats - Extra vitamins used like salt in sprinkling a bit on their canned food.  I've used it for years, ordered it before from a vitamin store.  This time I'd try ordering it through Amazon.  My expectations were met, I am extremely happy with the product.  Amazon was wonderful and once more the shipping was quick and efficient.

review/text: I put it in everything I cook from oatmeal to chili to spaghetti sauce.  It is great.  On a whole-foods, plants only diet, after taste buds return to normal (i.e., not expecting high fat, high sugar, high salt but now tasting the real food itself -- very enjoyable), this suffices.

review/text: Hot Tamales are my candy of choice so when i saw this deal on Amazon i couldnt pass it up.<br /><br />Although the candies seemed a bit stale they also were a darker red then I am used to maybe it was a bad batch but it seemed that when these were made they had a weird wax tasted to them, not like the typical Hot Tamales I get in a box from the grocery store.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Sure but if they had the same texture I wouldnt. I will give them the benefit of the doubt on this purchase and hope that it was just a bad batch.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk.

review/summary: Olewo works!
review/text: I have been using Olewo carrots and beets for about a year now. The difference in my dogs is like day and night! Their coats are now shiny, luxurious and soft. Color and pigment are vibrant. I love the deep reds and dark blacks on my German Shepherds. Olewo also helps regulate the digestive system and their stools are better than ever. No more anal gland or digestive issues. Very simple to prepare and extremely cost effective as well. To top it all off, Olewo is very palatable and the dogs LOVE the taste. Bowls are licked clean after Olewo!

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have a pretty picky cat, but she loves this cat food. I love it too because it's in small cans, so the leftovers don't sit in the fridge for more than a day. No off flavors or smells get a chance to develop. My cat absolutely hates the pre-formed chunks, shreds, etc. She only likes natural fish flakes, and that's what this product provides. The only thing similar is Trader Joe's 100% tuna. It's a great buy, but you need to live near a Trader Joe's, and the cans are larger. So sometimes I'd have to throw out the leftover food because it didn't get eaten fast enough. A local pet store carried the Tiki Cat Ahi Tuna, so I was able to purchase it there. Sadly, they've stopped carrying it, but I'm happy to have found an internet source.

review/text: My cat loves tuna fish, but I was appalled when I opened this can and saw/smelled the ingredients - brown, smelly tuna mixed with something green (not sure why cats need veggies in their diets).  I presented it to my cat (who will eat anything), and she walked away meowing, so I gave her something else which she quickly gobbled up.  I was gagging as I flushed the can down the sink and donated the rest to an animal shelter.<br /><br />Only recommend if your cat is a tuna hound and loves horribly smelly food, and if you have a strong stomach!!

review/summary: SUPER CUTE, VERRRYY Sweet, smell amazing..a weird review...
review/text: This is going to be a weird review for me :) I got 2 pkgs of these and at first taste I thought they were toOOOoOOoo sweet. Now, I am not a super big sweets fan, although I do like a very chocolate cake with a very chocolate icing etc, I prefer pasta or cheeses to cookies :)  So, I took the spare pack to work with me. This was a great idea because I get to pass along a LOT of thoughts in one review! Everyone said they were very, very sweet. So, the consensus is that if you don't mind sweet (like canned frosting taste, and sweet, and very little Oreo flavor mixed together with sprinkles on top) then you will LOVE LOVE these cookies!! That is exactly what they taste like! Also, if you love cute cookies, we all agreed they are adorable. Sprinkles!! How cute! Little layers inside! So cute!<br /><br />They are super melty. I had HAD to keep em in the fridge. A good note for whatever plans you may have. Also, they do have a very strong scent. Personally, and this is the weird part, I could sleep in this bag! I used to buy these amazing air fresheners that were marketed as vanilla. Well, every time ANYONE came in my house they were so disappointed that I wasn't baking a treat. Over and over: Sorry, it's just my air freshener. Sorry..." Sigh. Well, these smell exactly like it! Yummy, vanilla, cookie cake smell. Love it.<br /><br />I don't know how this all adds up for you. I won't be buying them again because of my not loving super sweet stuff. But if you do, you should give them a try. If your darling daughter loves tea parties, she would love these too! Oh, by the way, they are much smaller than any oreo. These are a pretty slim cookie.

review/text: I like Oreos. OK, I love Oreos. I am one of those people who need to hide them from myself because it is way too easy to go through a whole bunch of them before I realize that I've just surpassed my weekly caloric intake. I also love fudge. So when I read the ingredients of these little cookies I was really excited. When I got my package in the mail form Amazon, I couldn't wait to try them. Overall, I like the way they taste, but they didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />The cookies are much thinner than the regular Oreos. They are essentially "half of an Oreo" covered with fudge, although the crispy part may be even thinner than that. The fudge covering is very tasty as well, but again nothing spectacular.<br /><br />When it comes to nutritional content, these cookies are definitely inferior to the regular Oreos. They contain 9 g of fat, 4.5 g of saturated fat, and 17 g of sugar as opposed to 7 g, 2 g, and 14 g respectively in regular Oreos.<br /><br />These cookies are very tasty, but not as tasty as you would have suspected based on the list of ingredients. I certainly prefer the regular Oreos taste, and when it comes to similar fudge-covered cookies I think they are better alternatives out there.

review/summary: Yummy change from typical Oreo
review/text: I love Golden Oreos as well as the regular chocolate. I decided to give these a try for something different. They were surprisingly good. You get the familiar Oreo taste but it taste the same as if you took the lid off the Oreo & at just the bottom with the creme, which I do sometimes. It's covered in fudge but it's a very thin coating so it doesn't overpower the cookie. Between the creme & the fudge, these are very rich! For those that don't care for overly rich sweets, you may not care for these. My only complaint is that it seems you get less cookies than regular Oreos. They comes in the same plastic packaging but the plastic is divided into slots for each individual cookie. I assume this is so if the fudge melts a little they won't stick together. It appears to reduce the amount of room though so you end up with less. Overall, I enjoyed them & will probably buy again. I have to keep them in the fridge during hot months though to keep the fudge from melting.

If this is true, chances are you have found the occasional thin mint cookie that equaled them but not a thin mint cookie that bettered them,...<br /><br />until now.<br /><br />These <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JGQ16I">Oreo Golden Oreo Fudge Cr&egrave;mes</a>, also available in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XV1TAS">Oreo Regular Fudge Cr&egrave;mes</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XV8XK2">Oreo Mint Fudge Cr&egrave;mes</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JGQ15Y">Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Cr&egrave;mes</a>, are IMHO BETTER tasting than the Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies so while I might in future be persuaded to purchase fund raising thin mint cookies, they will be for other people.<br /><br />I'll be eating these!<br /><br />Note: As other reviewers have noted, this is not an entirely new concept for Oreo, which has offered limited editions of chocolate dipped whole sandwich cookies: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L98AQ2">Oreo Mint Fudge Covered Chocolate Sandwich Cookies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110E15I">Oreo Pure Milk Chocolate Covered Mint Sandwich Cookies</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UQIUA4">Oreo White Fudge Covered Chocolate Sandwich Cookies</a>.  The trouble is that these are by definition limited editions that may not be available when you want to purchase them while the new fudge covered half cookies look to be a regular stock item available year round.

review/summary: Half an Oreo covered in melty fudge
review/text: I'm not sure why Nabisco thinks anyone wants half an Oreo, but that's what you get under the fudge. It's tasty enough, I guess, but it's not what I'm thinking when I buy Oreos. I prefer the traditional Oreo.<br /><br />If it's a warm day or a picnic, you might want to put these in the refrigerator or the cooler because even when just warm, the fudge can make quite a mess.

review/summary: I'll Stick with the Original Oreos
review/text: Never one to turn down chocolate or peanut butter, I eagerly dove into this bag. I must say that the taste is just okay. The peanut butter component was the least satisfying, leaving a bit of an aftertaste. The idea is good, but none of the ingredients are at their best and the balance between them just isn't right -- a little too much peanut butter, in my opinion.<br /><br />That being said, I was supposed to receive "Golden Oreo Fudge Creme," but received the peanut butter instead. A disclaimer on the page states: "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product." In other words, you may not get what you think you're ordering. We know how dangerous this could be to someone with a peanut allergy.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the resealable packaging and it really does keep the cookies fresh when used properly -- it's quite easy to use.

review/summary: Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled as Oreos.
review/text: This review is for the peanut butter fudge oreos.  Evidently they may have the same code as the fudge cremes as this is the link I was given to review them from the Vine program.  The peanut butter fudge oreos are not really oreos in my opinion.  They really shouldn't use the name Oreo as I personally think it implies that they have an oreo taste somewhere in them.  Yes there is a VERY thin oreo crust cookie in them but that taste is overwhelmed by the peanut butter and fudge.  It hardly has any taste of oreo at all.  Also, these cookies are very thin and there aren't as many as I expected in the package.  Nobody in my household likes these cookies.  Everyone who has tried them says they are nothing special and are a very forgettable cookie.  I'm sure there are some people who like them, just not us.

review/text: After having tried the mint chocolate ones offered recently, I have to say that the Golden Oreo Fudge Creme cookies do not hold a candle to them. While they taste okay, I can't see going to the grocery store and buying a package. Really not much in the way of taste except chocolate, but then, if I want chocolate, I'd stick with plain oreo cookies and pay less.<br /><br />The folks at Oreo/Nabisco need to go back to the drawing board on this one.

review/summary: Not what one expects from Oreo
review/text: I ordered these from the Vine program and Peanut Butter Fudge Cremes arrived instead of the Golden Oreos--so this review is for the Peanut Butter Fudge Cremes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a snack cookie, these probably will fulfill your craving for a sweet snack. If you are looking for a dessert cookie, these cookies would probably be okay if served at home. These cookies just don't make the palate tasting grade. The primary flavor is peanut butter and I was hard pressed to say I tasted any fudge. The chocolate seemed to taste a bit waxy and not the smooth rich flavor one associates with Oreo.<br /><br />I would suggest you skip these cookies and go for something with a better marriage of chocolate and peanut butter--perhaps a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HXQPG2">Hershey Reeses Peanut Butter Cup, 1.5 ounces Boxes (Pack of 36)</a>?

review/summary: husband and toddler liked them, mom not so much
review/text: I received a package of peanut butter fudge creams, not golden fudge creams, so I'm reviewing the product received.<br /><br />The cookies are a thin layer of cookie topped with a layer of peanut butter cream (about the same, or perhaps less than the amount of creme in a standard oreo).  All of this is then dunked in chocolate.  The box contains 27 cookies and has a lift tab for easy opening.<br /><br />I liked the initial taste, which reminded me of a peanut butter grasshopper.  But then the aftertaste had elements of a plastic or resin taste - probabaly the palm oil remnants settling on my tongue.<br /><br />The product doesn't contain HFSC, but has plenty of corn syrup solids.  The 23% daily saturated fat contained in a single serving (of 3 cookies) is of most concern to me, though it's not a surprise since palm oil is the second ingredient.<br /><br />At 170 calories and 9 grams of fat for a serving of three cookies, these are a nice indulgence for fans of oreos, peanut butter and fudge flavors.  But be careful if you don't have willpower.  Scarfing down the package, (not too difficult to do since there are only 27 cookies in the package) would give you more than two days servings of saturated fat.<br /><br />My husband (who likes junk food more than I do) and toddler liked these without reservation.  I thought they were enjoyable as a treat, but because of the nutritional information, would probably not purchase them again.

review/summary: They lasted less than 24 hours in this house...
review/text: I try not to buy a lot of cookies for the house (save the kind sold by little girls in uniforms), as they tend to sit around and get stale until I finally throw them out.  But I do like peanut butter and chocolate, and decided to give the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Creme cookies a try.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the cookie wasn't thicker, as this cookie feels about 1/2 as thick as a regular Oreo cookie, and tended to break a little too easily.  And at first I thought the chocolate to peanut butter ratio wasn't quite right.<br /><br />But, the cookies lasted less than a day in our house before the package was empty.  So my initial misgivings must have been wrong.  In the end, I decided these cookies were tasty, and would probably hit the spot, if I were having some sort of peanut butter and chocolate cookie craving in the grocery store.<br /><br />But I am generally disappointed with the number of servings in a package (the cookies are individually spaced, making the package much larger than it needs to be for the number of cookies contained within it).  At this price, I probably would not buy the cookies on a regular basis, and would certainly not buy them to feed hungry teenagers (as the quantity of cookies would not feed too many).<br /><br />Overall, not bad cookies, just not a great value.

review/summary: No really an Oreo.
review/text: First off, it seems that Oreo or Amazon has put all the flavors under the cover of "creme" cookies.  This is for the peanut butter cream variety.<br /><br />It seems every candy and cookie company is coming out with variations of their product, can you even come close to naming the different kinds of Hershey's Kisses?  So no surprise another kind of Oreo, but to my surprise its not really an Oreo, which I admit is my favorite store bought cookie.  I know, I know the picture is pretty clear and I should have known, but you hear the name Oreo you expect two cookies, top and bottom, and a cream filling.<br /><br />On opening the package my first thought was these are really small.  This is really a wafer, with peanut butter covered by chocolate.  They weren't bad, but the peanut butter taste did overwhelm any cookie taste, assuming the cookie has a taste like say, oh I don't know, AN OREO!!  Really no different than a lot of other peanut butter/wafer cookies on the market.<br /><br />They made me hungry for a real Oreo.

review/summary: Not Your Childhood's Oreo
review/text: I am reviewing the Golden Oreo Fudge Creme Peanut Butter flavor.<br /><br />When I think of Oreos, I think of a sandwich cookie. But the Golden Oreo Fudge Creme cookie is more like a Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookie, only in the case of the Peanut Butter, it's peanut butter-flavored as opposed to mint. The peanut butter is creamy and not very peanutty.<br /><br />And the filling is soft, as opposed to the Girl Scout Mint Cookie. Both are enrobed in dark chocolate, though I prefer the chocolate in the Thin Mints.<br /><br />These are okay, but I wouldn't get them again.

review/summary: Better than the Mint ones, still lacking
review/text: I still lament the fact that these are NOT true chocolate-covered Oreos. I know the package clearly shows that there's only one cookie under there, but that's not the point -- why NOT do a true chocolate covered Oreo? Instead, we get about half the cookie and half the creme you'd get in an Oreo, covered in dark(ish) chocolate. I found these peanut-butter fudge cremes to be better than the mint ones I tried recently, but only just. Still not the best snack cookie choice out there.

review/summary: Peanut butter one is just as good as the mints
review/text: Last month I got the mint ones, this time it was the peanut butter ones.  I didn't expect they would be as good as the mint, but I was wrong.  Obviously different, but just as good.  The cookie count is low since each cookie is separated in the cookie tray.  They are fantastic cookies, but you feel pretty guilty if you eat more than a couple at a time since they are so rich. and there's few in the package.

review/text: The description says this is a Golden Oreo with fudge creme, but we ordered these and got the Original Oreo with the peanut butter creme dipped in Fudge.  I would say, go with that kind b/c they are INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS! Like all of the dipped Oreos in this product line, it is only half of the cookie with creme and then dipped, which makes for a perfect blend of chocolate, cookie, and creme mixture.

review/text: I love Oreos, especially these new fudge ones. They're now my favorite. I've tried both the mint and the peanut butter versions now, and while the peanut butter are good, the mint is still my favorite. That being said, these aren't bad at all. I still very much enjoyed them. My two kids (5 year old boy and 2 year old girl) both loved them as well. Whenever they could, they were begging for these cookies. In my mind, that's a good sign. If you've got a kid begging for these, you've got a pretty good product.<br /><br />My one disappointment is that it's not the full cookie. It's just half of it. Maybe they've done that to cut costs, but, as I recall, there was a similar Oreo product at one time that offered the full cookie. Either way, still worth it, and definitely a cookie I'd recommend.

review/summary: Delicious but a little sweet
review/text: The Oreo Fudge Creams come in two flavors, "Golden" with a yellow cookie and white cream... and "Peanut Butter" with a chocolate cookie and peanut butter cream. Both are covered in a chocolate fudge which held up (almost disturbingly) well in a hot car. Your first bit instantly assures you that the cookies are delicious and well balanced, and the the lack of the top cookie typically found on Oreos was a good and calculated decision. The only drawback I could find is that after eating more than you should you get a sense that the cream filling is a little more sugary than it needed to be, especially for the peanut butter ones. All in all though, a nice treat if you can practice moderation better than I can.

review/text: OK, there are few things that cannot be improved by coating them in chocolate. Consider the awesomeness that is the Twinkie. For years, people thought it the pinnacle of confection perfection. Then someone dipped it in chocolate, called it a Chocodile, and dessert history was rewritten. So, too, does the Fudge Oreo improve upon dessert awesomeness.<br /><br />While reminiscent of the Peanut Butter Twix (since that candy bar switched to a chocolate cookie), save with fudge instead of milk chocolate covering the entirety, the peanut butter Fudge Oreo is about as rich as one would like a mass-produced cookie to be. Doing away with the sandwich cookie concept, only the peanut butter filling and a bottom cookie layer are present, the whole coated in delicious fudge. It's really quite extraordinary. Get some, and hog out, folks.

review/summary: Peanut Butter Creme....
review/text: Standing on it's own, this is not a bad cookie.<br />Being branded as an Oreo Cookie works against it, since it sets up expectations that this cookie just doesn't deliver on. It's a thin little thing, roughly the size of a Girl Scout Thin Mint cookie, and they're oddly packaged. They could probably fit twice as many in a pack if the redesigned things a bit. As it is, the cookies arrived jostled and tossed around in the package. Those little slots didn't hold them, so get rid of them and put more cookies.<br />Taste wise, they're not bad......they remind me very much of a Peanut Butter Kit Kat or a Tagalong. I don't know if I'd rush out and buy more, but they were enjoyable enough.

review/summary: Oreo in name only.
review/text: First of all, I ordered this product as pictured and got the Peanut Butter variety. I'm not sure if I was supposed to get Golden or PB, but I'll review the one I got.<br /><br />Why does Nabisco even use the Oreo name for these cookies? They taste good, but they're nothing like an Oreo. The creme isn't like Oreo creme, the single, extra-thin cookie wafer isn't anything like the two thick cookie wafers you get with an actual Oreo, and they're covered in chocolate. Honestly, I don't understand the marketing for this product at all. They took a cookie that has absolutely nothing to do with Oreos and called it an Oreo solely for the product recognition on store shelves. Frankly, it's annoying.<br /><br />So if you're looking for something that tastes anything like an Oreo cookie, this is not it.<br /><br />Do I like them?  Yes. They're OK. They're like the peanut butter Girl Scout cookies. I would probably refrain from buying them again, though. The number of cookies in the package is slightly disappointing, considering the price. I can find the same kind of cookie in a much more cost-effective package without the Oreo name to pump up the price.<br /><br />These are good peanut butter cookies (the ones I got were, anyway) but I was expecting a package of Oreos and got something that bears no resemblance to them. I'd rather they just sold them under a different name, and left the name "Oreo" to the familiar cookie with *two* chocolate wafers and a creme center.

review/summary: Cookie Crunch Lost in Peanut Butter and Fudge Creme
review/text: A cookie review may initially seem superfluous, until one considers that in this case, we are talking about a spin-off of an edible touchstone. The National Biscuit Company was responsible for products that defined brand identity before marketing suits thought the term up. Animal Crackers and Oreo cookies are not merely mass-produced kids' snacks - they are candy culture icons. Let's leave the animals in their cardboard wheeled-cage and remind ourselves what makes the Oreo legendary.<br /><br />A crisp chocolate cookie that explodes in your mouth like a fistful of gravel - which in more-is-better-America is a good thing - only to be subdued by a generous dollop of stiff, whipped, sweet vanilla-like cream, bound together in a delightful chocolate and vanilla tango of sugary goodness, amid an audible ground-glass crunch. I may just need a cigarette.<br /><br />The new Peanut Butter creme Oreo Fudge creme is a delicious treat, but regrettably, does not live up to the Oreo standard - with a final verdict of:<br /><br />---"Not Enough Cookie"---<br /><br />The chocolate fudge covering, which is slightly waxy in texture but, oh-so-sweet and satisfying in taste, simply overwhelms the cookie layer. And it is not helped by the smooth peanut butter filling, which is equally flavorful as, but more moist than the standard for a Choco/PB fix: the Reese's cup. Sadly, the creamy PB layer and fudge-chocolate envelope combine to neuter the too-thin, chocolate crunch. After the taste, it's all about proportions and texture.<br /><br />Thicken the wafer by half and let's have another go, Nabisco!<br /><br />Also noteworthy is the amount of crush-proof packaging provided for each cookie. Let's just say, the ratio of packaging to cookies is definitely on the rise.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I will undoubtedly eat myself into a stomach-ache unless they are well-hidden, very soon.

review/summary: Perfect ratio of peanut butter to fudge
review/text: I'm not a big fan of peanut butter and chocolate, but the peanut butter is just right, it doesn't overwhelm the chocolate. They're thin, and the fudge coating can be a bit messy in hot weather. but they're delicious.<br />The fudge coating is really good, it doesn't taste cheap and plasticky like some fudge coated cookies. The peanut butter is light with a nice texture on the tongue. There seems to be a layer of oreo-type cookie with the peanut butter, very thin but in perfect proportion to the other layers.<br />The cookie inside is crisp, the peanut butter is soft, and the chocolate coating is nice and thick.<br />It's a rich, delicious cookie.<br />The packaging is resealable, very nice, although unnecessary for us since we have six kids. There are 28 cookies per box.<br />If you order in summer, keep them in the fridge for an hour or two before you eat them, unless you like licking chocolate off your fingers!

The results were overwhelmingly favorable. In less than a day the empty box told its own tale. The delicious combination of Oreo crunch, peanut butter filling and fudge covering is almost too much of a taste sensation. So register a big hit as far as taste is concerned. The only drawback - without two cookie parts there is nothing to twist and so some might suppose that this cannot truly be called an Oreo cookie. Nevertheless when I'm left with nothing but crumbs to clean up, I know i have a big hit on my hands!

review/text: Please note that this review concerns the "Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes" that come in a blue package, not the yellow package as pictured.<br /><br />That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this "confection."  It doesn't have the dry, hard chocolate cookie of the original Oreo.  Instead, it can be described as a dark chocolate candy outer layer, but with a very slight, pleasing crunch.  Inside is a thin layer of peanut butter.  The closest comparison is to Reese's peanut butter cup.  But I find this to be a higher quality of chocolate than Reese's (Yes, I'm a dark chocolate lover) It's also much smaller and thinner than Reese's, and, to my taste, less sweet. On the other hand, one cookie should satisfy anyone's sweet tooth, at a calorie count of less than 60 calories -- if one is to believe the nutrition facts.  Perfect for that "I want a little something just to tide me over."

The fudge coating was surprisingly good. There are 28 cookies per package. Ingredient list includes sugar, corn syrup and several hydrogenated oils among other things. Serving size of 3 cookies has 170 calories, 9g total fat, 23g total carbs, 17g sugars and 2g protein, etc. The test is limiting myself to three cookies. But double stuffs are still my favorite.

Well, this is a peanut butter cookie, still not an actual Oreo (just made by them) and I find it fails to even hit the same standard.<br />The main issue of course is that it simply doesn't taste great. It's not bad -- thus the three rating -- but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to choose this out of any. The biggest issue, I think, is that the peanut butter is of the variety that has sugar in it, which I for one do like like (with the exception of Reece's). If it used REAL peanut butter -- that is, made entirely out of peanuts perhaps with a bit a of salt -- I think the cookie would taste a good deal better, even with it being less sweet. The rest of it is just a reletively bland chocolate cookie and good, but again generic, chocolate icing around the whole thing.<br />So yeah, I just can't see this being anything I'd care about in the future.

review/summary: High Goo to Cookie Ratio
review/text: There are exactly 28 in each package. Each is half a cookie and the Oreo goo in the middle covered with the same cookie fudge as every other fudge cookie ever created in the past couple decades. They're good, but a bit more sugary goo than I prefer - I think it may have been better to cover an entire cookie so there could be more "crisp" in the treat.<br /><br />At any rate, they taste exactly as one could imagine. I like them; they're okay.

review/summary: awesome alternative to standard peanut butter cups
review/text: When I opened the package I thought I'd just try a couple of the cookies to see what they were like.  Instead, they were so tasty that I ended up eating half the package in one sitting.  They taste very much like the usual Peanut Butter cups, but they have the advantage of being less messy and you also don't end up with all those leftover "cups" every time you have some.  Also, the package they come in is one of the new resealable ones.  So you don't have to move the contents to some other packaging once you've opened it.  This is a great product - very tasty and convenient.  What's not to like?  I recommend it very highly.

review/summary: Yummy Naughty Snack
review/text: First of all The cookies I recieved were the Peanut Butter flavor not the Golden Ones. But as a long time Oreo addict, I figured I could still taste them and write a review. First of all with the Peanut Butter Fudge covered OREOS you get lots of Peanut Butter flavor, but not a lot of fudge or chocolate flavor. These are still great cookies, and yes definatly a naughty snack an indulgence. I also have to say I still prefer the original Oreos as opposed to these fudge covered ones. Though these will do as cookies go.

review/text: Very tasty!<br /><br />I'm not much into peanut butter but I thought these cookies are actually pretty good. Personally I didn't think the peanut butter was over-powering, thought the mix of flavors was about right.<br /><br />My wife just loves these. Two of her favorit flavors are together in one cookie. She absolutely decimated the package in a very short time.<br /><br />A coworker of mine didn't care for these too much. He seemed to think that the chocolate tasted like Hershey's which he doesn't like. For me though I happen to like Hershey's. Maybe that's why I like the way these taste.

review/text: I very rarely have cookies in the house, but every so often I like to buy a package.  These are very good tasting.  They are quite similar to the Girl Scouts Tagalong cookies.  Basically they are a peanut butter filled Oreo covered in fudge.  I pack a few with my husband's lunch, he loves them too.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the cookies were thrown around in the package and I had to put them back in the slots.

review/summary: for when the girl scouts and your stash are gone....
review/text: When the girl scouts are gone and your thin mints are just a memory, you may be able to find a bit of solace here with these new oreos.  I tried the peanut butter ones.  You get a thin oreo bottom, creamy peanut butter center enrobed in chocolate.  They are basically the same size as a thin mint cookie but with a delicious filling.  I can't speak for all the flavors (yet), but the look of joy when I ate this cookie made my hubby grab the box to make me share.....We agree....this one is a keeper, especially if you love chocolate and peanutbutter flavors together.  Not that you would be looking, but the calorie count on these are 170 for 3 cookies.  I would definitely buy these and would consider trying other flavors, perhaps hubby's favorite flavor....mint.

review/summary: OMFG PB
review/text: It's like my two favorite girl scout cookies of all time got together and had a baby.  That would be thin mints and tagalongs (ugh to the new names).  I tried the Peanut Butter version. These cookies have the light crispness of a thin mint and the fudgy peanut butter omf-goodness of a tagalong.  They are irresistibly yummy and impossible to stop eating.  The pack I opened yesterday is gone. finito. even crumbs are scarce. These win 5 stars on taste alone because we all know they are so not good for you. Do not buy if you are trying to diet at all, because you will not be able to resist.

review/summary: Not their best effort
review/text: I'm a big Oreo fan, but I didn't care much for this new version. On paper it sounds pretty good - chocolate covered peanut butter on an Oreo. What's not to like? Well, the chocolate for one - it's rather waxy-tasting. Just didn't hit the usual chocolate spot. The peanut butter is also lacking in flavor. In fact, if I didn't know it was peanut butter from the package, it probably would have been third on my list of guesses based on taste.<br /><br />The bright spot was the cookie base. Good to see Oreo has not lost their touch when it comes to the actual cookie.<br /><br />Perhaps this would be better in the mint version? In any case, I'd suggest giving the peanut version a pass. Good concept, but not well executed.

review/summary: tasty -- like an Oreo cookie mixed with a Reese's cup
review/text: DISCLAIMER:  I have a *BIG* sweet tooth.<br /><br />I must say that I enjoyed these cookies a lot.  There's a nice chocolate coating on the outside that covers a peanut butter flavored creme coated Oreo cookie half.  It's just the right ratio of cookie crunch to peanut butter creme to chocolate coating.<br /><br />My only issue is that these cookies are a tad messy to eat.  It's fairly cool where I live right now and I noticed that the outside coating on these was already a little soft even before I picked up a cookie, and then the coating definitely rubbed off on my fingers as I ate the cookies.  This isn't an issue if you can wash your hands as soon as you're done eating, but if not -- such as if you snack on these while driving -- you could end up making a mess.

review/summary: Tasty!  But....
review/text: if you are looking for big Oreo taste, these are not going to give it to you.  There is only one Oreo wafer in these, AND the wafer isn't even as thick as one side of a regular Oreo.  I suspect they were trying to cut down on calories, but give me a break, it is a cookie, covered in chocolate, with PEANUT BUTTER.  Are you REALLY thinking about calories while eating these?  Likely not.<br /><br />That said, they are yummy!  Hubby said NOM NOM NOM...he claimed that could be the extent of the review.  They taste very similar to a nutty bar, hubby, son and I all agree.  Quite good, but I LOVE Oreo wafers, so I could have done with a little more of that.

The actual cookie part is very fresh and a crisp bite under the peanut butter and chocolate coating.  They are rich and satisfy that chocolate craving with a single cookie!  These are nothing like traditional Oreos, but they are very, very good!

review/summary: Good, not great
review/text: I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, so this cookie sounds like something to get excited about.  It didn't quite live up to my expectations.  You've got a thin layer of chocolate cookie covered by a layer of peanut butter spread with the entire thing thinly coated in chocolate.<br /><br />The chocolate is slightly on the waxy side.  The word fudge wouldn't have popped into my brain at all if I hadn't seen it written on the package.  And peanut butter?  Well, I guess I was expecting more flavor, although the texture  of the cream is nice and smooth.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is in anyway a bad tasting cookie.  It just doesn't live up to my imagination of what it should or at least could taste like.  I could be thinking too much of Reece's Peanut Butter Cups here.<br /><br />Would I purchase them?  Probably not.  I'm guessing the price of the cookies is inflated by its packaging which keeps each cookie separate from the others.  It seems to be a large package for 27 cookies of that size due to the spacing of the cookies.  Even though some cookies decided to visit other cookies and not stay in their designated spot, none appeared damaged due to shipping or my own jostling of them when I took them into work.<br /><br />Would I eat them if offered to me?  I certainly wouldn't turn them down.

review/summary: Not Particularly Healthy But Good
review/text: This cookie in the Oreo family is certainly tasty if not healthy. There is a layer of chocolate surrounding a peanut butter delight and what appears to be one original Oreo. This latest addition to the Oreo family is not as peanut-buttery as, for instance, a Reese's peanut butter cup; but it has a nice texture and flavor.  You don't have the two great chocolate cookie crusts and the filling as in the original Oreo that has delighted people forever, either with a glass of cold milk or in a pie crust or nestled inside a cheesecake so it is okay to like this one without forsaking your allegiance to what, as I recall, is the most popular cookie in the United States. It certainly has my vote, even above the best of chocolate-chip cookies.<br /><br />If you are avoiding fat and sugar, look someplace else as this little number is high in both.

review/text: Those familiar with regular Oreos (and, really, who isn't?) won't find anything too terribly unfamiliar with these peanut butter Oreo Fudge Cremes.  They consist of a single wafer which is topped with a layer of peanut butter creme, then enrobed in a fudge coating.  The wafer is thin and nicely crispy.  The creme is purportedly peanut butter-flavored, but, to be honest, I was unable to pick up any of that.  It was still tasty, just not as peanut butter-y as I'd hoped.  The fudge coating was not too thin, not too thick, just nicely adding a hint of creamy chocolate goodness.<br /><br />What else can really be said about an Oreo?  Although I might wish that the peanut butter flavor was more intense, I was still quite happy to nibble on them.  I certainly wouldn't mind doing so again.

review/summary: For year-round Tagalong cravings
review/text: In short, these cookies are very rich, indulgent, and delicious.  That said, they really taste nothing like Oreos.  Instead, I see these Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes becoming an ideal way for Girl Scout Cookie fans to enjoy Tagalongs year-round.  While not an exact substitute, the taste is far closer to Tagalongs than traditional Oreos.<br /><br />Basically, these cookies consist of half of a Peanut Butter Oreo dipped in chocolate.  They taste incredibly rich, so much so that the recommended serving size of three cookies appears a little too much for me (and I'm a big chocolate, Peanut Butter, and all-around cookie fan).  I've only been able to eat two in one sitting.  They are good but a little goes a long way.  For those interested in a healthy snack, look elsewhere.  At 4.5 grams of saturated fat for a mere three cookies, a bag of these can easily blow a diet.  And while they boast zero grams of trans fat per serving, the ingredients list shows clear signs that they're walking a fine line: hydrogenated oil (trans fat) is a prominent component.<br /><br />Alas, there is one problem: these are messy little treats.  Each cookie comes fixed in its own little slot in the plastic tray, and if left at even room temperature for more than an hour, be prepared for about one-fourth of the chocolate coating to be wedged at the bottom of the plastic tray.  Smudges on fingers is a given, and even though these are best eaten slowly (two to three bites), the messy factor begs for them to go straight into the mouth whole.  No way am I putting these in my kids' lunch boxes!  This is strictly an at-home snack, served with plenty of paper towels.

review/summary: Not the same old Oreo
review/text: I am a long time fan of Oreo cookies...just about any flavor, antime. Thus, I was anxious to receive these and see what was new in the Oreo lineup. I was a bit disappointed but that may be because I apparently didnt read the description carefully.<br />These are definately not the Oreo's most will be familar with. These are a wafer type, appx. 11/4 inch in diameter, covered with peanut butter and fudge toppings. The peanut butter is rich tasting and the fudge topping is dark and tasty. However, I repeat this is not a traditional Oreo cookie. While the package says it is covered in Oreo type cream, and it may well be, it is lacking in the traditional taste of the usual filling type cream we associate with Oreo's.<br /><br />The cookies were fresh and tasted OK but were nothing out of the ordinary and certainly not your traditonal Oreo and will take a bit of getting use to. My package contained partially melted cookies and was a mess to try to take from the package but the taste did not seem to be affected.<br /><br />All in all an OK product but at least for me not up to the Oreo standards. If you prefer wafer type peanut butter and dark chocolate tasting cookies this should work for you.

review/text: I love peanut and chocolate and was pleased to try these cookies... Well they are very similar to Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies with peanut butter filling vs mint.<br />  That said I would consider these more of candy treat vs a cookie.. Very thin wafer cookie topped with sm amt of lightly flavored peanut butter and the whole thing encased in very chocolaty coating.<br /><br />Just 1-2  is more than enough and I wouldn't serve these as a after dinner cookie  but perhaps a mid meal light treat with large glass of milk but only occasionally.  Not as peanutty as I expected but very clearly peanut flavored.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with the packaging. it has  a new type of pull tab opening that flips open the whole top of the cookie package exposing all of the cookies at once.. when opened more than 1/3 of the cookies had flipped out of their slots in the cookie holder and some were smashed against each other and had to be pulled apart. Can't imagine this would survive in the heat of summer  if it can't make it through this mild spring weather.. Looks like they might be a melty mess in warm weather..<br /><br /> I enjoyed these but not sure would be a repeat order for us.  Due to the candy-like nature of the treat.  and we live in a warm climate and this just looks like a mess in the making for our climate..

review/text: In another addition to the Oreo cookie line, Nabisco added Oreo Golden Fudge Cremes.  These are basically a thin chocolate waffer with peanut butter filling covered with chocolate fudge.  This naturally creates a high caloric and fat content cookie.  My biggest complaint with these are that they left a bitter aftertaste probably from the chocolate waffer.  My kids didn't seem to mind but this is not a cookie that I would go out of my way to buy.  There are similar better tasting cookies out on the market today so I can only give this an average rating.

Gimmicky "remixes" of established classics...in my experience, a recipe for disappointment (Monterey Jack Cheez-Its anyone? I didn't think so...blecchh!)<br /><br />But these are like Girl Scout Tagalongs, except "all year long."<br /><br />In fact, they are MORE chocolatey, because of the chocolate (and not shortbread) cookie inside.<br /><br />The chocolate covering was surprisingly fudgy with a fuller chocolate body and flavor than I ever would have expected.<br /><br />The peanut butter filling is delightful, nicely balanced and sweet but still rich.<br /><br />So basically if you are a fan of Tagalongs and also a fan of chocolate, these represent a beautiful little crossroads.<br /><br />Just order them on a cool day. :)

review/text: Like many other Vine reviewers I was sent a package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JGQ15Y">Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Cr&egrave;me, 11.3-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a> cookies to try out.  Let's start off with the fact that these are not traditional Oreos.  We found them to be quite tasty, but they aren't traditional Oreos with two cookies and creme in the center.  So what are they ?<br /><br />While we were trying out this new Nabisco offering, I had a sneaking suspicion that I'd had this cookie before. A cookie with peanut butter...  covered in chocolate...  Ya know, if I didn't know any better, I would swear this was a Girl Scout Tagalong.  True, the Scouts don't use a chocolate cookie for their base, but the end result was very similar. They were even packaged the way the Girl Scouts sell them in individual slotted trays.<br /><br />Now that's not to say the Peanut Butter Oreo Cremes weren't tasty.  In fact, they disappeared rather quickly around our place.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I just couldn't help but feel that they should have been delivered by the local Girl Scout troop.

I saw this new Oreo flavor and thought I might get a repeat experience of mind blowing taste delight.<br /><br />I didn't.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented and I will make the same assertion: the peanut butter is just a bit off.  Somehow I had hoped/expected it would taste as magically addictively delicious as a Reese's PB cup.  The missing element here, to me, is SALT.  They're just not salty enough!  Combined with how bad these things are for you, I consider them to be just OK and will stick to traditional dipped Oreo cookies for now.

review/summary: Chocoate AND Peanut Butter AND Cookies!
review/text: These cookies are great, the only thing wrong with them is they are a bit addictive! I tried the peanut butter, fudge covered flavor, and really enjoyed them. Picture the bottom half of an Oreo, but about 70% as thick as a regular cookie. This is topped with peanut butter filling, probably 80% or so of a regular cookie. (I actually have peanut butter Oreo cookies at home to do a comparison.) Then, the entire cookie is covered with fudge. The cookie reminds me a little of Girl Scout cookies, but not as crisp or crumbly.<br /><br />The package is an easy-open top, which is helpful because the cookies are set individually in a tray. I store the cookies in the refrigerator, and highly recommend this--they taste even better cold.<br /><br />This is a great cookie for Oreo lovers, people who like peanut butter, and probably just about anyone that likes sweets.

review/text: After receiving these today, I gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.  First, let me describe them.  They are about the circumference of a normal oreo.  On the inside is one chocolate oreo-type cookie, about 1/2 the width of a normal oreo cookie, with a thin layer of creme on one side.  Then the entire cookie is covered with a chocolate/fudge.  Althogther, they're slightly smaller than the typical two cookies with creme inside oreo cookie you're used to seeing.<br /><br />The testers and I agree that they taste pretty good.  The cookie on the inside has a bit of snap to it when you bite into it, and the creme and fudge work well together.  And of course, almost anything tastes better when its covered with chocolate.  I won't go into the ingredients here, but a single serving of 3 cookies has 170 calories.<br /><br />This is an interesting new product from Nabisco, and I like it.  Five stars.

So, to describe it, It's a cookie crust bottom with peanut<br /><br />butter on top, then the entire cookie/product is covered in like a dipped chocolate similar to what you'd get if you went to Dairy Queen and had your vanills<br /><br />soft-serve cone dipped in chocolate.

review/summary: Good Balance Of Chocolate And Peanut Butter
review/text: I think I was supposed to receive the Golden Oreo Fudge Creme Cookies, but what I actually received was The Peanut Butter Fudge Creme Cookies, so my review will be based on the peanut butter ones.<br /><br />The packaging was fine, but most of the cookies in my package were not in their individual slots, so quite a few of them had two cookies stuck together, or the cookies were broken.<br /><br />I did enjoy the combination of the smooth peanut butter, balanced with chocolate.  The cookies are thin and crisp.<br /><br />I would definitly buy these cookies again, but in a store.  Maybe products like this are too hard to ship intact.  They did ship is a very large box with air pillows, but I think the cookies got bounced around, so that is probably how they got stuck together, or broken.<br /><br />The cookie package was sealed, but bulging, from the cookies being jostled, so that they couldn't lie in their individual slots.<br /><br />A great cookie, for when you want the taste of peanut butter and chocolate together.

review/summary: So... rich..
review/text: Oh, dear lord... merely looking at these was almost enough to send me into a diabetic coma. They are so incredibly rich it's insane. I was able to eat about three before I was willing to say "Yep, I'm done!" These really aren't as good as regular Double Stuff Oreos and you don't get very many. I counted, and you get 28 cookies. That's all. For the price you're paying you can find better. Heck, you can do what I suggested with the mint creme Oreos and buy normal ones and dip them into bark chocolate.<br /><br />Overall these aren't bad, but I didn't like them as much as the mint ones. They were way too rich for my tates.

review/summary: Pretty Good Cookie
review/text: The Oreo Fudge Creme cookies are pretty good, but could be better. The chocolate coating is a little on the waxy side, but does have good flavor. The wafer is a standard Oreo half, so you probably have had them before. The peanut butter filling is not a candied concoction like in a peanut butter cup, but more like plain peanut butter (if anything it's a little on the thin side). I posted some pictures of the package and the cookies so you could get an idea of the package size and opening and the cookie dimensions.

review/summary: Not As Yummy As I Had Hoped
review/text: Previously, I had tried the mint Oreo Fudge Cookies and they gave the Girl Scout's brand a run for their money.(especially at $3.50 for two tiers.)  But, I can't say the same about Oreo Thin cookie filled with peanut butter and coated with fudge.  These would be so much tastier if the filling was peanut butter and there were two normal size Oreo cookies surrounding them.  The thin cookie is a bit harsh, the peanut filler bland, and the fudge topping fine.  It just wasn't something I would buy again as the flavors don't blend well.<br /><br />Maybe Oreo will take my idea and run with it.  I am sure that would sell better than these.

review/summary: Oreo Neutronium
review/text: I admit that I've never met an Oreo I didn't like. Oh, I might have strayed a bit now and then--a bag of Chips Ahoy now, another of Cameos there, but I always returned to the one true love of my cookie life, ever since the days when I twisted them apart, ate the filling and dunked the outsides in milk. So be aware of my bias.<br /><br />The package I have of these is peanut butter. I can take or leave the peanut butter/chocolate union most of the time; I eat one mini peanut butter cup at Halloween, and that's about it for the year. But these are exceptionally yummy. there is a chocolate Oreo cracker there, and a layer of peanut butter, and the whole thing is dipped in a nice dark-ish fudgy chocolate to create a new rich type of Oreo goodness.<br /><br />It's tasty.  Well, more than that; it's the experience of being taken into a cookie-dominated plane of existence where there is nothing but you, the cookie, and deep regrets (kind of like Casablanca, except you can find what you're looking for at the supermarket).<br /><br />But beware: this is not a light cookie experience. These are dark, and rich, and dense, and they have--I swear--a very strong gravitational pull. Beware the tides!<br /><br />Oh, and to descend to the practical and prosaic, the bag has the best plastic self-resealing flap I've seen so far.

review/summary: Delicious addition to the Oreo family
review/text: This review is for the Fudge Covered Peanut Butter Oreos that were shipped.<br /><br />Caveat up front - I did not eat these, but gave them to my resident cookie critics (one of which is a one-type-of-peanut-butter-only young lass). Said cookie critics are huge fans of original and Double Stuff Oreos and "dippy milk" (a true Oreo fan/critic cannot mix "drinking milk" and "dippy milk"), but haven't been that excited about other Oreo types. I was very interested to hear back from them on these.<br /><br />Immediately upon receipt of the cookies, some were put into the freezer for a few hours (as I understand from these critics that it's the preferred way to eat a fudge covered sandwich cookie). After an appropriate amount of time (also known as "after dinner"), the critics turned their highly tuned critical senses to these fudge covered treats. Both frozen and room temperature cookies were devoured in a very un-critic-like manner, and promptly given two thumbs up, tons of smiles and "yummmmms" and highly recommended for future purchases.<br /><br />Who am I to argue with them? Our recommendations are to freeze them for maximum enjoyment.

review/text: Seriously, walk away....<br /><br />These cookies are nothing short of amazing!<br /><br />I don't really eat cookies, and if I did eat a cookie, It wouldn't be an oreo (not really a fan).<br /><br />However, I was offered the chance to try out these cookies, and WOW...<br /><br />At first I didn't know what to expect, I figured I'd eat a cookie or two, and move on (and let someone else eat the cookies).<br /><br />Sadly... that wasn't the case!<br /><br />I ate one cookie, (OMG) the taste was extravagant... creamy, tasty, smooth, and just so wonderful...<br /><br />Shortly after I realized I just finished off an entire row, panic set it (there were only 4-5 more rows left), I ate a few more (self control flies out the window when eating something oh so nice, especially when combined with a coffee)...<br /><br />Luckily I was saved, some friends were coming over and I was able to shove the box in their faces and they helped me out...<br /><br />I think the box lasted all of an hour, and it was all I could do to not run out and get more!<br /><br />These cookies are fantastic, once you start you won't stop.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Fantastic cookie, great taste, nothing like an Oreo.<br /><br />Tip: Eat the cookie upside down, tastes much better (don't ask why!)<br /><br />Con:  50 some calories a cookie (I find this out AFTER finishing off the box!)

review/summary: This is for the peanut butter creme, not golden variety...
review/text: This might sound weird, but if these cookies were marketed without the Oreo name, they might taste better. Or, if they were called "Oreo Crisps," I wouldn't have been hoping for that classic Oreo taste.<br /><br />My first impression was that these are "weak-sauce Tagalongs" (Girl Scout cookies). They're thinner, and don't taste super peanut buttery. The package clearly says "Peanut Butter" with "Creme" in small letters next to it, so I've theorized that the "creme" part means it's the familiar Oreo creme that has *some* peanut butter flavor added.<br /><br />The cookie texture is nice. Very crisp and tasty. It's just when everything is put together that it's kind of disappointing. I have hope for the original flavor, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XV1TAS">Oreo Fudge Cremes, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, but have yet to try them.<br /><br />That said, I do keep eating them. They kind of grow on you, so that's why I think my expectation of what a regular Oreo is gave me a bad first impression. I don't think, though, that I'd put one in my shopping cart if I came across it again.

review/summary: Where is the peanut butter or the fudginess?
review/text: We're  giving this item a 3 for several reasons.  First, while it is desribed as "Peanut Butter Creme," we could not taste any hint of peanut  butter in the chocolate covered wafer.  Secondly,it is described as "Fudge Cremes", sorry, the wafer is covered in  chocolate but  it is  simply that - not fudge.<br /><br />  We  thought the packaging was an excellent idea because all you have to do is pull a tab and then the tray of cookies is revealed.  Problem was that although it was not shipped in warm weather a good  bit of the chocolate coating came off on the aluminum foil when it was lifted.<br /><br />  The manufacturer did an excellent job in designing this package as the cookies are on a tray separated by plastic  bars.  Problem is if the package is turned upside down then the chocolate comes off on the cover.<br /><br />  We  would not recommend these for youngsters as the chocolate immediately  comes off on fingers. So, serve them outdoors unless you want sticky brown fingers around the house.<br /><br />  Since the taste is relatively mild they  might be nice served with ice cream or sherbert for dessert.  However, they simply don't have the  distinctive taste of the  original Oreo cookie and shipping them is certainly  problematic.<br /><br />  Sorry we could not have been more [positive because we truly love to eat!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Betcha Can't Eat Just One
review/text: In the cookie flavor category there is none greater. I wasn't expecting anything special when I opened the pack using the special pull out flap across the front giving you access to only a few, or the whole tray. The I popped the first one in my mouth, took a bite and wow it hit me. The crunchy thin somewhat resembling a thin mint but of course a little thicker had a burst of flavor that I would have to say is a cross between peanut butter, coffee and chocolate. I am sure all three ingredients are in there. They really scored 1000 on this one. I couldn't stop eating them. I have about six of them, even though I am on a diet. I just had a big bowl of fruit with pineapple, apples, blueberries, and honeydew melon. Well after about 5 minutes I got a stomach ache. I guess a stomach full of fresh fruit, and a fudge covered peanut butter cookie is not a good mix. Since I was on a diet, I gave the rest of the box to my brother, who ate the whole box in about one day. He gained a pound, but didn't have any stomach problems, so the fruit mix with these must not be a good idea.<br />They have a nice crunch, a good amount of fudge flavor, are thin enough to make you not feel bad about eating a half dozen. You are going to have a hard time finding a cookie that beats these guys in the flavor department. My hat is off to Oreo, I think they just created the next Oreo with these things.

review/text: The cookies are really good. They are crispy and not overwhelmingly peanut buttery. It has just a slight taste and it is very creamy. The best way to describe these is that they are like a chocolate covered nutter butter but round and thin with a crisp. It has very little oreo taste. I am not that big of a fan of oreos. I like the golden oreos but these have a thin chocolate oreo cookie that is not too much to have. They do seem like some girl scout cookies but many products are similar anyway. If you like peanut butter you will really like these.

review/text: Review for the Peanut Butter Creme Oreo Fudge Cremes:<br /><br />Picture one of the tops of an Oreo cookie thinned down half its size to form a wafer, then put creamy peanut butter on top, followed by submerging the whole thing in a choclate fudge coating. Still half the thickness of a oreo regular cookie, but packs a bigger and satisifying taste. Flat on the bottom and round on top these cookies are simiply delicious and guarenteed to be a crowd pleaser! Each 11.5 ounce box contains twenty eight cookies. Can't wait to try their other flavors!

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: I tried out the peanut butter creme version of these.  My first impression was that the fudge coating looker rather soft and would be messy if left out on a warm day.  On tasting, the overwhelming sweetness was predominant. Aside from the sweetness the flavor is more Butterfinger than Reeses.  The slight crunchiness of the cookie portion also made it texturally similar to a Butterfinger.  The chocolate flavor isn't that present and is drowned out by all the sugar. The "fudge" coating seems to be more chocolate flavored than actual chocolate.<br /><br />The excess sweetness of these cookies makes it hard to eat more than one, which is a good thing considering the nutritional information.  Overall, these cookies are much too sweet with a taste more like a candy bar.

review/summary: A yummy treat
review/text: I admit it.  I just love snack foods.  And amongst my favorite snacks to eat are cookies.  I can't think of a year that I haven't ordered Girl Scout cookies and Oreos are amongst my favorite cookies (especially double stuff Oreos).<br /><br />So I was excited to have the opportunity to try the new "Peanut Butter Creme Oreo Fudge Cremes".  While I think that they could shorten the name of these cookies a bit, the bottom line is that they are yummy.<br /><br />The only description on the bag is "fudge covered chocolate cookies" so they could probably expand on that a bit.  But basically, it tastes like a single cookie wafer with peanut butter creme stuck to the side and then the whole thing covered in a soft fudge.<br /><br />The bag I received was 11.3 ounces, which is a generous size.  It is also resealable, so not only is it very easy to get at the cookies without a knife, scissors or your teeth, but it's also easy to reseal the bag and keep the cookies fresh.  Of course they probably won't be around long anyway, because you're going to gobble them up.  At least, that's what I expect to do.<br /><br />I really like these cookies.  If this was a Girl Scout cookie, I'm sure they'd sell very well.  I definitely do recommend them.  Just try not to eat the whole bag at once!

review/summary: Continuing with the Girl Scout Cookie Theme, Mint are Better
review/text: So a few months ago, I tried the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes and they were fabulous. I even sought them out at my local grocery store--where they are on sale this week! Less than you can find them on Amazon, which is nice.<br /><br />The Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes taste a lot like Girl Scout Thin Mints.  In keeping with the Girl Scout theme, these taste a bit like the Tagalongs.. only thinner.  Honestly, I didn't like them as much as the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes.  The peanut butter is overpowering, and I barely tasted any chocolate.  I think this would work better as a traditional Oreo sandwich cookie (chocolate cookie top and bottom) then covered in fudge.  Instead, one has a very thin wafer (thinner than a typical Oreo top or bottom), with a disc of peanut butter, covered by a chocolate shell.<br /><br />If in a store, I had a choice between "regular" Oreos and the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes, I'd buy the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes quite often. (Although, you can't go wrong with the classic Oreos.)<br /><br />If in a store, I had a choice between "regular" Oreos and the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes, I'd always buy the regular Oreos.... or the Mint Oreos.<br /><br />Miss for me on this one.  And I love peanut butter.  If you do like these or the other Fudge Cremes, be sure to check your local store's sale flyer.  They were under $3.00 where I live--which is a great deal.

review/text: Okay, these are really great.  A favorite Girl Scout cookie of mine is very much like these, and they're only available once a year.  This is Nabisco's answer to the same product.  In fact, I might like Nabisco's product better.  It has slightly less peanut butter, which makes for a more balanced taste, in my opinion.<br /><br />The nutritional content being what it is, I would definitely make these a rare treat, as the 56 calories per cookie can add up.  A special dessert, not a daily snack for sure.<br /><br />One warning-- I wouldn't recommend ordering these online.  By the time these got to me on a warm spring day, they were a melted mess in the box.  All I did was pop them in the fridge to solidify and they were fine.  But they weren't very pretty and were all stuck to the plastic container.  I would recommend buying them from your local retailer instead.

This is one cookie with a peanut butter topping dipped in chocolate, and it's a dark chocolate which is not my favorite.  The peanut-shaped cookies you can buy with the peanut butter filling are way better when I have a craving for a peanut butter type cookie.  When I crave an oreo, I want the original!

review/summary: Very sweet cookie
review/text: In the mood for something extra, extra, extra sweet? You will enjoy this cookie then. Otherwise just buy when you have a big crowd. The first cookie isn't bad but all others after that just add up to an unpleasant eating experience.<br /><br />As far as taste is concerned, past the super sweetness, it does taste pretty good with plenty of chocolaty peanut butter flavor.<br /><br />But, wow, are they sweet! How did Nabisco pack so much sweet into such a small cookie?<br /><br />The cookie is about as thin as one side of the Oreo creme filled cookie. Kudos to Nabisco for actually covering the whole cookie with fudge and not just the front side. There is a thin layer of some sort of peanut butter creme on the top side of the cookie under the fudge coating. The PB seems to be where most of the awful sweetness is coming from.<br /><br />I'm not someone that reads every nutrition label for everything I buy and usually I just take it as a given that a treat like a cookie is not super healthy. But these little jewels are so sweet it will make you wonder exactly what you are eating.<br /><br />Dang. 3 cookies is 9g of fat and 170 calories (80 fat). Contrast that with the traditional Oreo: 15 cookies for 160 (60 fat) and 7g fat.<br /><br />I think it is worth mentioning since I couldn't find any nutritional information on the product page.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the eat healthy band wagon but good Lord. Surely a warning label should be required on something that looks so innocuous. Maybe the outline of a hugely obese person and a fat playful exclamation mark.<br /><br />Let me also point out that if you buy this from Amazon you need to have someone available to get the package as soon as it arrives if it is moderately warm in your area when you purchase them. My shipping package was left out in the sun a while and some of the cookies that had come out of their slots were somewhat melted and stuck together. Nabisco did a great job with the tray they ride in but shipping may unseat them and then the heat will glue them together. I threw mine in the freezer for a bit to solidify the fudge before I opened them.<br /><br />Oh. I have to say that I like the resealable package. I guess I haven't bought that type of package before or if I have all the cookies were gone before they could be resealed. It works very well and is much easier than the usual zip lock type resealable package.<br /><br />1 star for an excessively sweet taste in an excessively sweet cookie that could be a poster child for bad industry.

review/summary: Perfect for salting the rim of your bloody Mary glass
review/text: My wife and I wanted to find something to salt the rim of a bloody Mary.  This seasoned course salt is perfect!  The spices mixed with the salt are just what a bloody Mary needs.  The product comes in a resealable plastic pouch inside a nice metal can.  I keep the contents in the plastic container and only pour out the amount we intend to use.  We put this on a small plate so the remaining salt stays dry and fresh.  (We rarely drink, so we want the salt to stay fresh for a long time.)  When we make our bloody Mary, we put a little lemon juice around the rim of the glass and then turn the glass over and place it on the plate with the salt.  This will pick up just the right amount of salt for the rim.<br /><br />Everyone who has had one of our bloody Marys made with this rim salt loved it.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: If you care to enjoy a premium rum then is is one you simply must experience. I prefer it neat. It can be complemented by a good Dominican cigar or if in mixed company with good quality dark chocolate.

review/summary: What a lot of Mush-rooms
review/text: I like mushrooms of just about any variety. These dried fellows are excellent.<br />I actually seperated the different types out to see just what I had and was amazed<br />that it was so many kinds, not just one or two or even three like many dried mixes.<br />My hint to you, is to reconstitute them in a red or white wine. Then after you use<br />the mushrooms in your recipe pour the left over liquid into what you are cooking.<br />I also take a couple and grate them as a coating for fish.<br />I truly enjoy this dried mushroom mix. These get FOUR STARS from me<br />because they don't beat fresh mushroom ever but, they are the best dried<br />mushrooms I can find.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NYK7O">Premium Wild Mushroom Mix 4 oz.</a>

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I like salt, and I like having a citrusy garlicky one on hand. This is it! A nice texture, and very balanced with flavor, in my opinion. I would recommend having a salt grinder on hand to get the most out of this salt, as a grinder would incorporate the flavors well. It definitely chunky!

review/summary: Flavor plus
review/text: I ordered this item a couple months ago and love the flavor.  I use it just about everyday on so many foods(even popcorn). Since the grinder bottle is refillable I just ordered a large jar of it. I didnt give it 5 stars because I found one thing quite annoying.  The label information, except the Faerie's Finest logo, disappears as you twist it to grind the salt. I have never had any problems like that with other grinders.  So I hope the company reads  comments and come up with a label that will withhold the use.  As of now, when I refill the jar I need to somehow mark it with what type of salt it is.  (NOTE: all other information regarding what the contents are etc. are gone.)

review/summary: The freshest dried tarragon I could find anywhere
review/text: I love the tarragon in this package (and Morton & Bassett in general).  The herbs are always fresh, and there are a lot of them.  Tarragon is one of my favorite herbs, and this company packages and preserves the best dried tarragon.  It's great in just about anything, but I like it in French or Italian dishes that use anything with olive oil, vinegar, eggs, creamy salad dressings, or even tomato sauce.
