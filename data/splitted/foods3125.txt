review/summary: I Had My Doubts, But WOW!
review/text: Oaxaca is widely considered to have the best cuisine in Mexico and Mole is one of the most widely variable dishes in the country. In some places it contains bananas! and in others pumpkin and peanuts! I was a bit hesitant to buy this as I had low expectations about quality and taste, but this is right on as far as I'm concerned. The spices are just right and the amount of chocolate flavor is subtle but present in every bite. The first time I used it I mixed about half a can into some Enchilada sauce I had prepared and then cooked my chicken in it (this is called 'tinga' for some reason and doesn't translate as anything other than 'stewed'). The result took me back to the first Mole I had in Oaxaca years ago. I intend to try it without my own additions next time, but I'm impressed! If you've never had Mole this is a good one to start with. Mole can be an acquired taste and sometimes I don't care for it; for example I seldom order it in the Yucatan as it is too 'complex' for me and my son doesn't even want it on the table. By the way, this is dry spices not prepared Mole so you can mix it with whatever you like. I suspect water or chicken broth would work well. My Sombrero is off to Two Snooty Chefs!

review/summary: Not What Was Expected
review/text: When this single pack of popcorn arrived, the first thing I noticed was how the paper bag was oiled soaked and discolored. I was excited about the expected burst of flavor and bite to this popcorn. Popped fairly well, leaving about 25-30 kernels un-popped. The smell was good, mostly popcorn with a slight hint of pepper. Disappointed though with the taste as my expectation was for a sharp bite and more chipotle flavor. Very little to no chipotle taste and only a touch of the burn that make chipotle so good. This did not turn out to be the taste experience that necessitates buying the single package of this again.

review/text: I discovered these at a local Asian market and thought they sounded good, so I bought one bag.  When I finally opened them to try, I was hooked.  They are delicious and taste exactly like sweet corn on the cob. They are quite addictive. The bag I bought was the same size as a large individual bag of Doritos etc, had enough for two servings and I only paid 80 cents.  I'm not sure what size this bag is but the price and the shipping are ridiculous!! As good as these are, I wouldn't pay this price for them.  Check your local Asian store to see if they carry them because they are fabulous.  Love them!

review/text: This bread is probably the best GF bread I've eaten in almost two years!!  It's soft, no gritty texture, and has great flavor.  The only weird thing about this product is that it comes with 5 slices.  The slices are large enough to cut in half and make a sandwich with just one piece of bread, though.  They are double the size of what you get from other GF brands.  Most GF crusts are dry and have a distinct, icky flavor but this one doesn't.  Just really good bread!

review/summary: The best gluten-free bread (also dairy- and egg-free)
review/text: Recently I was tested for food intolerances, and I was off the charts.<br /><br />I discovered that I need to be careful not only with gluten, but with eggs and dairy.<br /><br />This Schar gluten-free "deli" bread is the best gluten-free bread I've eaten, bar none.<br /><br />Unlike Udi's and Rudi's, whose whole wheat breads include eggs of various kinds (specifically, Rudi's has egg whites), Schar is pretty 'clean" for me. As another commenter notes, the packages have 5 slices. But I have found that a perfectly good sandwich can be made by splitting one slice into two.<br /><br />[If you're in Europe, you can also find Schar's Pain Campagnard, which is maybe even better.]

review/summary: chocolate chips not included
review/text: info found on www<br /><br />Since I have had a feeling I am soy intolerant, it has been difficult to find any cookies store-bought or even mixes that I can eat. While shopping at Meijer yesterday, I came across Gluten Free Sensations Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix. This mix does not include the chocolate chips, you must purchase your own. Although this makes it more expensive, you have the option of using carob chips or my personal new favorite, Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the box for mixing the batter. There is also a suggestion for making peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. I think I also might have a peanut intolerance, so I added a 1/2 cup of almond butter to the butter. This made some awesome chewy chocolate chip cookies. By far the best Gluten-Free cookies I have had since going Gluten-Free. My son has disliked any of the GFree cookies I have made to date, but he loved these. Other cookies I have made, he has taken only one bite, but  he even asked for a second helping of these!<br /><br />So what makes these so special. I'm not really sure. The ingredients are very basic. Granulated Cane Juice (sugar), Potato Starch, Sorghum Flour, Brown Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Corn Flour, Baking Soda, Salt, Xanthan Gum. You have to add your own Chocolate Chips, so I'm not sure why this is so expensive. It cost me about $10 to make this one batch of cookies. Is it worth it? My son thinks so. They were pretty delicious.

Perhaps it's unfair of me to be biased in such a manner but the melamine that was poisoning dogs & cats 5 years ago still has me scared.

review/summary: My dogs love this food.
review/text: My two dogs had clearly become bored with the dry food I feed them. About a year ago, a dog trainer friend suggested that I try watering down a can of Evangers and pouring a little of it over their food. No more bored eaters; now they can't wait to get their noses in their food dishes.<br /><br />I've tried several of Evanger's varieties, but the one they seem to enjoy most is Hunk of Beef. When I first open a can the aroma is amazing, like your mother's great pot roast.<br /><br />I appreciate the seller packing this note with the food: "We hand-check cans prior to shipping, replacing any that are compromised. Cans deemed safe but not salable are donated to Chicago area shelters or rescues. Cans replaced: 3. Packed with care by: MD."<br /><br />What's not to love?

review/text: This is most certainly a unique chocolate with lavender and blueberry notes. I liked it better than the average chocolate candy that you can buy in stores. Besides Amazon, only one store in my area carries this candy. It is dark chocolate with lesser sugar/sweetness that would be perfect for diabetics. However, I like my chocolate a little sweeter and I was hoping there would be a little more sugar in these squares. I would give it five stars if it was sweeter. Other than the sweetness, it is delicious and I would recommend it.

review/summary: In Love With Dove
review/text: For a while there were not too many dark chocolate covered almonds available. Dove was one of the first big producers to put them on the grocery store shelves. When my wife and I tried them, we knew we'd found a keeper. There is usually an open open bag in the refrigerator and if there isn't, then a trip to the store is in order. The satisfying crunch of the almond mixed with the rich creaminess of the dark chocolate is a wonderful combination. In fact they are almost too good. It is hard to stop with just a single serving. We normally have a few after dinner in place of dessert and manage to control ourselves. Yes, dark chocolate and almonds have some health benefits, but our waistlines wouldn't appreciate it if we indulged to our heart's content.<br /><br />Dove brand chocolates are among my favorite. I am always impressed with their quality and flavor. If this is your kind of snack, what are you waiting for?

Great cup of coffee. In fact, I think the coffee is better than what is in the Senseo pods. These pods are a little thicker, IMO, compared to the others but this means I can sneak another half cup of coffee out of the 2 pods. Would definitely reorder these again.

review/summary: Wonderful Stuff!
review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/text: So I made a mistake and didn't noticed that this says ".8" instead of "8" ounces. A "0" in front might have helped, or just wearing my glasses.<br /><br />The spices themselves seem fine, nothing special, nothing horrible.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally take off stars for my own error, if it weren't for the horrendous overpricing - For the same price as I just mistakenly paid for 2.4 ounces, I could have gotten a full 16 ounces of the stuff. If you're going to charge six times more, I expect six times more quality or quantity, and these have neither. Still, a star for a decent quality product is deserved.

review/summary: Cats love this stuff! Makes a great topping
review/text: I picked up a package when my cat had a dental cleaning with a tooth extraction, he had to have antibiotics for 7 days afterwards and I used these treats mixed into his food to cover up the taste/smell of the medicine in his food. He will eat *anything* with this freeze dried fish mixed in! He has IBD so I have to be careful about treats and buy only pure meat products. Also these are made in the USA or Canada not in China like many pet treats, though it doesn't say the source of the meat other than that it is USDA inspected.

review/text: The first time I had ever seen these energy drinks was at my local Dollar Tree. Yes, Dollar Tree. I saw them and sneered at them. Like, how good could the quality be from a dollar store. I am hooked. The code blue tastes AWESOME. Im serious. If you have ever drank a 5 hour energy and hated it...this flavor is at least 5x better. If you actually like the taste of 5 hour energy, this stuff is gonna taste like Koolaid to you. Anyways, on to the energy. Its a great feeling. I feel my kick in 30 minutes, sometimes less. I have energy for the WHOLE day. If you want to order off of amazon for lack of Dollar Tree it equals out to 50 cents more. HOWEVER, I suggest if you have a Dollar Tree or maybe another dollar store, spend a buck and just try it.

review/summary: DE-licious Dried Mangos
review/text: *****<br />These dried mango snacks are sweet, chewy, and yummy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. There are 2 servings in every 2.2 ounce bag, with 103 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack. They are almost as chewy as fruit leather, though (about the same as jerky), so you'll need good healthy teeth to be able to chew them.<br /><br />Each of the many dried fruits that are prepared and processed by Bare Fruits--each one is different--some are chewy, some crispy, but all are natural and vary as the natural fruits vary. In my opinion, their brand would tend to appeal to people who like things without added sugars and preservatives and whose taste buds and teeth can handle less processed food.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very Dissapointed!
review/text: I ordered these snacks because I had tried the apple cinnamon kind and loved them so much. The apples were crispy and delicious and the nutrition information was very reasonable with low calories, no fat, and high fiber. Based on the strength of the apple snacks, I went ahead and ordered the bake-dried mangos. And because I love mangos, I ordered a lot--35 dollars worth to be exact.<br />Imagine my dissapointment when I finally got the snacks and they were nothing like the apples. Instead of being crispy and light, they have a tough leathery texture that is completely unappealing. Worse, they have a strange, bitter aftertaste that lingers in the mouth after you eat some. No one in my house wants anything to do with these extremely nasty snacks. Even my son, who loves all kinds of dried fruit, won't touch them.<br />What a waste of money! I will never order from this company again. Buyer beware.

review/text: Yes, my cat loves this stuff. That's besides the point. Really, this is not meant to be cat food. I put this on my rice, my ramen, my tofu, etc. and I eat it. This can also be boiled to make a fish stock, although it doesn't really give a super strong stock unless you use a lot of the flakes. The flakes are very meaty, taste mild and very good. For those of you who don't like fish, this isn't for you. However, you probably have had bonito fish stock if you've had miso soup before. I love this stuff. I set aside a small batch for my cat because he loves it too and it's a great treat for both of us that is not salty, preservative laden, or fatty.<br /><br />tl;dr: Great taste, can be used as a healthy alternative to cat treats, but it's really meant for human consumption.

review/summary: Pretty decent
review/text: This is a huge bag of fish flakes, and it's the best deal I found on them. I'm not very experienced with katsuobushi, but I think these Marutomo fish flakes taste fine. You should be aware that these flakes, while appropriately thin, are quite large. They are probably not the best for sprinkling on as a condiment, but they work fine if you're using them to make dashi.<br /><br />I was expecting to store them in a canister in my pantry, but the instructions recommend putting them in the refrigerator after opening the bag. It turns out that I don't have a canister big enough, so there is now a huge bag of fish flakes taking up room in my refrigerator. The bag isn't resealable, so I have it closed with two clothespins. I estimate the volume is about two gallons, so I'm going to look for an airtight pail that will hold them.<br /><br />If I end up using these a lot, I would order them again. However, I'm going to try keeping them out of the fridge next time. Since they're dry, I have a feeling they will keep for a while in the pantry.

review/summary: Cats love it and so much healthier than processed cat treats
review/text: I researched fish flakes for my cats because I was tired of feeding them processed cat treats (with disgusting ingredients and byproducts) and making them fat.  **Note that I make my own real meat cat food so the treats were the only thing they were still eating from a shelf.**  I wanted something healthier that they would still like and that I could feed quickly and in small amounts.  I use treats to clicker train so I need something they love and can eat relatively fast.  After pricing out every bonito fish flake cat treat I could find, the cheapest was over $4 an ounce with the most expensive around $13 an ounce.  Then I found this giant bag of human-grade fish flakes.  Not only do I now get a product that has better quality control because it's meant as people food, but it's the same darn thing for around $1.60 an ounce.  Granted you have to buy a huge bag but you can portion it into ziplocs and freeze, or give half the bag away to a friend with cats.  I do have to give props to whoever decided to buy this stuff in bulk and then repackage as cat food and mark it up 500%!!<br />The stuff STINKS like fish and the cats go absolutely crazy for it.

review/summary: Most Amazing Flakes
review/text: Ordered these for the first time, and about to place another order for a back-up bag.  So thrilled with this item.  We have purchased MANY different brands of flakes to get to this one.  The flakes are really large, just like in the others I have purchased that are sold as extra-large flakes.  This bag does have a bit of dust in it, but it is minimal.  All flakes will have a bit.  The cost of this bag works out to approx $1.55 oz vs. $5.99 for 1/2 oz pkgs. we had been purchasing at our local pet store for all of these years.<br />My advise is to also have a very large airtight bag on hand for when you open this bag. You have got to have a way to store these to keep them fresh.  This bag is so big, it is almost hard to envision 16 oz vs 1/2 and 1 oz pkgs.  Hang onto a couple of the plastic containers and maybe fill those with flakes to use and refill from the big bag.  But I had purchase some ziplock storage bags for clothing items, that kind of thing, and one of those bags works perfect for storing these flakes in.<br />My kitty is in fish flake HEAVEN!  At this price and qty. she can eat all she wants.

Then while watching Iron Chef, they used the flakes in cooking. I went online to find the most amount for the least price. This 16oz bag was wonderful and when opened it triples in size, so make sure you have "containers". It must be stored in the refrigerator after opening, its a real food product. My cats love it, cry for it and now I give it to them every day and generously too. Do the math, sixteen one ounce cans of Kitty Kaviar would run an average of $128 without shipping. This is the best buy ever!

review/text: I've been buying this product from Amazon for well over a year.  I buy it for my cat and she loves it.  You get a full pound for about $26 and it lasts for nearly 2 months.  The only down side is you need to keep it refrigerated.  I give it to her as a treat several times a day.

review/text: This is a great treat for cats they go crazy. I first started buying Kitty Kavier at the pet store very expensive and gone to fast, I looked at the ingrediants and found that it was dried bonita which is the base for Japanese soups so I started buying it At a Japanese market, same price but much more. The market is about 30 miles away and when I ran out it was a hassle to on the busses to get it.(no car) The cats would be very upset. I then looked on line and found this on line at amazon.com. The bag is huge and my cats are happy campers. I won't run out any time soon.<br /><br />Mochi and salem give it a ten star rating!!!

review/summary: Bonito dust not flakes, but if you can't get to a store.....okay
review/text: My previous experience:<br />100gram bags, multiple ( 4 bags) from a ( now closed and gone) Japanese Market, priced at less than $6.00 per bag. At the time of purchase, I did see two other brands available ( they were in Japanese, so I really couldn't read them), but they look similar to this one, crushed, so I didn't buy.<br />I own 2 cats: one very easy to feeds-will try and usually eats ANYTHING put down before him/the other VERY PARTICULAR, usually sniffs but won't eat.<br />They both LOVED the bonito I have purchased in the past. Neither will eat the 'crumbs'/dust found at the bottom of the bag without it being mixed with water and turned into a paste.<br />I've been know to sample a little, for a little protein.<br /><br />REVIEW: Look at the photo of this item. Do you see how the product appears to fill the bag? It SHOULD when it is in it's prime. I received my two bags ordered and there was WAY too much air space in the box! The bonito was compacted in both bags. I hope they were compressed, but not crushed, but alas, that was not to be. I usually pull out (kind of with a pinching motion)/pluck about 1/2 cup loosely placed easily. This stuff was so distroyed, it just fell from my fingers because the pieces were far too small to "pluck" from the bag. I wouldn't buy this again now that I spent the time and hunted down a Japanese Market. Or maybe if the store burned down/closed down.<br /><br />BETTER SOURCE, if you can travel there: I have since hunted down a new Japanese Market, Japantown in San Jose, California. I didn't have time to search San Ramon, CA, but I did look in Fremont and Newark area, with no luck. All locations have large populations of Asians [I'm Chinese and yes, I AM using THAT TERM-get over it!] I searched the web for locations, so there might be closer locations somewhere, but I don't know where.<br />I bought multiple bags varying in price and found:<br />LEARNED: Price you pay doesn't matter. LOOK at what you are buying. Dust/Crumbs are ALWAYS bad news. A smaller bag with bigger flakes is more desireable. I paid up to $8 a bag, and STILL found the under $6 a bag better in quality (bigger flakes, less dust). The checkout girl had a cat and SHE RECOMMENDED/suggested the one I and the cats liked best, both in quality and price thing in this case. FYI, I found a 40g bag with narrower slices, blue label, but it didn't seem to taste as good for some reason.<br />BRAND doesn't matter. My original bags appear to be the one pictured, that is why I bought it. I guess they could of been crushed BEFORE SHIPPING or in transit from too much jostling.<br />I hope this helped someone in their quest.<br />End note, buying this DOES beat paying the price for the FAR overpriced stuff at the pet store by far.

review/summary: People- Bonito is a Food Item, not a Cat Treat
review/text: Although bonito flakes are marketed as cat treats (some very expensive ones at that), these are not the cat treat kind.  Actually I'm appalled to see them being so popular as a cat treat.  I'm not saying you can't feed them to your cat, but has even ONE of you considered what an insult it is to Japanese cuisine that you are only feeding this to your cat?  These aren't even marketed as cat treats on this page!<br /><br />They're really delicious and made FOR PEOPLE, for whom they are really intended no matter how crazy kitty goes to eat them.  Of course he does- but he reaps no more health benefit from this than if you gave him tuna from a 50 cent can, and a few notable exceptions aside, probably isn't picky about getting any variety of tuna!<br /><br />Please, even if you order this for your cat, try making okonomiyaki some night.  There are lots of tutorial videos on making said dish, and it's quite good- provided you like seafood anyway.  If you need help finding one, go to YouTube, and search Okonomiyaki, look at the video by the user "cookingwithdog".  It's very easy to follow and they always list ingredients at the bottom so you don't have to pause the video constantly.<br /><br />You can even order the sauce for it on amazon, over here, or sometimes at various Asian food markets:  http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Okonomi-Sauce-12-bottles/dp/B000FKHVW0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=grocery&qid=1281996897&sr=8-2

review/text: Bonito flakes are fantastic -- my cat can't get enough of them.  Unfortunately they can be rather expensive, especially as a meal supplement.  I was getting a different brand from my vet and from local pet shops for $24 for a 4-ounce packet.  This brand seems just as fishy and fabulous, my cat digs it, and I'm paying about the same money for 16 ounces -- 4 times as much.

The 1.0 oz 'pet brands' usually cost $6 or $7 and I thought I was getting a deal when I could find the 4 oz for $20.  Then ... I started looking around and found this 16 oz for just a bit more than the 4 oz with the pet branding.  I think it is exactly the same ... she loves it and now I may be able to restart my retirement savings again (after losing most of it in the past few years ... grumble)!

So, we ordered it directly from Massimo Zannetti, the company that bought MJB.  First, they reduced the amount of coffee from almost 2 lbs. down to 1 lb. 7 oz.  Also, the flavor changed.  It doesn't have the rich aroma that is signature to MJB Colombian.  The taste left a lot to be desired, and it takes almost TWICE the amount of coffee to make a decent cup.

When I got home to Virginia I could not find them at any of my local stores so began searching for them online.  I found them here and bought some immediately.  They are just as good as I remembered.  I've used them with everything from Brie to cheddar, with fruit, on their own and with dips.  They are thin, crisp and spiced just right.  They hold up well with anything I've tried so far lending a great herby background taste.  Try to find them in your local stores (I have found them in a few places recently) because buying online is very expensive.

review/text: I have used Sweet n' Lo for years and there is no way I<br />could go back to putting regular sugar in my coffee, etc.<br />I  like my coffee sweet and if I used regular sugar, there<br />is no telling how much I might pile in. Sweet ' Lo has<br />a sweet taste that is not fake and perfectly takes the place of regular sugar.

review/text: This is a wonderful product -- even if you are a staunch vegan.  I add any green or yellow veggie (usually whole so it doesn't get too cooked) and the rice/seasong, and 16 minutes later I have a really delicious dinner.  At the sale price, it's just unbeatable.

review/summary: tastes really good, but too expensive
review/text: Ok, yes this chocolate syrup tastes great, and is raw and organic, but shipping is $10.50, and my own chocolate syrup made from raw agave nectar mixed with oragic cocoa powder cost $6.00 total no shipping, and it tastes just as good.<br />Recipe: pour raw agave syrup in a wide mouth container that has a lid.<br />  add cocoa powder to taste.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: This syrup is yummy.  My husband likes alot of products containing High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I refuse to buy it for him anymore, but it is hard to find natural replacements.  This one is great, and we both like it.
