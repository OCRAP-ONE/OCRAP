review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this "Real Theater" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is "bad" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of "real" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be "artificial" and "thick".  "Thick", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent "real theaters" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.

It all popped up to perfection in mins with my new whirley pop and I ate more then 1/2 the container it was so great! I can't wait to try their kettle corn variety.

review/text: Looked forward to trying this popcorn. NOT IMPRESSED. I guess everyone has a different idea about what great popcorn is. And it's expensive, 5 packs for $10. We don't have one of those Whirly Pop pans like they always advertise. Used a large pot instead. Had to add more salt and oil. It was ok -- just not great. I will stick to making great popcorn right on my stove and much cheaper. I just use a heavy 3qt saucepan, add popcorn, salt, oil and butter all right in the pan. Much better than any of these store bought kits.

review/text: If you like popcorn and are tired of the microwave stuff this is the best you can get. It's very simple and easy to make, just pour in the the kernels into a stove pot and mix in the supplied seasoning and butter mix, put a lid on top and in minutes you'll hear popping. Each bag makes a lot of popcorn which is nice and if you do it just right none of it burns.

review/summary: Strange coconut aroma
review/text: I recently tried the five pack Wabash "Real theater popcorn."  When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.<br />So?  I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more "smelly" issues.  Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content.  Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.<br />If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.<br />Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.<br />C'est la vie.

review/summary: AWFUL
review/text: I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but I did base my purchase on reviews I had seen on both Amazon & another site, which were all glowing.  So I thought it was fair to give another point of view.  I love popcorn more than any other food.  This is possibly the worst popcorn I have ever had.<br /><br />Normally, I use canola or peanut oil, fresh locally grown corn, & sea salt.  It is absolutely delicious with very few hulls or unpopped kernels.  It is much better (& better for you) than microwave or any other popping method using oil.<br /><br />This stuff was stale, & had way too much sodium.  The coconut oil mixture was disgusting. The taste was so bad that I threw the rest of it away after a few handfuls.  I had split the original batch in half, & gave 1/2 to my neighbor, who usually will eat anything.  Even she thought it was poor quality.  Now I'm stuck with 2 boxes of this junk.<br /><br />I gave it 1 star because every kernel did pop, and the cooking time was quick.  But I'm going back to, & sticking with, my old method.  I think it must be the locally grown corn (FRESH!) that spoiled me.

review/summary: The "New" pumpkin: Sweet Potato Pie without all the work!
review/text: With Sweet Potato Pie quickly supplanting Pumkin pie as the number one Holiday pie, most cooks shudder at the thought of all that boiling and peeling.  There's a reason why canned Pumpkin Pie filling is so popular and now you can have the same convenience with this brand of canned Sweet Potato pie filling. The canned filling also uses just the heart of the sweet potato, what most people call "Yams" so you get a better overall resultthat is smoother and sweeter than if you go about making a pie the old-fashioned way.  An added benefit is less mess and ease of clean-up.<br /><br />Unless you live in an area where Southern Cooking ingredients are easily available at the supermarket, you most likely will not find this product on the grocery store shelves.  Ordering it in quantity is not a bad idea since it stores well and when you do finally make it, more than one is usually in order.  It's also good to have on hand for unexpected company and to make as get-well gifts or to bring for Potlucks.  Once you try it, you'll most likely never make a pumpkin pie again!<br /><br />A Pantry essential!

review/text: If you're big coffee drinkers like my family, ordering in bulk like this is great and it never goes stale.  With coffee costing anywhere from $6.50 and up for a 12 oz package in the grocery stores, this is the only way to buy coffee.  I tried different brands, but came back to Eight O Clock for value/price.  I order Hazelnut and French Vanilla and mix them.  Ordering with Subscribe and Save lowers the price a little more, but you do have to watch that.  Found a huge price jump just before the French Vanilla was set to ship, so cancelled that one and ordered Coffeemasters (also a VERY good brand) instead.

review/summary: Tasty Coffee
review/text: While opening the package, it bugged me that the label is prominently labelled "ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED," in a manner that is not immediately noticeable on the website.<br /><br />I am the type of person who remains always aware of such labeling, even as I savor the coffee (which I do). I remain uncomfortably aware that its flavor profile was partially concocted by a food scientist in a lab, using unknown chemicals that I may not be able to pronounce.<br /><br />The "artificial flavor" scarlet letter is something most modern-day coffee outfits would jump through hoops to avoid -- and reasonably so, because labelling creates a genuine psychological component of any product.<br /><br />Not so fussy are the 8 O'Clock people (spun-off from the great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, now owned by Tata Coffee, a tea & coffee plantation giant headquartered in India, though their 8 O'C executives still HQ in  Montvale, NJ).<br /><br />While my enjoyment of this brew would be greater without the "artificial" label, I'm sufficiently happy with the flavor and the price that I will certainly allow my subscription to stand, though I will continue to sample other, all-natural brands.<br /><br />Another reviewer takes this coffee over the coals, contending that it tastes like a stevia-sweetened candy bar. I have to wonder what he's using to sweeten his brew, as my taste buds detect no such similarity...I suspect that this reviewer is even more neurotic about the "artificial" label than I, and he's tasting the labelling more than he is tasting the coffee.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: The coffee I tried had scarcely any flavor or aroma.  I feel that the hazelnut additive was more dominant than the taste of the coffee, and even that was quite weak.  I did not find the flavoring nutty either; rather unnatural tasting.  I generally have my coffee with the addition of half-and-half only; it is quite possible the people who enjoy this are accustomed to using syrups which might compensate for the blandness of this coffee.  Speaking of syrups, if you like hazelnut then I'd recommend instead a hazelnut syrup or liqueur added to a better coffee.  I found no advantage to the whole-bean either; I've certainly had better pre-ground Folger's coffee.  This is the second time I've both tried and been disappointed by the Eight O'Clock brand, and so I am beginning to suspect that I was not merely the victim of an old or otherwise bad batch.

review/summary: Amazingly tasty!  But it has green tea too.
review/text: I got this after reading about a study that said four cups of white tea a day - and no other changes to diet or exercise - could result in 4 to 8 lbs of weight loss in a year, and would actually reduce the number of fat cells in a person's body!  [...]<br /><br />One note: this tea is not just white tea, but has green tea as well.  While I don't object to the tea having green tea in it - the study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white - it's certainly not obvious from the name, and I feel a bit deceived.  If it's White & Green Tea, call it White & Green tea, not White tea.  That's the reason I knocked this down to 4 stars.<br /><br />For those that think that four cups of tea is a lot...  You're right.  But this tea is mild enough, and tasty enough, that I've been doing it for over a week and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  We'll see if that keeps up!

I was skeptical at first since Lipton, while a well-known name, doesn't really make artisan teas all that well.  I was so wrong.  The tea is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, with each sip lending itself naturally into the next.  Because it's a white tea, there are very low tannins.  And the tea bags themselves are fun.  These are not your mother's teabags.  Way cool mesh with a pyramid design allows for better steepage (plus it just looks awesome).  I definitely recommend this to anyone, tea lover or not!  It will make you a convert.

review/text: Very good tea.  I'm not sure what others complaining about flavor were drinking, but myself and others I've given it to loved it.  I usually make a whole pitcher of it with about 4 bags.  Add a little bit of sugar and you are in business.  Most of my regular teas need 1-2 Cups of sugar in this same pitcher and this needs 1/2 cup or less.  It has a very nice fruity flavor that needs very little enhancement.<br /><br />The plastic bags aren't that big of a deal either.  It is a thin mesh that doesn't amount to much and we put it with our plastic in the recycle can.

review/summary: nice, mild tea
review/text: This is a fine (though perhaps not spectacular) tea.  I found the flavors--both the tea flavor and the fruit flavors--to be a little on the mild side for my taste, even when seeping the tea for significantly longer than the instructions recommend.  So if you prefer bold flavors, I would suggest you look elsewhere.  But if you prefer lighter, milder flavors, this is a very pleasant product.

review/summary: Mild, fruity flavor 3.5 stars
review/text: I normally like white teas, and this is no exception. It's very fruity, and I especially enjoy it served hot. I found this one required longer steeping than the directions stated, and it's also a bit weak, so you'll want to use no more than six ounces of water per bag.<br /><br />Nantucket Nectars used to make a very delicious blueberry tea, which they've since discontinued, so I was excited to try another blueberry tea. This unfortunately is not nearly as good as Nantucket Nectars Blueberry Tea and just didn't taste right served cold, in my opinion, but as a hot tea, I do recommend this one.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that I don't understand why Lipton is using plastic tea bags now. Isn't plastic bad for the earth? Doesn't it take hundreds of years to biodegrade? I've read reports that plastic bottles are a health hazard. I don't know if this is the same kind of plastic, but it just doesn't feel right making hot tea with a plastic tea bag, so I just cut the plastic bag open and use it with my tea infuser.

review/summary: The Vision of the Pomegranate...
review/text: My ship and I, (the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish named after the 12th Duke of Devonshire), were traveling the Bay of Bengal in the summer of 1938.  King George IV, had taken reign the winter prior.  His royal majesty from the House of Windsor still had a tentative grip on the British colony of India.  Hearken back to olden days of yore when imperialism was a goal, and not a mangy politicians word.<br /><br />We were making headway up the Hooglhy River into Calcutta under the guise of His Majesty's Royal Trade Mission with peace offerings to the Maharaja of Bengal.  Calcutta was a dicey place round about that time, being our capital in colonized India you know.  The locals had grown weary of the legendary British hospitality.  A fortnight later, it was near the mouth of the Hooglhy River that we met a blind street beggar who promised us visions of prosperity.  At first we questioned this diminutive cheeky fellow, but alas, we listened to his tale.  We offered the blind beggar six British royal pounds in exchange for his gift of visions of prosperity.  And that is when it happened.  The blind beggar offered us this strange, yet edible fruit.  "Eat the fruit of this Pomegranate", the blind beggar said, "and the visions of your prosperity will come to light".<br /><br />For good penance, the blind beggar gave us seven pomegranates for our continued journey.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, a fine purveyor of English tea's, and the second most knowledgeable of my sailor's had a unique idea.  Boson's Mate Micklegal decided to steep some loose black tea leaves with blueberries we picked up from our travels along the coast of Palestine along with the strange edible portions of the blind beggar's pomegranate.  Much to our extreme delight, what an explosion of flavor!  I informed Boson's Mate Micklegal that he was definitely on to something.  While this delicious concoction was certainly no Earl Grey (as any honorable Britain would tell you, there's no comparison to "The Earl"), it was certainly divine, chamomile be damned!  Though summer's on the Bay of Bengal were most treacherous, with a cup of Blueberry and Pomegranate Tea by your side while fixing the braggywinkle's on the bowline, the fresh smell of the salty air on your lips, a better day one cannot achieve.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Boson's Mate Micklegal found a bottle of Glen Fiddyich stowed away in one of the hold's.  Boson's Mate Micklegal ended up getting pissed off the fine scotch and forgot his wonderful concoction.  In his plastered stupor, Boson's Mate Micklegal heaved the six remaining Pomegranate's off the aft deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, losing the wonderful recipe forever.  What Rubbish.<br /><br />Until the hack tea makers at the Lipton company devised their own version of Blueberry Pomegranate Tea.  While not as divine as the tea Boson's Mate Micklegal concocted in that summer of 1938, they came darn bloody close.  Cheers Lipton!  Thanks for the memories.

review/summary: sorry hodge-podge, masquerading as white tea
review/text: Almost all the teas in this line from Lipton are such careless mixtures of white+green, green+black, rooibos+green etc that there is no way to buy and know how much caffeine you're getting.  That's the first problem.  The name of each of these pyramid teas says you're getting 1 tea, when in fact you are getting at least 2, and then a mountain of other ingredients -- most of which are not even hinted at by the name.<br /><br />It's true, white tea is the first ingredient listed.  Then green tea.  Then apple pieces.  Then a litany of all the cheap add-ins available to fill a tea bag.  The pom -- is barely there at all, in the form of juice concentrated and then powdered into bits.  And blueberry is so far down the list that it's barely there at all.<br /><br />Of 15 listed ingredients, all the fruit (except the apple) are listed AFTER cornstarch and "natural flavor".<br /><br />What kind of tea is this that has blueberry and pom in the name -- yet has more cornstarch and the mysterious "natural flavor" than the microscopic bits of fruit and juice?<br /><br />CORNSTARCH?  In tea?  forget this stuff and find some Numi, or Republic of Tea, or Stash, or Celestial Seasonings tea that has the actual tea (white? green? black? rooibos? mint? chamomile?) in the name -- and then only minimal anything-else.  No fillers.  No thickeners.  No crap.  Almost any of the name companies in this price range give you more actual tea (and identifiable other ingredients) than this.<br /><br />And it tastes bad. The "white tea" they are using tastes astringent and peppery.<br /><br />Go for full leaf from a reputable tea merchant to be sure you're not getting a dainty little bag full of straw and leftovers -- which this is.

review/summary: This was disappointing.
review/text: I love tea...and I really hate writing bad reviews. Maybe I didn't make it right, but I've made other teas that came out just fine.<br />I've bought a bottled version of it from another brand and expected a similar taste out of this tea I bought today. I tasted nothing. I let it steep and steep and steep, taking sips ever so often to see if the flavor ever came out.<br /><br />I think the most disappointing thing about it is its box and smell. It's box describes it as "pomegranate blueberry" flavor. I tasted neither. It had such a seductive aroma, so much so, I could smell it while it was still packaged and I admit it was what persuaded me to buy it.<br /><br />I let my mother try it, and she described it perfectly:  even though it had a lovely aroma, it wasn't flavoring the water.<br />I noticed that there was an "apple-y" after taste at least. Lipton's just needs to step it up and make it a bit stronger so you can actually taste it. I don't know if it is because I have a natural affinity for stronger tea, or what, but I cannot begin with how disappointed I was, especially for the price I paid in store. If a tea has a fruit flavor added, I want to taste the fruit. I would rather it have a robust, full-bodied flavor. Or at least put on the label that it's a milder tea.<br /><br />For the rest of the people who put excellent reviews, do tell what you did to make it taste so good. I find that it is sweet smelling water and nothing more.

review/text: the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag.

review/text: I rarely eat mayo and haven't bought a jar of it in years. However, since I am pregnant and had a hankering for a BLT, I did want a touch of mayo on it so it wouldn't be dry. Picked up a jar of the regular lemonaise at Fresh Market b/c it was the least expensive canola-based mayo on the shelf.<br /><br />That BLT was the best I have ever tasted. Granted, I used some awesome bacon (Nueske's applewood smoked), some wonderful tomato stand vine ripe tomatoes, and some yummy fresh italian sourdough bread (lightly toasted) (plus some standard iceberg lettuce), but the mayo really stood out. Delicious. Tangy. Fresh & not overprocessed tasting.<br /><br />My husband was quite surprised to hear me raving over a jar of mayo, since I order everything w/o it. This stuff, lemonaise, however, is definitely an exception.

Also, it is the only one made without sugar (honey or other ingredients of the kind which belong in desserts not in a condiment) -- a complete miracle and the way mayo should be made. It also has great spices; its tangy taste is perfect and just what you would expect from a lemon mayonnaise. The Whole Foods near my home carried it for a while but now they decided to stop, everybody is asking for it so I decided to buy it on Amazon by the box. We don't use any other mayo and now my daughter's friends got a taste for it as well. I plan to buy only the Lemonaise not the duo.

review/summary: My Favorite Chocolate
review/text: Dagoba (pronounced duh GO buh) Dark is the best chocolate I've ever tried.<br />A previous reviewer said they threw this chocolate out because of it's "artificial taste". Some people are so used to Tootsie Rolls and Ho-Ho's that they honestly have no idea what chocolate tastes like.<br />As my gramma used to say, "there's no accounting for taste."<br />Dagoba is chocolate. Pure, organic, fairly traded, and delicious chocolate.<br />I used this to make brownies (per Cook's Illustrated's suggestion) because mine always seemed to lack deep flavor. Dagoba fixed that. Try making one batch with the cheapest semisweet chocolate at the store (Nestle or Hershey's or whatever) and one batch with Dagoba Dark. Then serve them to your friends and see which they prefer. It makes an obvious and remarkable difference.<br /><br />And for plain old eating, it's equally tasty. I've tried just about every plain dark chocolate bar at the fancy grocery store and I can't find any I like better than Dagoba Dark. Some that cost the same or even more are terrible. Some are almost as good, but none are better. Dagoba Dark is expensive, but it's a good value. There are a ton of chocolates that the real aficionadoes like even better that but the prices on those ultra premium brands like Amedei and Michel Cluizel are insane - $14.50 for 1.8 ounces! Can you believe that nonsense?<br />For $2.50 a bar, if you like flavorful chocolate, I don't think you can go wrong with Dagoba Dark.<br />The ONLY thing I'm not pleased about is that Dagoba is now just another division of a mega-corp (Hershey's) so you never know when they'll try to save a penny by compromising quality or organic or fair trade principles.

review/text: I was told by a professional baker to use powdered food coloring as it was the only way to go when making colored cakes and french macarons. What a disappointment. I ended up adding almost a tablespoon to my french macaron batter and it was such a pale color, that it wasn't worth adding a whole canister at the price. This isn't the way to go if you want bright vibrant colors.

review/summary: Organix Organic Adult Dog Food by Castor & Pollux 12.7 oz.
review/text: I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79-2.99 plus $2.31 tax = $37.79--12-12.7 oz cans.<br /><br />There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain-free, and those that have grain products such as flaxseed meal.<br /><br />My two ShihTzus Darby and Hampshire prefer turkey and chicken over beef and lamb so I purchased the following formulas:  chicken & vegetable; turkey, carrot & potato; chicken & organic brown rice; turkey & vegetable, chicken & brown rice; turkey vegetable; turkey & vegetable (grain-free); and chicken & vegetable (grain-free).<br /><br />Darby and Hampshire's typical diet is roast chicken with brown rice and mix vegetables.<br /><br />Their snacks normally consist of non-nitrate hot dogs, pan fried chicken livers, butter fried sweet potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes, turkey meatballs, cheese wedges, Bullies, Merrick sesame sticks, 2-TBS of Haagen-Daz vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, and the occasional non-nitrate cold cut.<br /><br />After tropical storm Debbie swept through Central Florida, I knew I needed to find a nonperishable dog food to stock for the hurricane season in preparation for power outages.<br /><br />I had searched for years for a high quality nontoxic and reasonably priced dog food that Darby and Hampshire would actually eat.  The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years.

review/text: I bought these thinking they were individually wrapped.  Should have taken more time to look at the reviews and the user submitted pictures.  The beef sticks taste alright, but I find myself not wanting to eat them because they are so inconveniently packaged.  I would need to use a clip to reseal the bulk package after one or two beef sticks.  A lot of the reviews mention that they aren't individually wrapped, but don't really make a big deal about it.  When I want a quick snack I don't want to go grab a utensil or a napkin just for a beef stick.  Maybe if I was dying of hunger, I would grab them by the handful and swallow them whole.

review/text: Jack Links beef sticks are apparently fine, if you like eating mold. I can't give a review on the taste because I haven't eaten any of the beef sticks.  I was shocked when I opened the box to see a package of beef sticks with white mold on the front and the back.  I wrote to Jack Link's about it but haven't received a reply.  Apparently quality control and health concerns for the customer aren't important to Jack Links.  The mold on the package was very visible, so whoever packaged it and shipped it out to me didn't seem to care all that much.  I'm so grossed out that they would send me this unappetizing and unhealthy product.  Blech!  Will be returning the whole shipment shortly.

review/summary: Good taste, no case.
review/text: These are really tasty little snack sticks.  Really beats other brands I have tried:  Good amount of spices, nice "snap" from the casing when you bite into one and no nasty greasy aftertaste as at least one brand I have tried has. (See my other reviews for that.)<br /><br />The only reason I withheld one star is Amazon's misleading picture.  This is a *bulk-pack" item meant for wholesale use.  The snack sticks come 36 (or so) to a large plastic non-resealable bag, NOT individually packed as illustrated.<br /><br />This was pointed out by other reviewers but Amazon has not updated the picture, so be aware you'll need some food storage bags or a nice tall jar with a tight fitting lid.  (Sticks are about 7" or so long and maybe half an inch thick.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a fine snack at a much better price than you pay buying them one at a time at the "Grab-n-Gulp", just don't expect to hand them out for Halloween or use them as stocking stuffers (unless you *like* greasy stockings...but that's your affair.)

review/text: We bought these for an event our church held to make care packages for soldiers. We looked all over for large packages of individually wrapped jerky sticks and thought these were perfect... Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews first which others clearly complain about as well. I bought 3 boxes and had to give them away to friends, family and coworkers before they expired. So I am out $75 and had scramble at the last minute and bought slim jims at smart and final, which is what i was told soldiers hate, but it was our only option. It seems Amazon makes no effort to make sure their sellers are showing real items and makes me rethink renewing my prime account for another year.

review/summary: Not individually wrapped, not that great and moldy fast!
review/text: I've been trying loads of snacks over the last year or more trying to find things my kids like in their school lunches and that are portable.  (older kids...)  Irritating that I have to read reviews (which I didn't do..) to find out these are not as advertised and my kids just can't throw them into their backpacks for a protein snack which is why I got them!  Now I have to buy lunch bags. :(  We also like regular jerky better, these tasted overly fatty with a sour after-taste.  Not impressed and won't ever repurchase.  Amazon needs to not list unless they are listing exactly what they are selling.  3 stars off for misleading...<br /><br />Edit:  I'd never looked up the fat content on these things and thought they were lower fat like many jerkys.  No.  About 9 grams of fat for one stick.  I'll stick with jerky and "individually wrapped" jerky at that...<br /><br />Edit again:  As soon as you open this you have very little time before the entire bag turns moldy.  Be sure and refridgerate!  I'd only had these 2 big bags a short time before they were bad.  Never again.

review/summary: Can't recommend these.  Seriously consider the individually wrapped version
review/text: Unfortunately I can't recommend these.  I like saving money, but I believe that buying these over the individually wrapped Pack of 84 is a mistake.  I actually bought these and the individually wrapped variety of the same product, so I think I can be a good judge on this decision.<br /><br />One note:  Don't be confused by the picture of this product.  It is NOT individually wrapped as shown.<br /><br />Here's why I can't recommend these:<br /><br />They are dried out, especially compared to the individually wrapped ones.  When I bite into one of these its kind of chewy, not moist at all, has less taste, and is less appealing overall than the individually wrapped ones.  The individually wrapped ones has a lot more taste, moistness (making it easier to bite into), and when you bite into it, you can really taste the freshness.<br /><br />The other, more important reason is that 90% of the time these have caused me... lets just call it "issues" in the bathroom shortly after eating them.  I have always had an iron stomach, but I have one stick and these "issues" start occurring.  This has been the case since the day I bought them.  This is not AT ALL the case with the individually wrapped beef sticks.  I can have two of those and experience no "issues."  I double checked the date on the box (they were new) and also insured that I was properly storing these sticks (I was).  So I really can only blame the fact that they are not fresh enough because they are not individually wrapped.  Possibly there's something more to this.  Maybe Jack Links put more preservatives in the bagged sticks to keep them fresher since they aren't individually wrapped.  I don't know, but this would make some sense.<br /><br />Please, do yourself a favor and buy the individually wrapped version of these sticks.  Its worth the extra money for the freshness you get from unwrapping each stick and to not possibly experience "issues, which will lead to buyers remorse.

review/text: I love these beef sticks.  Especially when I'm on road trips I can't resist buying a couple if they have them on the counter at check-out.  I now like to keep a few beef sticks in my bag at work (pediatric nurse) for late night snacks.  These are the best deal price/ounce and quality that I've seen thus-far.  I bag six at a time in sandwich bags, then six sandwich bags in a gallon size zip-lock to keep them fresh in my pantry, then take a bag or two to work to keep onhand.<br /><br />If you're compulsive and won't be able to stop eating them until they are gone, then you need to just buy a few at a time at the gas station, these are not health food.  They have some protein, but alot of fat, sodium, and calories.  They are a treat, not a meal!

It was always kind of a hassle to get more than one at a time out of the vending box on the store counter. It made people have to wait behind you. Now I can enjoy them anytime, hassle free! It doesn't bother me that these are not individually wrapped. They seem to last a while, I open one pack at a time, and place the unused ones in a snap tight container. Works great for me.

review/summary: great snack
review/text: my family loved these for snacking. I've read complaints that they do not come individually wrapped but I liked that... less waste... just open the bag, take what I need and clip it shut.

review/summary: Jack Links are great
review/text: Excellent value.  These are exactly the same beef sausages that you'll see on the checkout counter at gas stations and party stores.  (for half the price)  If you're a dog lover, like me, compare these to the price of that junk they call "dog treats."

review/summary: BEST smoked links EVER
review/text: I've purchased these at the local gasmart for years, then moved to an area of the country that doesn't carry them.  I missed them so much I got online to see if I could purchase some.  Guess what, they DO ship and it's the same as at the corner store was!<br /><br />Great flavor, not greasy nor blah, right amount of spices, etc.  I've never found a better product than this for a snack beef link.  Whenever I go back to where I live, guess what, first thing is pull into the gasmart I used and get a few!<br /><br />You can't go wrong, they are fantastic!

review/summary: JackLink's IS AWESOME
review/text: We used to buy Jack Link's Beef sticks from stores at a cost of 2/$1.00.... since I found where to order them online, I now pay about 33cents each!  What a savings!  And, Amazon saves my info so when I need to order more, it's right there and easy to order.  Now, if I can just keep the rest of the family away from them, the 72 stick order might last more than 10 days!
