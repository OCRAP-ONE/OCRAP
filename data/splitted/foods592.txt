review/summary: The Best Cat Food Available!!!!
review/text: I use this brand of cat food and the dog version too.  Very healthy, cats and dogs love this stuff, and it's affordable.  The results of your animals eating this food (including the canned) is very visible when petting my cat.  Her fur is silky smooth, healthy looking, etc.  I highly recommend this food to anyone with a cat or dog.  Don't be fooled by brands like Science Diet, Purina, Ol Roy, etc.  Read the ingredients of your current brand, and the there shouldn't be an beet pulp, corn, or by products.

review/summary: Good value good quality food
review/text: Wanted to add a 5 star rating to counteract any future 1 star "my cat won't eat it" reviews. (Cats are picky eaters by nature, but the reason they may chose not to eat this for example, is not because this is a flawed product.)<br /><br />Please reference this useful website (it is where I found out about this particular product). It breaks down ingredient lists for a number of popular cat foods on the market.<br /><br />http://www.petfoodratings.net/cattable.html<br /><br />This one scored highly for quality ingredients and value. Value is important. There are a lot of good cat foods that are too expensive just because they can get away with it (with essentially the same ingredients), or the vet is selling it (Science Diet) for 100% profit.

review/summary: We had a problem with this
review/text: We had a problem with this cat food. All of my cats but one developed loose stools on this cat food. It took me several bags of cat food to figure out that it was this cat food that was causing the problem because it did not kick in right off the bat. I had been mixing this with their old dry food and I was supplementing with canned food during the transition, so it took a bit to narrow down this new food as the source. The smaller cats developed the diarrhea before the larger cats did. I believe there is just a bit too much fiber in this formulation or perhaps it is the berries in the ingredients that trigger the loose stools. I would not have a problem mixing this with Iams or Science Diet if I could figure out the threshold where the loose stools starts. For now, I'm just going to stick to supplementing with canned food, which has almost no filler in it. On a final note, the cats were not thrilled with this. They would eat it but would go for any other food in the house before they would eat this, if given a choice.

Great in cookies and breads.  I sprinkle some with my french toast when making it too.

review/summary: Isn't it "real"?
review/text: This is one of the very few Gluten Free pastas that is so close to havng all the properties of "real" pasta that it's worth the extra expense. Most gf pastas can't be reheated without falling apart into a gluey mess. One that can be made into Mac/Cheese and not be a solid mass. At our house we even have been able to enjoy cold pasta salads again (though it needs to be eaten in a day or two). Have served this to non celiacs who have asked if it wasn't "real" and are amazed that it's not traditional wheat pastas. The texture is delicate but firm enough to hold it's shape. The taste is slightly different than traditional but with sauce (even a light one)you'd never know. Leave it to the Italians...they know their pasta...gf or not!

review/summary: Awesome for gluten-free eaters!!!!!!
review/text: My daughter is gluten and dairy free, and we have tried EVERY pasta brand out there.  Since I like to cook a lot at once and use the rest for left-overs, the other gluten free (brown rice and potato only brands) did not do well when re-heated, and also had a "different" consistency --according to my daughter.  This brand is incredible, perfect texture, cooks easily, and my husband (who is a Sicilian) will even eat it , and once mistook it for his favorite brand!  Bionature has achieved the perfect pasta for picky gluten-free eaters.  If you are celiac, or gluten-sensitive, you MUST try it.

review/summary: Best GF Penne Yet
review/text: Being that multiple members of my family are gluten-intolerant, I've tried most of the GF pastas out there.  When I ran across Bionaturae Gluten Free Penne I wasn't sure what to expect. I was thrilled with the results!  This GF pasta's texture and taste are very close to "the real thing". I made this GF penne with meatballs and red sauce for two of my non-gluten sensitive friends. They told me they couldn't tell the difference as long as there was sauce coating the pasta and they cleaned off their plates. The Pros are texture, taste and the fact that you don't have to rinse this ORGANIC GF pasta after cooking.  The Cons are that the leftovers don't reheat very well and have a tendency to fall apart.  Cooking tip: I've made this penne multiple times and while the packaging notes an 11 minutes cooking time - I always have to cook it a bit longer for it to be acceptably al dente. (I live at sea level.) Ultimately - I'm one happy camper with Bionaturae GF Penne, it's the best yet.  I don't think their GF spaghetti is quite as satisfying though. Most likely the tube shape penne works better simply because it holds more sauce. I also used Bionaturae GF elbow pasta to make a cold pasta salad - it was OK but nothing like the "real thing". Still - the Bionaturae GF penne was a genuine find.

Very popular with folks who eat wheat as well as gluten-free folks.<br />This pasta is more forgiving to over- and under-cooking than other gluten free pastas.

Great flavor and texture, it takes a little bit longer to cook, in fact its hard to over cook. I put it soup and it worked, no one knew the difference, only thing, if it cooks too much its kinda gross. But regular pasta is the same...It is pricey at the store and I just discovered I could buy it here on Amazon much cheaper so this is a game changer for me :)

review/summary: Bionature Gluten Free Pastas
review/text: I have never been a fan of regular pastas but my wife would eat pasta everyday and anyway it was fixed.  She was diagnosed with celiac disease about 4 years ago so we needed to find a pasta that she could eat.  After many trial and error processes we tried the Bionature pastas and they are wonderful.  Even I enjoy this pasta, and we eat it at least twice a week.<br />It is more epensive that other gluten free pastas, but it is well worth the extra cost.  I order the spaghetti, macaroni, fusilli, and the penne rigata by the case (6 or 12 pkgs.), and I have found no place cheaper than Amazon, especially with their free shipping.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0YW">bionaturae Organic Penne Rigate, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4P00">bionaturae Organic Spaghetti, Gluten Free, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI1L8">bionaturae Organic Fusilli, Gluten Free, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTC17S">bionaturae Organic Elbow Pasta, Gluten Free, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: This Is Really Good
review/text: I tried this pasta last night, and WOW, this is *really* good gluten free pasta.<br /><br />I've been gluten free for over eight years and have tried sooo many brands with mild success. This pasta blows away any brand that came close to being considered 'just good/okay'. As any Celiac or gluten intolerant person knows, gluten free pasta is 'just okay' when served right away. If you refrigerate it, and reheat it, bad things will come to your pasta. Not this pasta. It held up like a champ just after being cooked and then again after overnight refrigeration, which is why I'm writing this review.<br /><br />My only negative is about the nutritional value. It is made with rice flour, potato and rice starch and soy flour. I almost didn't buy it because of the lacking nutritional value. However, on taste and texture, this is the best gluten free past I've tried.

Having said that it doesn't fall apart if you reheat it, but it's not a great idea to make dishes ahead of time to cook later...  For thanksgiving I made a big dish of Baked Mac and Cheese.  When this is made fresh it's fine, but when I made it ahead of time to cook the next next day, the pasta was just too soft and it didn't taste right.<br /><br />This is one of e best that I've tried and since making food ahead of time isn't a usual concern, it's great for me.

review/text: A girlfriend of mine has been feeding her family gluten-free for quite some time so when I asked her to recommend some brands for pasta, this was at the top of her list.  Many of the gluten-free products (as you've probably discovered) are really sort of 'mealy'. This truly tastes almost like regular semolina penne pasta and my husband is fairly picky; he can't tell a difference.  My kids devour it.  This is definitely a better price than Whole Foods and the Subscribe & Save gives another 15% discount.  We add a little olive oil to the boiling water and then a little bit more after draining and we do not rinse it.

review/summary: Great texture. light on the stomach and gluten free!
review/text: So you find one member of your family has gluten issues and the rest of the family loves pasta.  Finally, we found a gluten free pasta that pleases the taste buds of those pasta lovers and yet addresses the gluten issue.<br /><br />We found this pasta brand was quick to cook, very light in texture, tasty but still had the pasta-consistency (not soggy and did notfall a part) you have gotten used to.<br /><br />The pasta is tasty enough that even the pasta lovers in our family are prepared to switch permanently to this gluten-free brand!

review/summary: Felt sticky on my teeth and like cement in my tummy
review/text: I bought this by mistake. I thought it was made from whole grain brown rice, my bad. I had it before (fusili, same ingredients) and didn't like it then but I tried it again anyway. In short, due to the texture, questionable healthiness factor, and price, as a pasta loving Italian-American, if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. But I give them kudos for trying. My full review is below. This review will not show as a verified Amazon purchase because I bought mine locally but I include photos too, partly to prove I bought it, partly to show I threw it in the garbage after my taste test.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />> Thick. The actual wall of the pasta is simply too thick. I felt it should be thinner for better mouth feel.<br /><br />> Tacky, sticky, chewy, just plain icky. It was so chewy, sticking to my teeth, I felt like I was biting into a mushy granola bar or candy bar. I tried taste testing it at 8 minutes cooking time, 9 minutes, 10, 11, and 12 minutes. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried all of them because I did buy this in the past and didn't like the texture then, so I wanted to give it every opportunity to cook properly this time. It was bad at all cooking times but it was most palatable at 12 minutes of a full rolling boil in plenty of water.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true al dente pasta-like texture. Well, I'm an Italian from NY and have been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years and this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought. So no, I don't think it gives "true pasta-like" texture as they claim. As I mention above, sticky icky.<br /><br />> It sat like a led weight in my stomach after eating about 2 ounces (dry weight) with home made fresh tomato sauce. Horrible feeling in my stomach even an hour later, like I'd just swallowed wet cement. I'm sure it will constipate me just like eating too much white bread so I just downed a fiber drink to help it move through me as fast as possible.<br /><br />> Not made from whole grain brown rice, it's white, which I feel means it's not really that healthy for you. But that's not the reason I gave it just 2 stars. It's not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so I wouldn't take away stars due to this. I just don't think people should eat white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead.<br /><br />> Made from rice, potato, and soy. The Potato is white, just like the rice. And soy, well more and more we're finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you. For centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning, it's only in modern times food manufacturer's are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can. I feel the combination of white rice, white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it.<br /><br />> Expensive. I purchased mine at a local store for $3.99 (one 12 ounce bag). Compared to regular pasta, which you can buy for about .75 per 16 ounces on sale. I honestly don't think it's worth the money. Currently sold here for $4.26 per bag ($25.56 for 6 bags, less if you use Amazon Prime). If you have already tried this stuff and like it and don't mind paying four times the price of regular pasta, and can't get it locally, then Amazon Prime is the way to go. Ask me how to get Amazon Prime free shipping perks. I tend to think most specialty food items are over priced because the manufacturer thinks they can price their items high, but maybe bionaturae (being relatively small family owned company) is so small that they need to price items so high to make a profit. Not sure, but either way I don't see it being worth the price.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />> Organic<br /><br />> Gluten Free<br /><br />> Kosher (circle K symbol)<br /><br />> Produced at a dedicated gluten free facility with no risk of cross contamination with dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, or eggs.<br /><br />> The manufacturer is one of a select few in Italy who are authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health to produce gluten free pasta. The factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle. Independent testing is also done at a laboratory in the United States on each lot before the products are distributed in this country.<br /><br />> The actual taste is a little like regular pasta. But I'm being generous saying this since the texture was so bad I nearly gagged on it.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Organic Rice Flour, Organic Rice Starch, Organic Potato Starch, Organic Soy Flour<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL FACTS:<br /><br />Serving Size: 2 ounces<br />Servings per container: 6<br /><br />Calories: 200<br />Calories From Fat: 10<br />Total Fat: 1g<br />Saturated Fat: 0<br />Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 0<br />Sodium: 0<br />Total Carbs: 42g (14% daily recommended amount)<br />Dietary Fiber 2g (doubtful)<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Protein: 5g<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />COMPANY INFORMATION:<br /><br />Euro-USA Trading Co., Inc.

review/summary: Bali's Best Citrus Green Tea Candy
review/text: Bali's Best is by far the best brand of tea candy I've tasted; however, this is not their best one. Their iced tea and green tea candy taste intensely as advertised; most people are surprised at how intense and natural the tea flavors are. In this one, I find the tea flavor a little muddled by the citrus. It's still a delicious candy, though, and like the others the ingredients are all natural.

review/text: I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.

It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.

review/summary: Great ground cocoa
review/text: This is basically frozen cocoa nibs ground to a powder.  No chemicals, no additives, no cooking.  While the health benefits are debatable, we're using this for all of our chocolate needs.  It doesnt 'melt' well into cold products, but we warm it for hot cocoa and incorporate it into recipes.  I add a spoonful to chilis and hearty stews and my wife made a cool 'bar' out of coconut manna, chia seeds, hemp seeds, this cocoa, almond butter, dates, etc.  It all came together in a food processor in a few minutes and tastes like a chocolate almond coconut power bar, but its got way more protein, good fats, and very few carbs.<br /><br />Pretty good price for what it is, well recommended especially if you're a believer in antioxidants and health benefits of chocolate, or even if you just like great cocoa for baking.

review/summary: Pure Cacao Powder by Navitas
review/text: I read an article last year about people in other countries who live to a great old age, without heart disease and cancer. One culture managed this, according to the article, by drinking as many as 5 cups of raw cocoa per day. I was interested in the possible health benefits, so after some research I discovered Navitas Cacao on Amazon and placed my order. We've been hooked ever since...Read the label.(BTW, this product has fiber in it. It took us a while to adjust our diets accordingly and for our bodies to adjust to the extra fiber.) We consume, on average, around 2 cups of hot cocoa each, per day.<br />I have priced it in health food stores and have yet to find such a good deal as Amazon offers.<br />As for the product, it really has changed our lives. We have never looked forward to a cup of anything as much as we look forward to a cup of hot cocoa made with this powder. (I know it contributed to me losing 30 pounds last year.) It is energizing,delicious and satisfying....and my husband loves it as much as I do! My favorite way to drink it is in a cup of hot (organic) milk with a tablespoon or two of (raw unprocessed) honey.  (You have to stir it extra well.) You can also bake with it, add it to coffee for a cafe mocha beverage, etc. AND it's low-calorie! If you love chocolate, this is the ultimate in pure chocolate bliss. Don't expect it to be sweet. This is dark; no sugar added.

review/summary: Too Bitter
review/text: This product is wayyy to bitter for me. I am not discounting the quality however the taste is very strong and bitter. I realize this isn't the over-sugared chocolate like snickers, however i was expecting to be able to doctor it a little. I am still trying out recipes to see what works. I am not a coffee lover which i am assuming you would almost have to be since this tastes very similar to coffee. I do like chocolate but this was a tad overpowering. But the product was as described, in powdered form and does smell great. That's the only reason i gave it a low rating is because of taste otherwise it would be 5 stars.

review/summary: Mild and almost sweet smell for a raw chocolate
review/text: I been using Sunfood Cacao Powder for a while but I wanted to try Navitas one, because I like very much both their Maca and Acai (and now Gojis also). The price is a steal, it's half the price of Sunfood. When I was a little concern was when I opened the bag: The smell of the powder is almost sweet, seems like I was opening one of Hersheys' cans. I don't know if that is because its a different kind of cacao (hope so) or because it is not organic or raw (hope been wrong with those two latter reasons).<br />Besides that in my smoothies the powder mixed up very good and the flavor is good althogh not fantastic as I was hoping for.<br /><br />Perhaps I just need Navitas confirms this is the real one (organic and raw) besides the sweet smell.

review/summary: "DARK" is an Overstatement
review/text: I am a dark cacao lover and was terribly disappointed in the Navitas product.  In fact, when it first arrived, I thought that the incorrect product was sent in that the word "Dark" did not appear on the package.  Rather than making additional enquiries I decided to "move on" -- perhaps I'd understand when I opened the package that "dark" was assumed and was, accordingly, not stated on the package.  I was disappointed in the pale color of the product and even more so by the lack of intensity of the flavor -- nothing "dark" about it.<br /><br />If you are one to buy bar chocolate with a 65%+ cacao flavor, you'll probably be disappointed.  Otherwise , I guess that it is a respectable product.  But I, for one, am more interested in flavor than claims of pedigree, etc.

review/summary: This Cacao is NOT RAW!!!
review/text: Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back.<br />Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality. If you look closely on some of the older packages, you can pull the Vitality sticker off that is covering up the vitamin C label. Which means that it has been cooked/processed in some way that removed that natural occurring Vitamin C.<br />I only use the highest quality cacao, from reputable sources. Less quality, Other "raw" cacao beans on the market are not only of cheap forastero cacao varieties, they also are contaminated with several types of dangerous bacteria (remember cacao is a tropical crop where microbe contamination is more difficult to control).<br />Remember you get what you pay for. Quality usually comes with a price. So check your facts before going cheap.

review/summary: CHOCOLATE IS HIGHLY TOXIC.
review/text: I was a big fan of raw chocolate, in fact I have ordered from Navitas for their cacao powder. However, I have recently found out that cacao powder has the highest source of THEOBROMINE which a neurotoxin. Having cacao powder on a CONSISTENT BASIS has been shown to cause tremble, sweating, nausea among a list of other side-effects. So essentially, you are harming your brain when eating chocolate. You might be very surprised to learn of these side-effects as I was myself but please do your OWN RESEARCH and you will come across same conclusions.<br />Even the natives in South America never used cacoa as supplements. The fresh fruit from that comes from cacao plant(aka theobroma plant) is what the natives eat and use for making drinks. The fruit is harmless but it is the seeds inside the fruit, which are used to make this powder or any chocolate, that are extremely harmful.<br />I have heard Carob is an excellent alternative.

review/summary: The Truth About Vitamin C In Raw Cacao
review/text: Hello Raw Cacao Lovers!<br /><br />Here is the real truth about vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content in Raw Cacao:<br /><br />Despite the trafficked reports circulating the internet, the honest truth remains: even when processed at low temperatures (i.e. "raw"), there is no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present in cacao.<br /><br />Recently, highly trafficked websites such as[...] have highlighted the misinformation of cacao's supposed vitamin C content. Included in these reports are claims that raw cacao is "extraordinarily high in vitamin C."<br /><br />Back in 2004, our Navitas Naturals lab tests directly looked for vitamin C content in raw cacao, but came up negative. Despite these results, the current media blitz brought us back again for another round of lab testing of our best-selling raw cacao products (beans, nibs and powder) for vitamin C. This time, we used two different laboratories instead of one, and utilized three different analytical methods: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Capilary Electrophoresis (CE) with UV detection, and Titration.<br /><br />Though all three methods have their place in the scientific community, Titration is the most commonly used method in the food industry when determining vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content. However, there is a critical detail within the Titration method many companies miss when testing raw cacao. The method of Titration is unable to differentiate the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) from the vitamin's analogs. The result is what is known as a "false positive."<br /><br />This is why, at Navitas Naturals, we use HPLC when testing raw cacao's vitamin C content. The HPLC method looks directly for vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and not just the analogs. Additionally, after sending samples of our products to another lab to test using the CE method, the reports returned consistent the HPLC results.<br /><br />We have now also tested one of the largest raw cacao brands in the United States using the Titration and HPLC methods. And yet again the results confirm our previous conclusion that raw cacao has no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present.<br /><br />Cacao is a tremendously beneficial superfood, containing a wide spectrum of minerals and phytonutrients. It is important to be clear however, Vitamin C is not amongst these nutrients.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Zach Adelman, President<br />Navitas Naturals

review/text: I love this chocolate powder. My family and I recently became aware that MSG and its hidden forms (autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed protein, yeast extract, calcium caseinate, natural flavors, etc.) are the source of our health problems. This discovery led to searching for less processed (especially by high heat) food products. This is a great find! Do beware, if you try this stuff you will not be able to go back to Hershey's....it is that good. Hot chocolate, chocolate ice cream, chocolate nut butters are all fabulous made with chocolate powder rather than highly processed cocoa powder.

review/text: I have a subscription to this product because it's so good, and you can't beat the price. The powder easily mixes into anything. It has a full, rich flavor with no additives or fillers and it's raw. My favorite way to use it is to mix it into coconut oil and agave, with a little extract like peppermint, orange, or lemon. It makes a lovely chocolate sauce that hardens on contact when it touches something frozen. I add the sauce to banana icecream, which is made from frozen bananas which I run through my juicer machine with the blank plate to make raw soft serve. It's a wonderful, raw healthy treat that I sometimes have in place of a meal. Go ahead and subscribe and get Amazon prime. It's totally worth it for this cacao powder.

review/summary: This is not chocolate as you may know it.  Change your expectations.
review/text: This is raw CACAO powder NOT COCOA powder.  This is NOT like Ghirardelli's or Hershey's or Nestle's or Swiss Miss cocoa powder.  This is NOT a direct substitute for those products in cooking or making hot chocolate.  There is no sugar in this product, it is bitter (the way it was meant to be) and it is a different product.<br /><br />This is also made from cacao beans like chocolate but it isn't processed the same way.  This is a simply ground (minimally processed to remove the bean's husk) cacao beans. In fact, unlike cocoa or chocolate this is high in fiber and low in fat (17% of the calories come from fat content).  It is low in calories at 24 calories per tablespoon. It also has ALL the health benefits of chocolate at a much, much higher concentration than even the darkest chocolate because the processing of chocolate/cocoa breaks down the healthy compounds.<br /><br />So, how do people use it?  I mix this product with hot chocolate mix to add a little bite to it.  I also add a level tablespoon to my coffee in the morning to give it a cafe mocha type flavor that I have grown addicted to!  People substitute this for cocoa only when they are either adjusting their expectations or their recipes.

review/text: I love this product. I add it to protein/whey/yogurt shakes, and to give a more chocolatey kick to hot chocolate. I take only half of the cheap hot chocolate mix and add a spoonful of this chocolate. The resulting hot chocolate is much richer and not nearly so sweet. I also use it with Acai powder (Sambazon or Amazon Thunder) and add one or two drops of stevia. Acai/Chocolate blend is really the best for mental energy, not just physical energy; It helps me focus for studying, writing, or problem-solving. This powder is a bit coarse, so it works better in cold drinks if shaken or blended, and in hot drinks you need to stir a few more times than usual. This a good price in a two-pack.

review/summary: Great stuff.
review/text: It's just cocoa -- pure, raw, high quality cocoa -- with no ifs, ands, buts, or additives. Great for drinks (it helps to stir it with a bit of syrup or hot liquid first, because the natural cocoa butter tends to keep it on top unless it's emulsified into the liquid) and for baking. Hershey's Natural is not bad, but this cocoa tastes better and is always fresher. Worth the difference in price, especially if you buy at the subscription rate.<br /><br />By the way, the reviewers who complained that this cocoa isn't "dark" enough for them appear not to understand how chocolate is prepared. Dark chocolate is made by treating raw cocoa with lye. Since this product is truly raw, unprocessed cocoa, it will not have the same taste or color as chemically processed cocoa. If that's what you want, buy "dutched" cocoa (or Hershey's Special Dark, which is a mixture of processed and raw cocoa) instead. It will not be "natural," and will not have as much antioxidant activity, but it will be darker.

review/summary: Unique, and excellent - not candy
review/text: Do not buy this expecting it to taste like a chocolate bar. It has a very complex flavor. It is raw bean, that is not false advertising. It tastes like an intense tropical nut crossed with a distinct fermented fruity wine/grape aroma, truly deep and unique, with the texture similar to cashew pieces. This is crushed up pieces of the raw cocoa bean. It does not blend into smoothies well, but that's how I use it. I mix it in with blueberries and hemp protein and it's great. I also put it on oatmeal. You could put it in cereal, or yogurt.. in peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, or fruit cocktails.. anything that has a touch of sugar in it. You can eat them plain, but it is slightly bitter, not at all unpleasant in my book, and actually much more enjoyable to me. I will never buy any other form of chocolate ever again.<br /><br />I am a health nut, and the highlight of this stuff is you can just tell you are getting a mega dose of antioxidants. A dark chocolate bar does not come remotely close to this stuff. I think the nutritional content is probably off the charts. To the person who said the fat in these is bad, they would be incorrect. This is not milk animal fat, like in most chocolate bars, and it is not extracted cocoa butter, it is naturally occurring good fat like those found in avocado, coconut, and nuts, it is rapidly available as energy to your body and is burned off by your liver.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product, it is truly unique.

review/summary: Gentle aroma, makes nice bars, no soy allergy
review/text: This powder has a refreshingly subtle, confection-like aroma; it is thinly ground. I've used it to make my own solid chocolate bars - it worked very well, the chocolate tastes creamier and less bitter, then with my usual organic brand. I think this cocoa can be used specifically for making solid candy bars. Food allergy sufferers can appreciate it: soy free chocolate.  I found myself allergic to any factory or specialty gourmet chocolate bars even if they swore in written "never use emulsifyers" "soy free" "100% chocolate" etc (some of those "cheater" brands later started indicating soy lecithin in their ingredients).  Well, you can use this powder to make your own chocolate. It's a simple process. Just get good quality cocoa butter, use boiling water bath to melt it in, mix in enough cocoa powder to thicken the liquid a bit, add sweetener of your choice,  maybe powdered milk  - taste it and adjust any flavoring - and here the magic starts - heat the mixture up in the boiling water bath till it gets more liquidy (about 5 min) and cool it off while stirring till it thickens somewhat (about 2-3 min). Repeat at least 3-4 times; after the last heating pour it in a non-stick container (or any container laid with non-stick foil) and put it in the freezer until completely solid (an hour maybe). You can take it out of the freezer later and just keep is in the frigde. Depending on the air temperature you can keep it out of the fridge. P.S.: The more times you change the mixtures' temperature and the better you stir it when cooling, the solider  chocolate bar comes out of it. Practice makes perfect and Navitas Naturals Cacao helps!

review/summary: Wow, This Stuff Gets Me High!
review/text: The first time I used this brand of raw cacao I made raw chocolates with it.  When I licked the "batter" off a spoon before the candies hardened, I did a little dance in my kitchen.  It was so good I couldn't believe it.  I definitely had a brain chemical reaction from it.<br /><br />Raw chocolate is a totally different experience from cooked chocolate or cocoa.  If you have never tried it, DO!  You will never look at cooked chocolate the same way again.  I make raw chocolate candies for friends and package them up and pretty little wooden boxes.  I always use this brand and people rave about them.  And the fact that they are organic is a big plus for me since I buy organic whenever I can.<br /><br />I love the way this raw chocolate makes me feel, energetic, happy and high.  And with all the health benefits, too many to list here, you can't feel bad about eating it at all. I also use it in banana or coconut smoothies and make some really great raw almond milkshakes with it.<br /><br />And if you know any women with PMS, raw chocolate far surpasses regular chocolate.  It has more of the nutrients in tact because it is raw and not exposed to heat.  Most importantly for women, the magnesium content is through the roof, which helps to relax muscles and overall body tension.  This is reportedly one of the main reasons why women with PMS crave chocolate.  And it definitely takes the edge off of menstrual cramps.<br /><br />Healthy decadence!

However, the kids could tell the difference from the traditional powder I was using.  We had Equal Exchange cacao powder, which is good but processed with soy.<br />So, I ordered up this powder version, figuring they can grind it better than I can.  I was correct.  Wonderful powder and smell.  I made brownies two days ago and another version yesterday.  They are great with the powder!  I just placed another order since xmas season baking is approaching and I have almost used one of my bags already!<br />I will continue to use Navitas products.  We currently get the cashews, maca and cacao from here.  Great deal on Amazon and the best taste I can find.  Bonus is allegen free for us as well!

review/summary: Try this, it might become a staple!
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, this is expensive. But it's also a premium product and you won't feel guilty about having it as there are no added sugars or anything remotely artificial or overprocessed here, just a rich chocolate flavor with all the associated health benefits. In response to negative comments about its palatability: You definitely need a blender for this (a blender bottle would also work fine). There is no way to stir this into something and not taste residual powder. Raw cacao powder is also an acquired taste-- It is far more complex and richer than your ordinary pre-packaged cocoa powder, but it has such a different taste that some people might have a hard time liking it on their first try. Seriously, though, once you've had this in a properly made recipe, you'll never go back to whatever you were using before. A last major advantage is the versatility. You can easily adapt this to any recipe requiring cocoa, by adding your own sweetener. In one bag, you have the main ingredient for smoothies, desserts, and hot chocolate; and all these can be made to taste.<br /><br />So far, I've made these two things, numerous times, because they're that good:<br />- raspberry, banana, cacao powder smoothies: 1 rounded teaspoon cacao powder, 3/4 cup raspberries, 1/2 banana, 1/2 c. almond milk, 1/2 c. water<br />- hot chocolate: 1 1/2 rounded teaspoons cacao powder, 1/4 c. water, 3/4 c. hemp milk, raw honey to taste<br />I recommend omitting the water if you use a thinner milk such as almond milk. My hemp milk is pretty sweet, hence the 1/2 c. of water.

review/summary: bitter and very poor taste
review/text: I am used to ordering the nibs and grinding them myself.  The result is the richest chocolate flavore one can imagine!  This on the other hand left a gritty texture in the pudding I made and has a bitter flavor that could not be masked by even major amounts of sugar and very mild hint of chocolate.  First time ever my daughter said she didn't want her 'chocolate' pudding.

review/summary: Very fragrant and delicious healthy dietary supplement
review/text: I was quite pleasantly surprised how fragrant and chocolaty was this organic raw Cacao Powder was. It is nice to know that it was milled with low heat method to preserve the natural enzymes and nutrients inherent in cacao beans. I do eat raw cacao nibs and cacao beans and I do admit it's an acquired taste and that it does not taste like chocolate as we know it. But this powder did taste chocolaty and I was quite pleased.<br /><br />I have used this cacao powder to make shakes and dips. Just remember not everyone may like this. I made fruit dips with Mountain High Yogurt mixed with this cacao powder and raw honey and stirred vigorously and my guests did like the dip and were pleased by the strong presence of chocolate that they described as being very "pure".<br /><br />Latest medical research has found that cacao has very high antioxidants and it could be helpful for people with high blood pressure and diabetes and knowing that the store bought chocolates are laden with sugar, it is nice to have another way to get the healthful characteristics of chocolate without the harmfulness of refined sugar or corn syrups. Using a small amount of raw unfiltered honey just to sweeten whatever you are making seems to be a better alternative or use the all natural Stevia. Remember the amount is SMALL if you are using honey. To me the jury is still out on the agave nectar. I still remember how high fructose corn syrup was presented as been healthier than regular cane sugar and now we know that it is not true.

review/summary: Great Product, BUT......
review/text: This is the first RAW Cocoa I have tried and I really love it. I use and highly recommend rapunzel(non alkali) cocoa for our hot chocolate but I wanted something raw for our shakes and when I make raw fudge. Anyhow the flavor is great and I have nothing to complain about as far as the actual product goes.<br />My problem is with Amazons packaging... The same day I ordered this, I placed a seperate order for a case of coconut milk. The problem is they sent them both in the same box and when I opened it the case of coconut milk had squished the unprotected cocoa bags and one of them popped open at the top on the seam. I contacted Amazon and left bad packaging feedback but to my disappointment they have not contacted me. And in case your wondering, No they do not accept returns on food. (thankfully) :)<br />Otherwise, the poduct itself is fantastic ust be careful what you order through Amazon on the same day.<br />UPDATE: I took the advice from the comment left & contacted amazon, the very next day I had my new bag of raw cacao at my door. Glad I didn't lose out. Thanks Amazon!<br />P.S. I didn't call amazon I contact through email, when your logged in to your account click "contact us" I was amazed at how quicly they resolved the issue.

review/summary: Many options!
review/text: I love mixing one serving of this Cocoa Powder with about 4-5 frozen/cold bananas mixed up for after my workouts. Tastes great, and very healthy! Also these are Organic, and the Amazon S&S price is very reasonable. Would definitely recommend. I also mix this with any shakes or powders that are hard to drink with just water. To my surprise it is also quite high in protein relatively speaking (3g per serving) and quite low in fat (1.5g), and even so they are healthy fats. As a university student I find it quite useful in mixing with the shakes and with bananas and I know that this amount will last me a long time.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Organic.<br />+Well priced.<br />+Many options to use.<br />+Satisfies chocolate craving in a healthy way.<br />+High in many antioxidants and minerals such as Magnesium (about 80% of Americans on the standard diet are chronically deficient in Mg!).<br /><br />CONS<br />+By itself tastes bitter and chalky.<br />+Can be daunting to research different ways to use it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />If your up for a bit of a challenge in finding ways to use the stuff, and want a healthy way to make some of your favorite recipes into healthy options, then this product is perfect.

review/summary: It goes well with coffee.
review/text: I've always known about the high antioxidant level in raw caocao. However, I am not sure if it does any good. I try to eat a good balanced meal, and been healthy for a long time. As I get older, I need more energy to get through the day. I've decided to increase my intake of antioxidant. I add a teaspoon to my coffee 2x a day. I drink Starbucks bold; it's already kind of bitter. The raw caocao powder (bitter by itself) actually enhanced the flavor of coffee. After adding the raw sugar and cream, I don't even taste the bitterness of coffee and caocao. I do taste the rich flavor of caocao. It's a win-win scenario for me; better coffee and more antioxidant.

review/summary: Why aren't there more than five stars? :D
review/text: I have never tasted a product that makes me want to rush to the computer to leave an amazon review....until today. Oh. My. Gosh. This is by far the absolute best cocoa powder I have ever had. I am currently eating a smoothie I just made with a tablespoon or so of this cocoa powder and it is the richest, smoothest, more pure tasting chocolate I have ever eaten in my life. I've tried a lot of different cocoa powders over the years, but this one blows them all out of the water. More than Rapunzel, more than Hershey, THIS is the cocoa powder I will be recommending from now on. I am so much more than satisfied with this purchase.

review/summary: Great for Raw Deserts
review/text: I've been using this Cacao Powder in raw fruit and nut bars, ice creams, cookies, and smoothies/shakes for the past two weeks. It is a bit strong, so use in moderation, but considering it's 100% cacao, isn't that to be expected? Definitely a great buy for the price, and I have dozens of new raw recipes to try it in, so I'm sure I'll be purchasing more soon enough.

review/summary: wonderful product for a wonderful price
review/text: As long as you get this pack of 2 for the price of about $25 plus free shipping, it's a killer deal! Even if they were $30 I'd still buy them. The chocolate powder can be used as expected...just blend in your smoothies or use in baking/desserts. A little goes a long way--just a spoonful is enough for me each morning. It's very energizing and may be a little too overwhelming due to the caffeine content in it, but if you take it in moderation (or even combine it with some Maca Root powder, an anti-caffeine superfood) you should be fine.

review/summary: Bitter flavor too strong, but otherwise good.
review/text: Smells GREAT!  Looks great, mixes great (in blender), great for you...But the taste will scrunch your face and pucker your lips...in a bad way.  My daughter is used to the flavor now and will drink it in her milk with no sweetener.  Go figure.  Try it out.
