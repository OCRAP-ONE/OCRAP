review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Cookies
review/text: This is a great tasting cookie. It is very soft and the texture is very smooth. I usually do not like oatmeal cookies because the texture is very gritty and tough. This cookie does not have that problem. It tastes like your Mom just made it.

review/text: I've been eating Muir Glen salsa for years and its freakin' awesome!  I know it sounds ridiculous to be this enthusiastic about salsa, but as a fitness buff, this salsa is a great way to spice up otherwise bland, boring, health food.  My mainstay is brown rice and chicken, and this salsa packs the MOST flavor into the LEAST amount of calories out of any other i've tried over the years.  Plus, Muir Glen is a small company on the west coast that focuses on organic, sustainable agriculture, which is just the icing on the cake!

review/text: Recently while visiting the Carolinas I became hooked on She Crab soup, so I picked up this mix on Market Street.  Not only was it as good as what I had there, for the most part it was even better.  When I checked on Amazon and found the same brand I was thrilled.  Ordered three packages.  Service was great, and now I know I can have it whenever I get the craving for She Crab soup!

review/text: I've always loved M&Ms and the minis were the best.  But this is just too many minis.  The smaller bags or tubes would be better.  Eat a handful and forget about it.  But can't really eat a handful of these, then close up the bag, and put it away.  So, these actually stayed in my cabinets much longer then they normally would have simply because of the bag size.<br /><br />If you like minis and have the will power to eat a handful and put the bag away they are worth every penny.

review/summary: Tasteless, Weak, Brown Water
review/text: If that's what you're going for, then this is the coffee for you!<br /><br />To preface, I'm no coffee snob, but I've had my fair share of good and bad beans.  I took a chance on this brand because of an Amazon promotion, but I don't think I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I knew I was in trouble when I opened the bag.  Characteristic of the beans that I've enjoyed the most is a rich, oily sheen left on the beans from the roasting process.  These aromatic oils are filled with flavor and provide a richness to your brew.  This bag?  The beans looked dry and oil-free.  I confirmed this when I put it through my grinder.  The grinds didn't stick to the grinder and the lid because there were no oils to bind it.  A disappointment!<br /><br />I thought to myself though, that the proof is in the taste.  So I brewed a pot and confirmed my suspicion; the coffee lacked depth and really tasted like coffee flavored water.  Now in case you think that my wife and I like our brews dark and strong, that's not the case.  We're both in preference to roasts on the light-medium end of the scale.  But this is an entirely different animal -- the flavor is just....off.<br /><br />If you're purchasing from Amazon, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SJHO4M">Kicking Horse Coffee Z-Wrangler Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 12.3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> instead.  When you open those tins, the aroma...it's just out of this world.  The beans are characteristically oily with a beautiful, chocolate sheen. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z613JO">Magnum Kona Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 1 Lb Bag</a> is another that I can heartily recommend (though I prefer the Kicking Horse just a tad bit more).<br /><br />Yes, it's more costly, but really, it's a small luxury in this frugal era of "staycations" and still cheaper than buying Starbucks or DD every day.  It's safe to say that I will not be buying any more coffee of this brand.

review/summary: pretty good for the price
review/text: In a past life, I was a bit of a coffee snob. For the foreseeable future, however, I'm on a tight budget that makes keeping stocked up with expensive coffees for daily drinking just not tenable.<br /><br />The roast of this breakfast blend is on the lighter side of medium, but that's just what I want first thing in the morning. It has a smooth taste, very little bitterness (practically none), and the aroma is pleasant both before and after brewing.<br /><br />Is this coffee the greatest ever? Not by a long shot, no. But if you're looking for a decent, whole bean coffee that's a cut above the crap that comes preground in a can, and costs considerably less than $10/lb, you could do a lot worse than this stuff. I guess the best endorsement I could give this coffee is that I've been drinking it for the past month and I'll be ordering more as soon as I finish writing this review. Give it a shot!

review/summary: Our Favorite Coffee
review/text: We live in Louisiana and we try to buy local when possible which is the reason we tried this coffee a few years ago. We drink a lot of coffee and have tried many different brands, but this one is our favorite. We purchase the whole beans and use this grinder: http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-BVMC-BMH23-Automatic-Grinder/dp/B004T6EJS0 You can tell the difference between the coffee already ground and one you grind yourself. Not sure why anyone would not like this coffee but I find people's coffee palette, much like their wine, varies greatly. Also the Amazon subscribe and save is a great deal with the price of coffee skyrocketing lately. Even in Louisiana the cheapest you can find this coffee is close to $6 a bag. We are really happy Amazon sells it.

review/text: We have tried MANY whole bean coffees. We've spent a LOT of money trying different brands and local roasters. While this isn't the absolute best we've had, it is pleasent and delightful. No bitterness. Good aroma. GREAT price. FRESH! Amazon often has coupon codes to get 3 bags for about $10... What a deal! It stays fresher becuase you don't have one large bag that must be opened often... even if you're just refilling your canister you lose freshness & aroma. We're REALLY picky though. We think that the Dark Roast is too dark (it's more like Starbucks).

review/summary: SO disappointed -- not at all what I was expecting
review/text: The television commercials for Pepperidge Farm's MILANO MELTS cookies really worked -- I couldn't wait to buy a bag!  I'm a big fan of the original Milano cookies -- the cookies themselves are light, crispy, and perfectly paired with rich dark chocolate.  So what could go wrong with Milano cookies filled with dark, sumptuous chocolate creme?<br /><br />Well, MILANO MELTS are disappointing.  First, the cookie itself:  It's sort of a "double-thick" Milano cookie, which means it lacks the lightness and the delicate crispness of the original Milanos.  It's very hard around the edges, and the texture seems dense and unappetizing.  Then, there's the "dark chocolate creme":  It just lacks the flavor of the chocolate on the original Milanos.  Additionally, there's nowhere as much creme as you see in the TV commercials (or pictured on the package).  The creme is mostly located in one half of the cookie -- I took my first bite and wondered, "where is the creme?"  All I saw was a thin line of chocolate, which was tasteless buried inside that thick cookie.  There was more creme on the other side of the cookie, but it was nothing like what I was expecting.<br /><br />These are simply not as good as the original Milano cookies (which are wonderful).  This is an interesting-sounding idea that just didn't pan out.  Stick to the original Milanos -- they will not disappoint.

review/summary: Disappointing.
review/text: I don't buy a lot of treats but I love the original Milano cookies so I was excited to try these.  What a waste of money!<br /><br />First of all, the cookie texture sucks.  Not the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the original cookies at all.  Second, there was hardly any chocolate in there and what was in there was tasteless.  I was expecting a thicker chocolate - real chocolate just "melty" like the inside of a fererro rocher or lindor chocolates - but these are more like chocolate pudding or something.  Cheap tasting - not what I would expect from a Milano cookie at all.

review/summary: A steal for any dirty martini lover!
review/text: Dirty Martinis are my favorite drink. I used to just add the juice from a bottle of olives into my martini but I would go through the juice faster than the olives and my fridge was holding multiple "juiceless" bottles of olives. When I found this product I thought it was too good to be true - pure olive juice with no olives?? Then I saw the price so I had to jump on the deal.  Saucy Mama's olive juice is delicious and potent! I use about half of the amount of juice I normally would use from a bottle of olives, making the product last a long time. I have given a few bottles away to dirty martini lovers and have gone through quite a few at home and even almost a year after my purchase I still have a few bottles left to use. This item is definitely worth the price and is a quality product - why pay more??

review/text: I've never written a review before, perhaps because I've never been so spectacularly disappointed in a product. Yes, this is inexpensive, and for a reason! First, every bottle has some strange white residue floating in it, which you can't strain out. The juice itself gives the martini an nasty, metallic taste. I bought a case, used two bottles, and threw the rest out. If you want a good, reasonably-priced dirty martini mix, try Boscoli.

review/text: I found this product to be horrible.  The juice was extremely cloudy and there was also a thick white colored residue at the bottom of the bottle.  It cleared somewhat when shaken in the bottle however it never went away.  I felt the juice tasted somewhat bitter and I didn't care for the taste it added in my martini.  I stored several bottles sideways on a shelf in my liquor cabinet and noticed within about two months they were leaking from around the cap with a rusty slimy residue dripping out.

review/text: I got this at Cotsco for 15 bucks, they're authentic jelly belly jelly beans, I can't believe some people are doubting that. The Kirkland signature is owned by Cotsco, they would never do that, as they are a very respected brand. Any who, I agree that there are some "spit-em-out-quick" , like someone said before, but also I agree that they are many tasty flavors as well, and it's for a great value. Here are the list of the flavors, and the ones I consider to be "spit-em-out-quick"  flavors. I also gave them a grade of A through F. I'm testing every flavor while I write the review.<br /><br />**** Keep in mind that everyone has different preference and taste. If you flavors that you really like and I really like it too then the grades will help a lot since it will probable mean we have slightly same taste, if vice-versa, then there's nothing to see, other than which flavors you're going to get.****<br /><br />Berry Blue A (my favorite)<br />Cappuccino B(it's a hate it or love it flavor, I like it, it tastes like the coffee mints)<br />Cotton Candy -A<br />Green Apple -A<br />Lemon Drop -A<br />Margarita -A<br />Pina Colada -A<br />Red Apple +C<br />Strawberry Daiquiri +D<br />Blueberry -C<br />Caramel corn "spit-em-out-quick" F<br />A&W Cream Soda +C<br />Island Punch B+ (taste like tutti-frutti)<br />Lemon Lime A<br />Mixed Berry smoothie -A<br />Sunkist Pink Grapefruit A<br />A&W root beer -C (it's not as bad as it seems)<br />Strawberry Jam -A<br />Tutti-Frutti B<br />Bubble Gum A (I'm not a big fan of this flavor but it really tastes like bubble gun)<br />Chocolate Pudding -A<br />Crushed Pineapple +A<br />Juicy Pear A+ ( It really tastes like pear)<br />Licore "spit-em-out-quick" -F (not a surprise..)<br />Sunkist Orange A<br />Plum +B<br />Sizzling Cinnamon -A ( it has a spicy hint to it)<br />Sunkist Tangerine -A<br />Very Cherry A<br />Buttered Popcorn "spit-em-out-quick" -F (it really taste like popcorn, I'm a popcorn lover, but who wants that taste in a jelly bean? )<br />Cinnamon A (the same as Sizzling Cinnamon but stronger)<br />Dr Pepper +D<br />Kiwi -A<br />Sunkist Lime -A<br />Orange Sherbet B<br />Pomegranate B<br />Sour Cherry -B<br />Toasted Marshmallow "spit-em-out-quick" F<br />Cantaloupe A<br />Coconut A (it tastes just like coconut)<br />French Vanilla +D<br />Sunkist Lemon -A<br />Mango A<br />Peach A<br />Raspberry A<br />Strawberry Cheesecake B<br />Top Banana A<br />Wild Blackberry -B ( Be careful!

review/text: A number of reviewers have complained about the price of this product-- stating that it's higher than the price at Costco. While that statement is true-- this product is a good deal when 1) you're sending it to someone as a gift 2) you have an Amazon prime membership, and 3) the person you are sending the gift to does not live near a Costco-- or have a Costco membership. When those conditions are met, this is a great price performer, and a welcome gift. I was going to buy the product from Costco, and send it to a friend, until I realized that shipping would cost more than the difference in price-- along with my time, the cost of the box, packing material, etc. I've sent this item to friends regularly, they always enjoy it and appreciate the gift. I appreciate the quality of the Jelly Belly product, and saving on shipping- compared to sending it myself.

review/summary: Much Too Tasty!
review/text: I've always liked jelly beans and my wife has also. I never thought much about the different brands until I heard many years ago that President Ronald Reagan's favorite brand was Jelly Belly. Out of curiosity, I tried them. They were excellent! They were  smaller, quite brightly flavored and more expensive. In any case, I quite enjoyed them but we try to keep our consumption low. We try to eat (or serve) very little candy and when we serve it or eat it, the candy has to be first rate.<br /><br />Well, my wife and I were wandering the isles of our local warehouse store and there was a big display of Kirkland Signature Jelly Belly jelly beans. They came in four-pound jars and were much less expensive than the small packets we usually bought. How could we resist? They were excellent, just as we expected. The variety of flavors is incredible. Some people like to pick out types of all one kind and others just dip in and chew a mouthful to see what happens. I happen to be one of the latter. We keep the jar of jelly beans around mainly for guests and special events such as Halloween and birthdays, but now and then the temptation is just too much and we modestly indulge. They're really much too tasty!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I love these, and I don't even normally like jelly beans...
review/text: I have never been a big fan of jelly beans...I am more of a giant chewy sweet tart person. At my last quilting group meeting, one of the ladies brought a bag of what I thought was jelly beans. She offered me one, I respectfully declined saying thanks but I really don't like jelly beans. She replied, along with a few of the other gals that "These aren't jelly beans, they're jelly belly beans!". So, I decided to try them. Now here I am on Amazon after purchasing this 4 lb. package of jelly belly beans, I priced them in several places, this is definitely the best price. I did wonder when I saw Kirkland Signature before the Jelly Belly Beans that they would not be the same ones; I needn't have worried as these taste exactly the same as the others I have had.

review/summary: Such a bargain!
review/text: My former boss of blessed memory loved to put candy out in the office.  On a trip to Hershey, Pa she discovered Jelly Bellies which came in a nice platic canister.  I think it was about 2lbs.  The kids in the office would go nuts over them.  I haven't had them in years but when I came across this 4 lb wonder I had to order them.  I love the crazy flavors.  In fact, I think popcorn is my favorite.  Don't know if I could eat a handful of just that flavor but one at a time is just terrific.  As for the price, I don't belong to Costco and to save $3.50* wouldn't be worth a trip there because in the end I would probably spend a couple of hundred dollars there (like I do when I got to Target).  With Amazon I get my $25. worth to get free shipping and then I'm outa here.  *And no sales tax makes up for some of the price difference because you'd pay it at Costco.  Also, in the long run, I save because I've gotten some absurdly cheap prices here.

review/summary: Just as Good as Jelly Belly...
review/text: These Kirkland Signature Jelly Belly...Jelly Beans are basically Jelly Belly Jelly Beans.  Not only are they the same 49 flavors you get when you purchase a 49 flavor pack from Jelly Belly, but these also have the Jelly Belly logo.  They taste identical to a standard purchase of Jelly Belly Jelly Beans as well but cost much less per pound it seems.  To be honest my original review of Jelly Belly brand jelly Beans sums up Kirkland Signature Jelly Belly's perfectly.<br /><br />- As Seen on the Jelly Belly 2-pound Pouch review -<br /><br />"The jelly belly's I got were excellent quality as I am used to with the Jelly Belly brand. There is no comparison between a Jelly Belly bean and a generic jelly bean you find in the supermarket. Jelly Belly beans are richly flavored, with each flavored bean having a distinct flavor to it. This isn't just some sugary bean you pop into your mouth and enjoy a sweet treat. Each tiny bean is packed with flavor, and by having 49 distinct flavors (plus mix n' match combos) the variety makes each portion of jelly beans a flavorful adventure."<br /><br />*<br />The only real difference here is that Kirkland Signature comes out much cheaper per pound.  Amazon seems to typical be charging around $7.80 to $8.99  per pound for Jelly Belly...  Kirkland Signature comes in at around $6.50 per pound (as of 11/25/2011).  Still that is a steep price to pay for delicious jelly beans, but it is worth it.  I usually won't pay more than around $7.99/lb for Jelly Belly so these Kirkland Signature's come in at a good price range.<br /><br />This product I would of given 5 stars (just like the Jelly belly 2-pound pouch) but what holds it back is that Jelly Belly's make for a rather expensive treat; But a treat worth indulging in!  As for the price, yes you can easily get this product at Costco for cheaper (you can get 3-pound tubs of Jelly Belly at BJ's Warehouse also), but for an online purchase the price is quite fair.<br /><br />NOTE: I've included a list of all 49 flavors contained in this 4-pound tub in the comment section of the review

review/summary: Real Jelly Belly with 3 differences
review/text: There seems to be a question as to the authenticity of these jelly beans. As a long time Jelly Belly connoisseur, I would attest that these are indeed real Jelly Belly jellybeans, but there are 3 differences I have found between this jar and the smaller bags that you can purchase at your local supermarket:<br /><br />1. These beans do not have the little "Jelly Belly" white logo stamped on the beans.<br /><br />2. These beans come in 49 flavors as opposed to the regular 30 or 39 flavors that the assorted store bags come in. This might attest to the "What was that flavor? These taste different than the supermarket beans" claims of some reviewers. (Officially, the Jelly Belly website lists 50 official flavors. Anyone know which flavor was left out of this jar? :)<br /><br />3. Most importantly, I've noticed that the distribution of the assorted flavors seems less uniform in these big jars. I'm about 1/2 way through a jar and have yet to find a peach, Dr. Pepper, caramel corn or cappuccino and have only had a few buttered popcorn, juicy pear and top banana, but there seems to be a lot more of lemon, lime, orange and cherry. Understandably, it makes sense that the more exotic and probably more expensive to produce flavors are included less frequently in such a large, economy priced jar.<br /><br />Otherwise, these are as real as I can tell and there is still a pretty good assortment of flavors, just don't expect a lot of buttered popcorn...

review/summary: Last two orders were sticky, maybe moisture inside????
review/text: I ordered one of these, then I order two more.  The two in the second order were sticky and stuck together. I believe there was some moisture inside when they were sealed, but I am not sure.  They tasted fine but it was disapointing, since I bought them as gifts and I didn't feel comfortable in giving them as gifts because they were so stuck together, and sticking to the sides of the container. I decided to open and check it and I discovered that they were indeed sticky.  So I didn't want to give the second as a gift because I knew it was the same way by the looks.  When I finely open it, it too was the same way.

review/summary: For the love of Jelly Bellys
review/text: These are 100% the real thing.<br /><br />I bought out my local Walmart of jelly belly's for a party favor jars I am making. When they didn't have enough of the product I went on amazon ( which I should of done first would of saved a lot of money ). They shipped fast, the jar was full of goodness. When I got them I compared flavors with the jelly belly's I hard already purchased. They are the same product. The brand this is sub packaged by ( Kirkland Signature ) is actually the same brand at Costco. If Wikipedia is right about the brand Costco does own it ( I say if because it isn't always dead on ) but they do carry it in there stores.<br /><br />Will be purchasing again for my own greedy stash of Jelly Belly's!

review/summary: Authentic jelly belly beans at a great price
review/text: I discovered these at my local Costco and they've become a permanent staple on my kitchen counter. They're actually the perfect snack to leave out all the time because you only have to eat one or two to get that really sweet flavor kick that satisfies after a meal or between meals. These are authentic jelly belly beans with all of the great flavors and some of the nasty ones like buttered popcorn and licorice. This is a great deal for this many jelly beans if you factor in that you'll do what my wife does and only eat the brightly colored ones avoiding all dark colors like licorice and coffee.

These are very sweet and, now being a Type 2 diabetic, I can't have them anymore but still occasionally pick them up for my kids. They love that the individual flavors can be mixed to create interesting combinations and each one unique enough where it is possible to identify the flavors with some degree of certainty.<br /><br />Four pounds is a lot of jelly beans to eat casually, but they do keep for a long time.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: If you're looking for a delicious candy treat to haphazardly pop in your mouth and enjoy, beware.  This isn't a simple mix of run-of-the-mill flavors.  If you're looking for a mix of orange, cherry, lime, grape, etc. - stay away.  Great for those who are adventurous with their candy flavors, willing to be surprised by unexpected flavors.  As for me, I found myself digging through the container for safe, solid colored beans.  As in nature, colored specs are to be considered a warning.  Overall, a good buy.  Good flavors and texture.  But finding 49 different flavors of delicious jelly beans proves to be a stretch.

review/summary: Have Allergies? Read this
review/text: These fresh, delicious Jelly Belly jelly beans  are not packaged by Jelly Belly and the container states: "packaged on equipment that also packages products that contain peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soybeans, eggs, and milk".  Jelly Belly explains on their site: "on occasion other companies repackage our products...Please check with the packaging company regarding possible peanut and tree nut exposure."  If you buy from Jelly Belly you will pay more and wait longer for shipping but the jelly beans are only manufactured in a plant that processes nuts, but not on the same equipment.  I work in a school with a strict allergen policy and they wouldn't accept anything made on the same equipment as nuts, although they would accept jelly beans made in the same plant that processes nuts.  At least my husband and his colleagues enjoyed them!  If you don't have to worry about allergies, these are a great buy and contain a variety  of delicious flavors.  If you want to know what you are eating, the label contains pictures of the jelly beans with their flavors listed underneath.  These jelly beans are even kosher(under the O_U) and pareve.  If you do have allergies, it's best to be informed before you buy.

review/text: It's funny.. ask a kid what flavor they want and the answer will be "red" or "blue".. Aside from the Cinnamon, Blue and red are icky.. to me...I don't care much for the white or pink either. I guess my favorite would be the buttered popcorn(.. Least Fav  Licorice or black(cofee/brown..yuck)<br />  What I have found missing that is another fav is the red wrapped green that is watermelon.. I live by a "Deals" store and I usually buy up the 1.00 bags of 8 ounces each of the "Belly Flops". These are the mistakes.. The ones that didn't conform to the mold or were stuck together. It works out to about 2.00 a pound for real Jelly Belly's but if they don't have them a neck and neck contender is the Kirkland/Costco 4 pounder.. As a Jelly Belly eater since the 80's (Good old Ronnie Reagan) I find them to be just as good.. In fact, most of them are indistinguishable from Jelly Belly's... Considering the deal I get on the bags of "Belly Flops" this is still the second best deal. If you are a prime member, you pay no shipping.. Or tax , for that matter...<br />  Even a Jelly Belly snob wouldn't be able to tell these apart... blind folded of course beause most Jelly Belly's have a stamp..lol

The kids don't like them, I don't either.<br /><br />And whoever said that licorice and buttered popcorn are not good is WRONG. They are the best.<br /><br />JellyBelly factor sells them at this same price and you get to choose the flavors.

My favorite Jelly Belly brand jelly beans are the red apple flavor, but these weren't in there. The licorice flavored ones were really overpowering to me, but the real Jelly Belly's I like the licorice flavored ones. Not in this container though, I found myself skipping these ones. They are still a great deal, and they are great tasting beans. I am a real Jelly Belly fan, and for that reason alone I don't think I would purchase these again. I think the real Jelly Belly's have more taste to them. I am curious to know though, how they are able to use the Jelly Belly logo on these.

I have, however, learned that it is a good practice to check prices before having the luxury of having items sent to my door at no cost. For the most part Amazon's prices are in line and are competitive, but sometimes they run too far into left field and run head first into the wall. It is worth $10.00 to me to make a trip to Costco to buy a bucket of jelly beans. I bought this exact product today for $15.89 at Costco.  JohnD

review/text: Of all the light or healthy versions of canned soups by Campbell's (and others, too), this is my favorite. True, I happen to like most things that are Mexican in flavor, so that's a factor. But after sampling some "diet-friendly" soups that were bland or boring or heavy on the celery flavor (hate that), this was a lovely change.<br /><br />I've made sure to keep it stocked in my pantry for over a year now.<br /><br />It's tomatoey brothy, it's got black beans and chicken and rice, but it's not stew-like. It still has plenty of broth, so it's adaptable. I tend to sprinkle some low-fat cheddar on top to add to the flavor and texture. Some days, I'll open a can of black beans and add it for more fiber. When I want to splurge, I add more beans, corn, low fat cheese and a tiny dollop of lite sour cream.<br /><br />If you have leftover veggies and rice, you can thicken it into a stew. I've done it, and it works.<br /><br />Some info: One cup has 130 calories. It has 480 mg of sodium per serving, and 2 g of fat--one of those saturated--plus 2 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />This is just a fun soup and tasty and a winner from Campbell's. I hope it stays in their line permanently.<br /><br />A note: The convenient microwavable can version of this doesn't taste as good. It probably has to do with it being cooked IN the can in the nuker, maybe, not sure. But I did notice it tasted "tinny" in that other packaging. I'd recommend THIS can and cooking in a non-reactive pot (ie, stainless steel), because this broth is very tomatoey.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br />Mir
