review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/summary: I must have weird taste buds because I thought this thing was awesome!
review/text: I just ate one of these for lunch today and I thought it was awesome.  I went online to find more and I'm surprised it got such bad reviews.  I really liked it and I live in NYC where I eat pad thai and other foods enough to have some point of reference.  I thought it was pretty good.  The only thing I would do is add extra noodles if you're making it at home because I thought the sauce and spices were quite strong and could have been spread amongst more noodles.

review/text: I saw an add on TV for these and then read some reviews on the net (some good some bad). I bought a case of these and wish I hadn't. The sauce tastes terrible (vinegary) and the noodles look, feel, and taste like plastic. Let's be honest here, this IS a crappy microwaveable lunch so I wasn't expecting anything great. I was still EXTREMELY disappointed. I have no idea how a product like this is out on the market. Didn't they do any panel taste tests?

review/text: This is an instant noodle dish which you can whip up in 90 sec.  Compare to other instant foods, Annie Chun's foods are the best.  You think it has too much salt?  Add only half the sauce.  How much salt do you think there is in your cheese burger?  Not enough Thai flavor? Come on.  This is an instant food.  If you want real Thai flavor, either you have to make it yourself fresh or go to a Thai restaurant.  One poster said that she saute vegetables and shrimps with the sauce before she adds the noodle.  I'm going to totally copy her idea.  Yum!

review/text: I don't know what this is supposed to be but it tastes truly awful. If I was served this in a restaurant, I'd be running for the door. It looked unappealing when I opened up the pack and it totally lived up to it's looks. I ate it because I was hungry and I'd paid for it - but it wasn't a pleasant experience at all. Nothing like any Pad Thai I've ever eaten.  It tasted of what I imagine old cardboard to taste like. Ugh!

review/summary: Disgusting Excuse for Pad Thai
review/text: I absolutely love Pad Thai. It is one of my favorite dishes and I have eaten it in several Thai restaurants and although the variations are slightly different, it is always delicious. I have been trying to find Pad Thai in a box that I can heat up quite easily and eat it quickly, since I do not have time to go to the Thai restaurant in my city all the time! However, every single time I've tried Thai food in a box, it is nasty. This is no exception.<br /><br />One weird thing is that the noodles already felt damp when I opened the package. And then I opened the sauce packet....oh, I just about lost my appetite then. Pad Thai does NOT smell like that!!! It smelled similar to soy sauce, but worse. And then I tasted it...the taste was not any better and the aftertaste is even worse.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this. I'm never trying Pad Thai in a box again.

review/text: I prefer a light roast coffee and this is a good one. Flavor is good. Individually wrapped pods are easy to open, preserve freshness, and fit well in the Senseo.<br /><br />I generally add some milk and Torani Sugar Free syrup to a cup, warm in the microwave, froth with a mechanical frother and place on the Senseo to add coffee to make what I consider to be a decent cappuccino not too high in calories.<br /><br />Alternatively, I drink the coffee black with a little sweetener.<br /><br />Both are an enjoyable way to start the day.

review/summary: Great Product not so great USPS delivery
review/text: I use a lot of Clamato juice for mixed drinks and have gotten several orders from Amazon at a great price with good service for the subscribe and save. Unfortunately the postal carrier decided not to leave this shipment due to rain. Fine if you can't bag it than leave a delivery notice and re-attempt. Not so. Who knows how long it would have sat in the local post office if I hadn't have tracked the package. I finally called and after getting a bit of a run around they agreed to deliver it the next day if it didn't rain. It didn't and I had left instructions for the carrier in case of rain. Still all in all my delivery experience has not been an issue with Amazon.<br /><br />Now, as I've found several other subscribe and save items, the price just went up so I can buy it cheaper locally. Really disappointed as I like the convenience of having it delivered. This product has had no price increases locally in well over a year so I'm a bit confused why Amazon needed to raise it's price.

review/summary: this doesn't taste good
review/text: I love cinnamon, and I like mini wheats so does everyone in my family. I was surprised to see Kellog's came out with the new cinnamon mini wheats. Isn't that great and healthy? right? In addition to tiny amounts of real cinnamon they added very unpleasant artificial cinnamon/streusel flavoring. Why would anyone do such thing?? It ruined everything. Cinnamon tastes good on it's own. Does anyone put artificial flavors in their cinnamon rolls? On top of that they threw in some red #40 and sorbitol, it leaves a bad aftertaste especially if you eat cereal on an empty stomach (this is how I eat my cereal :o)) Artificial sweeteners make sense for  those who can not have sugar, but why put sorbitol if it already has syrup/sugar in it or vice versa?? It doesn't taste good, nothing like real cinnamon or cinnamon streusel, wheats are rock hard (they are not the same as originals) and have a weird texture. I would like to add that nobody in my family wants to eat this as well. Will not repurchase again. I just had a light bulb moment! I will sprinkle some cinnamon over original mini wheats.

review/summary: The Holy Grail of 100% whole wheat cereal flavors - almost
review/text: Several years back I became hooked on Mini-Wheats flavored simply as "Streusel" in those days on the box. Then one day, the flavor disappeared from the shelves of local grocery stores. Considering that no-so-hot flavors like strawberry continued I eventually concluded that not enough people knew what "Streusel" was and didn't try it.<br /><br />I was astounded to find Streusel available on Amazon but I was suspicious that they were now called "Cinnamon Streusel". Nevertheless I jumped. Just got today and while the original streusel flavor has been preserved it is now somewhat overpowered by the new cinnamon addition. Nevertheless I was happy to have the flavor back, as I was getting tired of Blueberry Muffin, the only other flavor of Mini-Wheats which I find edible.

review/text: Always loved shredded wheat as a good source of fiber while growing up, and now w/ the spoon-sized portions and the great new variety of frosting taste, I never get tired of trying the new taste and having it for breakfast! I've never seen Cinnamon Streusel in the aisle before, but thought I would try it, having just seen it on Amazon and loved eating it w/ the kids. Cereal is so expensive these days and goes so fast when you have 3 hungry, growing, young teenagers; so, it's nice to get 4 boxes, stock up a bit, and save a little. This is the first time I've ordered food through Amazon, and it came in a big box wrapped in cellophane, w/ all of the other boxes of cereal I ordered individually freshly sealed, like you would expect.

They taste great and are not overly sweet. The only thing is that these boxes are pretty small. 16oz may seem like a decent size, but with the cereal being on the heavier side, there isn't a whole lot in each box.  For the price paid, I am definately not complaining.  I would never pay retail for this, though.

Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

review/text: I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn"t find it anywhere.  Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price.  However, after receiving it and having a cup -  it TASTED nothing like the store bought product.  It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be.  There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure.  Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want.  Beware !!!

It's not quite as "rich" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/text: This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: best on the market
review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,<br />but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".

review/text: This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.  If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price.  I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com.  A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free.

review/summary: Sipped By a Blazing Fire..
review/text: Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix has always been a part of my family as a child and into adulthood. This stuff is chocolaty and tastes great when sipped on a cool Winter night with family and friends, next to a blazing fireplace while reminiscing about the years gone by. If only those years could be relived.. there would be time to enjoy more of this memorable drink.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

review/text: Question:  Are the larger (27.7 oz.) cans of the Nestle Rich Milk Chocolate cocoa mix (39 servings) no longer available??  The texture and taste of the cocoa in the smaller cans is nowhere near as good as the cocoa we have previously ordered.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Vernon Aune

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.

review/text: I had been purchasing these large cans of Nestle's Hot Chocolate all through last winter and even the summer months at my local grocery store. In the fall they stopped carrying the item.  I checked at several grocery stores with the same results.  I was surprised to see Amazon had the item. I placed my order and it arrived within the week. Very satisfied with the item and the service I received.

review/text: I was so excited when I found amazon selling the Nestle Hot Chocolate.  We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether.  It was very disappointing.  It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate.  As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.

Hopefully I will go through it all before the expiration date.  It is wonderful to know that you can have a "zero" point weight watchers snack in the evening.... It felt like having dessert without the guilt.  It mixes well, and was creamy and chocolately.  I would recommend to all!!

review/text: I also LOVE this stuff!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe Nestle's has stopped making it.<br /><br />I actually wrote them TWO letters.  They replied that the sales numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the continued production of it.<br /><br />I just can't believe this.  I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.
