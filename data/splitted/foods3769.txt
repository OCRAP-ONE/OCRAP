review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: I have two dogs with digestive problems and they need a treat that can be eaten without causing their systems to get upset.  This is one of only two products available that meets their needs.  No stool problems!  In addition, these 100% real chicken treats are small enough not to have to break apart for dogs on a restricted calorie count.  One treat will do it.  Lastly, since they are round they don't break apart into sharp pieces while the dogs are chewing them.  It is dangerous for a dog to try to swallow a hard, sharp piece of food!  This was a major problem even with my large dog and the flat 100% chicken treats on the market.  This is a great product!

review/summary: My dog knows these by name and RUNS for the treat jar
review/text: I've named these "chicken balls" and my Puggle is fully aware of what I mean when I utter those words. She RUNS to her treat jar and pokes at it with her nose with reckless impatience as I hurry along behind her. I love that they're simple with no additives, just dehydrated chicken and rice. They smell just like chicken and rice if you put them right up to your nose. So they're inoffensive for those with sensitive noses. They're bite size and super crunchy. These may be too large or too hard for Shih Tzu and smaller dogs. I say this because when I babysit an adult Shih Tzu, she attempts to eat it but can't. I've broken them into smaller pieces for her and she'll eat them. These do not stain the teeth like those other chewy treats with color additives. They're safe to keep at room temperature and they keep for a very long time since they're dehydrated, although they never last more than a couple of weeks in my house!<br /><br />I highly recommend them.

review/text: So happy I stumbled across these awesome, 40 calorie toast snacks.  I've only tried the cinnamon raisin variety, but I'm sure they are all good. I spread some 1/3 fat free Philadelphia strawberry cream cheese on the toast. It makes a delicious low-calorie snack.

I tried the Banana Walnut - and tried it straight from the package.<br />With a big glass of milk and maybe 10-15 seconds in the microwave, it would have been heavenly.  Have not tried the Cinnamon Roll flavor - but I'm trying.  Our local grocery store never has these in stock - they seem to sell out quickly - so grab some quick!  You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Delicious Snack
review/text: I sampled these bars at my local Super Target, and they were delicious.  I picked up a couple boxes because I like to have a nutritious snack around the house to tie me over between lunch and dinner.  These bars taste great - better than the Fiber One bars (I still buy the Chocolate Fiber One bars because they are good tasting as well).  These bars are a pleasant surprise - much more substance than a Nutri-Grain bar.  Anyone looking for a good snack bar, or even a quick breakfast bar should check these out (note, when I wrote this the Amazon price through a third-party was $6/box - I bought mine at Target for $2.49/box...might want to look local for a while on these).

review/summary: Delicious!  But overpriced here!
review/text: These things taste good!  I eat one or two for breakfast almost every day.  Microwave it 10 seconds like the box suggests - It is like having a fresh pastry for breakfast.<br /><br />But these are good for you, too.  I have to monitor my fiber and protein intake to keep them both high enough.  Two bars give me 10 grams of fiber [1/3 the total I need for the day], and 12 grams of protein [18% of the total].  I used to have to eat a lot of AllBran - a good way to get the fiber I need, but the taste gets to be like bland cardboard after awhile.  These bars taste good!  The added protein is a real boost.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you have a Target store nearby, check their shelves.  I have been getting mine for only a little more than half what this outlet charges.

review/text: After I'd purchased them once at the grocery store, our 12-year-old son kept asking me to get them again. Unfortunately, I could no longer find them anywhere in town. Thank goodness for Amazon! When the shipment came, my husband and 14-year-old son wanted to try them, too, and they both raved about them. They're not quite my cup of tea (I actually haven't tried them, because I'm afraid I'd be wishing I were eating homemade banana bread instead) - but everyone else loves them. And I hear they're particularly good after 15 seconds in the microwave!

review/text: This is my favorite cherry juice. First, I chose it because it's made with cherries picked locally to my home. Next, I discovered there are alleged anti-inflammatory benefits. (Personally, I have experienced this; however, I'm not a doctor and can't say it would work for others). Lastly, I tried others and why I keep coming back to Cheribundi Tru Cherry is two-fold: this brand is made entirely of cherries/not from concentrate AND tastes FANTASTIC. Other brands cannot come close.

review/summary: Best of a bad situation
review/text: Should preface this by saying that I find tart cherry juice fairly revolting in general, but it's a necessary evil for me as it's one of the few things that REALLY helps my gout. I bought this juice to both help my flare ups as well as help me MAINTAIN a healthy diet which will prevent future flare ups. That's the hard part for me because you don't really think about it until you have a flare up, and by then it's too late because there is no immediate relief...at best you start to feel better in a day or two. But that is SO much better than a week or two or more.<br /><br />So, if you suffer from gout, I would highly recommend making tart cherry juice (some people also say black cherry juice works as well but that's even worse than tart for me so...) a part of your regular health regimen. I intend to drink constantly during a flare up, and then a serving every other day or so to maintain. It's a lot of trial and error to find a system that works for you and it varies from person to person. So keep at it.<br /><br />That being said, I've tried many juices and while I don't "like" any of them, Cheribundi is FAR AND AWAY the best I've tried, and the fact that it comes in 8 oz bottles makes grabbing and going much easier, which is going to let me remember to drink it more. It's more convenient to grab the small bottle than pour in a cup, or make your own drink from juice extract (if this isn't a concern for you, I'd recommend purchasing the 3 32 oz bottles as they're slightly cheaper for the same amount, I'm paying the extra bit for convenience). This product is going to be a regular purchase for me and I will recommend it to anyone with similar problems.

I bought a four pack and fell in love with it, so I came on here to see if it was cheaper. It is about 20% cheaper... totally worth it to me. I have no idea about the anti inflammatory benefits or anything, but I like the taste, that it contains 50 cherries per bottle (!), and that all the cherries come from NY and MI. Pretty cool.

review/summary: Perfect Pasta
review/text: After being diagnosed with Celiac, I tried many, many brands of pasta. They were all a disappointment. Grainy, squishy, and if they even got slightly cool they'd harden up. Or they'd just fall apart in the pot if they weren't carefully watched.<br />Then an online friend recommended Tinkyada.<br />I bought a package. Just one. I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. My non GF'ers in the house couldn't even tell the difference from their regular veggie dyed pasta. The taste, texture, and ability to be al dente unlike most other GF pasta's makes this pasta the King of All GF Pasta's in my house. We've tried all the various pasta's that Tinkyada makes by this point and not a single one has disappointed us.<br />The ONLY con to this pasta is if you don't use it all at once, and refrigerate it for later. It tends to get stiff and grainy feeling. However, my 15 yo GF daughter microwaves the pasta for a couple minutes with about a TB of water and then puts them in a microwave safe dish to take to school for lunch. Just those few minutes with some extra water fixes the issue no problems.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this pasta to anyone struggling with a gluten-free diet. This pasta absolutely replaces all gluten containing pasta's, especially with how very many varieties Tinkyada makes! No more feeling sorry for yourself or your child with yucky pasta.

I prefer the shapes that provide the most surface area, like the spirals, because they are easier to cook "al dente."  Boil it in a big pot of water and stir frequently at the start to keep them from sticking to each other.  (No oil needed in the water.)

review/summary: High quality cat food that really looks like food
review/text: This looks like real food! The chicken is actual chicken shreds, not some amorphous grey paste. The other TikiCat varieties are similar - the fish looks like fish, you can see pieces of leafy greens, etc.<br /><br />My cats love this. They also love the salmon, chicken+salmon, ahi tuna, and all the "tuna on rice with ___" varieties. I calculated the % calories from protein (vs. from fat/carbs), because I'm looking for the cat food that has the highest %cals from protein. Of the five TikiCat varieties I checked out, Hawaiian grill has the highest %cal from protein, followed by Napili Luau and PukaPuka Luau. The "tuna on rice with __" do have some carbs, since they have rice in them, but I still feed them to my cats every now and then for variety (and because they're less expensive!). My cats love all the TikiCat varieties I've given them, and I feel comfortable feeding this brand of cat food to my cats, since I can see what it's made of, there's no weirdness on the ingredients panel, and everything I've heard about the company (Petropics) makes it sound like they're really environmentally conscious.<br /><br />GreenLittleCat did a review of TikiCat, including a picture of what's inside the can. They also did a "natural cat food showdown" where they compared a bunch of natural cat food companies' environmental practices, and TikiCat won! Google them, since I feel uncomfortable linking to an outside site. (I have no affiliation with GreenLittleCat)

review/summary: Awesome food!
review/text: Tiki Cat is the only brand of canned cat food that my cat actually seems to enjoy.  I started with the variety pack and she went crazy for every variety but the ones that have sardines.  Most Tiki Cat flavors are tuna based, and I wanted to add try this salmon and chicken flavor for variety.  It was a bit of a risk ordering a 12 pack of food that my cat has never tried, but she just had her first can today and she LOVES it!  I opened the can and it looks like home cooked chicken and salmon.  Smells great!  Very high quality food and I feel good about the company that makes it, Petropics.  I will definitely continue to buy this flavor.

review/summary: PLEASE, MOMMIE, PLEASE
review/text: When I unpack the TIKI Wild Salmon and Chicken when it arrives from Amazon, my cats know by the blue lable that it is their favorite food. There are four of the critters. I cannot seem to umpack it when they are asleep or playing. As soon as they hear me open an Amazon box, they run to see what "WE" got. If it is the BLUE TIKI CAN, they start right away with the, PLEASE, MOMMIE, PLEASE....OH, PLEASE...MEOW!<br /><br />I have never seen anything to equal their degree of anticipation when this TIKI arrives...SO...of course they get some RIGHT AWAY.<br /><br />This particular flavor is different from the others in that it is in shreds of, what looks to be, white meat of chicken. Then there are flakes of Salmon throughout these threads of chicken. If you are thinking shreds, as in that awful Friskies stuff, then forget it. More appropriately, these would be described as Threads...like a thin string. And they are not cut into small pieces parts of threads. It looks like Spagetti has looped itself around and around the cat food can. Actually, it looks pretty tasty. The kitties certainly think so!!!!!!!<br /><br />There is NO FISHY ODOR. Honest. Sounds like we are discussing people food. But, truly, no yuccky odor. Looks for all the world like I have opened a can of chicken, but for some reason it has been packed in threads instead of chunks.<br /><br />The kids like the other flavors OK. Sardines better than the rest. But they can take them or leave them. But with this stuff, they are begging to eat. Instead of putting a can in a small bowl as I usually do, I get a larger bowl and fill it with two cans of this TIKI treat. Then all four get some and they line up and behave politely knowing from experience that there is plenty for all.<br /><br />This is a bit pricey, but since there are never any left overs, or turned up noses, it makes up for the cost. I plan to give them a try at the plain Chicken next. They do not have this all the time, but when they do, it is a PLEASE, MOMMIE, PLEASE world. Which is a wonderful thing to a cat owner's ears.<br /><br />I and the kitties really, really are happy with this and suggest you try it too. But do not use it all. Leave some for those who gave you this great news!!!  Happy cat keeping to all of you.

Smells moderately strong but clean and unspoiled. Eaten with great joy by the cat family. Best of all: Dolphin-safe chicken!

review/summary: Very tasty, was worth trying
review/text: This is a very tasty product and was well worth trying.  As with many fresh meat and produce purchases it is pretty expensive compared to buying locally, but at the same time for someone living alone like I do, to have something like a corned beef roast pre-cooked and sliced into 12 ounce trays is a time saver.  This to me tastes as good as cooking a brisket at home, and I don't end up with a large amount of meat that I probably don't end up eating even as left overs.  When I am in the mood for corned beef, either as part of my main meal or since this is sliced for sandwiches, I can just microwave this.  12 ounces is more then enough for one person at a time.

review/text: The texture of these wine gums is okay, chewy like good wine gums ought to be. Unfortunately, the flavor of these wine gums really fall short. While the box claims "natural and artificial flavors," all I could taste was the artificial flavorings, and weak ones at that! At one point all the flavors seem to taste the same - just sweet but bland.<br /><br />While these are cheap, you do get just what you pay for. I'd say go for the Gustaf's wine gums instead, or just go ahead and splurge on Maynard's or Bassett's.

review/text: We were fortunate enough many years ago to spend a year in Texas which is where we discovered Wolf Brand Chili.  Throughout our many moves over the years, which have been coast to coast literally from Florida to Alaska, we have sought out Wolf Brand Chili and frequently have ordered it when it was not locally available.  I just want to be really clear THIS IS THE BEST CANNED CHILI IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, no I am SERIOUS.  Really no kidding this is not greasy or nasty or made with cheap garbage instead its got a full yummy flavor.  There are flavors for everyone our family eats 3 different flavors, I eat the beanless my husband favors the one with beans although I try to limit that, and our kids like the hot/spicy one, with rice, with cracks its quick its awesome.  We cant get it where we live now so we order it from Amazon.<br />One more time just in case there was maybe a bit of confusion THIS IS THE BEST CANNED CHILI IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!  at least what is sold in the US)

Having said that, I'm not quite satisfied with it in one respect: its hotness, or lack thereof. I like my chili hot, and this chile fails in that department. Unfortunately, I'm not a cook, and my attempts to "spice it up" have not yet worked, but I'll keep trying. So far I've tried powdered chili, and ground-up fresh jalapeno chile, but I didn't like the results. I know that there must be some percentage of some kind of additional hotness that will make it perfect, but I haven't found it yet. Something to look forward to.<br /><br />One more thought on my personal "hotness" meter. At one point I did read the label to make sure that it contained chile. I really hadn't been sure about that, but it does.

review/summary: Damaged deliveries;  chili soup.  UPDATED REVIEW
review/text: I've previously had this on Subscribe & Save (last year) but the next time I went to order it had been dropped from S&S.  Recently noticed that it was back on S&S again and decided to order it.  I received the order fairly quickly and as usual some cans were damaged. To the point that at least one of them I will not be able to open.  Amazon MUST do something about the way they package this stuff.  I discovered another disconcerting thing.  What I received in the can I would not call Chili, but maybe Chili Soup.  Unlike all of the Wolf Brand Chili I have ever had in the past this product poured out of the can.  In the past I would have to spoon out the chili and beans to get it out of the can.  Wolf Brand has reduced the meat and beans and is using more water.  WB's quality has diminished.<br /><br />UPDATED:<br /><br />Since unloading the case I have discovered that every single can is dented, some worse than others, a couple likely beyond opening.  I also wonder if the contents would be safe to eat.  The drop in quality of the product is bad enough but the state of the delivery is unacceptable. I'll be contacting Amazon about this.  They shouldn't sell canned goods if they can't deliver them properly.  Buyer beware!

review/summary: Best canned chili with spicy flavor!
review/text: I love chili, preferably with beans, since that is the way I grew up.  I crumble a half a sleeve of crackers in it, and I can not get enough of it.  I have tried all the manufactured cans of chili, and this manufacture is the king of canned chili, Wolf  brand chili!

review/summary: Texas chili
review/text: For this Texan living many years in NYC, good canned chili is a necessity when I don't have time to make my own. The national brands have been blanded down too much. Wolf's -- made in Texas bit not available in supermarkets in NYC --  is one of the very few which doesn't need to have additional chili powder to be hot enough.  I'm glad to be able to get it thru Amazon at a reasonable price with free postage.

review/summary: The Best Chili Yet!
review/text: I bought this Wolf Chili with Beans after reading several of the reviews.  I am so glad that I did.  This is good chili.  My husband and I have slathered it over tamales and spaghetti and corn chips.  The possibilities are endless.  We thought that Hormel Chili was the best.  Turns out that we prefer the Wolf Chili with Beans.  We are keeping this item on our shelves and will continue order this fine chili.

review/summary: Wolfbrand vs Steak n Shake
review/text: I have been an addict on Steak n Shake chilli all my life. I even found a clone home made receipe for Steak n Shake chilli on the net.. It was good but just not the same as the real deal. Then I found Wolfbrand in Krogers next to Steak n Shake chilli. It was $1.79 for a 15oz can and the Steak N Shake chilli was $3.59 for a 15oz can. In my brain, someone somewhere told me to try it but havent seen it in my area anywhere.<br />After consuming and comparing both Steak N Shake and Wolfbrand I can say Wolfbrand tastes almost exactly like Steak N Shake chilli. I say almost tastes the same is because Steak N Shake has cumin in it. Otherwise exactly the same. I add some cumin to the Wolfbrand when I prepair it and there you go. Awesume stuff. Now the price at Amazon on Wolfbrand chilli ends up being $2.12 a 15oz can if you get 24 cans @ $50.95. So if you could save  $1.80 a can if you shop around. I give this Wolfbrand product a 5 star.

review/text: I have never rated anything on Amazon before, but I was very impressed by this chili.  I have tried many different canned chilies and have found most of them are like a bland bean soup.  My favorite before trying Wolf's was Amy's vegetarian (and I am NOT a vegetarian) just because it had some flavor.  You can't get any better chili unless you make it yourself.

Don't get wrapped up in memories of the first time you ate it with an ex-boyfriend who told you it was the best ever because it's not AND don't ever brag to the heavens to your hubby that it's the BEST because you will be taken down a few notches like I was.<br /><br />Yes, I admit, what was I thinking or drinking when I decided WOLF was best ever because it's just like the rest.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />It's just like me... wah!

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: My case of Wolf chili arrived yesterday. Lets start with that. HEY AMAZON, whoever works in your shipping department should be fired. This case of chili was in a box about 8 inches larger than the case itself, no problem there. But only 1 piece of brown packing paper was used, and it was placed on top of the chili. There was no packing around the sides of the case, so this chili was sliding around in this box and tearing the box up. A few of the cans were dented, but no problem there. I worked in shipping and receiving before, and if anything was packed in this manner, it would be totally unacceptable. I am surprised UPS even accepted the package the way the case was sliding around in the box. Ok, enough of that. On to the chili itself.<br /><br />I bought this because I had read so many reviews about how Wolf chili is supposed to be the best. Well, I gotta say that it doesnt even come close to the best. First of all, open the can and pour it into the pot. Thats right, pour. The consistency of this chili is almost like soup. Any other can of chili you would either have to shake vigorously out of the can or spoon it out, but this stuff just pours out. And I think there was beef in it, but it must have been ground up so small that it was hardly noticable, again, adding to that watery consistency.<br /><br />As for the taste, well, it aint bad, but again, nowhere near the best. But the consistency of the chili and the taste combined? Makes you wonder how anyone can rave about this stuff. 4/10 at best, and thats being kind.<br /><br />If you want the best, I would go with Stagg. Many different flavors and a much higher quality, and better consistency.

review/summary: Don't get it
review/text: Bought a case after seeing the many great reviews of this chili....to me it's average at best. It's very pasty, with no real definition of meat, beans, or tomatoes. Almost pureed, like Hormel's chili....I will say I like it on hot dogs for that reason, but to eat as a stand alone dish...not so much. Doesn't compare to the Firehouse chili I buy in the grocery store.

review/summary: Greasy, was 5 stars for a canned chili~
review/text: It isn't greasy tasting, it's thick and damn good. I was vert surprised it held up to the gtreat reviews.  I added a few dried onions to it while cooking for ten minutes, the slight crisy and sweetness of the onion makes it taste as good as a restaurants.<br /><br />UPDATE...A week later I ate another serving, only I ate the whole can instead of only ten ounces....8 hours later my body was forced to regurgetate it. This has not happened to me since I ate some really greasy spicy chicken wings for lunch at work in 1993. I spit it into a paper towel, it was orange grease, I fear the same orange grease that rises to the top of most other canned chili's that I am able to mostly skim-off  This chili showed very little solid grease at the top, I could not quickly remove it, so I didn't. I suspect it had just as much but was emulsified into the thicker sauce, which I ended up eating and then regurgitating because my body could not digest it. I wish I hadn't eaten it. Now I have 22 cans more which I will be afraid to eat unless I can figure out how to easily get rid of some of the hidden grease.

review/text: I've purchased many different Americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh. I purchased 7 bottles from this TCP vendor and 5 of them were old, one even had a use by date of one year before my order! Working with TCP to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with Amazon. I finally did get a refund but only for the product, not the shipping charges. The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not.<br /><br />The two yellows I ordered from TCP were good and fresh. I'm happy with these colors but will not order again from TCP because of the other 5 old colors.

Often, these parts come from chickens that are not fit for human consumption, meaning they are diseased or decayed.

review/summary: Great for On-The-Go
review/text: These Godiva Milk Chocolate Pearls are getting harder to find in stores, which is a shame because they fill a great niche in the chocolate lover's life. They are a perfectly portable, portion-controlled (if you want them to be) indulgence.<br /><br />One drawback is the price tag on these, which I'll admit is hefty (it's usually cheaper in stores, if you can find them!). You're paying, though, not only for the quality chocolate, but also for the design and package. This tin is one of the only candy tins that I have never seen pop open at the bottom of a crowded purse. Never! The box doesn't seem perfectly air-tight, but it keeps the pearls fresh for a good long time regardless.<br /><br />The pearl design is super-smart, particularly given how many people (women especially) are trying to be portion conscious. One or two pearls can satisfy a chocolate craving without "costing" a lot of calories. The milk chocolate is more like Dove than one of the mid-low end brands like Hershey's.  It's sweet but not cloying, and melts smoothly on your tongue.<br /><br />I highly recommend Godiva Milk Chocolate Pearls. Given that they're becoming scarce on stores (and pricier online), I'm a little concerned they might be on the way out - try some while you can!

review/text: Update:  Sadly, my pup figured out how to get this treat out of the holder.  He chews with his back jaws and is able to flatten it pretty quickly and then somehow gets it out.  This used to last a day or two but is now only good for an hour or two.  If your dog is not a problem-solver, it can still be a good product but if he figures things out, then it quickly becomes a very expensive 1-2 hour event.<br /><br />Previous Review:  My young dog is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys (not people!).  He can deconstruct almost any kind of stuffed toy and he can EAT any size of rawhide treat.  Rawhide is a disaster for him because he chews off big chunks and then swallows them.  The rawhide doesn't digest well and the big dummy gets diarrhea.  I was actually worried he was going to get an intestinal blockage from rawhide so we banned the rawhide when we found this product.<br /><br />It is very hard to get the discs into the rubber treat ball.  I have to stand on them and even then they don't seat in very properly.  However, the dog has an equally difficult time getting the treats OUT.  He has to chew sort of sideways on this rounded treat using his back molars.  They must be tasty too because he keeps working on these and they last for days.<br /><br />We will continue to buy this product.  It keeps our pup busy, seems agreeable to his stomach, and compares very favorably to other chewy treats.

review/summary: Love em, and so do the dogs
review/text: These work great to occupy our dogs while we are away.  Using them inside the chew balls, which seem indestructible, keep them occupied for hours on end.  Their attention stays with the chew balls.  Excellent

review/summary: Tiny, gone in a few seconds
review/text: These treats are much smaller than I thought they would be, and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. For the price, I could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment. I gave them two stars only because my dogs did seem to like the taste. But then, they're not exactly picky.

review/summary: Our dogs second favorite everlasting treat
review/text: I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is with this barbecue version coming in close second! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but they really prefer this flavor and the vanilla mint. The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.<br /><br />Update: The malamute figured out if he sawed away at one side until about 1/4" was demolished, that he could then pull the whole thing out and just eat it.  Takes him 5 minutes to eat three of them now.  Good while it lasted! :)

review/summary: Great treat but...
review/text: this i believe is a great dog treat the only problem is i have yet to find a toy that will outlast the treat the toys designed to use with these treats seem to be made of a soft rubber that my dog chews into pieces the treats seem to keep him busy better then the toys themselves I gave this 3 stars because it is a good treat just has no use if the toys designed for them cant keep up I would suggest a ever-locking treat for a good chew treat for your pooch
