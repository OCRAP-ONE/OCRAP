review/summary: They are begging for their pills now!
review/text: I'm pretty good at shoving pills down cats' throats, but it really isn't fun for anyone involved, so I was happy to try the pill pockets. I was even more happy with the results.<br /><br />It's easy to put the pills into the putty-like cups and close them up. They accommodate even fairly big pills, and the cats will eat them right up. I haven't had any of the problem of them licking the treat off the pill that I'd had when trying other things like meat or peanut butter.<br /><br />The best thing? My cats come running as soon as they hear my open the pill bottle!<br /><br />They keep for quite a while, so even if you're only giving a short course of antibiotics or something I totally recommend them.

review/summary: These worked for a while
review/text: My sister recommended that I try these.  She has been giving her cat thyroid pills for years and swears by the pill pockets.  When my cat was in a bad cat fight, and required surgery, I had to give him antibiotics.  So my sister gave me some of her pill pockets to try on my cat.  They worked great. The vet then told me that I would need to start my cat on thyroid meds as well, so I went ahead and ordered more of the pill pockets.  Well the day after I ordered 4 bags of them, my cat figured out that he could eat the treat from the outside of the pill, and leave the pill. I tried a few more times, and he always ate the treat and left the pill.  So the 4 packs of pill pockets that I bought will be given to my sister now.<br /><br />So yes they are great unless your pet figures out that there is a pill inside.  My sister has been using them for a very long time and has no problem with them.

review/summary: Amazing Pill Pockets
review/text: I have to give my almost seventeen year old cat a half a pill three times a day. For several months when I first started giving her the pills, I put the pills in the pocket and put it on top her wet food. She ate it right up. The quality of her fur improved dramatically. Eventually she figured out the pocket was hiding something and stopped eating them on her own. I now have to shove them down her throat, and technically I don't need to use the pill pockets anymore, but I continue to use them because they cover up the bad pill taste, and the enzymes and nutrients noticeably improve her health. If I no longer had to give her pills, I would probably still give her the pill pockets.

review/summary: Pilling a cat is made easy by Pill Pockets
review/text: After years of hiding flavored liquid heart meds in my cat's treat food, the dreaded day arrived: the only way I could be sure of his swallowing all the meds was to pill him. My cat threatened to take me to divorce court; my savvy neighbor gave me some Pill Pockets to try, and from that day on, the living was easy! I enclosed up to five different pill pieces in one yummy chicken Pill Pocket, wet it to slide easier, and in one second pushed the entire treat down his throat. No bitter taste, no pills spit out later under the table, not even any resentful looks from my baby. And no guilt for me, as I knew the Pockets are made up of only healthy, fresh ingredients. The best part was that our relationship stayed great, while I knew all of his meds were properly ingested. I can't recomend this product highly enough; and buying it from Amazon rather than my vet saved me 2/3 of the cost.

review/summary: Makes giving pills easy
review/text: The treats are shaped like little meat cylinders.  There's an open center where you slip in the pill, then you squash the soft treat into a ball that has your pill in the center.  My cats barely notice that the pill exists.<br /><br />My cats like both the Chicken and the Salmon flavors.  While I don't think it's the healthiest treat (it would need more meat and fewer fillers for that), it's a whole lot less annoying than trying to shove a pill down a cat's throat.  The only time my cat wouldn't eat it was when he was very very sick and refusing everything.  In fact, the only thing I don't like about this product is the price... and this is a whole lot better than paying $8 a bag to get it from my vet's office!!

review/text: My cat was extremely ill and I had to give him 7 pills a day.  He's a big kitty--about 20 lbs--and was really fighting me, or taking the pill and then spitting it out.  I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them.  Wow!  What a difference.  As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his "treat."  This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen.  I highly recommend these.

review/summary: Well worth trying
review/text: I have an elderly cat who must have medications on a fairly regular basis.  He is a horror to try and pill. My vet gave me some of these to try him on and they are fantastic!  Normally the cat refuses anything with a pill in it and it turns into a wrestling match. But with these he takes his pill quite happily.<br /><br />The person who suggested using different hands for the pill and the treat is on the right track. My cat instinctively knows if I hand him something and hang around that it might be medicine, but with the pill pockets I can put the pill downin front of him like a treat and walk away.  He hasn't caught on yet!

review/text: My cat isn't a picky eater, but she had no interest in eating Pill Pockets. I was hopeful about these things, but my cat didn't even recognize that they were supposed to be eaten. Rolled it around, poked at it, sniffed it, and moved on. I can't imagine they are very fragrant or flavorful to get that kind of reaction since she eats everything else she sees. Glad to see others had success, but we weren't impressed.

review/summary: My Cat Wouldn't Eat Them
review/text: As the title suggested, my cat would not eat these.  They are rather large (about two times the size of an ordinary cat treat) and rubbery in texture.  I cannot attest to the flavour and how palatable it may or may not be to felines.  If your cat is used to "normal" treats, these may not go over well.  My cat is extremely difficult to pill, and we have tried basically every last idea known to man on how to get his daily meds into him.  We still have almost a whole package of these in the fridge.<br /><br />All I can say is, good luck.  I guess it all depends on the cat.

review/summary: 5 strikes and you are out
review/text: I really wish these pill pockets would work. Instead, I have tried every flavor (including the dog ones just in case) and I have followed every tip I could find online religiously.<br /><br />For instance, I take great care at handling the pills with the opposite hand as the one handling the pockets. I tried giving it to them alone, without pill just to see if they liked them. I have tried mixing them with treats they do like. Invariably all my 5 cats refuse to eat these pill pockets snacks. It makes me wonder if the manufacturer even ever tried giving them to a cat.<br /><br />It's really too bad because I have one kitty, one I am incredibly attached to, that is dying of hearth disease. I have to give him numerous pills every day. I have tried everything and I really hoped these treats would do the trick. Instead, what I am doing now is to take my Dremel tool and hollow out the cat treats he likes so I can put the medicine inside. It's painstaking work. The sad thing is that if I use this product even just as "mortar" to keep the other cat treat together, he is able to sniff it and won't eat it. I tried skipping the meds and it's not that. It's the pillpocket that doesn't work.<br /><br />Considering that 5 out of 5 cats do not like this pillpocket in my experience, I cannot really recommend them.

review/summary: I was leary, but..........they work!!!
review/text: My cat is extremely picky when it comes to treats, so I was leery about whether she would eat these or not.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then one of these, then a couple of hers, then one of these in order to trick her into trying them.  She likes them!<br /><br />After doing this for several different days, I put a pill in one of them.  She is little, so when I put the pill in one treat she chewed it, which is not what I wanted her to do, since she also chewed the pill.  She takes Prednisolone, which apparently has an awful, bitter taste.  So the next time I put the pill in the pocket, closed it and squeezed off all the excess Greenie treat until I got a little ball.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then snuck the pill treat in.  When she started to chew I put another treat in front of her quickly which made her swallow the pill treat whole so that she could eat the next treat.<br /><br />These work great for me!  No more having to sit on top of her, holding her down as she fights me, prying open her mouth and shoving the little pill to the back of her throat, just to have her spit it out so that I have to start the whole process all over again.  I'm sold, and I will be using these from now on.

review/summary: Finally... one battle conquered...
review/text: I had been struggling to find a way to give my cat with hyperthyroidism her medication twice daily.  I had tried all sorts of other things (american cheese, cream cheese, bread, etc) to wrap her pills in, but she always managed to spit them out.  This product has been a godsend!  Prior to finding this product, my cat had started to become anti-social, probably due to the fact that every time I managed to track her down she was being traumatized by being pinned down and having a pill shoved down her throat... now, if I am not right on time when it comes to giving her a pill, she is the one who lets me know now by meowing and making noise until she gets her pill.<br /><br />One suggestion... if your cat is not accustomed to receiving treats, I would introduce them to treats for about a week or two before introducing these.  My cat was skeptical of treats, because she never got them, so I started giving her Temptations cat treats about two weeks before starting the pill pockets.  It got her used to the idea of receiving treats daily, and after a short amount of time she was gobbling the treats without even chewing.  Made it much easier when I introduced her to the pill pockets - she ended up just gobbling those down too without chewing, so she doesn't even notice there is a pill buried inside.  Without this product, giving my cat her medication would be a daily battle - instead this product has made it a pleasure to give my cat her medication!

review/summary: Sometimes works
review/text: If you have a cat who is prone to gobbling treats whole, these will likely work. My cat, however, chews treats, so she breaks the pocket open and then tastes the pill and spits it all out. It would likely work best with small pills and then you could use part of the pocket and maybe the cat would swallow it without chewing. You need to be extremely careful if the pill is bitter; if you handle the pill and get residue on your hand and then use those fingers to pinch the pocket shut, it will get residue on the outside, which makes the cat less likely to take it. It might help to just feed a few as treats without pills in the beginning to get them used to the idea that they are treats?

review/summary: I wish I had discovered these sooner
review/text: These are awesome.  Not knowing that this product existed, I've been trying to make my own ad-hoc pill pockets with wet cat food.  When the food is too soft, my cat licks it right off the pill.  When the food is too firm, my cat has figured out how to crumble it apart to leave the pill in the bowl.  But this product is perfect.  The material is pliable (almost like chicken flavored Play-Doh) but won't allow cats to lick it away or crumble it apart.  In fact, while he eats it, I've been listening for the "crunch" that indicates that he bit into the bitter pill, but so far he's been swallowing it silently and whole, so it seems like the softness makes him believe he doesn't have to chew it - this is great, since he has no idea what's inside.  Now my cat begs me for his "treat" each day, even though he's a really picky eater and has turned down other new cat treats numerous times in the past.  I was a bit shocked at the price, but I was at my wits end trying to pill my cat, so I am willing to pay for the peace of mind.

review/summary: Be Careful if using these long term
review/text: I had been using these with much success for my cat for the last 8 months.  He has to have seizure medication twice a day, and he loves the pill pockets.  About 3 months ago, he started having chronic diarrhea that got worse and worse.  The vet tested him for everything and did x-rays and tried multiple medications, but he still didn't get better.  Than as a last thought, we decided to try to stop using the pill pockets completely and just giving him his medication in his food.  Within 5 days, our cat was back to normal, and within a few weeks he wasn't dehydrated anymore and gained some weight back.  I was very pleased with this product until I realized it was what was making my cat sick.  I thought it might just be him, but I found other sites online where people had cited the same problem.  I think this is a great product for help administering short-term medications, but I would make sure to monitor your cat if you are using them long-term.  If your cat starts getting chronic diarrhea, these may be the cause.

review/text: My older cat recently spent time in the animal hospital due to a blocked bladder. When he came home and the vet gave me pills to give him, she warned me that the pills stink and they had a hard time getting him to take them. I spent the first three days crushing them up and mixing them with tuna, then had to sit there and make sure he ate it - and that my other cat didn't!<br /><br />I found the Pill Pockets review when I googled "how to get a cat to take a pill." The idea was amazing, and the first few reviews were promising. I went to PetsMart and bought it the same day, and wow! My kitty ate that treat-covered pill like he was starving, and after he was done sat there and meowed at me for another. He even crunched right into the pill and never thought twice about finishing it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to every cat owner - salmon or chicken, doesn't matter, but these things work!!

review/summary: Life Saver for our CRF Cat
review/text: Our cat of 15 years was just recently diagnosed with Kidney Failure.<br /><br />Among the other things the vet prescribed to help her is a daily dose of Pepcid and an appetite stimulant which she takes every 3 days. She's not allowed to have a lot of protein (part of kidney failure), but the vet advised a little would be OK to disguise her pills in a small bit of food. We tried everything to get her to take the pills - tuna, cream cheese, regular cheese, cream, whipped cream, ham, turkey, baby food, etc. Although she usually loves all of these things (she comes running when we shake the whipped cream can!), she would not touch them when the pill was mixed in. We tried adding the pills whole as well as crushing and mixing them. No go.<br /><br />The vet suggested force-feeding her the pills. This includes wrapping her up in a towel while my husband forces her to open her jaw and throws the pill in while. I shoot a syringe full of water in forcing her to swallow the pill. Sounds pretty straight forward, but its not. Not to mention its stressful on us all. When we were finally able to get the pill in her mouth it actually started foaming!<br /><br />Needless to say, we were very frustrated and didn't know what to do. Then we found these. She loves them and hasn't even noticed the pill. We purchased both the Chicken and Salmon in case she gets bored of one flavor. We're crossing our fingers that she doesn't wise up. But they have literally been a life-saver!  Thank you Greenies!

review/summary: Great invention!
review/text: I'm a dog owner, but I got the cat size version at someone else's suggestion because it's more reasonable than the the dog version which comes with larger, but less, pockets.  These are great for little pills that your pet won't eat plain.  They're soft and wrap about the pill very easily.  When I have a larger pill, I use two of them.  Dogs seem to love them and are instantly eager to take their medicine.  Great invention!

review/text: If your cat's pills are small, use a half a pill pocket.  The treat is smaller so the cat doesn't chew it as much, and he's less likely to run into the bad tasting pill and spit it out.

review/summary: Great for most cats (and dogs) but not all!
review/text: My in-laws have a very food-driven feline who takes meds daily and LOVES these so we bought the dog versions of these for our poms. I was skeptical, because these are a bit pricy (especially if you buy them from the vet). However, they were so easy to use and our dogs loved them so much, we decided to get both cat versions (chicken and salmon) to try on our cat who takes daily heart meds.<br /><br />We tested them on all three of our cats (sans pills). Everyone LOVES Pill Pockets--except the one cat who actually needs them (typical). Oh, well. That's the way it can be with kitties sometimes, and our one cat doesn't generally like treats to begin with (unless it's fat-free cream cheese--spoiled fink).<br /><br />They are still worth a try--even if you have a finicky pet (one of our other cats is also finicky and LOVES them). If you have a very food-driven dog/cat you will probably be fine, but don't buy in bulk until you are sure they work for you. :)<br /><br />One last bit of adivce - if you have a mult-pet family and have to medicate one with strong pills, make sure you do it in a separate room with the door closed. Make sure he/she actually eats both the pill pocket and meds. Pill Pockets smell/taste soooo good, it is easy to run the risk of the wrong pet getting the medicated.

review/summary: With Pill Pockets my cat eagerly waits for his vitamins every morning!
review/text: Before I found Pill Pockets I had to trick, entice or coerce my cat by methods of whateverworks to take his vitamin supplement capsule for his skin & hair coat.  He would lick off the "likeable" vitamin I had to crush and roll the capsule in to entice him to eat, and sometimes spit the darn capsule out, now punctured and leaking all over.  Now with Pill Pockets (chicken flavor), I don't have to worry, as he readily waits for me every morning in the kitchen to get to his wrapped capsule.  The formula of Pill Pockets allows you to mold it around the pill or capsule, as it is more pliable with the heat from your hands.  These really are TERRIFIC!  They have made a tedious, high stressed duty become an easy, daily ritual that is only stressed by the imploring eyes of my cat who now pesters me to give him his vitamin before I can get my morning coffee.  I am also trying the Salmon flavor and will let you know how that is accepted.<br /><br />Only complaint:  Are there really 45 pcs. in each package?  It seems only like 2 weeks ago I started using these with the lack of hassle.  They are double the price from the local pet supply than online.

review/summary: My cats love it, it saves their life and is worth every penny!
review/text: Giving your pets meds, no matter what form, can be an awful experience for you and your pet. Two of my cats were diagnosed with thyroid issues which means they need pills, twice a day, forever. My vet told me about pill pockets during my visit so I picked them up. They are amazing!<br /><br />My cats treat their medicine time just like a regular treat time and are so happy when they get the pockets. They are worth every single penny I spend on them. I do have one tip, instead of using a whole pill pocket on one pill, break off a piece and wrap it around the pill. The pill pocket gets really gummy in contact with saliva and my cats were scared when they tried to eat a whole one because it stuck to their teeth. This way they get the pill in the first piece of the pocket and enjoy an extra piece as an added treat. Works much better this way.<br /><br />As cat owners we know all cats have different personalities so some cats may like it, some won't. If they don't I suggest putting the pill in a piece of chicken or tuna and it works the same way. But I'm fine with spending the extra money on a treat my cats love!

review/text: I had used Pill Pockets years ago when my feral tomcat was sick, but the old guy was so savvy and stubborn, he wouldn't eat them when he figured out I was sneaking stuff into them. So I wasn't sure they were such a great product and I forgot about them.<br /><br />But my other feral tomcat, the young one, needs medication now - and so I tried the Pill Pockets again and this time they are a real lifesaver. Dickens doesn't care if there's something inside it, he wants MORE. And my inside Persian cat, who also needs pills, loves the Pill Pockets as well. I'm able to give pills to my persian by popping them down his throat - but Pill Pockets are SO much nicer for my cat and for me. The Persian also begs for more of them!<br /><br />So I do give all my cats a Pill Pocket as a treat when the meds are handed out. My cats absolutely love these things.

While the reviews were largely favorable, I had my doubts because my cat is very picky about food & treats.  Well, he loved them from the start and now he actually looks forward to his daily pill - because he doesn't realize there is any medicine involved!  It has allowed both of us to relax and he can now trust me again.  Brilliant concept!

review/text: I have two very sweet kitties, but when it comes to giving them medicine they turn into wild banshees.  I finally decided to try Pill Pockets, and lo and behold, they worked!  They beg me for them even when they're not taking medication, so I give one to the cats every so often as a treat so hopefully they will continue to like them.  My only complaint is that they are a bit on the smallish side; sometimes the pill pokes out the other end and you have to stretch it a bit to make sure none of the pill shows before giving it to the cat. Otherwise, a great find! And waaaaay cheaper on Amazon than buying it at a pet store.

review/summary: Excellent Product, Bit Expensive and with Cats ...
review/text: Have now tried this product on 5 different cats.  Two gobbled them down with tablet inside.  One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all day - IT worked.  One cat sniffed and ran regardless of what I tried.<br /><br />CATS ... what can you say other than that?<br /><br />At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!<br /><br />Very easy to use, but a bit "greasy".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).  Think I may try the salmon flavor on other cat, can't hurt to try, if she doesn't like, the other cats may and at ~$6.00 no big investment.

review/text: Our elderly cat will need 2x daily pills for the rest ot his days.  I honestly believe he would not be with us still if it were not for pill pockets. He is frail and the trauma of being picked up and pilled would seriously negatively impact his quality of life.  We make sure to push the pill into the pocket so it sticks and doesn't fall out when he chews.  Also, we rotate through all three flavors so it stays 'treat-y' and he doesn't get bored with them.  Happy Kitty, happy owners!  You do have to be careful when you reseal the bag so they don't dry out prematurely. Once they dry out they crack and the pill doesn't stick as well.  The price here is excellent compared to our local pet chain stores where I've paid upwards of $7.

review/summary: Pill Pockets work well for my cats
review/text: I have made my own pockets by gouging snack treats but I prefer these for convenience. One of my cats has a sensitive digestion, but he has always done well with Greenies Pill Pockets. I usually use 1/2 to 1/3 of a pocket because they are gooey and he gets it stuck in his teeth (he looks like one of the Stooges eating a sandwich full of glue). Sometimes I glue a little pill he's been taking to the back of another kind of treat, using pocket material as putty. Also a small amount of pocket rolled around a vitamin tablet works well to convince him that what's good for him can also taste good!

review/summary: Veterinary approved for dogs. Still mixed about cats...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World...

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I have one cat with severe anxiety issues. He requires daily medication to keep him from stressing out and urine spraying. My oldest kitty has a mild heart condition and requires heart meds twice daily. Pill Pockets are a life saver! I don't have to scoop them up and use a pill dispenser to jab the meds down their throats. I simply place the tablets into the pocket, seal it and they happily gobble them up. My Dusty knows he's supposed to get his treatums twice a day and now doesn't even wait to be served. He comes right to the kitchen while they're being prepared.<br /><br />You may wonder why I only give it four stars if I think it's so great. No product is perfect and there are some things to be aware of especially if it's the first time trying these. If the tablet is large, it won't fit well and may need to be cut in half. Luckily one kitty gets 1/4 of a tablet twice a day and the other gets 1/2. If the cat chews the pocket it can come apart leaving a bad taste in their mouth or worse yet medication on the floor and no desire for another "treat". My Kali accidentally did this a few times when we first started and then refused to eat the pockets . What I did was went back to using the pill dispenser for the meds but giving him the empty pocket as a treat right after. I did this for about two weeks then tried again. Most of the time no problems any more. If you experience this problem don't give up. Stop using the pockets for meds right away to prevent negative association but treat with the pockets immediately after dosing. Try them again in a few weeks. At the very least, this stopped my cat from running when he saw the dispenser in my hand. I'd call him, let him smell the treat (at which point he'd start to drool)administer the pill, then reward. Either way much better than the stressful alternative.

I was skeptical because she is notoriously picky, but I didn't have any other options.  My husband got some, along with antibiotics in pill form.  We cut one in half and let her try it without a pill in it.  She LOVED it and asked for more!  We gave her the other half, and then the one with the pill in it.  SUCCESS!!

review/summary: When they work...they are great!
review/text: I've had years of experience pilling my various cats. I always swore by a combination pill gun and fill-em-yourself #3 gelcaps. Never had a problem. It turns out that this was not due to my technique as much as my dear departed cats were very good patients.<br /><br />Last month I was fostering a cat from the ASPCA who needed thyroid meds twice a day. Well, this poor thing would barely let me pat her without hissing, much less allow her jaw to be pryed open to put a pill down her throat. I bought a bag of Pill Pockets. They worked for exactly 3 doses. I could actually hear her growling as she hit the part that had the pill...and Tapizole is not known to be a terrible tasting med. As someone suggested, I gave her an empty one right before the 'loaded' pocket. But after the first few successes, she just refused to eat them. Unfortunately, I had to give her back to the ASPCA.<br /><br />I took another cat...a totally gentle sweetheart. She has some intestinal issues that require for a twice daily dose of Flagyl which is a notoriously vile tasting antibiotic. For this reason, I didn't even consider using the Pill Pockets I had left from the first cat. I went back to my old method of cutting up the pills and putting them into the gelcaps. As sweet as my new cat is, she proved very difficult to pill...she's not nasty, but she's a wriggler. I can manage it(sometimes it takes a few attempts), but there is no way that a cat-sitter or my husband could.<br /><br />Now it seems that my vet wants her to continue with the meds for an extended period...a problem if I have to be out of town. Just for the heck of it I decided to put a dose of Flagyl into a Pill Pocket to see what would happen. 'Odey' went right for the treat and started chewing...I waited for her to hit the pill and start foaming at the mouth...but she just swallowed everything and looked up at me to see if there was any more on the way!  I've given her three doses so far. Now she just scarfs them right down without a lot of chewing. Now when she hears the bag being opened, she runs right over and practically begs for her 'meds'.<br /><br />I hope that she doesn't discover my little secret...if she does, I'll go back to the pillgun. But in the meantime, It's wonderful not to have to forcibly wrestle down my sweet little pal twice a day, and to know that if I have to be away, someone else can easily medicate her.<br /><br />I give Pill Pockets 4 stars instead of 5 because of my initial unsuccessful experience and also because they are a little on the expensive side. Not really a problem once or twice twice a day, but I was giving my late cat, who had CRF 6 different meds stuffed into gelcaps 3 times a day...which could get a little price-y with PillPockets because you just can't fit as much into them.<br />LF

review/summary: Pill Pockets are a blessing
review/text: Before trying pill pockets, we used to shove a pill down our cat's throat.  She started running away from us and don't even ask what she did to our pet sitter.  Our vet sold us our first pack of these and we were really skeptical about them working.  Well, we were wrong.  Our cat loves them! We can go on vacation knowing our cat will get her medicine and the pet sitter can breathe easier!

The small size DOG pill pockets will cover a smaller capsule.  The CAT version will not!<br /><br />However, they did LOVE the taste!

review/text: I got a prescription for Cosequin capsules for my cat's arthritis from my vet today. He said to sprinkle them on her food, i knew that wouldn't work and the capsules were too big to pop them in her mouth. My vet told me to try the Pill Pockets (he charged me $8!!). So I took them home and opened the capsule and sprinkled the powder into the pill pocket, and my cat gobbled them up like crazy, some of the powder was even overflowing from the pill pocket onto the plate and my cat licked it all up. I could not believe it!! My problem is that one capsule's powder required 5 pill-pockets to take all the medication which could be expensive. My cat likes treatsin general, so she enjoyed this product very much!

review/summary: Change Not Always Good
review/text: I have been using Pill Pockets for years and am VERY disappointed that Greenies changed the ingredients. Not only are they not as moist, but they removed the probiotic which aids in digestion. They say only the packaging has changed, but I had an old package and compared the ingredients and they are DEFINITELY different. It is still a Good way to give a pill, but not as healthy or tasty. I have even found unknown pieces of hard stuff in some, (I use to break them up and roll into balls and give as treats. I have tried to track down any of the originals, but unfortunately, they seem to be all gone. So, if you need to give your cat a pill, buy them, I just don't give them as treats anymore. Sad that such a great product has gone from a 10 to a 4, in my opinion. And what's sadder, I wrote to Greenies about the ingredients  about 3 months ago and I have yet to hear a thing from them... Not very good customer relations.

review/text: Pilling my cat used to be awful. She hated being restrained and having something put in her mouth. She would struggle and often times spit it out, than run and hide. I would end up feeling so mean, dragging her out of her hiding place and trying again.<br /><br />I wasn't confident these pill pockets would work. My cat normally doesn't like treats. So, I put her medicine inside the salmon flavored pill pocket, then put it in a dish with a tablespoon of Fancy Feast salmon appetizer, which she loves, and spooned some of the juices over the pill pocket. She ate all of it very happily. Hooray!

review/text: Our oldest cat has problems with urinary tract blockages.  After the 3rd time to the vet in the past few years, they suggested giving coenzyme supplements for healthy bladder function.  Well he HATES pills.  It takes two people to give him his pills and he is not a happy camper.  These little puppies came in handy for prednisone, and now with coenzyme supplements.  Unfortunately these cannot hold a whole coenzyme supplement (even emptying the pill contents in the pill pocket), so I tried mushing 2 pill pockets and mixing the coenzyme powder with it.  Works like a charm!

review/summary: ABSOLUTE LIFESAVERS!!!
review/text: Recently one of my elderly cats was diagnosed with an ulcerated cornea that had both bacterial and fungal activity in it; wow. So I have to somehow get this fully clawed cat to swallow a pill twice a day, and also squirt antibiotic gel into her eyes. And somehow do this without losing a limb? Yeah right. This cat is FIERCE! Our vet recommended the Pill Pockets....WHAT A LIFESAVER!<br /><br />I have to squirt gel into my cat's eye 3 times a day and get her pilled up twice a day. So in the morning and at night, she gets a 'treat' afterwards: her antifungal pill wrapped in a pill pocket!! We laugh that she's being 'rewarded' with her pill. But she's looking for that pill as soon as we squirt in the eye gel, like a crack addict looking for their next high! She starts sniffing for her treat immediately. SHE LOVES these pill pockets! Which amazes me, as she is normally not the kind of cat to be fooled by medication wrapped up in treats. Nothing else we have ever tried, has worked like these.<br /><br />TOTAL recommendation to anyone and everyone from now on! I will also give these to my friends who have cats constantly on medication. These are a miracle product for us!

review/text: We have four cats. At various times, they've all needed to take pills, which can be a nightmare by normal methods. But the cats love the flavor of the chicken pill pockets, and will actually beg for them if they see us taking out the bag. We used to drop the filled pocket in their food, but have found it works better to just feed them by hand - they just gulp the thing down. Two things to note: for larger pills, might need to split the pill and use two pockets, or mold two pockets together around a capsule, and the second thing is that at least one of our cats won't touch the salmon version.<br /><br />At the moment, one cat is very happy - he's sick and needs three pills, which means he gets hand-fed three pill pockets every evening and two every morning!

review/summary: A miracle
review/text: My cat was recently diagnosed an epileptic, and will be on phenobarbital pills for probably the rest of her life. My cat loves to eat, especially table food, so I thought getting her to take her meds would be easy, crush the pill up, mix it in milk or sour cream or any of her favorite foods, and viola! But I quickly found out it was not so easy! I would be up at 6am chasing her around the house trying to get her to eat it, or force-feeding it to her, which me and the cat both hate to do! I discovered these pill pockets while doing research online and decided to order it. Let me tell you, medicine time is a piece of cake now! I dont even have to crush the pill up. You just stick the pill in the predesigned pocket, pinch the top together and my cat eagerly chomps it down! She loves both the chicken and salmon flavor, medicine time takes less than a minute to accomplish, and both me and the cat are happy! She has been enjoying these "treats" for a few weeks now, twice she ended up biting into the pill, yet the flavor of the treat was so appealing to her that she didn't pay any attention to the pill and kept chomping it down! We love these things, they really were the answer to our prayers, especially for my boyfriend who had been responsible for medicine time in the evenings while I am at work. My cat has always been more hesitant to take her meds when he is giving them to her, but since trying these pill pockets it has been absolutely no problem. We are all very thrilled with this product--mom, dad, and kitty!

We'd seen the vet force the pills down his throat which was traumatic for both him and for us, so when we found Greenies we were thrilled. He LOVES them. We call them "treats", and when I ask him if he's ready for his treat, he runs to the spot where I feed him. It's really very cute. I don't know what we would have done without Greenies because I wouldn't have been able to force pills down his throat. As it is, he happily takes them every single day.

review/text: We have a Bengal. They are known to be smarter, feistier and more opinionated than the average cat. When ours was struck with a sudden mystery illness that caused acute life threatening anemia - after a week in the hospital he came home with a strict and huge pill routine.<br /><br />For two weeks we fought, got bit, scratched, foamed on, etc. we tried liquids. Pills. Hiding them in food. Hiding them in other treats. Everything. He wasn't getting his meds - he'd throw them up. Foam them all out. Eat around them, etc.<br /><br />As a last hope we tried the pill pockets. I figured he was WAY too smart for this trick. The pills he takes are huge and foul smelling - I couldn't imagine he'd not smell them or not bite into them whole eating it.<br /><br />But - they worked!! And not just once - every time. He's going to be on steroids for probably a year, and into month 3 he still takes his 3 pills daily with pleasure! Talk about a literal life saver, we wouldn't have made it without them.

review/summary: Okay for some cats
review/text: The concept behind the product is wonderful, so I tried it with my cat. He's normally a loving, docile kitty but turns into Cat-Kong when we try to administer medication. It worked the first time, even though he had difficulty chewing it up because of the pocket's soft consistency. The second time we met with less success. It ended up slipping out of his mouth, and I had to offer it to him several times before he ate it. Thinking it was too soft for him to grasp with his teeth, I left one out on the counter to let it harden up a bit. The slightly hardened pocket worked the first time but failed to work after that. I think this product meets with more success with cats who enjoy wet cat food. My cat eats only dry food, so he lost interest in it quickly when he couldn't grasp it with his teeth. You may want to keep this in mind if your cat has only enjoyed the dry food. Even though it didn't work for my cat, it might be worth a try!

review/text: My cat is very finicky.  He eats only what he wants to eat and nothing else.  He has, on occasion, practicably starved himself because he didn't like the brand or flavor of food that I bought.  A short time ago he broke his foot, and while he is all better now, the doctors recommended an herbal supplement on days where his arthritis has really bothered him.  Giving him this pill, however, has turned out to be more traumatic experience, if not making the pain even worse then before I gave it to him.  Popping it into the Pill Pockets makes for a much better solution.  He thinks he's getting a treat, and although the first few times he was unwary, he has grown to love the treats and never noticing a pill inside.  I would recommend this to all finicky cats everywhere.

review/summary: What a wonderful invention!
review/text: One of my cat sitters told me about these wonderful products so I bought them locally so I could start using them right away.  On another site there were some good suggestions for using them:  1)  Before giving your pet one of these with the pill in it, give your cat one of the pockets just plain.  Your pet will be so anxious to get another one, he'll gobble the second one with a pill in it without hesitation.  2)  I think this is a key to success.  As you get ready to put a pill in the pocket, be careful to handle the pill with one hand, carefully putting it in the pocket, then with your other hand close up the pocket and hand the treat to your cat - this way the smell of the pill will not be transferred to the outside of the treat.  After a couple of days of success, I guess I got sloppy and didn't cover the pill up well enough.  The pill ended up on the floor, but I scooped it up and put it in another pill pocket and gave it to my cat and she gobbled it up.  I am sooooo happy not to have to stress my cat out any more.<br /><br />Followup:  A few days later I fell asleep in front of TV.  When I woke up the package of pill pockets was on the floor torn to shreds (this cat is declawed by the way).  She had probably eaten 25 pill pockets.  After that I could not get her to eat one - with or without a pill in it.  Soooooo, put them out of reach until you need to use them.

review/summary: Fantastic, Tosca loves them :-)
review/text: My cat Tosca has developed a medical condition requiring pills 2 x daily.  She is the sweetest cat, however, not too agreeable when she needs to be medicated.  With these pill pockets she comes running for her meds.  I now have to give the other  2 kitties a treat each time she gets her meds or they feel left out.  Terrific product if you need to medicate a cat and want a  hassel and/or stress free way for both the cat and you. I'm very happy with the results, well worth the $$ and quite a bit cheaper than any of the local retailers anywhere in the area that I've found, living in CT.

review/summary: So far, so good!!!!!
review/text: My 16 year old cat, little bug has joined that ever growing club of hyperthyroid cats.  While she is super easy to pill, is was clear that hunting her down twice a day to drop a pill down her throat was hurting our relationship.  In addition I wanted it to be easy for someone else to pill her when necessary. These so far have worked like a charm.  As she only gets a quarter tablet I tear the pocket in two and that cuts the cost down.  Amazon's price on these smokes the pet store and the the vet.

review/summary: Awesome for Picky Cat!
review/text: Our picky cat, Roxanne, was ordered buspirone for urine marking. She WILL NOT eat wet cat food. On a friend's recommendations, I bought these pill pockets but was not terribly hopeful. But JOY! Roxanne takes it right down! This is especially wonderful as she has to take the pill twice daily! This is an awesome product. It has been a week and she still hasn't figured out that there's a pill stuck inside. Thank you!

review/text: Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.  Do not buy.<br /><br />I should add - a few came broken during shipping. I was not upset. But the refrig directions make them un-useable. I have yet to pull them out or open the others since.

review/text: I thought these were pretty cool. I got to try out 4 flavors of Dave's hot sauce without putting in the cost of buying fullsized bottles. I liked em' all so far but you need to find creative uses for things like the garlic hot sauce. I also gave 2 of 3 extra packs to a couple fellow hot sauce lovers that I am friends with so they make nice gifts as well. I'm not sure if I'd eat these regularly, but it's a great sample buy.

review/text: I bought this for a friend of mine who likes hot sauces and he found it was a good way to add a bit of spice to his food while at work. He did not care for the garlic flavor and Temporary Insanity was too hot for him (he can drink a salsa he rates a six on his ten point scale like water) but when diluted it was a nice addition. The other two were good for him and he now seeks out other sauces made by them in larger bottles.

review/summary: A Bargain!
review/text: Fructose is fructose. It's a simple sugar found in plants, both fruits and vegetables. Buying fructose is like buying salt. Brand names don't matter much. I'm sure there are conspiracy theories about fructose, but as an old woman I'm tired of hearing "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!"  First it's "Don't eat butter." Then it's "Butter is good for you." Etc. Etc.<br /><br />Getting away from health issues, I have to say that if you want to buy fructose, this Amazon item is a bargain.  You get a LOT of fructose for the money. I think it's less expensive, pound for pound, that the fructose I get from Publix.

review/text: This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was "mercury is less than 400 parts per billion". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process.

review/summary: Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G">Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/summary: Better than average for cheap k-cup standard of coffee
review/text: As for the Green Mountain K-cup.  These k-cups do not give you the flavor you would normally get from brewing Green Mountain coffee.  The k-cups are week and taste watered down compared to brewing the loose/ground coffee in a conventional way, thus my 3 star rating.  With that said:  These k-cups are slightly better than other k-cups on the market.  If you are going to use k-cups I would recommend this brand and brew.  I would also recommend buying at Amazon as the prices are right compared to other sites.<br /><br />This k-cup is over priced.  If you look at the price you pay for this k-cup compared to the loose ground/whole beans you would be surprised.  You pay $0.50 a cup for a k-cup and $0.05 a cup for loose.  You get a 100 x's better cup from loose then with a k-cup.  Why pay more for a crappy cup?  Convenience!  But there are ways to avoid that cost<br /><br />The environment.  By using the loose/ground and the k-filter you help save the environment as all you toss out is ground coffee.  Every k-cup used takes up space in a landfill somewhere.  In my opinion it is the same as using a foam cup as to a ceramic mug to drink your coffee.<br /><br />Keurig.  This machine is convenient and quick.  But it is expensive to use with the k-cups, costing the average family $50+ a month.  To cut this cost to as low as $10 I use the k-filter with the machine and Green Mountain is one of my brands.  The loose/ground coffee in the filter gives you a stronger cup but still not the greatest but better than the k-cup alone by far.  Using the Keurig you must make a choice to sacrifice quality over conveinance.  I make that sacrifice during the week as I have little time on the weekday's to brew a pot of coffee. But I choose to use the filter with the Green Mountain loose/ground coffee and get a slightly better cup and save about $40.00 a month.
