review/summary: Best Senseo Pod Yet
review/text: I've been through most of the pods for the last two years, and finally found my favorite about six months ago.  When the Sumatra arrived, I still had Medium, Dark, Brazilian, and Columbia on hand for comparison.  As it turns out, I didn't really need to compare because the Sumatra stood on its own from the first cup and is exceptional.  Sumatra is a dark, rich blend that finally fills my need for a stronger coffee with a pleasant character.  It took a long time but I finally managed to finish off the other blends.  Sumatra is all I order any more.

review/summary: Excellent dark blend
review/text: This is a similar blend to the Senseo Dark, but with a smoother finish. No bitterness or burnt taste at all. My only reason to give 4 stars rather than five is that the pods are a little weak. They contain about 10% less coffee than the Senseo Dark blend and it makes a difference in the cup. I normally make a two-pod cup anyway, and deal with this slight weakness by simply shutting off the brewer a little early. Another reviewer complained that the specific varieties in the blend are not stated and that therefore the taste may vary from batch to batch. I'm not an expert by a long shot, but I do drink a lot of coffee and I've been using this blend for about a year with no detectable variation.<br />Sometimes when I want the slight extra kick of the Dark blend but still want a smooth finish I will use one pod of Dark and one pod of this Colombian blend. (That's one thing I like about the pod brewers over the Keurig style: one can mix and match).

review/summary: A GREAT Price for Pods
review/text: In these days when we're all trimming our budget, buying my Senseo pods this way saves me quite a few bucks!  #1: This subscription  is the cheapest way to purchase pods that I've found. I paid $4.24 per box at WalMart, which is the lowest price in my area.  This way, it is $3.94 #2: It saves me a trip to WalMart, thus saving gas.  #3: When I go to WalMart, I will spend more money than just for pods, thus I eliminate any impulse buying. #4: Free delivery and no tax just sweetens the pot. #5: It is so convenient!  Frequently, WalMart was sold out of the dark roast pods.  I don't run out of pods anymore!  I am SOLD on this subscription arrangement.

review/text: My parents are coming to visit in a week and they drink coffee everyday.  I don't drink coffee that often and my husband doesnt like coffee so we don't have a coffee maker.  I was looking for coffee I could put in a tea kettle and make without any mess of coffee grinds and thats why I bought this (not going to buy the expensive little coffee makers for pods!).<br />  I boiled a few cups of water and dropped in a pod earlier today.  Stirred it around then let it rest for awhile.  I added sugar milk and vanilla and served myself a cup.  It is very good, no bitter or yucky after taste.  I'm pleased. :)

review/summary: About as good as it gets for the Senseo brewer
review/text: Re-write of earlier review after more than a year: I previously compared this blend to Starbucks Verona with (to quote Starbucks) a "bold intensity, with a rich, smooth and slightly sweet" flavor. I had more or less absent-mindedly migrated to the Senseo Colombian blend over the last year or so, and just recently again tried the Senseo Dark because it came with a new brewer. I stand by my earlier comparison - the Senseo Dark is similar to Starbucks Verona. And I still find the main weakness with this blend to be that it's just slightly too weak...which you can counteract by killing the brew process early and getting slightly less than a double cup from the two pods.<br />You _can_ make better coffee than this in the Senseo brewer but not by much. The Colombian Blend is smoother, for example, but not as rich and not as sweet.

review/text: I have used a Senseo maker for about three years, making 3 to 10 cups a day. (I'm on my third machine.) Mostly I have used other brand pods for the bolder flavor, but these Sumatra pods are about as good as any I have tried.<br /><br />Some other brand coffees I like are from Wolfgang Puck and Reunion Island; however, these other brands wreck the mechanism of the Senseo due to the thicker pod. These Senseo pods work better and taste just as good.<br /><br />I lived in Germany for three years and really learned to like European style coffees. Nothing makes crema like a Senseo!

review/text: Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like. Counted on all the positive reviews, but we all have different palates, don't we? I prefer Senseo's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite. Just opened my first of six bags, so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my "bargain" purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional. I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy. Just can't throw it all out!

review/text: Coffee has been part and parcel of my family's history.  Since discovering the Senseo machine and coffee I have used nothing else. I have tried other brands of coffee, but they're missing something.<br />Imagine a fresh cup of coffee with every cup...That's Senseo.

review/summary: They're BACK!
review/text: We just received (July 10, 2012) a shipment of the Dark Roast pods from AMAZON after not being able to get them for the last several months.  The site still says "Out of Stock", but I think if you place an order they'll start catching up to demand in a little while.  Many thanks to the person who wrote the review explaining the move of production facilities.<br /><br />We tried a Mr. Coffee Keurig style machine while we were unable to get Senseo, but couldn't find any coffee as good as the Douwe Egberts pods.<br /><br />We're very please to see the return of the Senseo Dark Roast pods, and I hope that my subscription for the French Vanilla pods will also be available again soon.

Hence, I cannot use any of the pods as they are covered with coffee grounds.  I tried to return them, however the Amazon website states that they are not eligible for return.

review/summary: Love SENSEO Coffee, not the cost
review/text: I love this coffee but it's getting harder to find. I finally called the company and was told that yes, it is being removed from retail stores but will still be available "on-line" and from places like Amazon.<br />I signed up with Amazon to have this coffee shipped to me automatically. I get 3 cases every 2 months. It's convenient but the price fluctuates and you don't know how much it's going to be. First time it was $70, two months later it went up to $90. I hope Senseo doesn't price me out, cuz I'll miss it.

review/summary: WTF Amazon ???
review/text: OK - so to start with, I LOVED my Senseo coffee system.  Have gone through 5 machines in 10 years - they eventually leak and cause problems so it's easier to buy another.  That being said the last couple of years it's been harder to find another machine (Ebay mostly) but I NEEDED my Senseo.  Then this past spring (May, June) I stopped receiving my Amazon shipment of PODS and found out that they were becoming obsolete everywhere.  Couldn't get them.  Period.<br /><br />I had to break down and purchase a Tasimo machine and the coffee to go with it (lots of plastic waste in the little cups) but I digress . . . so I've been 2 months with this new machine, and what arrives at my door last week ????  A CRAPlOAD of Senseo coffee pods!!!!!  Not one month's supply but THREE.<br /><br />Now I ask you if I drink coffee everyday, and you stop delivering my coffee for 3 months . . . . how (or why) do you think that when you do come into some inventory that I'd want (or need) to have the three months worth of coffee  . . NOW???  Those days are gone and I invested in a new machine.<br /><br />I'm sending them back, if anyone else needs them ;)

review/text: I've had 2 Senseo machines - I thoroughly enjoy the coffee pods and was so sorry recently to be told by Amazon that they are no longer available as a Subscribe & Save product through them. After all these years (6+ at least) of drinking Senseo coffee - and it's getting impossible to find at any of my local grocery stores - I had come to completely rely on Amazon as the one place where I could always find Senseo coffee pods. I realize this is likely not Amazon's choice, it may be as sad for Amazon as it is for me. I have to echo the sentiment I read in another's comment on the site..."what do I do with my Senseo coffee maker now, plant flowers in it?"

review/text: I only use this coffee, so that it is great is obvious.<br />What my problem is, is with AMAZON.<br />I have been buying it here forever.  The other day I get this email saying it is on a HUGE sale, BIG savings etc.  I got so excited, because as we all know coffee is expensive, but can't live without it.  I opened the email to see a huge LIE.  They showed the regular price, which wasn't the regular price.  IT was a crazy jacked up price.  Then it said you could save this huge amount...which was the regular price.  It made me so angry I almost quit my subscription.  That is so wrong.<br />But yes, the Senseo is awesome.  Perfect, rich....wonderful everytime.  I will never go back to a conventional coffee maker.

review/text: Moving from a coffee press to these coffee pods was a culture shock.  I don't know if it's the medium roast, or possibly needing more than one pod per cup of coffee, to me it tasted like the coffee in a cheap diner. I would highly recommend buying a single bag before you invest in a case to make sure it suits your palate.

review/summary: Happy but not thrilled.
review/text: I purchased a single serve coffee maker that used the "pod" verses the K-Cup, because I thought it would be less expensive, and because I knew I could use 2 pods if I felt I wanted to make a stronger cup of coffee.  It turns out that it still wasn't strong enough for me, for the amount of coffee I drink.  In order to fill my travel mug to take to work, I found I was using 4 pods every morning, and the savings just were not there.  I ended up buying a new coffee maker (Keurig) and got a good deal on Amazon for Coffee People K-Cups and found that with the right kind, I can fill that travel mug using 1 of them and the taste is outstanding!

review/summary: Light is an understatement -- NO flavor is more like it
review/text: Okay, so I like a strong cup of coffee.  I tried the Senseo Dark Roast and it was very good -- bold, but smooth taste.  The breakfast blend was really weak and tasted a little bit like wet cardboard or, as the Peanuts comic once said, like hot water with a brown crayon in it that needed more crayon.  I even used TWO pods for the smaller cup of coffee and it was still way too wimpy for me.  It still had the nice crema layer, it just had no taste.  I realize everyone has different coffee preferences.  But for someone who likes a stronger, more espresso-like coffee, I would tell them to steer clear of this roast.

review/summary: Beware Senseo Quality control-- Bags leak coffee
review/text: I bought four cases of Senseo Breakfast blend, both caffeinated and decaf. Every coffee pod in every bag had a hole at the seam. None were sealed properly, and I lost a quarter of the coffee that I purchased, half of which was on the bottom of the bag that contained the pods and the other in my coffee maker before I figured out what was wrong. I had to staple bags in order to use them.  Called Senseo and they said to contact Amazon. They could not replace the coffee because they "did not stock it at the office." Huh?? They said that if I gave them my name, address and email, they would send me a check for what I paid. Of course they did not, and they got my personal information. Don't buy this in bulk. Buy one container at a time or you will end up with a wasted purchase.

review/text: I like my coffee strong but not bitter.  Douwe Egberts is generally so so coffee but it at least has some taste. These Senseo coffee pods are different; no taste whatsoever!  It is as if they shipped old pods that had been sitting outside their packaging for a long time. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Note that I do get a "care package" from friends in the Netherlands sometimes which includes a dark roast coffee Senseo pod, also from Douwe Egberts. The package is different and contains more pods, more importantly the taste is entirely different.

Contacted Amazon and they gave me a refund even though the 30 days had passed.  Buy the Dark Roast instead; it tastes much better, is fresher and obviously sells better so they rotate stock more often.  I still had a little of the Dark Roast left, just compared the two, it's not even close.  Bottom line...1 star for this coffee, 5 stars for Amazon customer service...so a 3 overall I s'pose...

review/text: This is an attractive machine, looks good in my kitchen.  My husband and I use different coffees and love the convenience of having whatever brew we need available, cup by cup.  It's easy to operate, the coffee smells good and tastes good.  Having said that, here's the downside.  It's not very well made.  It has been recalled for some electrical difficulty that could have been disastrous and the replacement broke down within months.  I am now on my fourth or fifth one and if this one goes bad in the next two years or so I am going shopping for another brand.  Sometimes I think I keep buying them just because it's so fast, efficient and pleasant to deal with Amazon.

review/summary: senseo pods
review/text: Living in a fairly remote area, it is so hard to find pods for my beloved Senseo.  Now I order them in bulk from Amazon and never have to worry about running out or not having a variety of coffees to choose from.  Thanks to Amazon and Senseo for their program!

review/summary: I Threw It Away
review/text: I ordered this coffee because of all the positive reviews for these pods.  I have tried making coffee from the pods, and I have found ALL of it undrinkable. My goal was to make a medium-sized mug of coffee.  With one pod, the coffee was way too weak.  I then tried two pods, and the coffee was still not strong enough.  It lacked flavor, and I found it very flat.  (For sake of reference, I like medium strength coffee.  Starbucks Coffee, for example, is too strong for me.)  Regardless, I managed to squeeze 3 pods into my coffee maker, but the coffee was now horrible.  Ok, so I thought, let's go back to 2 pods and vary the amount of water.  After some experimentation, I found that 2 pods and 10 oz. of water gave the proper strength for my taste.  However, nothing could help the flavor.  I detested the flat, stale taste. Do yourself a favor - skip this product.  Now I know why the pods are relatively cheap - you get what you pay for. I'm not a coffee gourmet, but this coffee is worst than the over-boiled stuff that is left at the end of the day in the office coffee pot.

review/text: This was the best coffee I had found for my pod coffee maker.  Too bad it's never in stock!  I have searched all over the web, and everyone seems to be sold out.  Makes me think Senseo may not be making these anymore and that my little coffee maker will be collecting dust real soon.

review/summary: Better coffee from a can
review/text: There's no denying the Senseo is easy to use, and 'greener' than any of the other pod brewers out there. But the Dark Roast coffee was stale and dry, with the same aroma and flavor of a canned coffee that's been left sitting out too long.<br /><br />A pod brew will never be AS GOOD as drip - I get that. But that won't stop me from looking for something close.<br /><br />If you want easy and are not picky about taste, this pod's for you. If you want a pod brew that is at all reminiscent of a decent cup of coffeehouse java, keep looking.

review/summary: Item was returned.  And no communication from Amazon - very strange.
review/text: This coffee was purchased in the past before for my husband.  Due to circumstances beyond my control I no longer needed it.  I had cancelled many automatic shipments in the past - hoping that I would be able to start them up again in the future, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Eventually I cancelled the entire Sumatra account.  I never actually took possession of the coffee for it was being held at the post office for signature - not sure why.  When I went to the post office they showed me the box and I asked them to return it.  Please contact me about the refund to my account at your earliest convenience.  TYVM.

review/text: I just purchased the Cuisinart cup o matic and just love it. I have been trying all different types of pods even though I can use regular ground coffee and the Senseo dark roast is our favorite. The deal with 6 bags of 18 for 27dollars is a better deal than most especially with no cost for shipping. I give this a 5 somehow it only shows 1 but AAAAA+

review/summary: senseo changed pods
review/text: When I got the the pods i thought they were "fake" made by someone other than Senseo.  The pods were loosely packed and would not set level on the pod holder resulting in week coffee.  The pod also did not have the senseo logo printed on the pod.  Calling cust service they changed how the pods are made and some are still out untill they are phased out.  Sucks!  The new pods are packed better but you still need to place then carfully r the coffee is weak.  I would not buy a large pack.  Stick with the single pack so you don't wast money having pods that dont work

review/summary: Inconsistancy
review/text: We have been buying Senseo Dark Roast for years.  Lately the quality has been varying - in batchA599269100 with a date of 11-24-12 - the resulting cups vary from great to watery.  Having used the Senseo for so many years, we can recognize when the coffee is going to be weak by the color of the flow.  The color varies from very light to dark in the middle of the process.  With the above mentioned batch the majority of the outputs has been light tan throughtout the run.<br /><br />This has happened once before.  We maintain our Senseo so the quality is not affected by the condition of the Senseo Unit.  Since I also have another Senseo at work, I took the pods to work to test.  Same result - watery coffee.<br /><br />I just bought 18 packages of dark roast if I continue to see watery coffee, then I guess its time to change from Senseo into another process.

review/summary: The Best Senseo Pods? I love my senseo
review/text: I've had a Senseo now for, wow, six years. It's not as cool as a Keurig, but the Keurig is slower, pods cost a lot more (when I last looked, a while ago now) and don't produce a better cup.<br /><br />There is/was a Blue Mountain pod, but I never tried it. I would rate a cup of this pretty much on par with what you would get out of a mid-grade Sumatra bean in a drip pot; maybe even as good as a French press. Of course, it's smaller...<br /><br />Comparing this with the rest of the Senseo pods, it's somewhere between medium roast and dark roast (in flavor), but softer and richer. It's well worth the extra expense (minor cost difference between this and dark roast pods). One of my favorite products period. I start every day with at least one cup of this.

review/text: Senseo Espresso pads make a decent cup of coffee but I wouldn't call it espresso.  I appreciate the fact the pods are strong enough to make a decent cup of regular coffee and I admit I did not expect the pods to make the thick, rich cup of espresso I'm used to making with an old stove top maker.  This is fine for what it is, but it's not espresso.

review/text: I've been buying these pods for years, and have a "Subscribe & Save" program for them through Amazon. I like strong coffee, and these are the strongest I've found. However, today I opened up the first bag of my latest shipment and noticed the pods were very thin; had much less coffee in them. Sure enough, they made a VERY weak cup of coffee. Unfortunately, I'd upped my order recently to three months at a time, so I now have another 107 weak cups of coffee to look forward to. But I'll be shopping for a new brand.
