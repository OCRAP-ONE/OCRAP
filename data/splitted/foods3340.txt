review/summary: Super Moist
review/text: These dates are extremely moist and soft and because of that the dates at the bottom of the packet tend to get squished. Once you reach the bottom of the packet it is like eating dates jam. I purchased this product two times and have been very happy with the taste and consistency. Try making a Dates MilkShake with these dates. It is absolutely delicious.

review/summary: Excellent succulent dates
review/text: I needed to get my order up to $25 in order to get free shipping so I looked around for something I enjoy that wasn't too expensive. After reading the reviews I decided to try Bergin Nut Company Organic Medjool Dates. They were very good. They were freshish - I've had fresher when I lived in date country but satisfying, yummy.

review/summary: Best dates ever!
review/text: I have been into dates since moving to Palm Desert in the 1980's. I fell in love with the medjools which are the softest, sweetest, at lest from the desert. These are every bit as good and very soft and sweet, and dates are so very nutritious. I recommnend them highly. They also have a lot of potassium and about double or more of that in bananas for folks on diuretics. They're simply a wonderful food. The seeds grow nicely  into little palm trees. Dates are God's gift to man in the desert.

review/summary: These wonderful dates are better than candy
review/text: Trying to be more health conscious I bought regular sunsweet pitted dates from the supermarket to substitute for an occasional candy treat.  They were ok, not organic, hardish, but still better for us than candy.  Store didn't have any last time, so I checked Amazon and here were these organic dates (with pits) so I ordered them after reading the reviews.  Absolutely worth the price!  Tender, tasty and no refined anything.  My next trial is to make raw almond butter sweetened with these dates (pits removed) in my Girmi miracle mincer.  I'll be ordering these dates regularly.

review/text: I ordered these dates first and we ate them immediately while watching tv... not what I intended!  Ordered a slightly cheaper brand and they were not as moist as these.  These have a lot of fruit and very little pit (which is easily removed.) Medjool is a large date and few to a pound. Spouse is diabetic and he carries a couple of these in a plastic container to use when he feels a low blood sugar coming on.  He prefers these to glucose tablets... for sure.  Wish these did not cost this much but we find they are worth the money in eating pleasure.  Thanks Amazon for another winner!

review/text: Medjool dates serve very well as they can be part of the alternative materials for the soup in Chinese medicine. Compared to other dates sold in the US, this product provides large and sweet dates. The only downside is its relatively high price for the package. If the price is not the problem, I highly recommend it to you.

While I was trying to put on some weight I read on internet that medjool dates have one of the highest calorie content among dates..they're also called the diamond dates or the king of dates so I looked on amazon for medjool dates and found this one rated pretty high and I went with the public opinion and I'm glad to say that I'm a part of the same public with fantastic reviews about these dates! They say "See it to believe it" - I say "Eat it to believe it"! It just melts in your mouth! Absolutely awesome dates!

review/text: I tried this Habanero Hot Sauce for the first time yesterday while at a Mexican Restaurant, and I must say it is DELICIOUS!<br /><br />The chicken burritos I ordered were not terrible, but they were quite bland. After adding on this hot sauce it completely turned that around, making a once bland burrito a terrifically flavorful experience!<br /><br />Yes, it is quite hot, so hot that it helped clear up my sinuses and sadly burdened the waiter with refilling my water a good 8+ times, but I tell you it wasn't anything overly spicy. I cooled down quite quickly, and unlike when I eat most spicy foods or sauces my breath and mouth did not suffer from any disgusting aftertaste!<br /><br />This sauce has greatly improved my outlook on bland boring food! (I plan on carrying a bottle with me anytime I'm invited to a known bland Mexican restaurant in the future!)

review/summary: They're Vegetarian!!
review/text: I often take a short train ride out to Sunnyside, Queens to shop at the Butcher Block, an Irish grocery store; I'm able to pick up the Odlums flour I need to make soda and brown bread and there are lots of interesting new things to try. I spotted Tunnock's Tea Cakes, picked them up, and noted that even though they contained marshmallow, there was no gelatin in evidence. As a lacto-ovo vegetarian, about the only easy-to-find marshmallow option is Marshmallow Fluff, so these looked even more interesting, especially since the ingredients were simple and included real chocolate. They weren't expensive, so I bought a box.<br /><br />Tunnock's Tea Cakes ROCK. If memory serves, these are MUCH better than Mallomars--far less sweet, with a filling that reminds me of the filling in Russell Stover Milk Chocolate Mint Dreams (sans mint). I'd really like to try the dark chocolate variety but didn't see any. Maybe it's a good thing because I could easily eat a whole box of the milk chocolate variety in one sitting (the fact that they're not very large helps). And they're really cute, too--they're individually wrapped in foil which makes them a convenient to-go snack. Cross my heart, they're just perfect: a crisp cookie base topped with marshmallow, the whole of which is dipped in milk chocolate. What could be yummier? And besides, Tunnock's is an old, family-owned business--who better to support?<br /><br />Mallomar lovers owe it to themselves to give Tunnock's Tea Cakes a try if the opportunity to do so presents itself. In fact, anyone who likes chocolate and marshmallow would probably love these. Jump all over them if you see them for sale.

review/text: Cookie with marshmallow on top, covered in milk chocolate. Delicious! Flavor reminds me a of a s'more. They're also wonderful hot-- with hot chocolate, tea, or coffee. These are a bit larger than Mallomars, and the chocolate coating on these is less waxy and more thick and chocolate-y. The marshmallow is also a lot taller than the ones on Mallomars. The cookie is a little more crunchy and graham-cracker-like than the Mallomars cookies.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer mentioned, there is no gelatin so they are vegetarian! Cute, classic packaging, which I remember from my childhood in England. All the cakes are individually wrapped in foil. Perfect for packing a lunch.<br /><br />Tip: try microwaving them for 5 seconds.... oo-ey goo-ey deliciousness.

NONE of the pre-packaged foods will come even CLOSE to freshly prepared food with freshly ground spices. It is impossible for a finely tuned Indian palate to relish pre-packed, factory-processed, preserved offerings. However, if you are not conditioned like me, then this is a great alternative to the restaurant fare we get in the US. Easy to use, quick and tasty enough. I bought the assorted pack and gave it to my non-Indian friends so they could cook their Chicken and Lamb curries....and they just loved it!<br />I give 4 stars to this product for trying its best.

review/text: I bought this 6 pack because it was a good deal price wise and I have previously enjoyed this brand of Indian food.  We tried one pack and found the gravy to be very watery even though we only out on 75% of the water in the recipe.  I added tomato sauce to the remainder of the meal and it was much better.  I canceled my order for additional product.

review/summary: Good Stuff!!
review/text: First let me say that we do not eat Indian food very often, and I certainly do not know how to make it and I have never tried. It would probably require a specialty cook book and a bunch of expensive spices that would rarely be used. I also may not know good Indian food from bad Indian food, because like I said, we rarely have it. This stuff is delicious!!! We have not tried them all, but the lamb curry was excellent. I added some sliced onion and threw in a handful of frozen peas at the end and served over rice. It was fragrant, warm but not hot, and delicious! I know this is kind of bad, but I didn't have lamb so I used some thin-siced beef steaks that I had frozen. Anyway, the curries are delicious and easy to prepare, just add meat or vegetables, water and simmer. Some of the packets call for a little butter or something, but you'll probably have that handy. As for nutrition, they all say that they have 2 grams of fiber per serving. Sodium varies from about 480 to 660mg per serving but the veg. briani is 810mg., and calories are relatively low at 45 to 60 per serving, fat is 3 to 3.5 grams per servin, carbs are around 3 to 5. Try it, you'll like it if you are normally just a little adventerous in your food choices.

review/text: After reading all the positive reviews I decided to give this product a try. Man, was this surprisingly good! It tastes so authentic, yet so simple. Depending on which type I use, I usually add onions, chicken, potato. My favorite is the chicken curry which I added cauliflower, mushrooms, and chicken. My favorite! My least favorite was the lamb curry. Definitely give this a try if you haven't already!

review/text: Much as I enjoyed Indian food, I am not an Indian by nature. But after trying this variety pack at home - following the detailed yet simple instructions on the package - I was so happy that I found authentic Indian tastes again, here in the US, instead of in Indian. By far, it is the BEST paste I have tried.

review/summary: Unfortunately not what my non-indian palate was looking for
review/text: Before buying this, I thought I loved Indian food. I also used to think I liked spicy food. These mixes have made me second guess both of those beliefs.<br /><br />I've realized I like some indian food,but my sampling of Indian food has been limited to several indian restaurants and a few homemade dishes. Admittedly, this is not a very impressive resume. Usually when I order, I get the mildest dishes (saag paneer with lots of naan) in the mildest forms. I've ventured into the spicier curries and regretted it.<br /><br />So, on to this product. These mixes were much too spicy for me and weren't the type of indian food I enjoy. Looking at the other reviews it is obvious many people love these mixes, and plenty of those people are indian themselves. So, take my review for what it is worth. If you aren't sure if you like indian food, or only like select mild dishes at indian restaurants, these may not be for you. If you know you like authentic indian food and don't mind spiciness, disregard this review and read the other ones.<br /><br />I was going to give this 2 stars, because honestly the rest of these mixes are sitting on my shelf. However, I recognize that plenty of others with more experience in this category of food love these products, so 3 stars it is. Good luck, hope this helped!

review/summary: Delightful assortment
review/text: I've been eating the Butter Chicken version of Kitchen's of India for years, but have never ventured past that one flavor. This assortment was a deal of the day, so I gave it a shot. I now have a few more favorite versions!<br /><br />The assortment consists of 6 packets, one of each of:<br />Butter Chicken<br />Chicken Curry<br />Hyderabadi Biryani<br />Lamb Curry<br />Fish Curry<br />Vegetable Biryani.<br /><br />While my favorite still is the butter chicken, all were tasty. My least favorite was the fish curry, but I have to admit I'm not much of a fish fan to begin with. While they all taste similar there are some differences, such as a greater level of spiciness to the hyderadadi biryani, and more oiliness to the chicken curry.<br /><br />All are prepared about the same (add liquid and the meat). Quick and easy prep. I like to modify the preparation a bit - for example, I use only a small amount of butter when preparing the butter chicken, replace the water with chicken stock and add peas.<br /><br />While these mixes fall short of what you'd get in a good Indian restaurant, they are quite good, very easy and economical. Highly recommend.

review/text: I am English and my Wife is Mexican so we both love spicy food (lots of Indian restaurants in England).<br />The pastes are very pasty and really need to be mixed with plain yogurt to make them more creamy, just buy some plain yogurt, drain the water and mix til you get the required creaminess.<br />Even then the result is pretty spicy, much too spicy for my young'uns and on the limit for my wife.<br />Of course, you can use less paste and/or more yogurt.<br />Very tasty for the price.

review/summary: as near as I expect to get to the real thing at home
review/text: Where I live the Indian restaurants are mostly very excellent. I'm a tolerable good cook but have never been able to duplicate Indian dishes at home. "You ain't bonafide!" as the child says in an old movie & perhaps I'm not. I can taste a spoonful & identify 8 of 10 ingredients but the other two are a mystery. I've tried some of these spice packs and find they're really excellent. Not quite as good as the local cullinary artists. But HEY if you're not a real cullinary artist this product gives very satisfactory results.<br /><br />My advice: Follow directions precisely until the end. Then stir in 1-2 tablespoons of flour while still hot to thicken the sauce. This was standard in grandma's time. Sadly forgotten now.

review/text: This is a really fantastic mix that I keep as a staple at home.  The only thing is I pretty much disregard suggestions for meat and throw whatever veg I have on hand in instead.  I also cut the water by half, and add either coconut milk or cream with a bit of cornstarch at the end- makes it a bit thicker and gravy like (i know that's probably cheating!).  My favorite is the butter chicken mix- with a bit of cream at the end, it's pretty much way better than anything you'll get at a restaurant.

review/summary: Easy to prepare, excellent taste but...a bit too spicy?
review/text: I really like Indian food for some reason, especially chicken curry. Hence I jumped at the chance of trying this product a couple of weeks ago. Overall, I am pretty impressed.<br /><br />First off, the food is extremely easy to prepare. Most of the time you just need the chopped meat or vegetables, and perhaps some butter or lemon curd. It makes a quick and delicious dinner -- just turn on the stove, add water, curry paste, meat/veggies, wait 25-30 minutes, and bingo! I was surprised the first time how good it tasted. Just add some naan or rice and you have yourself an authentic Indian meal.<br /><br />So far I have tried most of the packs in the variety box. The chicken turned out well both times I made it (there are 3 different curry flavors) and also tried the vegetarian one. Now this may be only a personal quip, but I thought the curry paste is a bit too spicy at times. The second I made the chicken curry, I used more chicken than the recommended amount (1lb) and results were similar. The vegetarian is even more spicy. Just beware.

review/text: First of all, I like the price.  Trader Joe's Indian paste is $2 and $2.30 per packet.  This 6 packet for $10 deal is great!<br /><br />Second of all, I love the taste.  So far I only used the vegetable curry packet for my Yosemite camping potluck the past weekend.  I added a minced Roma tomatoe, half a head of minced red onion, and a cup of TVP from Bob's Red Mill.  The result was just fantastic!  It's a bit spicy, granted, but everyone who loves spicy food loves this dish.<br /><br />I can see that this and TVP will be my must-have in all my camping trips.  It is as easy as 1-2-3 and a super healthy, tasty side dish to eat with grilled meat and pita bread.

review/text: Out of the six possibilities, I have only made the butter chicken, but it was tasty enough that I have high hopes for the other five packages.  Preparation was easy: I mixed the paste with some turkey broth and butter, added pieces of chicken right away and some potatoes about halfway through, and mixed in some plain yoghurt during the cooldown period.  Very easy and relatively fast way to make dinner.<br /><br />While I didn't find this particularly hot, my wife did find it a bit tongue-searing. To help you gauge our heat tolerance, she likes several jalapenos in her salsa and I like a couple of habaneros.

review/text: After seeing this pasta reviewed by America's Test Kitchen... "Tasters lauded this 100 percent whole-wheat spaghetti for its "earthy," "wheaty," "nutty," "full" flavor, which was "heartier than white pasta, without being too wheaty." It also boasted a "pleasantly chewy,' "firm" texture. Its "good blend of whole-wheat flavor and regular-pasta texture" complemented the pesto and didn't overwhelm the marinara." I decided to give it a try. I've tried other "whole grain pastas" on the market without much success, off texture,taste and couldn't get my husband to enjoy them. After seeing this episode of ATK we decided to try it. I purchased a few pounds of spaghetti to try and surprisingly it was very good. My husband said "he would definitely eat this again, and can't wait to try other shapes of it." The description above is on point, it is hearty and has a pleasant chew...very satisfying!

review/summary: Best Chocolate and most fun shape
review/text: I've known about Toe Buddies almost since my dear friends started the company.  It's been a true and utter joy to watch this idea of humor and quality chocolate come together.  What Jackie & Jeff don't know is that this chocolate has changed my life forever.  I'm never ever going to be able to buy cheaper chocolate again - even some of the more expensive fancy stuff isn't near the quality of these Toe Buddies - and that isn't even getting into how funny the shape is.  My first Amazon order is being sent to my running coach.  Getting this woman (me) up off the coach and jogging deserves quality chocolate and what is funnier than Toe Buddies being sent to my jogging buddies.<br />Being able to purchase and ship through Amazon has just made my gift giving so much easier.

review/summary: my bad :S
review/text: I really like the Bergin papaya spears, which are low sugar and do not contain sulfur dioxide, but decided to try the chunks this round.  Unfortunately, I didn't do enough research, or remember that I can't drink red wine because of the sulfites, and I had a HUGE, very uncomfortable reaction after eating these papaya chunks.  Now I am stuck with almost 6 pounds of it..so beware, if you think you might be allergic.  Also, in my opinion, this product contains way too much sugar...it's more like candy than dried fruit, and that's not what I need or want.

review/summary: Outrageous Shipping
review/text: I wanted to find some sugar-free hard candy I could buy in bulk, as all I can get at the grocery stores are tiny bags of highly priced candy.  Eda's seemed like an interesting prospect, so I ordered a 1 lb. bag of the Old Tyme flavors.<br /><br />The flavors themselves aren't bad, if a little unique.  They resemble the flavor they're representing but don't quite nail them - with the exception of cinnamon.  Frustratingly, you don't know what you get  until you've bought it, but flavors include peppermint, cinnamon, licorice, coffee, chocolate, lime, cherry and a curious dark red candy whose flavor I still can't place.<br /><br />The deal killer to Eda's, though, is the shipping, which is more than the cost of the product.  I paid over $8.  Eda's candy is okay, but only for a hard-to-find or really stellar item would I pay that kind of shipping for a 1 lb. package.  For me, it's on to the continuous search for bulk candy.

review/summary: Good & Nutritious
review/text: I prefer the whole grain to the ground seed.  When mixed with liquid (about 2 Tablespoons of Salba to 1 cup of liquid), it forms a gel.  The whole grain has the consistency of tapioca pudding; the ground salba is a bit too gritty for me, even after it gels up.  Whatever form one uses (ground or whole grain), Salba (chia seed) doesn't have much flavor of it's own, so it takes on the flavor of whatever I mix with it.<br /><br />I do like that it has omega-3 (which is good for my heart) and fiber (which is good for my digestion).

I know friends of mine who raise their eyebrows at anything more than a couple of weeks old.<br /><br />Honestly, I could not tell the difference once the expresso was made - it tasted hot and fresh. If you are not a snob, I recommend this; if you are true aficionado, find a local roaster, and get something that was bagged this week.<br /><br />Happy drinking!

review/text: I tried this coffee because my usual Lavazza was getting too expensive. There was a promotion going so this was at about 50% off the list price. I was hoping for an acceptable taste knowing that it was not going to be Lavazza and the other reviews were good. Unfortunately, all my 5 espresso shots turned out to be burnt-bitter taste.<br /><br />I use an fully automatic espresso machine and use beans solely for espresso shots and not for regular drip coffee. I picked this item because it specifically said "Espresso Whole Bean Coffee".  I tried different grind settings hoping I could make use of the 3 bags I bought but nothing helped.  Also, fyi... Eight oclock is my second choice since coffee prices are almost double I paid last year.
