review/summary: The honey center is nice
review/text: I'm not sure that anyone is getting any nutritional benefit from these, but they taste fine. The honey center seems to be pure honey, which is nice--kind of like sticking your finger in a honey jar. The outer part of the candy gets very chewy once it starts to melt, so if you have delicate dental work (or braces) don't chew one of these--seriously, you'll regret it. But taste wise, they're just fine. Of course, if I had them on my desk, I'd go through a box in a matter of hours, so that's probably not a great idea for me! Funny, but I remember a candy like this, with a honey center, back in the 1970s, I just can't remember what they were called.

review/summary: Good candy
review/text: I don't know what the word 'energy' is supposed to refer to unless its the sugar. But as far as hard candy goes these are very good. I am a very big honey fan and so enjoyed these. But they aren't going to replace the Five Hour Energy in your desk drawer quite yet.

review/text: The list of ingredients goes like this:<br />1. Sugar.<br />2. Corn Syrup<br />3. Honey<br /><br />Needless to say, it's all this candy is, and it has way more sugar and corn syrup than it does honey - to keep the cost down obivously.<br /><br />I am giving it 2 stars, because despite all the sugar it doesn't taste terrible and they tried to include vitamins and didn't use high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I wouldn't give these to a kid though, might as well chew on a cube of sugar.

review/summary: Very Delicious Honey filled candy infused with vitamins
review/text: If you've had the regular "Honees" candy before, you will definitely enjoy these. They taste the same but are infused with vitamins C, B12 and B6. If you've never had these before, these candies have a honey flavored sugar shell on the outside and are liquid-honey filled on the inside. If you love the taste of pure honey, you'll probably really enjoy these candies.  I've loved the taste of honey since I could remember, so I really love these candies. I even use honey as a sweetener in my coffee, so I may be a bit biased in this review, lol.  Anyways, there are 9 pieces of candy in each bar, and there are 24 bars in the box. They also have other different flavors such as Caramel, but I prefer this one because it tastes just like the original (which is strictly honey flavored). There's not much bad stuff to say about this except that it may increase the likelihood of getting cavities... it tends to stick to your teeth once you bite into the honey center. By the way, this product is imported from Italy, so it is pretty hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Tastes very delicious<br />-Each candy provides 33% of your daily needs for Vitamins C, B12, B6.  Eat 3 for nearly 100% :)<br />-Made in Italy.... which automatically makes it cool in my book ;)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May be habit-forming and addictive, lol!

review/text: Talk about all natural. Basically this is a drop or splash of honey covered by a thin candy coating. The candy coating melts in your mouth and then comes a rush of honey. I really cannot say that it gave me energy but it sure tasted good and each drop has 33% of your recommended intake of vitamin C, B6 and B12. The product is made in Italy.

review/summary: Excellent, Mid-Afternoon Pick-Me-Up
review/text: Most health-conscious adults know the importance of the combination of B-Complex Vitamins with C; yet, we also realize that our B6, B12, and C are water soluble vitamins-- meaning that whatever is not metabolized in our systems is lost in our unused fluids, whether it be by urination or perspiration. Some compensate for this loss through time-release vitamins, but there is a concern from some that certain time-release vitamins are not as natural as other forms, not as effective, or not as easily assimilated.<br /><br />Ambrosoli-Honees honey-filled Energy Plus drop provides a tasty and effective alternative to time-release, as well as a natural alternative to the acrid potency of recent caffeine energy drinks.<br /><br />The hard candy exterior is delicious and not so hard that you cannot easily chew one or two up and get to the even more delicious honey center. I weigh well over 225 lbs. so I didn't seem to have the kind of energy surge from only one drop; but two or three drops at my weight allowed me to notice a bit of alertness and energy when my energy levels would have otherwise dropped off. That put me up to about 60 calories at 20 calories per drop; yet, with the energy boost received from the three drops, I know that my activity more than compensated for the caloric intake.<br /><br />One down side to the honey drops is that they may not store too well for long periods of time because the honey might seep through the end of the hard candy leaving you with a sticky wrapper.  For me it wasn't really a bother at all because you're going to get something a little sticky any time you use real honey.

review/summary: A decent tasting candy with a few vitamins
review/text: This candy tasted good. A real honey flavor. The ingredients don't state much honey though, mainly sugar. I liked knowing I was getting 33% of a few vitamins while eating it. I cannot feel any extra energy, but then who feels something when they take a vitamin? I'll tell you who, someone who should be seeing a doctor not eating candy. I take this candy after a meal so I can absorb the vitamins better. Vitamin C and B6, B12 can be taken at higher doses without side effects, so If I take a multivitamin at diner time on top of this, It won't be overkill. While the product stated pack of 24. I only got 1 pack. This is not a reflection on the product, but it may be a reflection of the ordering process of this product.

review/summary: Great tasting Honey drops - with nutritional value
review/text: Essentially, these are honey drops, that provide you with Vitamin B6, B12, C, and more. I found it to be such an ingenious idea to add more nutritional value to these drops. In a way, it's like healthy candy.<br /><br />Some nutrition facts for 1 piece (5g):<br /><br />Calories: 20<br />Fat calories: 0<br />No fat, sat fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium or fiber<br />Total Carb: 5g (2% daily value)<br />Vitamin A: 1% daily value<br />Vitamin C: 20mg - 33% Daily value - Woo hoo!<br />No calcium or iron<br />Vitamin B6: 0.66mg (33% Daily value)<br />Vitamin B12: 2mg (33% daily value)<br /><br />You can get a good amount of vitamins from just one or two honey drops. Just be a little aware of how much you're having. A little more than your daily intake is okay. Water soluble vitamins, which are the B vitamins, are excreted through urine if there is any excess. There's no real worry if you have more than usual.<br /><br />I love the taste of these honey drops! It's sweet and not to overbearing when you first put it in your mouth.  And as you make your way to the center, honey bursts out. In no time, you've already finished a piece of honey drop. Onto the next!<br /><br />I'm a believer. A great tasty pack of honey drops packed with nutritional value.

review/summary: They taste good!
review/text: I am going to call these candy rather than vitamins simply because the ingredients begin with sugar, corn syrup, and honey.  I received one pack of ten small candies from Vine the week before I did a distance walk.  So I thought it would be a good test.  Each candy is individually wrapped.  They actually have a honey taste with a liquid honey center.<br /><br />After walking about 10 miles one of my walking team was yawning, so I suggested that we try the candy.  Everyone liked the taste, especially the liquid in the middle.  We could not tell that there was any energy boost, but the yawning did stop.<br /><br />There were enough candies for us to use one a day for the next two days, nine in a package.  The company sent one package to vine members.  We never really noticed that they gave us any extra energy, but they were a nice treat.  So as far as being a vitamin, or giving you extra energy, I can't really say that this is a great product, but if you are looking for something that is tasty, this is is.<br /><br />I am going to add something to this review.  I thought about this product in relations to all the other products that are supposed to give you energy while doing marathons, or some kind of long distance exercise like that.  In my experience, none of them work to give you that instant energy boost with the exception of a couple of fruit juices and chocolate milk, and this certainly taste better than some that I have tried.  We did talk about the choke hazard that a hard candy might cause if you were running, but I am a distance walker and don't intend to start running again this late in my life.  So I think that would not be a problem for me.<br /><br />With all that in mind I decided to go back and raise the review another star, they taste really good if you like honey, I think that the sugar gives as much energy as some other products,  and they were easy to put in a pocket..

review/summary: True honey flavor and texture
review/text: This is a very pleasant hard candy with a liquid center of honey. It has a strong honey flavor when you get to the center. It reminds me of a honey cough drop. You also get a few vitamins. There is actually an error on the label concerning the vitamin content. The label says there are two mg(milligrams) of B12 and that is 33%of the DV(daily value). It should say two mcg(micrograms), which is, indeed, 33% of the DV. Well, nothing is perfect. At least the quality of the candy is fine.

review/summary: Quick boost with taste
review/text: If you don't want to take supplements or open a chocolate bar, these drops provide a quick energy boost. They are low in calories but are just a tad too sweet because of the honey center. I took one in mid afternoon when I began to feel that slump coming on. It subtly gave me more energy without the jitters that caffeine products tend to. I felt good for the rest of the work day. One slim pack fits easily in a small purse or pocket. Each drop is indivually wrapped. If you want an energy boost that does not contain caffeine, I recommend this.

review/summary: Energy Candy?
review/text: Nine individually-wrapped pieces per roll.  The outer shell is hard spun sugar with a smooth texture that develops long grains if you let it dissolve on your tongue .. like those old-fashioned hard candies that your grandma kept in a jar, all stuck together in a huge clump.  Anyway, these are not stuck together; as I said, they're individually wrapped.  I don't chew them.  I let them slowly dissolve.  They taste like honey, or at least they seem to, until you get to the liquid honey center and are reminded what honey REALLY tastes like.  This is the best part, when the honey gooshes out ... but then the sugar shell collapses and the last remaining portion of the candy is very sticky like an old-fashioned toffee.<br /><br />These things are fortified with B vitamins which are supposed to give an energy boost.  I couldn't tell whether it worked or not.  I really didn't feel any different ... but I didn't get tired for a while after eating the candy, so maybe it did something.  I don't know.  It could be a placebo effect because I _expected_ to be energized.<br /><br />Whatever.  At least they taste good.

review/summary: Good Dietary Supplement
review/text: Ambrosoli-Honees hard candy drops imported from Italy have a honey taste that is subtle rather than overpowering. The hard outer shells dissolve rather quickly as you suck on them and there is a good amount of liquid honey in the center. The dissolve time is too long to eat as your run, and I prefer gel packets (with caffeine) during a marathon or half marathon.<br /><br />The Honees are good prior to a training run and would be good prior to a race on the way to the start line or waiting for the gun. They have no caffeine so you would not have to cut back on caffeinated gels during the race. It is irritating to have heart palpitations due to too much of the stimulant during the last miles of a long race.<br /><br />The contents are: 5 g of sugars, 20 mg of Vitamin C, .66 mg of Vitamin B6, and 2 mg of Vitamin B12. The quantities of the three vitamins equal 33% of Percentage of Daily Values based on a 2000 calorie diet.<br /><br />The Vitamin C research suggests it is one of the safest and most effective nutrients available in dietary supplements. It is involved in protection against immune system deficiencies (my interest), and prevention of cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />Vitamin B6 is involved in several metabolic processes. It facilitates amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism. It plays a role in neurotransmitter and histamine synthesis. It is also involved in hemoglobin synthesis and function, an interest of mine because blood work shows a tendency toward anemia.<br /><br />Vitamin B12 is important to me because I and other seasoned citizens may have a deficiency in it, and it is important in energy metabolism. Experimental studies suggest it may have no beneficial effect on performance in absence of deficiency. I can tell a difference in recovery time after a run of 6 or more miles when I eat a Honee drop before the run. I do not experience as much of a decrease in post run energy level as I do without the drops.<br /><br />My subjective feeling may be a placebo effect, but it is still a real feeling. The next time I have blood work, I will see if the Honees plus other vitamin and nutritional supplements have made a difference in some of my low normal readings. For now, I have no adverse effects of the drops (1 per day) and do believe run recovery is facilitated by them.

review/summary: Staved off fatigue after travel
review/text: I had traveled across several time zones to visit family and had this shipped to that destination to await me. Although this is not a sugar-free treat, it certainly eliminates any guilt because honey is a natural antibiotic, and it is a great way to get some more energy, B and C vitamins, and zip into your day. It prevented fatigue for a while, which with my busy schedule, I need! Plus we are coming into flu season, I had a bit of a bug, took this after I recovered, and although this statement has not been evaluated by the FDA, I felt better. the taste is terrific--you have to prevent yourself from chewing too soon, i recommend sucking and letting the flavor expand a bit.

review/summary: Great tasting hard candy with a Honey center.
review/text: I wouldn't call these Hard Candies exactly healthy for you nor should you expect a burst of energy after taking one. On the other hand, if you like hard candies and like the taste of Honey, then you will love these. And they will actually be better for you than the average sugar sweet hard candy. These Ambrosoli-HoneesEnergy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops do have Vitamin B6,B12 and Vitamin C content such that 3 of these Drops will give you 100% of your daily requirement. But the best part is that these Drops taste really great. They taste like Honey and have a nice Honey filled center. They are not too sweet and dissolve readily. However, if you buy these expecting a big burst of energy after taking one Drop, you will be disappointed. I didn't really notice any significant increase in energy.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to keep your throat from drying up then these Ambrosoli Drops will definitely do that. If you want a hard candy or hard drops that taste really great but also are better than the average hard candy then try these Ambrosoli-HoneesEnergy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good Flavor - Not High Energy
review/text: The flavor of this product is smooth and enjoyable.  The honey comes through in just the right amount.  It is great as a piece of hard candy when you need a honey fix.  However, I did not notice any discernible increase in energy with this product.  I wasn't looking for a "caffeine boost," but I did expect to feel something (since that is how the product is marketed).  So this is where you will have to weigh exactly what you are looking for.  If you want a great, honey candy, then you have the right item.  If you are looking for an energy boost, you might want to go elsewhere.

review/summary: It's a candy, not a multivitamin...
review/text: Know what you are getting here.  These Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey drops are candy disguised as something else: energy boost, source of vitamins B6, B12, and C, and honey.<br /><br />They'll taste honey-like, with a soft center, but the thing is mainly sugar and high fructose corn syrup.  Use this to fulfill your vitamin needs and you'll probably add a few pounds while putting a few dollars in the pocket of your dentist.<br /><br />If you've ever chewed honeycomb, then you'll have a sense for the consistency of these drops when you start masticating.<br /><br />Oh, that continual search for a magic wellness bullet!

review/summary: Glorified Candy
review/text: Ambrosoli Honees are candy, folks. The vitamin content in the drops looks almost like it was an accident. No protien? Even real honey has a gram or two of protien unless it's been so denatured that it's nutritionally valueless.<br /><br />It takes three drops to get 100% of the USDA recommended value of vitamin C, less than you'd get from eating one fresh orange. Along with the arificial vitamin C you'll get 60 calories (half of a can of sugary soda), 15gm carbs, 15 gm sugar, and still only nominal amounts of two or three other vitamins.<br /><br />These drops do more harm than good in my opinion. They're too sugary and deviod of any real nutritional value for me to take seriously.

review/summary: A variation on a nostalgic treat...the original is better
review/text: I grew up enjoying the original Ambrosoli Honees and was looking forward to trying this "Energy Plus Vitamin" version: I received one 1.58 oz. bar, and all of the drops were leaking their liquid centers, so it was a sticky affair. I don't recall ever experiencing this in my earlier consumption of the original "Honees", so maybe these are more fragile...hard to say with such a small sample size.<br />In any event, I did manage to get the wrapper off of a few of the drops and tried them: they have the familiar sugar/honey flavor that I remember fondly...and some of the liquid remained to be enjoyed.<br />The leakage aside (I'll assume that was due to bad handling), I feel the "plus" aspect is not worth the extra cost, and would recommend that customers consider opting for the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYKM">Honees</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYKW">Milk & Honey</a>, which are much more affordable...almost 50% less on Amazon...and obtain one's vitamin RDA via supplements or food.

review/summary: confusing concept
review/text: I love the taste of honey and at times I need an energy boost so I was eager to try these honey filled drops. The flavor is very good but I'm not sure if they deliver the energy part. The package says 3 drops equal 100% DV of vitamins B6, B13 and C. As I said I love honey but 3 lozenges is a lot to get down. Doesn't seem very convenient to me. Maybe if I ate one after the other through an afternoon but I dont see having 3 in a row. I'll update this when I try a few more.

review/summary: Great taste, but didn't do much for energy.
review/text: All in all, this isn't a bad product.  Each pack comes with 9 pieces, so in order to get the 100% of B6, B12 and Vitamin C you need to eat 3.  Which means you would run out in 3 days if you do 3 a day.  Another note is that each piece has 20 calories and 5 grams of sugar, so it will cost you 60 calories to get 100% of the aforementioned vitamins.<br /><br />I tried one before a 40 minute workout and didn't really notice much. I also tried one after a workout and it didn't give me much of a boost.  So, from that front, I can't say it really gave me an energy boost.<br /><br />I will say however, the product tastes wonderful!  The best part is when you get close to the honey center and bite into the candy, the honey slowly oozes into your mouth and on your tongue for a taste sensation that is very, very pleasant.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting High Calorie Candy
review/text: The product is a "granola bar" looking silver foil packet containing nine individually wrapped candy lozenges.  Each lozenge contains 20 calories of "sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, and butter" (actually labelled that way, in that order, on the wrapper).  The product is actually manufactured in Italy by the G. B. Ambrosoli Ronago company, and imported by Andre Prost, Inc. of Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  The label goes on to say that "Honees" is a registered trademark of Andre Prost, Inc.<br /><br />At a time when people all across America are spending $ billions on little tiny bottles of caffeine marked "one hour energy," it appears that the Prost company is trying to cash in on the "energy" fad with a more honest approach that simply provides a blast of sugar. They have added vitamins B6, B12, and C to the product, so that three lozenges contains 100% of the daily requirement of these vitamins.<br /><br />Its very pleasant tasting.  Its got a nice mild "honey-ish" flavor, and the liquid honey center is a very nice reward at the end.  And I'm a person who enjoys the taste of honey and its benefits for a sore throat who is also aware of its high caloric density.  I was surprised that its only listed as the fourth most common ingredient; perhaps because honey is so much more expensive than sugar.<br /><br />For someone who normally enjoys hard candy (I'm not - my dentist advises against it.), "Honees Energy Plus" might be a nice addition to the product choices.  When I ordered the product, I was expecting a granola bar type experience, not a hard candy.  I suppose they are hoping people will overlook the calories to focus on the vitamins and energy.  Its a worthy idea.  Yet the candy, energy, and throat lozenge categories are all busting with product entries and are very competitive.

review/summary: Delicious, convenient. Honey is an energy food.
review/text: Honey is an excellent energy source, which I like to use when working out for extra boosts. But it's really inconvenient to lug bottles of honey while on a walk or hike, and anyone who has ever tried, knows the upset of a leaked bottle in your backpack!! These make no mess and are so convenient - just put a few of these cello-wrapped treats in your pocket! Hard candy on the outside and then you get to the soft, chewy honey center. And at only 20 calories per piece, you're working off those cals in no time. I'll definitely buy more of these.

review/text: If this is available in your area, buy it locally. you will save money and probably get fresher soda. If however, like me, you can't find this in your area, you must try it at least once. Not only is it some of the best soda i have tasted, but one of the best drinks. It has 200 calories per can, so of course it isn't for every day consumption, but a great treat every once in a while. The flavor is slightly similar to pineapple orange soda available at most grocery chains, but minus the orange. It is quite sweet and in no way bland. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pretty Good Chai Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.<br /><br />Overall, recommended.<br />****

These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.<br /><br />The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.<br /><br />While drinking this tea you are transported to India where chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially enhanced by listening to Shiva Rea's Yoga Rhythms CD.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Saved by the flavor...
review/text: This item contains sucralose.<br /><br />When I ordered the item, I read the description page twice and did not find any hint of fake sugar stuff, so I ordered the Mango Pineapple pack.  Shortly thereafter, I read the comments and tried to cancel (I hate Splenda for many reasons), but they were already being shipped.  I could have refused the package, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if I did not like it, my sister (addicted to Splenda) might.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I opened a stick and added a small amount to a cup of water.  Much to my surprise, it was not bad!.  The experience may have been different if I had used it as indicated, but I normally use this sort of dry mix sparingly.  In this case, it produced a fruity and sweet cup of water.  Not overly sweet - but again, I only used a small amount.  I decided to keep these and use with water or home made lemonade (instead of sugar or honey).  I will still share with my sister, but not all of them.<br /><br />Why 3 stars?<br />Average between misleading description (1 star) + good flavor (5)<br /><br />Amazon, please revise the description page!

I over dilute mine (using 1 pouch to a 24 oz bottle) and it is still a little too sweet for me.  Hubby likes it the way it is supposed to be and of course, the kids will drink it any way you give it to them.  It is a better alternative on the go than buying soda or sugary beverages.  A nice alternative when we are tired of drinking plain water, etc.  Honestly, there are not a lot of "healthier" to go options that you can leave in the car or a bag.  Hopefully, there will be soon.

review/summary: Artificial aftertaste weakens nice drink
review/text: I was unsure how "Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix" would taste, I was interested but also a little leery. I decided to wait until I was in need of `refreshment' and not just a `drink.' Over the weekend I was working in the garden, came in and decided this was the time it was designed for.<br /><br />I poured a glass of water, added the powder and stirred. And stirred, and stirred again. The powder clumped a bit and took some work to break up. I took a small sip and mainly tasted the artificial sweetener. Not so good. I took the plunge and took a big swallow. That was rather better. It tasted of tea and the hint of honey and fruit. Not bad, I down the rest of the glass in two goes and was pleasantly surprised. Not bad.<br /><br />Then trouble creeped in as the main flavor ended and the taste of the artificial sweetener filled my mouth in the aftertaste. I do not make a habit of drinks with artificial sweetener and this aftertaste was the reason why. BLEAH.Since my wife is no stranger to diet soda's I asked her to give it a try. She had the exact same problems I did with the powder clumping badly and an even strong reaction to the aftertaste.<br /><br />In the end when you're downing it this is a nice, refreshing drink, BUT if you are not in the habit of `diet' drinks the aftertaste will be an unpleasant and unwelcome surprise.

I appreciate that I can have something this sweet and refreshing without a ton of calories or caffeine.  The granules take forever to dissolve so it is best used in a water bottle you can shake rather than a glass you have to stir.  I notice they've added a pitcher sized pack to the single serve lines which I assume would be more cost effective.

review/text: On the plus side, the tea mixed fairly easily without any residue remaining on the bottom - stirring with a spoon in a glass is adequate. That was important to me since convenience and ease in making it are part of what makes me want to buy it. I thought it was very sweet and refreshing, and my husband enjoyed it.<br /><br />On the negative side, it was almost too sweet for me, but if you add more water (obviously) that helped. What I couldn't change was the taste itself, and I thought there was a bit of an "aftertaste".  I don't know whether or not it's just because I just don't like the taste of the acai, which I've never had before.  I think I would have preferred just the strawberry. But if you are a fan of acai I would say you should try this and it may end up being "your cuppa tea".

review/summary: Easy to use and great tasting
review/text: Recently becoming tea connoisseurs, my husband and I are thrilled to try Lipton To Go Stix.  Small packets of Strawberry Acai flavored tea that is simple to use and provide a great tasting beverage.  Simply pour the stix into a bottle of water and shake well, or pour into a glass and stir well.  Drink and enjoy: pretty simple concept that is well known.<br /><br />At 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it is a reasonable substitute for other drinks.  Plus, it is decaffeinated, so that is a big plus.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely strawberry.  I am not sure what acai tastes like, but I could not taste any other flavor than strawberry.  So if you are looking for a strong tea flavor, this is not the flavor for you.  It tastes more like diluted juice than tea for sure.<br /><br />I really like this product and will gladly buy it again. A note, be sure to stir or shake well, as the box notes tea takes longer to dissolve.

review/summary: "made with REAL ingredients" (as opposed to imaginary ingredients?)
review/text: When I saw this I thought "Oh boy! ice tea , sweetened with honey sugar and a taste of strawberries". I should have been thinking "Oh boy, tastes like raspberry jello and I can DRINK it". Don't get me wrong, it tastes alright for what it is . Just don't get your mouth all puckered up for tea because there isn't much tea taste to it.  The person who came up with the idea of adding sucralose should be fired. Maybe that was their way of competing with all the no-calorie, low-calorie "water enhancers" on the market but I think they will lose more customers with the sucralose than they would with a few more calories. But what do I know?<br /><br />Anyway, a description of the product. The box comes with 10 little packets about the size of a stick of gum. Easy to carry in your pocket or purse. Each packet flavors 16 oz of water.  Each packet has a little slit making it easy to open and an opening just the right size to empty  it into a bottle.  Dissolves quickly. Decaf ,if that's important to you.<br /><br />The "GO Stix", in water,  were a little too strong for my taste but I emptied one into a 2 quart pitcher of Lipton iced tea and it gave it a very nice, subtle strawberry taste. I think that is the way I'll be using mine. Not what they were intended for ,I know , but works for me.

I would prefer the drink without the artificial sweetener(s). The drink is already sweetened with honey and if still not sweet enough, I would prefer to add a little sugar if needed. But, the drink is good and low calorie, so a decent trade-off. Also, the mix dissolved easily in the water.

review/text: Lipton has another winner on their hand with their new on the go honey, strawberry acai iced green tea packets.  You get all the health benefits of the green tea as well as 5 calories per serving.  I have found with most low calorie tea you lose a lot of flavor, but this one has all the sweetness you crave without the guilt.  More fruity tasting than tea tasting, but still worth it.

review/summary: Tastes good but a bit too sweet for me.
review/text: This tea had a refreshing, fruity flavor that was really delicious. Unlike most other Texans, however, I prefer my tea unsweetened most of the time. So, the Lipton was a little too sweet for my taste. Even knowing that it was honey flavored, I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. As a comparison, I like the Lipton Citrus Green Tea in bottles, but it is right on the edge. This was maybe twice as sweet. However, the mango flavor was excellent. Over ice, this tea was great.

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I got a package of these to review for the Amazon Vine program.  I'm not normally a big fan of these add to water drinks.  But, this one is really good. It's not as much green tea as it is mango and pineapple. If you're a tea lover, you might not like this so much. It's very fruity.  I like the fact that it's not all artificially sweetened even though it does contain an artificial sweetener.  At least there is some honey in it.  I would definitely buy these.  I couldn't keep them away from my daughters and my wife.

review/summary: Like the flavor, but not the after taste
review/text: Ok, so I tried the Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai flavor. While I liked the Strawberry Acai flavor in and of itself, I did NOT like the after taste left behind. It uses sucralose as a sweetener and I just don't like the "coating of the tongue" effect you get from that. I don't drink diet beverages normally, so I might just be more sensitive to the sucralose. I suppose if you are one who drinks diet beverages normally you would probably not notice the after taste that most diet beverages leave. I would love if they made this product with real sweeteners and not artificial.

review/text: I don't like fake sugar flavor and I don't like things to be super sweet.  I'm tough to please in the beverage department.  But, these little iced tea things make the cut!  They dissolve easily, even at the office without a spoon to use to stir and the flavor is light and sweet, not cloying and artificial.  I do use a bit more water than the package recommends, but I find this product pleasing and excellent!

review/summary: Nice taste, very portable
review/text: If you are a fan of the drink to go packets that you add to a water bottle, you will love these.  They come in a couple different flavors and are a nice to change up to the old routine.  The honey, strawberry acai is tasty.  Quite different than several of the other packets I've tried.  If you are looking for a way to drink more water without the caffeine, these are terrific.  Many of the tea varieties of other brands contain caffeince, but these are decaf.  They do contain some artificial sweetner which I would prefer to not have, but the flavor doesn't have a strong aftertaste and it does limit the calories.  I would definitely recommend giving these a try.

review/text: For a water-flavoring powder, it doesn't mix too well with water. Unlike other brands where you can just pour water over the powder and it'll mix itself and dissolve, this stuff needs to be stirred and stirred and stirred, and you'll still end up with random clumps of unmixed powder anyway. The flavor is pretty good, but as others have said, there's no real honey taste. It tastes more like a sugar-free Crystal Light mix. Not that is a bad thing, but it's not the flavor it says it should be.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting, But Not Iced Tea
review/text: To me, if a product is advertised as being an iced tea mix, there should at least be some tea in the list of ingredients, and the product should have some tea taste. Lipton Tea & Honey, Decaffeinated Iced Green Tea Mix, Strawberry Acai (how's that for a memorable name) does have "decaffeinated green tea powder" in the list of ingredients, third behind honey granules (sugar honey) and something called "malic acid."<br /><br />Perhaps that's why this product, which is low calorie (5 calories per every 8 ounce serving) and convenient (just add water to the "to go" packet, and shake), doesn't real have an iced tea taste. The taste is pleasant enough, and this product definitely tastes okay (it has a strawberry taste), but sorry, it's not iced tea.<br /><br />Te good news is that this product is non-fat, and very low calorie. And the packets are very convenient, which is great if you are looking for a low calorie, non-fat soda replacement at work or school. It's just not iced tea.

review/text: I really like the taste of this drink. It tastes like a smooth fruit juice. I was expecting it to taste like a flavored tea, but it's more of a flavored fruit juice. I do like the health quality of it. And being that it is caffeine free, it is great for my whole family, my 5 year old loves it as much as his kool-aid, so this makes a great alternative! I would recommend it if you're looking for a fruity tasting drink, just don't expect it to taste like tea.<br />Also, it dissolved quickly. Some "tea" mixes tend to sit at the top of my bottle, this did not.

review/summary: More like Kool-Aid than tea
review/text: I love the concept of a mixture in a small packet form that you can add to water in order to transform the taste. I know many companies have embraced this idea and have branched out from juices to coffee and I think it is a good direction to take. A few of these packets in the side pocket of my bag provides a convenient way to have my own beverage when I want it without the danger of a flask or a bottle spilling on your stuff.<br />This concept I give 5 stars and will gladly purchase more in the future.<br />However, as far as taste goes Lipton has sold out to the sugary sweet guys. Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again. It isn't very practical to use only half of the package per beverage.

review/summary: Refreshing low-calorie, decaf drink
review/text: At just 5 calories per serving, and with no caffeine, this is a refreshing and portable beverage. The label says each packet is 2 servings, so most people will use the entire thing and have 10 calories. The to-go packets make it easy to keep in your purse. The packets say it is sweetened with honey, but it also contains sucralose (the generic for Splenda), so I think the label is a little misleading. I liked the strawberry flavor and it didn't have a strong diet after-taste, although I could tell it had artificial sweetener. I like that it doesn't contain artificial colors. If you like other green tea beverages, I highly recommend this one. I'd definitely get it again!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Honey granules (sugar, honey)<br />Malic acid<br />Decaffeinated green tea powder<br />Hibiscus extract<br />Maltodextrin (corn)<br />Sucralose (sweetener)<br />Natural Flavor<br />Strawberry juice solids<br />Acai juice solids

review/summary: Tasty, portable and decent ingredients list
review/text: The instant beverage market has exploded in recent years - what started with Kool-Aid is now half an aisle at the local grocery store. Products like Mio and these Lipton packets are brilliant to have "on the road". This newest flavor from Lipton is pretty creative, and shows that companies are slowly running out of the basics. The flavor of the tea, honey, mango pineapple is good - the ingredients list is pretty decent (no propolyne Glycol like in Mio for example). One packet is enough to flavor a regular bottle of water, and factoring in the price of both, this makes a pretty cheap flavored water.<br /><br />That said, there is also something to be said for sticking to normal unflavored water, but lets be honest - everyone needs some flavor every now and then.

review/summary: Slight aftertaste, but is good for what it is
review/text: This tea tastes a bit like strawberry jam to me.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I tried dissolving it in both a glass of cold water and shaking it in a plastic water bottle. Both ways produces a good blend of the product with little or no powder left.  I already finished my box, so that is a testament to how refreshing it is. It's a good substitution for soda or if you want something treat-like in your water.

review/summary: Sweetened with honey AND sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: Lipton Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai is an individually-packaged drink sweetener that you add to water in order to improve the flavor. It is decaffeinated, which I especially like, and is pretty simple to use: tear off the top, pour it into a bottle of water, and shake it up until the powder is completely dissolved. What you get is a refreshing, low calorie (10 calorie if you use the entire packet) drink that is an alternative to cola and plain water.<br /><br />Overall, the product has a decent flavor, and you can definitely taste the honey and strawberry. I do, however, have two problems with it. First, the box states the product is "made with real ingredients," yet it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (which is marketed under the trade name Splenda). The use of sucralose in no way invalidates the other "real" ingredients like tea leaves and strawberries, but it also means that not every ingredient in the drink is *natural* (something people often infer when the term "real" is used). Second, each packet contains enough for TWO bottles of water - if you pour the whole packet into one bottle, it will probably be significantly too sweet.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. I liked the flavor overall, and will use it in the future. It is a valid alternative to diet cola, and has a more natural flavor than many other water sweeteners on the market.

review/summary: Tastes good but some ingredients questionable
review/text: This product does taste good, and it only contains 5 calories from 1 gram of sugar. It takes 2 or 3 minutes to completely dissolve, but that's not a problem. What is confusing/questionable are some of the ingredients. Among others listed are "sucralose (sweetner), Maltodextrin (corn), ... isomalt". What are these things? Two of them appear to be malt products and the other an artificial sweetner. Is this Maltodextrin (corn) similar to high fructose corn syrup?<br /><br />Also, at the very bottom of the "Nutrition Facts", apart from the ingredients list, 10 mg of caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet" is also mentioned. When only 1/2 packet (one serving per the package) is added to 8 fluid ounces of water, the taste is definitely watered down.

review/summary: Better than Mio
review/text: A while back I tested a couple of flavors of Mio and found them to be one dimensional and disturbingly artificial. On one hand, while I usually brew my own ice tea for daily drinking, I don't always have it and sometimes would like a substitution. Mio isn't it. Lipton To Go Stix are an improvement over Mio. Mio tends to only hit parts of your tongue's taste buds and lacks a balance and fullness of flavor, in addition to tasting fake. Real brewed iced tea has a broad spectrum of flavors that cover a wide range of taste buds while highlighting the flavors you brew it for. In my case, I make cold brewed green tea with honey and I can actually taste the green tea and honey. With tea drink mixes, though, I rarely taste the tea. Most are overly sweet for me. The Lipton To Go Stix, however, when mixed as directly, is not overbearing in sweetness or any one flavor. I still don't taste ice tea, but the other flavors taste like they are supposed to and it covers a wider range of tastebuds. It does not taste artificial. The 7 ingredients include flavors from natural sources (honey, sugar, green tea powder, hibiscus) versus Mio's mostly synthesized formulas.<br /><br />On the whole, I think I may pick up some of these To Go Stix if I see them on sale. I think Lipton did a good job of creating natural flavors and it may fit the bill as a substitute drink for me.

review/summary: Decent powdered ice tea
review/text: I don't like most powdered teas, either because of their articial flavor, the bad aftertaste, their use of certain artificial sweeteners, or some combination of the above. However I did enjoy the Lipton Honey Mango Pineapple Ice Tea, albeit with a few caveats.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flavor, and didn't find it too "chemically" or with a significant aftertaste. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly so (depending on how you mix it). However, I found that following the mixing instructions of the box made the tea far too strong and sweet. I'd recomend starting with half the listed amount, and adding from there to taste.<br /><br />Although some people have stated that this is "all natural", do be aware that it contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the tea, but I would like it much more if it were a bit less sweet, and really were all natural.

review/summary: Very sweet flavor, doesn't taste like tea.
review/text: My kids and I enjoy the flavor of the Blackberry Pomegranate Iced Green Tea Mix from Lipton, but it doesn't taste like I'm drinking tea.  The fruit flavor doesn't really taste like a juice, either. It's very good, but I do wish it tasted more like an herbal-green tea mix with less sweetness.  My kids disagree. They like the flavor and its sweetness just the way it is.  I prefer to drink it diluted to half-strength, so instead of pouring the whole pouch into my 16 oz. water bottle or glass, I pour in half of it.  Or I get my 32 oz. water jug and pour the whole pouch into that.<br /><br />Other than the fact that it doesn't taste like tea at all, the other small complaint I have is that the powder doesn't fully dissolve.  There are always a few small dark pink balls floating around, no matter how much I stir or shake it.  I just tell myself it's little pieces of fruit and go ahead and drink it.  I have noticed that they do dissolve by the time I finish the drink, if I manage not to swallow them down.<br /><br />This is a great flavor additive if you are trying to drink more water, but just can't bring yourself to drink it plain.  It should be noted that it does contain caffeine and artificial sweeteners.

The honey and fruit combines to deliver a refreshing, good-tasting drink that makes me want another right away.<br /><br />One slight caveat: as with all drinks including artificial sweeteners (sucralose; 5 calories per packet) there is a mild aftertaste. Overall, however, comparing drinks of this sort, this was quite acceptable.

I tried one of the Green Teas sweetened with Honey by Lipton & was pleasantly surprised. So I decided to give this flavor a try as well. It's not as good as the Green Tea. Obviously, the tea is very artificial tasting, not like their bottled tea. It's powdered instant tea though so I it's to be expected. However, after a few sips, it grew on me. The fruitiness is there but not over powering. The packaging is very convenient. I can just throw one in my purse and pour it into a 16 oz. bottle of water wherever I am. The great part for me is that this is less sugar I am drinking so anything that can win me over in that dept is a keeper.

review/summary: Lazy Summer Afternoon Sort of Drink
review/text: I'm not sure I'd go to the store specifically to buy this drink, but that said, it's the sort of fruity drink perfect for a tall glass, lots of ice, and a good book. There is a slight "diet" taste to it, but that could be because I'm not watering it down enough and therefore it's a bit "strong."<br /><br />It's a great drink to accompany a long catch-up conversation with a friend or sit by yourself next to a pool. Either way though, I keep picturing it as a summer drink. I can't imagine it being quite so refreshing if you're wrapped up in a quilt huddling by a fire.<br /><br />The little to-go pack took me a while to figure out how to open. That cut they put in it almost looked like a mistake rather than the way you're actually supposed to open the thing.<br /><br />Watering it down might spread out the taste a bit. I'm more of a raspberry/blueberry sort of girl, but this is a pleasant diversion. If you like green tea you should give this a shot.

review/text: My first sip impression was that of mango with an odd but not unpleasant underlying aromatic flavor.  After trying some other products, I realized this is probably the green tea.  Once I got used to it, I found I quite liked it.  This drink is very refreshing and does not fill me up like a carbonated drink would.  I especially value that it is so low cal as compared to my normal iced tea mixes.  The single serve is very convenient but I wish it also came in a bulk pack for the mass consumption I intend to do if our Pacific Northwest weather ever gets warm!

review/summary: Love the Strawberry flavor
review/text: I am constantly looking for new flavors for my water.  I like the taste of strawberries but I am not really a fan of green tea.  This flavor stix doesn't have a bad aftertaste and it is bursting with strawberry flavor.  My husband took a drink from my bottle and he said he would like a bottle all his own because he really likes the taste also. I will be looking for this flavor again when my box is all gone.

review/summary: A little sweet
review/text: This was a little too sweet. The mango and pineapple kind of overtake the tea. But if you like really sweet tea then you will love this. Obviously it is very convenient. You just pour the packet into a bottle of water and shake. I would even venture to say you could use half a pack and it be just as good. This may need a little diluting. But still recommend.

review/text: The predominant flavor of this drink mix is mango with a hint of pineapple.  I really do like it.  It's also very convenient.  Each packet/stick is just enough for a 16 ounce water bottle.  After a vigorous shake, the powder totally dissolves.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it is less than the Crystal Light drink mixes.  Really good.  I do recommend.

review/summary: Lipton to Go - Tropical Mango & Pineapple in a Bottle or load it up in a CamelBak�
review/text: Pretty impressive for Lipton for their fruit infusion which is amazing! I found this to work better when you insert these packages in the 16.9 ounce bottles and THEN refrigerate them as they dissolve easier this way. In addition; I had even used the remainder in my small CamelBak� while I went on a 60 mile cycling tour on March 31st on my Trek� (Racing / Touring Cycle) to keep hydrated. I adore Mangoes and Pineapples; but come across mixing this with tea - that I have never heard of(I own a Mango tree and grow Pineapples)!<br /><br />It's great for anyone who is a FRUIT FUSION lover or a smoothie lover or those who dare to venture into something different!

review/summary: Pretty tasty and convenient, but with a slight weird beginning-taste.
review/text: This is a pretty-tasty tea mix and I like the slim profile of the packet which allows you to pretty much stash it anywhere you want until you need it. The "open here" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink container if you're not careful.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was the container I used to mix the tea in-or maybe that I was using tap water-that was causing this slight bitter beginning-taste to it. But it isn't either of those things. The powder just has a slight taste to it that may or may not turn you off to the drink.<br /><br />Each packet is 10 calories and 2 carbs. It says 5 calories, but if you take a second glance, that's for 8 oz of water; the full packet makes 16oz. If the directions are for 16oz of water with a small bottle of water pictured (like the kirkland signature ones from costco), then can we get a nutritional count for the whole 16oz, please? I didn't dock anything off the rating for this, given that it's printed right on the packet, but c'mon...<br /><br />Overall, a nice little product to give your bottled water some extra tasty kick. Not a fan of that first split-second it hits the palate, but if you're busy, you might not even notice.

review/summary: Just fine as an anytime drink
review/text: Overall, I have been enjoying this drink. It's fruity and pleasant, with a honey taste that comes through pretty strongly. I like that it's decaf, so I can drink it any time of day. I like that it contains sucralose instead of aspartame.<br /><br />I have been using one packet in a large, 16-ounce glass, since each packet is technically two 8-ounce servings. The pink powder smells strawberry-ey at first (sorry -- I'm much better at book reviews than these food reviews!), and the color once mixed with water is a nice deep pink. The granules are big and take some stirring to dissolve, which the package does indicate.<br /><br />Amid the fruity and honey taste (and smell of honey) it's hard to detect any tea flavor. I picked up a little blueberry as I continued drinking it the first time. Could I tell that it contains green tea rather than black tea or any other kind of tea? Not at all.<br /><br />I like that it's low-calorie (though not technically sugar-free, since, as the ingredient list states, the honey granules contain sugar). But I've been avoiding sugar lately, so I'll take it!

review/summary: Better than the Crystal Light Teas
review/text: I love iced tea, and usually enjoy it home-made and unsweetened. Unfortunately, there are some activities that keep me from dragging along a large jar of home-made tea, so I have to settle for the fake stuff.<br /><br />I've tried the Crystal Light versions, and have universally hated the aftertaste, although I like plenty of their other flavors. I had also tried a Lipton version of their ice tea and lemonade a few years back, and wasn't that impressed. This one looked intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I always mix these with 26 oz rather than the 16 oz they usually call for, and at this strength the tea flavor is rather diluted, however the sweetness and mango/pineapple tang are near perfect. Very refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this mix takes quite awhile to dissolve in water, and it will settle to the bottom if you don't cap the bottle and shake aggressively for half a minute or so before drinking.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I really liked the taste of this. I mixed it with 16.9 water bottles, cold from the refrigerator. I found it took quite a bit of shaking to mix the powder in, and never did get it completely dissolved as there were still tiny bits that settled to the bottom. I think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix, it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle.<br />The strawberry taste was excellent, not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. I really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner. It makes drinking my daily intake of water easier.<br />The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go. The package has a notch to make opening easier. I will definitely buy these. I would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve.

review/text: This is the second flavor of Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix that I have tried. This mango/pineapple is delicious! It mixes easily and leaves no residue.<br /><br />My two gripes: Why on earth package a drink mix designed for water bottles as " mix 1/2 package with an 8 oz bottle"? Who buys those? The most common size of water bottles in my section of mid-america is 16 oz. Just stupidity.<br /><br />And, the misleading title of "tea with honey". If you check the ingredients, there is way more than honey sweetening this beverage. How about sucralose  and maltodextrin?<br /><br />So, basically, it's just another sugared beverage. But it is pretty tasty!

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I love the To Go sticks that you simply mix in a bottle of water!  I've had many different brands and flavors over the years.  The Lipton To Go Iced Green Tea and Honey with Blackberry Pomegranate wasn't too bad.  Both of my kids (ages 6 and 7) wanted to try it too.  The 6 year old gave it a thumbs down but the 7 year old gave a thumbs up.<br /><br />The powder did not dissolve too well.  I shook and shook and shook but there was still some parts that were not dissolving (both in chilled and unchilled water.)  I also don't like that the instructions are to mix in an 16.9 oz container of water, but the serving suggestion and caloric information is all based on 8 oz (Why can't we keep things simple?)  Still at 10 calories for a 16.9 oz bottle of water, that isn't bad.  No fat, only 1 gm - per serving - of sugars.  The big plus for me is the 10mg of caffeine that it has per serving!  I can skip my afternoon coffee but still get that extra little lift to get me through.<br /><br />It also says that it is naturally sweetened with honey.  Which, yea, it has honey granuels in it, but it also has sucralose.<br /><br />Overall it is pretty good as a water enhancement powder.  I would buy in the future.

review/summary: Excellent Lo-Cal Beverage
review/text: This is quite a good product; the beverage comes in easy to mix and use individual packets, and boasts a low 10 calories per serving. But the low calorie count doesn't sacrifice flavor; the brew is smooth and refreshing, if not quite crisp, and will make a fine drink for hot summer days. The drink mixes up to an attractively clear and deep purple color.<br /><br />The predominant flavor is blackberry, which seems to overpower the others. Honey could be distinguished only as a sweetener, not for characteristic honey taste. Pomegranate could not be easily detected. And, surprisingly, there was little green tea flavor, a result which I wouldn't have expected in a Lipton product, most of which seem to have carefully engineered tastes.<br /><br />There is one unusual use for this drink that I'll bet the designers didn't anticipate: It makes a very good mixer for neutral-flavored alcohol add-ins (adults only, please!).<br /><br />I give this four stars for convenience, good flavor, low calories, and versatility. One star comes off for the lack of tea flavor in what is sold as a tea drink.

review/summary: Convenient, refreshing but this is not my favorite flavor
review/text: These To-Go drink mixes are great. They are so convenient to buy, store, and use. They are economical too. This specific flavor though is not my favorite. I like the Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate flavor much better.<br /><br />In terms of sweetness, though, it is just right. They tell you to use 16.9 ounces of water, but I always add more water (about 22 oz) to these To-Go type powdered drink packets, and I find that much better.<br /><br />There are 5 calories per packet. It has a mix of sugar, honey, and sucralose (same thing as splenda) which keeps the calorie count down.<br /><br />While I wouldn't buy this in the future, if you like strawberry, then you might like this flavor.

review/text: Lipton's Tea & Honey Iced Green Tea, the Blackberry Pomegranate flavor this time around, has a perky berry taste I like, unfortunately with the slight after taste of a diet drink (possibly the sucralose sweetener). The ease of putting it in a 16.9 fl oz. water bottle is a plus, and after several shakes, the packet dissolves nicely.  I appreciate being able to make some bottles ahead of time.

review/summary: Tastes great, but contains artificial sweeteners
review/text: This is a great tasting, low calorie iced green tea mix  from Lipton.  It is not too bitter, although the use of sucralose, which is extremely sweet, makes it a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  My wife loves the stuff - then again she does not mind artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Speaking of sucralose, I was surprised because it appeared that Lipton had actually come up with something that was not bad for you.  However, closer examination of the ingredients revealed use of an artificial sweetener (sucralose), which is one way to make the iced tea sweet and low calorie.  Although this is probably the least offensive of the artificial sweeteners, I generally avoid them like the plague.  Besides, the only reason why I was excited about this tea mix was because it appeared natural - tea, honey, strawberries - how could I go wrong?<br /><br />Each package contains approximately 4 grams of the iced tea mixture - because it is so sweet, you could probably get away with using less than the recommended serving size (1/2 package or 2 g) and it would still taste pretty good.  I might go with 1/4 package. Whatever you do, don't dump the whole package in a glass.  As far as the flavors go, strawberry overwhelms everything else - this tastes like the fruit drinks my children love.<br /><br />For those of you that don't care about ingesting artificial sweeteners you will probably enjoy this iced tea mix - it does taste pretty good.  I generally liked the stuff, although I will dilute the mixture next time around.

review/summary: Great honey flavor for making bottled water more exciting
review/text: Looking for a way to spice up your drinking water and getting tired of adding lemons or limes?  Lipton's Tea & Honey mix adds a flavorful new option already divided into individual serving packets, which makes it easy to add to a water bottle on the go or a full glass of water at home.<br /><br />This particular flavor is quite different from the standard powdered mixed drinks, having a strong honey taste with a light strawberry twist.  There isn't much sugar in it either, at only 2 grams per packet, so it's an option to consider for diabetics or people watching their sugar intake.<br /><br />Plenty of other reviewers have noted there is a small amount of sucralose (Splenda) in here, which is something to consider if you don't care for artificial sweeteners. As the husband of someone with Type 1 diabetes I've gotten quite used to it and find it to be a very enjoyable flavor, so it didn't personally bother me at all.<br /><br />If you don't have time to brew up iced tea at home and want a quick flavor boost for water, this is a great option, and is an excellent way to make bottled water more exciting on picnics or car trips.

review/summary: Good Taste and Easy to Mix
review/text: I drink a lot of flavored waters using the ready-to-mix packets, primarily the Crystal Light brand - I can't recall drinking a Lipton brand but, after drinking this one, I will add it to the list.<br /><br />This packet has a good flavor, although the blackberry (to me) had a hint of grape in it.  I mixed it in a 20 ounce bottle of cold water - the directions say use a 16.9 ounce bottle - and it still tasted just a bit too sweet to be called perfect.  The powdered mix is not as fine as Crystal Lite but a little thicker and coarse, so you will spend a little bit more time shaking the bottle in order to mix it properly.<br /><br />There are 10 calories per packet, even though the front of the box says 5 calories in big letters because each packet is two servings.  That's about the same as Crystal Light.  Overall, this one is pretty good and I think I will try out a few of their other flavors to add some variety.

review/text: Normally, I hate any zero calorie drink. Artificial sweeteners have a bad aftertaste to me. So I didn't have high hopes for this. Well, I was surprised. This tea is partially sweetened with natural honey so I guess this helps to eliminate some of the aftertaste. This particular flavor is very fruity & refreshing. I poured the packet into a 16 oz. bottle of water and it was great. The packets come in convenient travel size packets that would be easy to stash in a purse or pocket. This is a really nice alternative for someone that wants something fruity & not loaded with sugar & calories. Can't wait to try the other flavors!

review/text: I did enjoy this just add water & mix fruit tea. Because of the tea granules it does take some mixing which is not a problem. I was surprised that the drink could have a strawberry flavor that was sweet but not too fake tasting also I was wondering about the strange aftertaste that was reminiscent of a diet drink.<br /><br />The drink touts itself on being sweetened with HONEY and other natural juices yet maintains its paltry 5 calories without the aid of aspartame - so it is healthy right? Well that super sweetness is in thanks to SUCRALOSE an artificial sweetener that just happens to be 600 times as sweet as table sugar and 3 times sweeter than aspartame.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />So the drink is an official diet drink if NOT 100% natural.

review/summary: Review for Lipton Tea & Honey (blackberry pomegranate flavor)
review/text: This is a powder drink mix that you can add to your water bottle. (Each packet is meant to be added to 16.9 fl oz of water.) I think it tastes okay, but it is more like juice than tea. I don't really taste the green tea part. It reminds me of the Celestial Seasonings herbal teas. I tried the drink both cold and hot, and it tastes fine either way. The powder doesn't dissolve as readily in cold water but stirring helped. The only thing I don't like is that even though it claims to be only 5 calories without using aspartame, I noticed that there is sucralose in the ingredients list. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener used in sweeteners such as Splenda, and I've never liked the taste of it.

review/summary: crystal light???
review/text: It seems to me that this "TEA" product mirrors some of my crystal light products. I think Lipton is trying to get a bigger step in this flavored water market.  For me, seeing a name like Lipton on the box would push me into buying this product until I taste it and then I think of crystal light. Although tea is the third item on the ingredient list, for the life I me I can't taste ANY tea.  The first two are honey granules (sugar) and citric acid for tartness.  The third is green tea powder.<br /><br />Another thing that is really odd is that the packet, of which there are ten in the box...half of the packet is a serving. But, when I think about this, isn't that what crystal light is also?<br /><br />Getting down to what I thought of this product...Doesn't have enough tea in it for me to drink it as caffeine. Even when I put the whole packet in 20 ounces of water, it was still too, too, sweet and strong.

review/summary: nice fruity flavored drink
review/text: One thing is certain, they don't skimp on the blackberry and pomegranate flavors in this drink!  If anything, they overpower the taste of the tea - if you're looking for something along the lines of a tea drink lightly flavored with fruit, this one might not be for you.  But it tastes good and is refreshing, especially for the warmer months (a slight false sugar aftertaste aside).  This mix was a bit different than the usual powered drink additives I've tried out there and there's the nice green tea bonus as well (which might explain why the fruit flavors overwhelm the tea as it's not as strong as black tea).<br /><br />Other than the faint sucralose aftertaste, my only other complaint would be that a 'serving' is half a packet - perhaps I'm not familiar enough with these drink sticks to know that you're only supposed to use half (which seems ridiculous) to consider it a full serving.  Seems a way to cheat to get that five calories claim.

review/summary: Kinda sweet, but good when diluted more
review/text: This doesn't taste like green tea to me, but it tastes a lot like strawberry kool aid.  That's OK because I LIKE strawberry kool aid, and I'm not a big fan of sweet tea.<br /><br />Most of this is sugar or sweetener of some kind - "honey granules" (sugar, honey - they added sugar to honey?  Really?), maltodextrin (corn sugar), and sucralose (Splenda).  There's green tea powder, hibiscus extract, strawberry juice solids, and acai juice solids are the flavor.  The flavors work well together, but again, it's pretty sweet.  I tried it full strength with 12 ounces of water, and it was too much.  I poured half a packet into a 20 oz bottle of water, and it was almost the right strength.  The cool thing about that is that a box of this will last a little longer for me.

review/summary: Sweet but Flavorful Tea
review/text: I should premise this by saying I am not a huge fan of overly sweet drinks. This product comes in a box of 10 small pouches full of drink mix. The directions say to pour the mix in a 16.9 oz bottle of water and shake vigorously or pour into a glass of water and stir. It warns that the tea takes some time to dissolve, and it did- about a minute of stirring before it was fully dissolved. It was easy to mix with a bottle you can shake, but it does eventually dissolve. The tea itself is fairly sweet, but still nice and tart enough for me. I preferred to water it down even more than the box suggested and put one pouch into a 20oz. bottle which made it more palatable for me. However, if you prefer your drinks more on the sweet side, I would follow the directions as stated.  There is about 20 mg of caffeine per pouch as well and 10 calories per packet. Overall, pretty tasty little drink mix! Definitely a convenient way to zing up your water on the go!

review/summary: Great Tasting and Refreshing
review/text: My family and I are all tea lovers - both hot and cold.  The Lipton to-Go is of course an iced green tea.  A perfect blend of honey, tea leaves and real fruit solids make it a healthy alternative to sodas.  Each packet makes two 8 oz servings, which have 5 calories, 10 mg of caffeine, and 2 g of sugar.  Although I usually drink a whole 16 oz, I still don't think it's too bad.  My daughter mixed a packet by agitating it in a 16.9 fl oz water bottle, and experienced no problems dissolving it.  However, I mixed a packet in a 16 oz glass of water and had to work a little harder to dissolve it.  That's my only complaint.

review/summary: READ the directions AND the ingredients!!
review/text: I like both blackberry tea and pomegranate juice, so I thought this would be an easy "A+". Not the case.<br />First of all, drink mix packets are everywhere these days. Most of them are designed for a 16 oz bottle and plainly say so. For some reason, Lipton has decided to print directions that say to add 1/2 packet to 8 oz of water. Why? How many people actually buy 8 oz bottles? And, if they felt their product was aimed at those who would seek out 8 oz bottles, why not make the packet with just enough for that? Just odd.<br /><br />'Tea and Honey" is proudly proclaimed several places on the package. Classic combination. Clearly stating ' NO asperatame!". "Sweetened with honey, Real tea leaves, real fruit flavors". But there was a funny, artificial taste. Reading the ingredient list reveals: sucralose and maltodextrin. YUCK!<br /><br />Besides the artificial taste, or maybe because of it, instead of tea, this really tastes like Kool-Aid. If you're ok with that, then this is an ok drink. Me? I'll pass.

review/summary: Decaf, but pleasant
review/text: I know I'm not the only one out there who doesn't like to drink water. I'm always looking for solutions to help me put down more of the stuff each day - solutions that are low calorie, caffeine free, and pleasant tasting. Most of the mini packs of powder feel to me like I'm adding chemicals to my water glass, which seems to counter the healthy idea I'm going for in drinking water. These packs are pleasant tasting, although they don't really taste at all like tea - think of them more as a Crystal Light type equivalent. I also couldn't really taste the honey - I would have described them more as a generic "berry" flavor, but not cloyingly sweet.

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: I've been drinking this at work and it is a good alternative to soda. I tend to like my drinks on the weak side so I water this down a little more than the directions say because it is pretty strong. I can't imagine drinking this in the middle of winter but it is perfect to throw in a gym bag in case you want to put some flavor in your water while working out.<br />I wasn't even aware that the product is low calorie (5 per serving) I was just wanting something different so the low calories a big bonus.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: This product has great taste, and not too sweet. The tea mixes up in your water like coolaide, and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you. However, the packets do not tear by hand, but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open. That is the only thing that needs to be improved.

review/summary: Pretty good cold
review/text: Got my package today so I opened it up then put one packet in a bottle of drinking water then put that in the fridge so it would get cold as thats the way I like to drink tea. Did the same to another packet & water bottle. A few hours later I decided to taste one of the cold bottles. A nice strength when added to a 16.9 oz bottle without being overpowering. I did shake the bottle before opening it of course. Good & tasty. Not too strong on the sugar & a nice mix of flavors. Be aware this will turn the water red in color which is not a problem. I might buy some of this when my box of 10 packets runs out. I'd say try this. You just might like it as I do!!
