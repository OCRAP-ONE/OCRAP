review/summary: Easy, Excellent, Curry
review/text: I love this curry powder mix. It's good for a variety of meats, I make lamb and chicken curry with it. It tastes like the good curry you get in an authentic Indian restaurant. And, it's easy to make, the directions are on the back. Just add meat, onions and plain yougert and you're all set. I also add a can of pigeon peas, but you can use any veg you want (although that's not in the recipe on box). You can adjust the "spicy hot" level by adding more or less of the curry powder. Try it if you're a curry lover, and even if you aren't --with this curry powder you may become one.

review/summary: Not Your Father's Tobasco Sauce
review/text: I have never written a food review on Amazon before but I just have to rave about how tasty and sensational this chili sauce is. Being Vietnamese and being practically raised on this sauce, it makes so many types of dishes spicier and flavorful like Pho or on anything meaty. You can honestly make a pizza that tastes like cardboard or ramen noodles that are too starchy and put this sauce on to make anything taste much better. It is made with garlic and has a sweet/sour flavor to it but it pours smoothly and consistently. It can be quite spicy, depending on how much you use but a little squeeze does go a long way. It is sold at any grocery store nowadays and I guarantee that you can find it in Wal-Mart. Most Asian groceries carry this bottle, usually at a cheaper price than American stores but if you can't find one, buy it through Amazon. You don't know what your taste buds are missing until you try this sauce!

review/text: This is my favorite hot sauce.  It has a rich, complex flavor, loaded with garlic and sweet hot chili peppers.  I use it on sandwiches, as a marinade for meats and for roasting root vegetables.  Try tossing cubed turnips and rutabaga in Sriracha and roast in the oven at 400F until tender.<br /><br />Warning!  This sauce is very addictive!!

review/text: And lots of heat, too, which I love. Maybe more than any other tastes. This is great on eggs, in soup, on ramen-style noodles... I haven't tried it in my morning coffee yet, but that might be good, too. The top tends to clog a bit, you might want to use a toothpick to keep it flowing or squirting. Actually this stuff is so hot it would be a good self-defense weapon if you hang out in dark alleys at night. But it's really great on food of all kinds if you enjoy heat. And I sure do. Anything would taste good with this sauce on it.

review/summary: doesn't seem to be spicy for all foods
review/text: I'm not sure why, but many things I put this on did not seem very spicy. I've only gone through 1/4 of the bottle and the only thing that actually made my mouth feel burned was when I put this on lobster. For these rest of the things there was not a burning sensation on my lips and I could dip whatever I was eating into the sauce and not need to drink water. It does add a little flavor but I found this a little odd. (I thought i became immune to the spicy feeling until I was got burned by this on lobster and the sauce from a different sriracha bottle, same brand i think)

review/summary: A Great Hot Sauce. Worthy of being a staple in any kitchen.  Almost as hot as Tabasco but with much better flavor.
review/text: This is an excellent hot sauce, quite potent, on a drop per drop basis. Beyond its considerable heat there is a subtle sweetness to it and also a vague hint of garlic. Compared to traditional hot sauces (such as Tabasco) this sauce has a superior flavor. It lacks the harsh vinegar after-taste of Tabasco and substitutes a subtle sweetness with vague garlic notes.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label) Chili, sugar, salt, garlic ... etc<br /><br />This sauce is quite potent on a drop per drop basis! Notice that "chilies" are the first (major) ingredient in the sauce. That is fairly rare among hot sauces. More often than not the first, ie, major ingredient is water.<br /><br />Be advised that the considerable heat of this sauce lingers in the mouth far longer than most. I don't know why that is -- but it is certainly a fact!<br /><br />This sauce is available in two different sizes - 17oz and 28oz. Often these two different sizes are priced less than a dollar apart.<br /><br />This sauce is widely distributed and can often be found in supermarkets --- just look for it in the Asian food isle.<br /><br />The overall favoring of this sauce is vastly superior to most other hot sauces. There is a wonderful balance of heat, sugar and garlic notes. I'd recommend this hot sauce to anyone. It is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen and is one of my top 5 choices.<br /><br />PS: If you enjoy watching cooking shows or competitions you'll often find this sauce in the background if you look carefully.

review/text: My wife decided at that last moment that she was going to put a dish together for our guest the very next day. The product was not available locally, so I went to Amazon and found every item that was needed to prepare the dish. Again, because of Amazon's shipping options I was able to receive the ingredients on time for the evening of the meal. Did I pay more, yes. Did I need as much as it came packaged, no. But it worked out because, I expected to pay more for our mistake of not having on hand the proper ingredients, plus our guess liked the meal and we were able to share the extra quantity with them, along with the receipt, so it all worked out.

review/summary: Splinters anyone?
review/text: I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns.

review/summary: DONT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT
review/text: My dog almost died from this product. The bone splinters and the company knows it. They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.

We bought the first one at Petco, Petco brand, and she loved it and eventually broke it in two (prob a month or so after having it), and she was needing a new one.  I decided to go with this one on Amazon and she LOVED it!! She spent an entire hour chewing on this just during the first sitting.  She carries it around the house with her and it is FANTASTIC because she doesn't try to chew the wall anymore (or carpet! augh!!).  Highly recommend. :)  Thanks, Amazon.

I had her to the Vet within an hour and $354.32 later learned that this Hartz "Premium" bone for "aggressive chewers" tore up her intestines.  She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz "Premium" bones for "aggressive chewers" from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog.

review/summary: Sharp Splintering
review/text: I purchased this bone at a local supermarket and gave it to my boxer. I walked in the house to literally make a cup of coffee and my dog devoured the bone. What a surprise, when the packaging clearly says: "...this long last chew satisfies your dog's instintive urge to chew." I didn't think anything about it until 2 hours later when after a walk, my dog regurgitated twice! I checked the vomit and sure enough, there was shards of the bone inside. This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, "This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering." Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not. DO NOT PURCHASE, IT IS UNSAFE.

The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his "full" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!

This stuff is THE BEST dressing I have ever tasted.  We ALWAYS get compliments every time we serve it to guests.  I haven't bought another type of dressing in years.  I use it on every salad I make, I use it in pasta and couscous salads, and also marinate chicken in it.  I have yet to find anything that is even remotely this good.  Sadly, I have not been able to find it in any store I've been to here in NJ, so I order it directly from their website and get a case probably twice a year.  You don't need much, it is so flavorful and delicious and good for you, try it!

It isn't too salty or overwhelming like a lot of other dressings, and it has the perfect combination of sour, sweet, garlic, salt, and savory.  My husband and I love it and put it on all kinds of stuff.  The unfortunate thing is that we moved to Louisiana and can't seem to find it in a grocery store...but we will order online for sure. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Highly Recommended quality porduct!
review/text: I highly recommend this product as it has an amazing taste and once you get hooked, you can't go back.  You can use it on salads, as a marinade, or as a dip for fine breads.  It's very healthy for you as well since it does not contain the junk additives that you usually find in commercial dressings and marinades.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

review/summary: We've Loved It For Years
review/text: About 10 years ago, I found this dressing in a high-end<br />grocery in New Jersey.  I brought several bottles home to Texas and when I ran out I began ordering it from the chef who created it.<br />Finally, my Krogers store got tired on me pestering them and brought it in.  It flew off the shelf so they decided to give it a permanent home.<br />Try it on angle hair coleslaw.

review/summary: Great zippy salad dressing
review/text: I first found this dressing in a top grocery store in Eugene, OR.  It's natural and very fresh tasting, with apple cider vinegar and several garlic cloves in each bottle.  It's perfect on salads or raw vegetables (especially tomatoes and cucumbers) and can also be used as a marinade. I'm so glad to see it for sale on Amazon because most grocery stores haven't caught on to this dressing yet.  It's now my favorite.

review/text: If you like vinaigrette dressing, this is the one for you. It is a tart dressing with a strong garlic flavor. There is minimal oil (5g fat/Tbspn) and the taste explodes! I can't stand sweet stuff on my salad and this fits the bill. I also love this dressing on cold spaghetti. This stuff is just great!

review/summary: Best Salad Dressing!!
review/text: I first tried Garlic Expressions when visiting my sister in Michigan.  It was the best bottled dressing I've every had!  In Michigan you can buy it at Meijers and it seems like you can now get it at most Krogers nationally but it's normally in the produce section.  I normally add a little balsamic vinegar to make it slightly less oily and more acidic.  When I want to make a greek dressing, I just add a little lemon juice.  Very versitile!  Love the huge chucks of garlic in it that will ultimately fall in your salad as you near the end of the bottle.  Like the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: The Best Dressing On The Market
review/text: This salad dressing has been a personal favorite for over ten years.  Its unique flavor is like no other, although the ingredient list is refreshingly simple.  Perhaps the wonderful taste can be attributed to top-quality ingredients.  The premium grade garlic is never pre-manufactured or dried/dehydrated like those found in other salad dressings.  Instead, prime garlic is bought from select areas, where it is then sorted, sized and qualified.  Likewise, apple cider vinegar is obtained from one Northern Ontario supplier using Northern Spy apples.  I couldn't make a better salad dressing from scratch, and wonder why Garlic Expressions isn't more readily available or popular.  It should be a household staple.

review/summary: What a nice change of pace.
review/text: A good product.  Very tasty.  It's also very spicy, despite the fact that it's labelled as being "Mild".  But unless you really can't stand spicy foods you should enjoy this product.  I couldn't taste the coconut at all, and that's the reason I picked this particular flavor but after I had cooked it all up and eaten it I wasn't disappointed much.<br />I would recommend thining this with water (maybe a cup per full jar) as it is, like I say, a bit spicy.  The thinned product also went well over a bed of rice.<br />I used this sauce with chicken and frozen 'stir-fry' veggies; sauteed and then simmered while the rice cooked.<br />This product makes a nice change from the usual lunch or dinner dishes.  I will try other Pataks flavors in the future (although I prefer Chef Shaikh's curry sauce to Pataks).

review/summary: Organic milk chocolate with a nutty surprise!
review/text: Rapunzel is a Swiss organic foods company and this chocolate is made for Rapunzel by Maestriani, a Swiss manufacturer of chocolate.  It is imported to the U.S. by Hershey.  The ingredients are all legitimately organic and at least some of them are sourced through Rapunzel's own fair trade program, Hand in Hand.<br /><br />This candy is a typical Swiss style milk chocolate except that it has hazelnuts in it.  No, not whole hazelnuts--pulverized ones that are invisible to the eye.  This is different and unexpected (the front label only says "contains tree nuts" )but it lends a subtle and pleasant flavor reminiscent of Nutella.  The quality is very good with a nice mouthfeel and flavor and it doesn't make my throat gummy.  It also has a pronounced taste of vanilla along with the cacao and hazelnut.  The claimed cocoa content is 38%.<br /><br />Each 85g/3 oz. bar is divided into 12 tablets.<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />Organic raw cane sugar, organic cocoa butter, organic whole milk powder, organic cocoa mass (100% crushed organic cocoa beans), organic hazelnuts, organic vanilla.<br /><br />Nutrition Information<br /><br />There are two servings per bar at 1.5 oz. each with 250 calories total and 160 calories from fat.

review/summary: Off-putting flavor
review/text: I like to have a jar of curry sauce in the pantry for quick suppers when I don't have time to make it from scratch.  I've been testing several brands, including Maya Kaimal.  The consistency of this sauce is a bit thin compared to most others.  I liked the packaging and the ingredients list.  However, this brand's combination of ingredients was really unpleasant.  There's some sort of sweet, off-putting tinge to this sauce.  I think a Madras simmer sauce should be rather spicy but this particular brand was not for me.  I would not purchase it again.  I've found that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB4Q8M">Seeds of Change Simmer Sce, Og, Madras, 12-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> is much tastier and can't seem to get enough of it!

review/summary: Excellent, compares to the better harissa's found in Morocco!
review/text: My husband is Moroccan and I have made efforts to recreate some of his favorite foods from home - as a result this harissa has become a #1 staple in the house, I don't know what i would do without it! When I first brought this home, he couldn't believe how good it was - he said it tasted as good as the ones from Morocco! He liked it so much that I gifted a few jars (it comes in very pretty, sturdy glass jars with gold metal lids, just as pictured) to his mom who has been here for 9 yrs - and she told me she had tried so many in the US and NONE came close to being as good as this one, it reminded her of what she would get back home. My husband likes it dabbed onto steak sandwiches; served along with roasted chicken; with lamb... I use it in bakoula (a spinach dish), and other assorted Moroccan veggie dishes I've learned to make. It goes with many things and is quite a versatile condiment, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: The best of the bold series
review/text: Almond lovers everywhere rejoiced when Blue Diamond released their "bold" series.  To be sure, all of the Bold varieties are tasty.  The zesty flavors (there are 8 "bold" varieties) of this line make for a healthy twist on an already healthy snack.  The flavors are so dominant, in fact, that one really doesn't need more than a few handfuls, hence the small packages.  A little goes a long way.  That said, I still buy this size by the six pack (I could order bigger packages, but I figure it's best not to go crazy).<br /><br />Of all the bold flavors I've sampled (and there are several I've not - not all flavors available in all areas), Habanero BBQ is the best.

review/text: These almonds make a great snack. I've been a big fan of Blue Diamond's BOLD line of almonds for quite awhile now and I would rate this flavor as my third favorite, behind Jalapeno Smokehouse and Blazin Buffalo Wing. My only real complaint is they're a little sweeter and a lot less hot than one would expect from the name but the taste is still very satisfying. My roommate tells me he doesn't even like almonds but will munch on these just for the flavor. Definitely recommended!!

review/summary: I keep inhaling these canisters
review/text: I was at the grocery store a few months ago looking for some healthy almonds--almonds and walnuts are among the healthiest foods we can eat--when I came across these, so I decided to give them a try. I was amazed at how fast I gobbled them down, thoroughly enjoying myself. I went back for another canister in less than a week! Fast forward to last month when I found this 6-pack at this ridiculous discount. Today this 6-pack I have already emptied 5 canisters in about three weeks.<br /><br />These nuts are absolutely delicious. They are as bold in taste as the label suggests--very salty and very spicy. Less specifically BBQ, though, more just zingy. The almond nuts themselves, ignoring the spice, are the perfect texture and flavor. I'm impressed, Blue Diamond apparently does a great job taste-wise at gathering and packing nuts! Seriously!<br /><br />By the way, these nuts are not very good when exposed to ambient heat and newly unsealed, as when just delivered at the door here in Arizona where I live. They are somehow less zingy and bland. I am clueless as to the science of this. Let them sit at room temperature for a day, unsealed (but with the lid on), then they become just right.

review/summary: A bit disappointing
review/text: I have become an enormous fan of the Blue Diamond line of flavored almonds (so much so that I buy them in bulk on amazon!).  This particular flavor is lacking, however.  "Habanero BBQ" should be spicy -- habanero is the hottest pepper available, after all.  Yet these are more sweet and tangy than actually spicy.  They weren't awful, but they certainly didn't live up to the excellence of some of the other flavors, like wasabi or jalapeno smokehouse. If you like the idea of a tangy bbq snack, than this might be what you're looking for.  Just don't expect it to be spicy!

review/text: These are fantastic!  When they say bold they mean it the flavor makes you tongue reach out and slap your forehead it is so darn good.  What you get is a very good BBQ flavor first then the heat of the habanero spices kick in but not too much.  These are only slightly hot when compared to what you would normally associate the word habanero.  They are so well balanced with just the right amount or BBQ flavoring, heat, and saltiness for me.  These are my overall favorite nut.

review/summary: A Clear Favorite!
review/text: Several years ago my wife and I decided that there were too many soft drinks in our diet. We had quit drinking sugar-based drinks long ago, but we were still consuming artificially-sweetened drinks. Well, they're just a chemical concoction designed to resemble a traditional soft drink and they do a pretty good job of it. Excess calories are eliminated, but we worried about the listed ingredients and the quality of the water. Are they safe? Well, most people would think so, but we had lingering doubts. We started drinking a variety of bottled waters and my wife found several that were acceptable to her.<br /><br />About a year ago, I discovered some cases of Crystal Geyser Sparkling Mineral Water at our local warehouse store. I grew to like them quite well. The bottles (18 ounces each) came in four lightly flavored varieties and were carbonated. They suited my drinking tastes quite well. A chilled bottle is crisp and refreshing. Of the four flavors, my clear favorite was the Natural Lime Flavor. Delicious! I can't seem to do without it, and now I find soft drinks to be sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: my cats love it, I like that it is good for them
review/text: So I just switched from the standard purina cat chow to this, the Purina One. I made the switch, after years of using the cat chow, because I was glad to see purina one actually uses real meat as the first ingredient, where most cat foods of the same price range have by-product, at best, and rarely any protein source used in much quantity. The cats wouldn't even wait to finish the remaining Cat Chow before they were begging for the unopened bag. When I blended the two, they were actually picking out the Purina One and leaving the cat chow! I think that says a lot about how they feel about it.

It's important to cook it according to instructions, and not a minute more. You don't have to rinse this pasta either. My kids love this pasta. Good deal on amazon.

review/text: We've tried all the brands of gf pasta we could find on the shelves locally. Everyone loves Tinkyada, but I couldn't stand the texture, the taste or the fact they do get mushy, I couldn't wait to find something closer to "real" noodles.  Then came the discovery of Bionaturae.<br /><br />They cook just like real noodles!  And ....they don't get mushy.  They reheat just as if they were freshly cooked.  The texture is perfect and that taste is excellent.  Some noodles have such a after bite, but not this brand of noodles.<br /><br />I am feeding my family of 4 with these noodles.  The 2 most important critics are my kids (3 and 7). Once we finally tried these, the kids kept asking for more.  They too love this stuff and they are tough critics to please!

review/text: Bionaturae makes makes gluten-free pasta that can pass for the standard wheat variety.  It's the best I've tried.<br /><br />I've found that it's best to cook it for about two minutes longer than the package recommendation.  Always try a test piece before you shut off the stove burner, because you've only got about a three minute window between the pasta being ready to eat and being overcooked and falling apart.

review/text: We were simply surprised by how quick it took to cook (less than the 9 minutes that was indicated on the packet) and it was delicious. What we loved about the texture was that it was still firm, but lighter compared with whole wheat pasta.  You can tell it does not taste like any of the wheat pasta, but if you were gluten intolerant then this is a great alternative.  Definately will be stocking up on this brand.  I would recommend you guy this product from a health food store before buying the bulk.  My husband who likes his whole wheat based products,really liked this brand and would consider eating this with me to avoid me having to double up on the pasta!

review/summary: Our Family Loves This Pasta
review/text: We've bought these noodles in our local store a few times, and we love them. We've used them in soups and in a mac n cheese type dish with ham and veggies. It worked great in both. Now that we know we like them, we are buying in bulk on Amazon.<br /><br />As for the noodles being sticky...that's the nature of gluten free. You need to stir them more frequently while cooking than regular noodles. The same goes with spaghetti. Once you get them cooked and in your meal they are just fine and have a great flavor and texture. No gluten free product is ever going to be exactly like it's wheat based counter part. It's just not possible. This product is really close though, and I'm grateful to have this option available. I'm a very picky eater, and I like these noodles.

review/summary: I give it 2 stars for effort.
review/text: I tried to like it and I know it's hard to make good gluten free pasta, so I gave them 2 stars for effort. But due to the sticky tacky texture, questionable nutritional value, and high price, as a pasta loving Italian-American who has been eating all kinds of pasta for over 50 years, I can tell you that if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. I'd rather just pour my home made tomato sauce over brown rice, add some veggies, maybe a few shrimp. I know that's more like a Spanish dish, but like I said, I'd rather give up pasta than have to eat this stuff.<br /><br />My full review is below. This review will not show as a verified Amazon purchase because I bought mine locally but I include photos above to prove I've tried it. But if you do choose to buy this and can't get it locally, Amazon Prime is the way to go. Check out Amazon Prime (http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime) for details on how to get Amazon Prime shipping perks for free, or ask me about it.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />> Tacky, sticky, and way too chewy. It was so chewy it stuck to my teeth. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried it at 10 minutes and it was uneatable. It was best at 12 minutes - cooked over full flame in a full rolling boil in plenty of water. Be sure to use lots of water. Unlike regular pasta, when cooking pasta made from rice or other flours you can't really get away with crowding the pot.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true pasta-like texture. As an Italian-American from NY who has been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years, this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought, and I don't think it has "true pasta-like" texture as they claim. Like I said above, sticky, chewy, tacky.<br /><br />> It felt like wet cement in my stomach. I'm not exaggerating. It made me painfully constipated.<br /><br />> Since it is not made from whole grain brown rice, it's white, I feel it's not really that healthy for you. It's not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so I wouldn't take away stars due to this. I just don't think people should eat white rice or products made out of white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead.<br /><br />> It's made from rice, potato, and soy. The Potato is white, just like the rice. And soy, well more and more we're finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you. For centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning, it's only in modern times food manufacturer's are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can. I feel the combination of white rice, white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But as I've mentioned in some other reviews, poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it. Sorry if that sounds crude, but I think it really goes make a good point.<br /><br />> It is expensive, but if you have already tried this and like it and can't get it locally, then Amazon Prime is the way to go. Ask me how to get Amazon Prime free shipping perks. But I don't see it being worth the price.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />> Organic<br /><br />> Gluten Free<br /><br />> Kosher (circle K symbol)<br /><br />> Produced at a dedicated gluten free facility with no risk of cross contamination with dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, or eggs.<br /><br />> The manufacturer is one of a select few in Italy who are authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health to produce gluten free pasta. The factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle. Independent testing is also done at a laboratory in the United States on each lot before the products are distributed in this country.<br /><br />> The actual taste is a little like regular pasta. But I'm being generous saying this since the texture was so bad I couldn't finish more than a few fork fulls.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: (same as all of their pastas)<br /><br />Organic Rice Flour, Organic Rice Starch, Organic Potato Starch, Organic Soy Flour (and water is used)<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />COMPANY INFORMATION:<br /><br />Euro-USA Trading Co., Inc.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.

review/summary: Does the job
review/text: I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling. The only thing I don't like is that on the shelf it smells like vomit. It grosses me out. It doesn't smell like that when it's brewed.

review/summary: Fish tea
review/text: I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better.

review/summary: This is the foulest Tea ever
review/text: These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.
