review/summary: Very mild, choc/vanilla almost chi tea (mild hot cocoa w/stevia & milk)
review/text: First off, to understand my palate, I, growing up, until I became an adult, LIVED on candy. To lose weight, I still ate processed low-fat food. It wasn't until 10 years ago, I was told how evil processed food was & how it effects the body & finally re-developed a taste for natural foods/herbs. I stopped fast food, dairy, artificial anything, then even all foods that contain table sugar. I still have a killer sweet tooth like any kid & the only thing that helps me stay good is my IBS.<br />On that note, I dislike tea & coffee, but like hot cocoa & loved Chai tea w/healthy dose of milk/sugar from years past, so gave this a shot.<br />I seeped the tea for the full 5 min., even squeezing the bag w/my spoon during & using I think 7 oz. of water (which I think maybe too much & 5 oz. is probably best). Without adding anything, this tasted pleasant, but very mild & watery. I could taste the chocolate & vanilla faintly when I concentrated, but nothing sharp, no taste of strong spices either, which was a letdown as I love nutmeg & cinnamon.<br />I added only MOST of a packet of Sweetleaf (non-artificial Stevia leaf) & it really helped bring out the chocolate & vanilla to give it a more robust, admitting also nicely sweetened taste. Even with my sweet tooth & dislike of tea, I would have been overall happy with this.<br />I added 1 tablespoon of 2% milk (non-organic unfortunately, nor any soy milk in the house) to the stevia sweetened tea & it's got a nice full body taste. It tastes like a thinner, lightly sweetened hot cocoa & instead of slowly sipping, I gulped it down happily.<br />I tried using only 1 tbsp of milk & no stevia, but if had to choose, stevia brought out the flavor more.<br />I tried adding a slight tap of cinnamon & nutmeg to the tea, but even with the milk, it overpower the tea blend.

review/summary: Not bad; flavor is subtle
review/text: I usually like to drink tea (and coffee) straight-up, and while this had a good strong tea flavor, the chocolate and spices were barely there.  After reading other reviews, I tried steeping for only 4 minutes and adding a splash of milk, which improved the overall flavor, but again it tasted like tea with a sweet-spicy scent, not "chocolate-flavored" tea.

review/summary: Chocolate Relaxation
review/text: I've tried both the Numi "Chocolate Puerh" and "Magnolia Puerh" teas.  Both are excellent quality.  The flavors are distinct, not overpowering, and enjoyable.<br /><br />These teas are enjoyable with just a touch of agave to sweeten the cup.  The flavor is pleasant without any need to be enhanced or covered up by anything else.  A touch of lemon juice also works well.  And a dash of vitamin C can be used in harmony with this tea.<br /><br />I do agree with the instructions to not let it steep too long, in fact a good full flavor is obtained at the low end of their recommended steeping times.<br /><br />I like what they have written on the box about being high quality and healthy.  It is nice to not find "artificial flavors" added.  This company appears to really care about producing a good product and protecting the environment.

review/summary: Medium Strength Tea with Great Mix of Flavors
review/text: I have a group of teas that I alternate between depending upon my mood. This tea fills a void I didn't realize exists in my favorites -- chocolate tea. This is a medium body tea -- not weak and not strong. It has absolutely no harsh bitter aftertaste and I brewed it at different time intervals, and no bitterness appeared. I followed the package recommendations to steep for 3-5 minutes, and ignored the boiling water directions and just used very hot water to steep the bag. At three minutes it was a bit too weak, but it seemed just right at five minutes. I left the bag in the cup and let the tea cool down to see if it would become too strong or lose its smoothness as it cooled -- it did neither. The results seemed to hold firm at the five minute mark. I often use tea in cooking but this tea would not work for that purpose -- it isn't strong enough to impart flavor as an ingredient in other dishes. The tea is organic and Kosher, and 1% of sales benefit social, environmental and sustainable causes.<br /><br />There is a lovely pronounced chocolate flavor in the background that oddly enough works perfectly with the black tea. There are much milder hints of cinnamon, orange and nutmeg that also help to create the tea's special blend. And, although the chocolate isn't strong enough to cause me to skip dessert, it might do in a pinch. I will definitely add this tea to my list of favorites -- it is that good. And, I would definitely curl up with a cup of Chocolate Puerh to sip and savor on a rainy day.

review/summary: Yummy Numi!
review/text: This Numi Chocolate Puerh tea is truly original, at least for me. I have never had a cocoa infused tea before and certainly nothing as rich as this tea. I'm eager to try other flavors after tasting this one.<br /><br />The tea is smoother and fuller bodied than the average tea, a bit more like coffee, but still a tad lighter. It has a very chocolate/cinnamon flavor much like a gourmet dark chocolate bar.<br /><br />There is also the claim that this tea is good for you. I certainly can't attest to being healthier after drinking it, but the flavor is wonderful so I will continue to enjoy it and hope for additional health benefits.<br /><br />Unique, organic, and tasty, with cool environmentally sound packaging, too. Highly recommended!

If quality control is so inconsistent, I guess I wouldn't take a chance again.  I guess either something went wrong in the recipe, or in the filling of the tea bags at the factory, or maybe it was stored too long in the wrong conditions, because the product was really weak.  Too bad.

review/text: Numi Organic Chocolate Pureh makes a nice cup of tea and it is good to know organic methods were employed in its production. There is not much chocolate or vanilla flavor, it has a sort of a non-descript brown herbal mugginess. I tried putting milk in it because that is how I enjoy black tea, but it was not a good fit. Maybe sugar would give it some zing, but I don't want to start putting sugar in my tea.

review/text: You would never know this was a tea from the taste -- it tastes like the world's thinnest water-based hot chocolate.  This might be a good choice if you want the taste of chocolate without a lot of calories.  But there is no way to tell how many calories, or how much caffeine, since there is no nutrition label.  All in all, there is not much reason to drink this beverage.

review/summary: Really Weak Tea made me Really Nauseous
review/text: I tried this Numi Chocolate Puerh tea four times and was disappointed and left with a very upset stomach. I used a big mug and the taste was barely detectable, it did however have a pleasant aroma of cinnamon with an ever so slight scent of vanilla. I then tried it in a smaller cup with the same results, barely any taste to it. I then tried it in a tiny 6 oz tea cup and it still really had no flavor other then a slight taste of cinnamon in hot water. Very weak tea with awful side effects of extreme nausea. Not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else, maybe the cinnamon. I can't recommend this on any level, it is weak and tasteless with awful side effects at least for me.  I love plain Rooibos and I will stick to that.

review/text: My wife and I both love this Tea! She is the more picky about her tea, between the 2 of us. If she likes it than it must really be good since she has tried a great many different kinds and can be considered a connoisseur.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to drink my teas plain with no sugar or other additions. This tea tastes great plain. The very subtle chocolatey aftertaste is very pleasant. I tried adding just a bit of sugar, as an experiment, and it's still quite good that way too.<br /><br />Based on my experience, I find the Numi Organic Tea to be of high quality and can definately recommend it to tea drinkers everywhere.

review/text: I don't eat many prepared foods, so I rarely have quick options on hand when I need them.  Enter this chili.  I got a great deal with subscribe and save, and made the commitment of 12 cans, having never tried this product.  When I finally did, I found it good but bland.  I threw it in a saucepan with a little extra water, tomato paste, and three different kinds of chiles.  I like a LOT more spice and flavor in my chili and I didn't mind adding to my preferences.  That aside, you can tell the ingredients are good quality and healthy, which makes the taste adjustment worthwhile to me.  It's a good pantry staple and I'll eventually eat them all, but will then probably try something new.  I'd LOVE a really, really hot variety.

review/text: Most folks here in the Pacific Northwest prefer extra dark espresso roasts, but I love the mild, non-acidic, medium roasts served in the German and Austrian restaurants I frequented while traveling on business in the 1980s. I've tried just about every medium roast on the market, particularly after Safeway stopped carrying Dallmayr a year or so ago, but everything tastes bitter in comparison. Dallmayr is also very finely ground, which is important good coffee from drip coffee makers. I'd buy the larger 17-ounce size (a 30 cents per serving savings, I believe) but the 8.8 ounce fits perfectly in my special coffee tin.

review/summary: Doesn't taste right to me
review/text: I bought a small package from a local store because it was sitting with all the other luxury coffees like Kona or Blue Mountain, but for a quarter of the cost.  I hope I don't make that mistake again. I use a french press to make my coffee and my favorite coffees come from Kenya, Ethiopia and Hawaii.<br /><br /> Maybe I got a bad batch, maybe I am doing something wrong, or my tastes are different, but this coffee tasted weak and lifeless. Thinking I just made it too weak, I used more coffee the next time.  I got some of the flavor I was looking for but it was overpowered by an acidic flavor.  So I cut it with milk and it improved, but it still just doesn't taste how I think a fine coffee should.  I shouldn't have to go through all that to get a drinkable cuppa joe. Yes this coffee is not very bitter, but removing an entire element of flavor from this coffee just ruined it.  I like very dark chocolate because of all the different interesting flavors, fruity, spicy, sweet, and it's slightly bitter- but in a good way.  That is how coffee should be.  This coffee is like milk chocolate. It is overly simple, hardly bitter and some people are bound to like it that way.  To me, it lacks the flavor I look for.

review/summary: Not my favorite coffee.
review/text: I recently tried Dallmayr prodomo. I typically like German coffee (Jacobs, Tchibo, even Aldi "German Roast") but something seems "off" on this Dallmayr. Black with just a bit of Splenda results in an odd, possibly acidic, taste that's hard to describe. Adding a bit of Half and Half which seems to make it taste more like "regular" coffee, but I don't normally do that with any of the other coffees I drink. I bought the coffee locally, and it was more than year from its freshness date, so I'm just going to avoid this variety in the future.

review/summary: Good Salmon
review/text: Not everyone has the same expectations for smoked fish.  Some people prefer it smoked to a crisp; other people prefer smoked fish that is nearly raw.  The folks at Seabear seem to have found a good, in between, place.<br /><br />I've used this product several times and have always enjoyed it.  The salmon is smokey and flavorful, flakey, firm, and tasty.  The salmon ships in foils pouches, each containing a couple of ounces of salmon oil.  You can pour it down the drain if you prefer a drier fish (but that's a lot of good omega-3 fatty acids to waste).  Used in salmon pasta with a little olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and a little black pepper (let it sit over night in the fridge for the flavors to mix) it is a summer favorite.  If you like your smoked salmon moderately moist, yet firm, Seabear is a good choice.

review/text: I have this product delivered to my Dad every two months.  He loves it!  He has tried to find it or something similar on the open market in Los Angeles, and just unable to find the same prime quality.  Once he mailed me the packaging.  I thought he was sharing.  NOT!  He wanted me to see how nicely the product was packaged!  I'm glad I finally found something that he really looks forward to receiving.

review/text: Since moving to the Northwest, we wanted gifts for friends and families that reflect our new lifestyle.  The trio of smoked salmon is perfect.  I keep some around for visitors also.  It doesn't have to be refrigerated, the salmon is very good, and the 3 pack makes it great for a couple of visitors or open more than one box for a crowd.  Put out some cream cheese, crackers and the fish and you are the best hostess in town.  Be sure to pat the fish with paper towels before serving or it is very wet.

review/text: Many people, trying to be and sound more sophisticated, substitute the words "smoked salmon" for the word "lox".  Having eaten the "SEA BEAR SMOKED SALMON TRIO", herein being reviewed, (and the literature that comes with it), I have learnt that, whilst all "lox" IS smoked salmon, not all "smoked salmon" is lox. (SeaBear DOES offer a nice, large package of "lox"....and calls it "lox", and illustrates it, in the advertising flyer that comes with the "Smoked Salmon Trio").  But the fish within the "Smoked Salmon Trio" is NOT "lox". The fish here is dryish, and very salty.  "Lox", on the other hand, must go through additional preparation, for it is far more moist than the dryish fish within the "Smoked Salmon Trio".  I have seen, (in the "Cabelas" catalogue), "Lox" described as 'buttery'....which it truly is.  For those who are interested, "Lox" also is usually certified kosher -- whilst the fish within the "Smoked Salmon Trio" is not.<br /><br />The smoked salmon within the "Smoked Salmon Trio", is, as I have said, very dry and salty.  However, all bones have been removed, (although the skin remains).  This fish also will keep on a shelf!  It need NOT be refrigerated until opened.<br /><br />The three types of smoked salmon within have very little taste variation to me.  Yes, there is a TINY bit of difference....but not enough to excite my taste buds.  And salmon -- right from cans, especially the top brands and varieties -- right from the supermarket or on Amazon, taste almost the same to me, at a far lesser price.<br /><br />The literature that comes with this set of three smoked salmon varieties is interesting and informative, as is the history of "SeaBear" foods, which is also given.  This company obviously takes great pride in providing good salmon and other products to its customers, and strives to be the best it can be.  I would advise them, however, to emphasize, even more, the difference between "smoked salmon" and "lox" in ALL its literature, and in the package description of ALL its products. Knowing whether "Dry" smoked<br />salmon, or "buttery", or "lox"-type smoked salmon, is in a package, would be a great help to those who, like me, sometimes get their syntax and meanings confused, betwixt the two.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  Will NOT Buy This Product Again.  (But hopefully, the "Lox" they sell will be available in smaller quantities! : ),

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: This is far too overpriced, you get three small filets that have a terrible smell to them, almost like day old tuna.  It works out to about 12 dollars for a 6 oz salmon filet that really isn't even good. You can get it fresh, minus the horrible smell and not already precooked.  To be perfectly honest, a can of bumblebee tuna would be better than this and it would cost you 35 less dollars, I only purchased it by mistake and the seller immediately hit the shipping soon button and would not stop shipment even after request.  Worst transaction I've had on Amazon to date.<br /><br />I couldn't even stomach to taste it, that's how bad the smell was, huge waste of money, just go to the store and get a filet yourself, cheaper and better quality.

review/summary: Too Delicious...Wait for Amazon Sale!
review/text: The normal price for these chips is just too high to justify on a regular basis, so it is one of the many items I have on my shopping list so I can keep track of prices and scope out when it goes on sale. I got lucky on these recently, at about half off, during the warehouse sale for the box of 12 so I jumped on it.<br /><br />These blue chips, not dyed, just made from Blue potatoes, are such a treat. They are crisper and somehow heartier than your normal chip and, like almost all Terra Chips, are just deliciously made.<br /><br />I've grown blue potatoes in my garden. They tend to be much smaller so the chips also are smaller. You certainly don't need nearly as many to get your salty crisp fix than you do of your regular chip.<br /><br />These arrived double boxed and in perfect shape. New chips with expiration date the same as the chips in the store so not an issue there. It may seem strange buying groceries at Amazon, but I had to say, this was convenient, smartly priced and well worth it!

review/text: I have this product on Subscribe & Save which makes it the most economical organic coffee I know of that also tastes good. It does tend to brew light (I have the typical drip coffee maker) and I noticed that if I grind it a little too finely it can have a bitter edge, but that might be more a user issue than a coffee bean issue. I love the aroma of a freshly opened bag. Taster's notes say "citrus & butterscotch" and I have to agree because, without reading that, I noticed caramel-y notes on my first sip. It also says the coffee is "bright & balanced". I've gone through several bags and the taste and character is consistent.<br /><br />I am still looking for a Fair Trade (possibly locally sourced? might be asking for too much in the coffee industry), Organically Grown coffee that has consistent, exceptional taste, and I am still open to suggestions. In the meantime, however, I am very happy with my current Pick (pardon the pun!).

review/text: This isn't the best coffee I've ever had, but for sitting on an Amazon shelf for who knows how long, and then being shipped out to the consumer at a sum cost of $16-$20/30 oz, it's an amazing coffee.  Definitely a French roast, but not a burnt French roast; it doesn't taste like the roast is hiding anything in the beans.  It drip brews up full bodied, smooth and rich - exactly what an every day breakfast blend should be.  The organic label is a bonus, but it's not the reason I buy this.

Finally last year I got a Gift Pack containing 1 jar each of Dinni's Spicy Shrimp Sauce, Honey Mustard and Italian Herb Vinaigrette. All these products made a believer out of me. These is no difference that I could tell in Shrimp I cooked with Dinni's Spicy Shrimp Sauce and the one I eat at Bonefish. Amongst the 3 product each one was better than the other.<br /><br />I have ordered several times since then from Amazon. There are some products Amazon does not carry, which I buy from Dinni's website, and always the company includes a free jar as repeat customer appreciation. The free stuff is not mentioned on Dinni's site hence I was surprised the first time. Every product I have tasted is simply Amazing. I don't understand why Amazon does not carry all of them.<br /><br />We throw several parties every year. I always wanted to serve the Bonefish  Bang Bang Shrimp, but it is not practical, so I started searching the web to find a exact recipe, the first one I tried was the one which had lots of good reviews, it called for; Mayonnaise, Thai Sweet & Hot Chili Sauce. After 3 hours shopping and trying to purchase hard to find ingredients and another hour in the kitchen, the result was very disappointing. The shrimp turned out to be miles apart from Bonefish's Shrimp. Don't get me wrong the shrimp was OK if you are not looking for the Bonefish Taste, but defiantly it was not a knockoff.

They sent me a free bottle of an Italian marinade that is yummy too!

review/summary: As close to Bone Fish Bang Bang as you can get
review/text: My husband and I are Bone Fish Bang Bang Shrimp nuts!  We order it often.  I am a recipe hound and am always looking for copy cat recipes and this is it.  I read up on one of the recipe sites about this sauce being as close as you can get to the real thing.  Of course Bone Fish will not give out its recipe, however this is close.  There is a recipe on line that is pretty close and then we toss this sauce...delicious.  Great product!  The sauce is great on other items as well.  FYI its got a kick.

review/summary: Tasty Horchata Beverage
review/text: I think this horchata is just as tasty as ones I've had in mexican restaurants.  The nice thing about this product is that it lacks hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, and dairy products which I have found in some powder mixes and concentrates. It's a little sweeter than I thought it would be, but normally my horchata from restaurants has ice so maybe I'm used to a more dilute flavor.  Adding a bit of water helped cut the sweetness and allows me to extend my yummy horchata a little further.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product are: Filtered Water, Brown Rice (Partially Milled), Dehydrated Cane Juice, Expeller Pressed High Oleic Safflower Oil, and/or Canola Oil, Rice Flour, Natural Flavors, Spice, Carageenan.<br /><br />An 8 oz serving contains 160 calories, 25 calories from fat.  4 Servings per Container.  Total Fat 2.5g (4% RDA), Saturated Fat 0g, Trans Fat 0g, Polyunsaturated Fat 2g, Monounsaturated Fat 0.5g, Cholesterol 0g, Sodium 5mg (0% RDA), 80mg Potassium (2% RDA), Total Carbohydrate 32g (11%RDA), Sugars 18g, Protein 1g, 4% RDA Calcium, 2% RDA Iron.<br /><br />FYI, the packaging indicates that this product should not be used as an infant formula and to consult your child's doctor for use with children under age 5.<br /><br />I have found this drink at my Whole Foods Market if you are interested in trying it before buying 6 boxes.  It was 2. 69, so only a bit more expensive than Amazon.

review/text: I have tried both of the other Rice Dream flavors, vanilla and original. This one came in the 32 ounce size so I thought I would give it a try. It makes a high fiber bowl of cereal a taste treat. It's a mild cinnamon taste. It's like the difference between oatmeal plain and oatmeal with cinnamon. And thanks to it being lactose free, no bloating and no tummy troubles.

review/summary: I love this stuff
review/text: I keep ordering this and draining the boxes one after the other until I have none. This will be my fourth order and it absolutely won't be my last. Keep this cold in the back of the fridge and add some ice... so good. That said, sometimes I don't even bother with a glass, let alone ice. Other times I thin it with some water to extend the goodness.<br /><br />It tastes creamy, but the texture is thin. It's sweet, but not too sweet to drink down like it were water. The only problem here is that I have no desire to moderate my consumption of this stuff. I want it to come in gallon containers and I want to treat it as a replacement for water. Of course, at 32 ounces per each of the six containers, that gets costly. It's also good mixed with coke for a Pepsi and Milk replacement (no, really.)

review/summary: Better than orange juice, Coca Cola and Mountain Dew combined
review/text: Better than orange juice, Coca Cola and Mountain Dew combined (not together, just of any other drink I've had since milk as a kid).<br /><br />I decided to cut back dairy, bread and red meat for my 80 something Mom and I (including store pizza, cheese and such).  I've been ordering boxes of aseptic Soy and Almond milks looking for some good flavor, variation and low price; combining flavors with soy and whey proteins in a blender for a daily protein shake as a nutritional supplement - as recommended for her by her doctor.<br /><br />(The protein has helped my senior Mom recover badly needed lower body strength, and actually our high blood pressure problems have disappeared. She is mentally sharper.)<br /><br />...<br /><br />Looking at prices and availability through my Amazon prime account the horchata sounded interesting enough to try - Amazon prime because I don't think I would want any grocery goods shipping more than a day or so. In fact I prefer to order up when a product is temporarily out of stock so that there is a better chance it has not been sitting in their warehouse very long.<br /><br />While all of the flavors of other products have been ok; even great when combined and mixed with other flavors (bananas, yogurt, (mint)-chocolate, misc. fruits and flavors) the horchata is delicious right out of the box - the delivered case had a ruptured box leaking into the shipping box (and delivery truck) and I drank a glass poured off straight - yea, I'm kinda gross sometimes.<br /><br />It was like the long ago taste of cinnamon toast without the toast (and loads of added sugar and butter).<br /><br />So I use the horchata alone for some of the soy and whey protein shakes (with a little Guar gum to thicken it maybe) and no ice needed with the boxes in the fridge.<br /><br />It makes up a little for pizzas and stuff. I think this is the start of something special...

I loved it so much I searched online and found this.  The first couple of boxes were excellent.  I have 1 open container in the fridge now.  I went to have some and it seems as though it fermented or just plain went bad.  I looked on the container and the best by date says  May 2011.  I have like 2 containers left, not open.  I'm afraid to try them.

The more easily found Kern's, while tasty too, has more sweetener (corn syrup, yuck) as well as artificial flavors and has to be kept refrigerated even before you open it, unlike this product. This is healthier, tastes better and so dang cool to have delivered to the door. Yay Rice Dream!

review/summary: Not Crazy About It
review/text: I'm not crazy about this product. It's nowhere near as good as the horchata I get at my favorite Mexican restaurants. I think it lacks flavor; it definitely needs more cinnamon. Also, it's quite sweet. It should be poured over a large glass of ice to water it down. I still do enjoy this product somewhat, especially after adding more cinnamon. It's just not ideal, especially because the extra cinnamon doesn't incorporate well. I think I'm going to try blending it with ice and extra cinnamon to see how it turns out.

review/text: I decided to try and find a horchata that tasted like the kind I'd drink when growing up in San Diego. So far, this has been the furthest from it. This product has a chalky, almost dry taste to it. It's not awful, but not the taste I was expecting. There is an aftertaste that seems like flour or some other similar flavor. Obviously, liking the flavor is subjective, but I will not be purchasing this brand again. When Amazon has it in stock, the Klass brand horchata is my preference so far.

review/text: To begin with, I am no expert in the field, and I have pretty limited range of experience. That being said, I love Glenmorangie Original. It has wonderful aroma and complex flavors. I don't know all the proper lingo, I'm afraid, but it has sweetness and smokiness and a little citrus, maybe? It is light and not peaty. The finish is long and lovely. When you roll this whiskey around your mouth a bit, the "mouth feel" is very rich and pleasant. This is a far more complex drink than American or Canadian whiskeys and a bit richer than Glenlivet, the Scotch I met first.

review/summary: Top of the Line K-Cup
review/text: I really love this k-cup.  It is my second favorite regular coffee K-cup (at this time), second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW">Barista Prima House Blend</a>.  I agree with their text that states a more complex flavor.  The claim is that this is a premium line for those who expect a premium coffee more like a coffee shop.  I tend to agree, except you just don't get as much per cup.  I love the colombian blend flavor as variety to mix in between the house blend, which I absolutely love most.  The house blend is a very blended flavor without one note overpowering the others.  For a change, I like the stronger note that the colombia blend offers.  Both match my preference for medium or medium-dark house blend roasts from coffee shops, but not the very dark roast of Starbucks.  I really feel this is a complex blend that has well more than one note, but a slightly stronger note associate with colombia blends.  Most importantly, it doesn't taste burnt like a dark french roast.<br /><br />I have tried so many K-cup flavors, most of which I liked at varied degrees with a few exceptions, but this one is currently my second favorite (second to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW">Barista Prima House Blend</a> in the same variety).  What is nice about K-cups is you can easy switch blends per cup or over time without having to exhaust a whole bag of beans or grounds before moving on.  And preferences change as you have the same day in and day out.  So I can say that at present, I love it over previous favorites (of non-flavored) which in descending order of current preference are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGPK">Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Dark Magic</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IO37Y">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1GFN2">Caribou</a>, and a number of other decent ones.  I am just saying I prefer this over those right now.  But I will still have the others for variety.  Within this variety, I really like the house blend best.  But I prefer variety and usually have House Blend in the morning, and a Colombia blend in the afternoon.  On more rare occasions, I'll have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Italian Roast</a> when I feel like a dark french roast with very strong flavor.<br /><br />The Barista Prima tends to be more expensive, and depending on the sale price, can be only a little more expensive than other varieties.  For a little bit more, it is worth it to me.  For a lot more, maybe not.  Paying about 12% more yields about 30% more in value in flavor to me.  But paying 50% more is costly when there other flavors are plenty good too.

If I have the choice I usually prefer to make my coffee with a French press, but I must admit that the flavor of this K-cup variety comes much closer to good press coffee than I would have thought possible. The Barista Prima K-cups tend to run slightly more expensive than other garden-variety ones, but the coffee is so much better that it's definitely worth the premium.

review/text: I like a good Colombian coffee, so I thought I'd give these k-cups a try. The coffee is good, but not great. I normally brew the 8oz cup size and the result was a fairly weak cup of coffee. They should have made this an "extra bold" product with a little more coffee grounds in it.<br /><br />The flavor and balance is good, but I expect just a little bit more bite in a Colombian blend. I don't especially think these k-cups are worth the extra cost. So while I'll be happy to finish drinking them in the 6oz brew, I won't buy them again.<br /><br />I would have given then 3.5 stars if I could and would go to four if they made this in extra bold.

I'm used to very strong coffee, so I brew 2 k-cups on the small cup setting into to my large mug. Awesome, but kind of pricey. I just reported to Amazon that this is WAY cheaper at Target. It's on sale right now for $13.99 for 18 cups but even the regular price is only $14.99. The price I'm seeing today on Amazon is $20.35. Ouch!

They are also very easy to break into small pieces with your hands if you're using them for training.  They actually smell good, like beef jerky.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty dog treat made in the USA
review/text: Our Bichon likes all the Zuke treats we've given him and he's been eating them for a few years.  However, he loves these chicken Z-filets!  We break up the filets since he's a small dog and they're high protein as well.  They're natural and made in the USA.  I've looked through Petsmart several times looking for made in the USA, natural, good-for-dog treats and the selection is very small.  So Zuke's is a great find.

review/summary: GREAT TREATS
review/text: I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again.

review/summary: If this was an animal, wolves would exclusively hunt it.
review/text: Upon sniffing this treat, I've had dogs compulsively sit before me, wide-eyed and hopeful.  Even torn into impossibly tiny shreds (easily done with its maleable yet resilient texture), these morsels are gobbled up.  I had a dog actually excited over getting to eat the few crumbs left in my treat pouch which I fished out after the treats were gone.  I can't imagine the glee an entire one of these gigantic treats would induce.  So far, I've fed these in strips.  They're large; a palm-sized flat piece of jerky.  It has a softer texture than jerky; it's maleable, not easily crumbling or mushing together in a treat pouch, yet torn apart effortlessly by a human or canine.  They're perfectly chewy yet not moist, so they don't dirty your hands or surfaces.  They smell *FABULOUS*.  They're like a nicely seasoned steak.<br /><br />I use these for scenting/tracking (wonderfully effective and motivating), high-focus training, breaking bad habits and filling puzzle toys.  They're a little more expensive, but they last a lot longer if you remember to feed like a filet mignon, not like a Milkbone.  Also, if you subscribe to "treat value level" theory, having a few of these on hand during training is a lot easier "ace in the hole" than messy hot dogs, cheese or freeze-dried liver.  They're a high-value treat that's easy to store & carry.<br /><br />Four paws up.  (yes, they're defying gravity for these treats!)

review/summary: chicken treats for dogs
review/text: My dog loves them, but I originally bought them because I wanted to switch over from the jerkey treats out of China.  For clarification these treats aren't jerkey....my dog gobbles them in about 1.5 seconds but she is greatful.  The best part about them is they are made in the USA so no worries about poisining.  The cons are they are EXPENSIVE for what you get.  But I guess anything in the US is going to be more expensive than China.  I'd rather support local than China anyday!!!!!
