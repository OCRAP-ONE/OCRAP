review/summary: Greasy but tasty beef sticks
review/text: These beef sticks are greasy, decently salty, and have a nice texture. Overall I think they're good, but they're insanely unhealthy. They're full of saturated fat, cholesterol and salt. Each stick is about 110 calories too, and each package I received has 9 sticks. This is not diet food; it's definitely a junk snack. Quality beef jerky, which this is not, is very low in fat. I think I'll stick with jerky in the future, but these were fairly tasty.<br /><br />My cat seemed very intrigued by the smell of these beef sticks. She won't eat any kind of human food (even meat), but she actually ate a piece of these and liked it. That got me slightly worried so I think I won't be ordering any more of these.

This company is aware of the stigma behind products made in china but they're not going to bring their manufacturing to the US until consumers care enough about their dogs to stop buying this product.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March.

review/summary: great treats
review/text: I had been buying at a store, but they had a hard time keeping them in stock...My dogs were already hooked on the treats so I thought maybe I'd try from online.  The sticks at the store were half the amount for about the same price.  The only difference was the size of the ind. sticks.  They were used to the longer sticks, but have easily adjusted to the lesser size.  They are just Yorkies so the smaller size is probably all they need anyway.  Of course, Yorkies are known for the bad knee joints so this is a good way to give them a daily dose of gluco-condroin.  I do wish they would put the dosage amount per lb. so I would know if they are getting the recommended dosage for weight and age.  The only concern I have is these are made in China.  I just don't trust the sanitary conditions and effort to control the product ingredient safety issues.

review/summary: Dan's Perfect Popcorn
review/text: Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.

review/summary: Great Theater-like Popcorn
review/text: This is the best popcorn I have ever bought, outdoes Orville Redenbacker's popcorn in size and taste.  It is also the cheapest at approx. $1.20/lb.  It pops up really well in the microwave (avoid all plastic microwave containers). I use a 3 qt glass bowl with a glass plate on top as a lid.  It fits loosely enough so that when I overfill it with popcorn, the popcorn can lift up the lid easily and let excess gas escape.  Most popcorn is pressure-sensitive so that if there is too much popcorn in a bowl to pop, some kernels will not pop.  Almost every kernel pops when I microwave on high in a 1500 watt microwave oven for about 5 1/2 min (about 1 1/2 TBLSP popcorn) and no added oil.  In fact when I popped about 8 bowls of the popcorn (had to cool off bowl each time to avoid overheating the microwave and burning popped pieces), I found about 5 unpopped kernels in the bottom of the large paper bag.<br /><br />This popcorn outdoes all of the microwavable popcorn brands that you will see in the grocery stores since you are not popping them in teflon/PfoA lined paper bags which will leach out dangerous chemicals (PfoA) into your popcorn with the heat necessary to pop the corn.  If you try to use a lower heat on your microwave you will get progressively more unpopped kernels.  Microwave is better than the hot air corn-poppers since it doesn't cool down kernels in between the pulses of hot air that corn poppers do.  I watch the timer as it counts down and start to note when I hear a pop as the popping slows down.  When I do not hear a pop for 12 sec, it is time to pull the bowl out of the hot microwave. Thus the time to pop a bowl of popcorn will vary from 5.3-5.7 min when starting with a cold bowl and lid.

review/summary: Bye Bye WAY overpriced Supermarket Corn!
review/text: I regularly pop corn in a wok with canola oil.  Nothing fancy, pops like a charm.  My local supermarket chain (VONS) used to sell those old plastic bags of corn for like $2.  You know -- those old fashioned bags that just sit there while everyone else buys all the microwave garbage.<br /><br />Well VONS slowly marked up these bags to about $3 over the years.  Then one day they were all GONE.  Replaced with Orville Reddenschmucker like 'jugs' of unpopped corn.  Just under two pounds of corn for --- WAIT FOR IT -- $5.<br /><br />I have to pay MORE money and get more container but LESS corn?!?  I don't THINK so...<br /><br />So I start surfing the web.  My God -- some site was willing to sell me a 50 pound bag for like $18.  My cheapness grinned ear to ear.  Then I saw the shipping charge --- WAIT FOR IT -- $43.  Yeah... no...<br /><br />So then I see this brand at Amazon.  12.5 pounds for $17.  Shipping?  FREE.  And I don't have to store 50 pounds!<br /><br />Just over a dollar a pound instead of twice as much?  SOLD.<br /><br />Now it's home.  Just made a batch.  I'm not a gourmet -- it's frickin' popcorn, okay?  To me, it's either a pass or a fail.  Better than Von's, the same, or unacceptable.  It's either better or the same as Von's -- I can't tell.  It seemed to pop bigger, but I'm not sure the bigger popping translates to better taste.<br /><br />Why are you still reading this?  Just order it already.<br /><br />;-)

review/summary: Bulk Bag of Stale Paragon Popcorn
review/text: I ordered the bulk 12.5 lb bag of Paragon popcorn on August 12, 2011, thinking that it was reasonable priced and would go well with the microwave popper and the air popper I was also ordering from Amazon.  Some Reviewers had noted that what they had received was stale;  they were right, the popcorn tasted alfully funny and barely popped in the microwave popper, at least a third of what I had cooked were unpopped duds.  In the air popper, I did get better results, but still had a lot of partially popped kernels (aka, "tooth breakers" as I had to be extreemly careful at the bottom of the bowl).<br /><br />I was going to try making a batch tonight, I noticed a dark kernel in the mix;  it had mold on it.  Some of the other kernels look suspecious, too;  my overall impression of the cooked corn, and the weathered plastic bag the entire 12.5 lb batch came in, is that it's completly stale and too old to use.<br /><br />I expect 12.5 lb bags of corn are not selling that fast, and are getting stale in the warehouse.  Anyone who wants a decent bag of popping corn would be better off just picking-up a bag at the grocery store;  at least those bags are freshness-labeled with a date, this Paragon corn was complely undated and no telling how old it was.  Terrible!!<br /><br />**UPDATE** 11-OCT-2011  - I tossed all the stale Paragon corn last week in the trash, decided it wasn't worth dealing with if it was moldy, stale, and wouldn't completly pop.  Last weekend, I tried a new *freshness dated* bag of Kroger yellow popping corn in my new air popper;  that did perfect, there were about 5 unpopped kernels remaining (compared to the over two dozen unpopped kernnels from the Paragon corn).  No more unsealed food products from Amazon for me after this experience.

review/text: Our family makes popcorn on an almost daily basis, so paying $4.99  for a 1 1/2LB bottle of popcorn kernels feels like highway robbery. The Paragon 12 1/2 LB bag is a much better bargain (especially if you already pay for prime shipping). The kernels pop up very well, have a good fresh corn taste, and after one month- still no stale taste or increase in unpopped hulls. You may want to store the opened bag in an airtight container to keep it fresh and for ease of scooping.

review/text: I have a Chaplin Movie Popcorn Popper and it's hard to find a good popcorn that's not too expensive. So I went to amazon and look for popcorn. I found an excellent tasting product and a very reasonable price. Thanks for having a great product at a great price.

review/summary: Anyone else think these kernels pop stale?
review/text: Okay, so I just bought a hot-air popcorn popper and bought this humungo bag of kernels thinking I'd get the best bang for my buck with premium popcorn to boot! But I was a little disappointed with the popcorn because it was a little stale. I figured the first batch was just a fluke, but then the second was the same.<br /><br />Granted, I'm no popcorn connoisseur but something was a bit off with the texture. Flavor was okay but it was hard to really get a feel for it with the texture just not adding up. could the kernels be too old? I don't know.<br /><br />Oh also, it could be that these kernels come out best in traditional stove top poppers with oil and not meant for a hot-air popper. This would explain 10-20 kernels not popping in each batch.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents and I hope it helps. Definitely cost-effective though!

Expensive for chicken feed, I know, but thats where its going.<br />I'll try the Great Northern brand next, but am not very hopeful after this huge bag of jaw exerciser.<br /><br />As always, Amazon's shipping and packaging were great.

review/summary: Just The Facts Mam....
review/text: I thought I would do a little detective work about cost on popcorn since I eat so much of it...<br /><br />Here are the cost break downs.  Many people (like me up until now) buy the 3 pak of microwave popcorn at one of those dollar type stores. The weight in these microwave bags are often 3 OZ, what I will call here as a "serving"<br /><br />Popcorn costs per 3 OZ serving.<br /><br />Paragon Bulk Bag 12.5 priced at $16.99 w/free shipping = 25.5 cents per serving<br /><br />50 LB bag Sams Club $19.00 per bag (includes/CA sales tax) = .0712 cents per serving<br /><br />One of those 4 LB containers at $9.99 w/free shipping = 46.8 cents per serving<br /><br />3 pak of 3 OZ microwave popcorn at dollar type store  = .33 per serving<br /><br />Large popcorn at the movies $5.00 (you can make it 70 times at home for the same price if you used the 50 LB bag here)<br /><br />It all comes down to what your taste buds prefer and how much popcorn you want to store. I think all brands are delicious and worth the price. If you buy 50 Lb.s and end up throwing away<br />a bunch after a year or two the savings don't apply.

review/text: I ordered this brand of popcorn due to the rave reviews. I made several batches in my Whirly Pop before writing this review. As others have, I used Orville Reddenbacher as the standard for comparison.  Paragon was no better, and no worse. So far, the most tender and flavorful popcorn is from Wabash Valley Farms. The Wabash brand is, however, much more expensive.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Paragon is not bad, it's just very average, on par with Reddenbacher.

review/summary: All popcorn is not the same
review/text: I used to think that all popcorn was the same.  However, I've been buying an eight-pound container of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn from Costco for awhile, so I have another brand to compare with the Paragon popcorn while my memory is fresh.  Paragon is less expensive than Orville Redenbacher's, but the texture and flavor of Orville's product are significantly better than Paragon's.  While Orville's has almost a buttery flavor even without seasoning, Paragon's has much less flavor.  While Orville's texture is marshmallow soft, Paragon's is much crunchier and less enjoyable to chew, almost as if the kernel hasn't completely popped.  Both brands seem to have the same rate of kernels popping, i.e., pretty much all of them pop in my air popper.<br /><br />So I've learned that you do get what you pay for with popcorn.  It isn't that Paragon's product is bad, and in fact I've purchased it before and enjoyed it; I just didn't have Orville to compare it with at the time.  Although I'm generally quite frugal with my purchases, after I've popped my 12.5 pounds of Paragon popcorn I'll be stocking up with Orville's again; it's worth the extra money.<br /><br />I've come back to downgrade my rating from three stars to two, because after eating this popcorn for a few weeks I'm realizing that I'm just not looking forward to the experience the way I used to.  It's just too crunchy, and too much of the popcorn is husk.

review/summary: Met all my expectations
review/text: For many years I had been using Orville's Gourmet popcorn in a Presto "Poplite" Hot Air popper and was satisfied with the taste and the fact that there were always some unpopped kernels.<br /><br />What did not satisfy were the trips back to the store to restock and the price.  The Paragon 12.5 bag with free Prime 2 day shipping seemed like a good idea to correct what did not satisfy based on the favorable reviews.<br /><br />Now that Paragon has been popping here every day for several weeks, I join with the other favorable reviewers.  The kernels are slightly larger than Orville's Gourmet so the popped corn is slightly larger too.  The taste is great, very close to what I had become accustomed.  There are some unpopped kernels, about the same as I used to have with the Gourmet popcorn.<br /><br />The Paragon bag I received was clear plastic and was undamaged.  The contents fit in 2 reusable air tight Hefty 1 gallon zipper bags, which makes storage more manageable.  An old plastic Kirkland 2.5 lb Cashews jar works well for storing the every day supply and its wide screw on lid makes it easy to scoop up kernels using Presto's measuring cup + butter melting tray.

review/summary: Great value, great popcorn
review/text: I am not really sure why there are so many differing opinions on this popcorn. First of all, let's be clear, I do not think you will find popcorn for a better price anywhere.  So, it is a great value.  But, if something doesn't take good, it doesn't matter how cheap it is, right?  I am not sure why others have not had success, but I will tell you that the popcorn popped up beautifully at my house.  I used a Cuisinart popcorn machine, added a small amount of peanut oil (no peanut allergies here) and waited as my machine popped nearly every kernel. Then, I lightly salted it and served it up.  It was crunchy, not chewy, and tasted fresh and delicious.  I would say the kernels popped up to fairly large popcorn.  You really cannot go wrong with this purchase.  Enjoy!

The large popcorns are edible but flavorless and pretty chewy. The popcorn that doesn't pop big is just unedible as its too tough.<br /><br />Overall I'd look elsewhere unless you just need something cheap to pop.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: This popcorn is great.  I got a popcorn machine this past Christmas and have struggled to get the "theater" popcorn I've been wanting.  I tried different brands of popcorn including Orville, but just couldn't get it just right.  Either the popcorn would be too crunchy or too chewy.  I researched my problem and I thought the kettle was too hot.....or maybe it was not hot enough, so I spent days adjusting the thermostat to change the popping temp.  I tried more oil, less oil, and still not great.<br /><br />I didn't want to spend money on the pre-portioned packs, so I thought I'd give the paragon popcorn a try.  What a difference!  Tastes good and pops great.  Nice and crispy, not crunchy, and not a bit chewy in the middle.  I've read on a couple different forums of others having the same problem and a lot of solutions were offered about kettle temp, too much moisture (leave doors open during popping), use less/more oil, and let the kettle warm up this or that long.  Well, I'm here to tell all you people having similar issues, TRY THIS POPCORN!  Not saying there aren't other brands out there that will work, but this one has done it for me.

It's the type of popcorn they use in large popcorn machines at fairs, so it's gotta be covered in salty artificial butter to give it any redeemable flavor. If that's your sort of thing, buy away.

I'm going back to Wabash Farms and only wish that Amazon carried their full line.

review/summary: A great supply of Popcorn Kernels
review/text: It has gotten so hard to find any grocery stores that even sell popcorn kernels cheaply packaged and inexpensively priced in one pound plastic bags anymore. No, just either a small bottle of Orville's or bags of microwave popcorn. Finding this cheap and equally great alternative has been a boon. Now it is easy to always have a supply of popcorn for the air popper without having to buy several bottles of overpriced kernels at the supermarket. If you often indulge in popcorn and have enough storage for a 12 pound bag, you really should get this. And with prime, it was here in 2 days. Amazing.

review/text: I'm always making real popcorn on the stovetop for my buddies who are used to the microwave stuff.  I have all kinds of different flavors and recipes ive made up and everyone loves it.  I have always used orville reddenbacher because it tastes the best, but this stuff is WAY better!  Just popped my first batch and this stuff even tastes great before I added any butter or salt.  Has a great consistency, all the kernels popped, and no pieces getting stuck in my teeth.  Ill never buy popcorn at the store again.  Awesome stuff!

review/text: I found 4 lb. bags of yellow popcorn from a popular brand available at my local grocery store for $3.87/bag.  They were even dated to "best sold by 3/13'.  That comes to under 97 cents a pound.  Paragon bulk might be pretty good but I can buy 12 pounds locally for $11.61 which is close to $5.00 cheaper than listed here of equally good popcorn.  Sometimes looking around locally is a better buy.

review/summary: The only popcorn we buy!
review/text: I'm a popcorn fiend, maybe too much for my own good!  But after a great deal of trial and error, this is the only popcorn we buy.  It offers the best value for the money -- the kernels pop up light and fluffy and the cost is a whole lot less than what you might pay in the store for even the worst supermarket popcorn.  The only popcorn that beats the Paragon is Orville Redenbachers, but I refuse to pay the outrageous price when this stuff is close enough.  So, I gave the Paragon 4 stars only because Orville's is a little better, but if looking strictly at value it's a 5-star deal.

review/text: I bought this months ago, and I am buying it again.  The popcorn is flavorful, delicious, and has nice firm texture.  Some popcorn, like microwave popcorn, practically disintegrates on your tongue and is overtly salty.  I pop this using my West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Popcorn Popper that I also purchased from Amazon, spray it with spray butter, and it turns out perfect every time. Absolutely craveable!!

review/text: This is an incredible amount of popcorn & a GREAT value. The kernels pop up large with  little to a moderate amount of hull. However, these have a texture comparable to a soft al dente pasta. Not tough or overly chewy, but if you're looking for melt in your mouth softness, this isn't it. The flavor is good, and I've had very few "duds".

We are on our second 25 Pound order now order now and I  have considered laying in a hundred pounds so as not to run out. (That is my way. When I like something I like to keep a supply on hand!)<br /><br />As always, we are more than pleased with Amazon's customer care AND with the quality of the product. We are retired elders whose health requires attention to details that were easy to overlook in years past. If you are in the market for popcorn THIS is a great value AND a fine treat! You will not be disappointed! I quickly produce a healthy, salt-free, VERY low oil snack FAR BETTER than popcorn packaged  for the microwave.

review/summary: stale corn
review/text: I'm not sure what the problem is, but can only conclude that the kernels were improperly stored.  I researched to see if I was doing something wrong, but if the oil is hot, the only other reason for the corn to be chewy is if the product is stale.  The moisture in the corn that causes it to "pop"will escape the kernel through the shell, resulting in yucky pop-corn.  My children don't care and neither does my hubby--maybe I'm just picky.

review/summary: Stale - Only Half Popped
review/text: Unfortunately these kernels were not good at all.  When I placed them in my hot air popper, only half of them popped.  I later tried a different brand of kernels - Orville Redenbacher - and nearly all of them popped.  Therefore, I believe that this brand of kernels (Paragon) was the problem.  The Paragon brand is inexpensive, but I highly recommend paying a few extra bucks to get something better.

review/text: By far one of the best food purchases I've made on Amazon in a long time. My kids have been loving air popped popcorn but the store bottles are so expensive! This is a huge bag that's lasted us over a month of popping nearly every day and we still have over half the bag left. My kids are very happy and the kernels pop about 99% of the time, with only about 1 or 2 kernels remaining in the machine after. Makes a really great healthy snack for them at school. (we don't put butter)

review/summary: Not At All Good
review/text: We purchased this and opened it within three days of getting it. The popped product was very tasteless with small  kernels and very large hulls. There weren't a lot of 'old maids' so we didn't believe the product was stale as much as it was just inferior corn. We purchased a jar of Orville and popped it the same evening and there was much more flavor and the kernels were larger with less hull. So in the compost went the Paragon product, not to be purchased again. In this instance we feel we got what we paid for.

Last night alone, I made 3 batches of popcorn (each batch fills up 2 large bowls) and there were no unpopped kernels and it tasted great (obviously or I wouldn't have had to make 3 batches for movie night).<br /><br />The popcorn comes well packed; when the UPS driver rang my doorbell he told me the package was very heavy and to be careful ....... I told him it was my popcorn.  His eyes got large and said you really must love popcorn and I told him it was Paragon brand popcorn and you can't beat the taste or price.<br /><br />I don't understand why people would buy Orville's popcorn at a ridiculous price when you can buy this great popcorn.<br /><br />If you love popcorn and eat a lot of it, I highly recommend this Paragon bulk bag of popcorn.

It does not pop up fluffy at all like Orville Reddenbachers and there are a lot of un-popped kernels left over. I gave up on microwave popcorn a couple of years ago and have tried many brands of popcorn since then. I will never purchase this again. Since it is a lot of popcorn I feel like I need to use it up, but every tie I make a batch I wonder why I am using this inferior brand of popcorn.

review/summary: The best for popcorn.
review/text: I don't understand how there can be different popcorn kernels, but there are. I bought this bag back in January and I recently started living on my own. I left my bag of Paragon Corn at my parent's house. I bought some generic corn from a store locally for popping, and it tasted awful! I was so used to the Paragon corn I've been using for months. This store brand corn was not fluffy, did not pop all the way, and often left the kernel shell still attached to the popcorn which is the stuff that gets in your teeth. Good corn does not do that as often. I can't wait to go back and get my beloved Paragon corn. You have to buy this stuff in bulk, but overall it is cheaper than buying the small bags you ordinarily get in a grocery store.

review/summary: Hey, their planters what can I say.
review/text: These arrived as fresh as any jar of planters peanuts I have purchased.  The price was excellent so nothing to complain about.  I will definitely buy again.  The expiration date was almost a full 12 months from date of receipt.  The jars are glass, 9 inches tall with a 2 1/4 inch wide mouth and a tight fitting lid so it can be used for other things.  I am thinking refrigerator pickles at the moment or perhaps a batch of limeade to take to a friends for margaritas.  Or even soaking small paint brushes.

review/summary: Fresh, and the recommended variety
review/text: Just shoring up the lo-carb, gluten-free-ness of the diet here. Was already like that but then read "Wheat Belly" by Wm. Davis, MD and am trying out his specific suggestions. So I created Nonpareil Trail Mix with high-protein ingredients, one of which is these.<br /><br />They are dated, "BEST BY 10/01/12". That's something I always look for and can't when shopping online, obviously. So wanted to report. Also you might want to know that these are glass jars with hard plastic screw-on lids, which makes them relatively impervious to marauding rodents. They could chew through the lids. Generally, though they'll go for something easier. Sorry, that's not an appetizing topic but relevant to storage, even short-term. I live in the country. So do rodents, whether I like it or not. And they may live where you are, too. Anyway, Mickey, the peanuts are great. (Left one out last night and MM took it. Sigh. Time to bait up the snappers.)

review/text: Good snack that doesn't have oil, salt, sugar, etc. I keep the jar in a draw at work and avoid the candy machine.
