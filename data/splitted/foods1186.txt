review/summary: Liquorice Bassetts Allsorts Tin
review/text: This liquorice has been made for a long time ever since my grandfather used to try and hide it in the closet from my brother and me over 50 years ago. I ordered two tins and sent one to my brother for Christmas to bring back old memories.<br />The delivery from Amazon was quick, well packaged and tasted just like it did all those many years ago. The liquorice was sealed in two separate packages inside of the can to maintain freshness.<br />Thanks Gramps for introducing me to the best tasting liquorice candy of all times.<br />(ASIN:B00455R2QQ Liquorice Bassetts Allsorts Tin 800g)

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/text: These are the real deal. Pepper Companie has made these black jacks the same way since the 1800s. They are all hand pulled and delightfully irregular in size. The flavor is really strong of molasses. DELISH! They have a fabulous texture similar to a candy cane. Not super dense like a jolly rancher, they're more airy so you can bite them and chomp them down if you want.. (and trust me, you WILL want to) All of the pepper candy companie products are fabulous but these are my absolute favorite. I always stock up when I'm in Salem.

review/summary: A long-time favorite
review/text: I've been drinking this tea for about a decade now, buying it first at a Russian specialty store in Washington Heights, NYC.  It's similar to Earl Grey in that it's a Bergamot tea, but it has a distinct flavor of its own.  I generally drink it unsweetened, but it also takes sugar and milk well.  The packaging is old school without the excess of packaging each individual bag, but I've found the flavor to stay constant through the last bag from the box.  My personal favorite above many teas I keep in the house, definitely recommended.

(Its nice to not have to drink the nasty office coffee and my coworkers cant steal it like they do with my lunch)  Its smooth and not to bitter, just right for a good cup of tea without sweeteners like I take it.

review/text: There's a time when you simply don't want to drink a tea with any flavor in it at all. For the past few months I've been drinking all sorts of flavored tea: Earl Grey, Earl Grey with vanilla, tea with berry, tea with mango. Then I got tired of drinking flavored tea and decided to try this.<br /><br />This was actually a gift. I didn't want to open it at first because the packaging was kind of dowdy. But I wanted to try a tea without any extraneous flavors at all and decided to try it anyway.<br /><br />The result surprised me. This was a very full bodied tea with a very strong taste. It was very good and just what I needed after drinking all that flavored tea; finally a strong tea without any berries or anything.<br /><br />So, if a very strong tasting tea is what you want, I highly recommend this.

review/summary: Still loving it
review/text: The bad first:<br />The tea bags were not individually wrapped.  I've bought a box of 100 tea bags before and they were individually wrapped within the box, but these were not.  Also, while most of the tea bags are consistent in potency, there are some outliers. So far, i've probably consumed 25 tea bags, but i would say that at least 1 or 2 of them were flukes (meaning they were weirdly not as potent as usual) and i had to remake my tea.<br /><br />The good:<br />Despite the little issues mentioned above, i continue to love this tea.  I used to drink English breakfast tea but now i just drink this one, which is not as harsh and more fragrant.  I discovered them about 5 years ago and Ahmed's English Tea #1 is still my favorite, and i am an avid tea drinker.  True, loose leaf teas are generally more aromatic and strong, but when you don't have a lot of time in the morning, this is my go-to tea.  So glad i found them online b/c i no longer live near the store where i used to purchase them.

review/summary: Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, 100TB ~ The Most Exquisite Earl Grey I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I first came across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea a number of years ago, while I was visiting a friend who lives out in Seaford, Long Island (NY). I was waiting for her to meet me in a mall, there, & I just happened into a Mideastern grocery-deli to browse and look at the great variety of exotic foods & spices they had for sale.<br /><br />By & by, I started getting thirsty & asked the shopkeeper whether he had cups of hot tea for sale. He showed me the varieties of tea they had & I chose Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, since Earl Grey has been my favorite ever since I was introduced to it back in the late '70s by an English friend of mine, who would prepare it with milk or cream & sugar or honey.<br /><br />Well, I had had excellent cups of Earl Grey tea in the past -- Twinings, Bigelow, Island-Rose & others -- but nothing I had previously tasted had fully prepared me for the sublimely fragrant, yet delicate & nuanced bouquet of aroma & flavor that literally "took me by surprise" upon my first sip of Ahmad Earl Grey Tea... aroma & flavor that was not just a simple one-dimensional taste but one that seemed to unfold as you drank it, revealing delightfully unexpected subtleties, layers & shades of enchantingly fragrant aromas & flavors.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the high quality of the tea leaves & the bergamot used to impart the flavor were clearly distinguishable to me in the tea's unmistakably delightful yet delicate aroma, not only when opening the box of 100 tea bags, or the individual envelopes containing the bags of tea... but quite detectable, in the tea bag itself, even after having made a cup of tea or two, making me wonder whether they might have discovered some very effective, secret manner of infusing the bergamot aroma into the tea leaves, or the tea bag, such that the aroma didn't dissipate after having made a cup of tea, or even while standing on the shelf of the grocery, as I've noticed sometimes happens with lesser grades of Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />In any event, after such an incomparable experience with Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, it is the only Earl Grey tea that I choose to drink, unless I happen to be out somewhere where it is, unfortunately, not available.<br /><br />It is at such times that I am so appreciative to have come across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea.<br /><br />Though I often purchase it at Mideastern food markets, for instance in Astoria, Queens, where it is readily available at rock-bottom prices & fresh from the importers, nevertheless, for those of you who are too far away to do so, the fact that it is available here on Amazon.com is already quite a boon, especially if you order a number of packages of it to lessen the impact of the shipping charges.<br /><br />If you do order Ahmad Earl Grey Tea & try it, I'm quite sure that you'll find that it soon becomes for you, as it has for me, "a most exquisite delight, definitely not to be missed!"

review/text: I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey.

The rose hip/hibiscus mix does not jive well. Hibiscus tea can be bitter already (which I nornally don't mind) but the rose hips do nothing for the taste but make it more bitter and less enjoyable. I was not satisfied with this purchase. Better off buying loose leaf hibiscus tea and brewing it alone. :( I do want to mention I had no issues with the seller, but the product is not tasty or comforting like many other good quality teas out there. I do not reccomend buying.

You must eat something before you drink it and you MUST NOT drink the entire bottle in one sitting. If you do, you may feel tired and sick! You can however, drink the whole bottle in a day, just wait a couple hours before you drink the second serving and you will be good to go.<br /><br />These things also taste great (at least to me).

review/text: I discovered Redline by accident and am glad to this day that i did discover it. I have tried every energy drink on the planet and non work, I'am able to drink 5 Redbulls and still feel nothing. Redline on the other hand WORKS! It has a great taste, tastes super sweet when its warm. If you ever need a quick energy rush Redline is for you, sip it over time to get an intermediate energy hype or slam the bottle and in about 20 minutes you will be bouncing off the walls and will not be able to stop. The only problem is if you do slam it after about 2 hours you'll crash pretty hard, but to counter that drink a lot of water and eat spoon fulls of peanut butter (not joking). All in all Redline works unbelievable wanders for those in need of amazing amount of energy, this stuff should be sold illegally in alley ways its so powerful. What could it hurt to just try it?

review/summary: Best Energy Drink I've Found
review/text: I've tried quite a few different energy drinks and Redline is the one that works best for me. The only thing I would change is to remove the Yohimbine because it causes jitteriness in larger amounts. That can be mostly avoided though by sipping small amounts over a longer period of time rather than drinking a lot at once. That also minimizes any energy crash effect. The taste is quite good as well.

review/summary: Great product--make sure to read the label!
review/text: I love this drink--I work full-time and go to school, and sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me on task.  It's also great right before a workout.  The taste is acceptable; I think it's a little lighter and sweeter than Red Bull, without the fizz.<br /><br />Warning: This is NOT just a variation of Red Bull or Monster--it's many times more potent.  The label lists it as a dietary supplement, not an energy drink.  I recommend starting with 1/4 bottle or less on a full stomach, to see how you tolerate it.  I rarely drink more than 1/2 bottle per day.<br />I've seen a lot of "reviews" that say that Redline is dangerous, because they had a bad experience; read further and they invariably say they didn't read the label before using it.  If you ignore the label (and the cap warning you to read the label) and drink a full bottle on an empty stomach, you will probably go to the hospital.  You might even die.  Of course, you could say the same thing about Motrin.  You have to use it responsibly.<br /><br />As for the 24-pack, I like it--I was going through a 4-pack every week or so, and they ran me $10 or more.  The 24-pack will save you a lot if you use the product regularly.

review/summary: Incredible
review/text: I've tried many energy drinks. This one is like no other.<br /><br />I bought mine at a convenience store. I was looking for something strong to finish up my paper after a pretty long night out.<br /><br />On the label they said '2 servings per bottle'. I have to admit I smiled and downed the whole damn thing.<br /><br />I could not believe how jacked up I was. That thing is *wild*. I don't know what they put in it, but let me tell you folks this is the absolute sh@t.<br /><br />The only problem is (1) sleep disruption --- got to work your tolerance up --- (2) potential crash after the effects have expired (3) a bit expensive.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars, totally worth it, one the sickest pick-me-ups out there.

review/summary: gives you incentive to work out after 20 min. of drinking
review/text: when people say "read the directions", you must. you aren't supposed to ingest the whole bottle. it's meant for 2 servings for 2 separate days. i like going to the gym, but i stress staying on the elliptical, unless i drink only half of this small bottle. i do 60 minutes on elliptical and sweat like crazy. after that, i literally can run on the treadmill for another hour. i did this several times, and i got bad knees and shouldn't be running. this tells you how much stamina you have once drinking half. if you want to lose weight while working out, but can't get yourself to stay in the gym long because of procrastination, lazyness or lack of energy, this is your product. just beware by not becoming addicted to this harsh, liquid drug. i can't have a normal workout without it.

review/summary: Death Bottled Me Some of Its Blood... And I Love It!
review/text: The title says it all, really. It works. Though its effects are different on different people (for instance, I don't get the "shiver feeling"), it wakes you up and keeps you awake. I haven't tried taking more than 1 bottle a day and I strongly advise against it, as it has enough caffeine to permanently damage your body, but really, one bottle is more than enough. I'll take a little sip in the morning, another in the afternoon, and one on my hour-long drive home in traffic (Love L.A., Hate the Traffic). This usually leaves me with half a bottle to 2/3s of a bottle left.<br /><br />Its taste is kind of strong, and you can tell it's a bunch of chemicals altogether, so if you can't stand it, I suggest pouring half a bottle of this into a 20oz cup of Sprite or another tangy, citrus soda. If you don't like soda, maybe some fruit juice or something. You really only need a little bit to wake yourself up and stay awake for a while and I'm not sure that much caffeine all at once is good for you anyways. Then again, we're talking about blood from the God of Death here, so if you really value your health over everything else, I don't suggest taking this at all. Not that I'm suicidal or anything, but I've got work to do. 14 hours worth. 6 days a week.<br /><br />I've been encountering this more and more at gas stations, so please, before you buy a whopping 24 bottles' worth here (VERY GOOD DEAL), try one first. See how you do with it. And please don't try it on an empty stomach. (I have, with no weird effects, but that's just me. I don't recommend anyone else try.)

review/text: I am in my late 30's, weigh only 100 lbs. I bought this drink at a local Seven Eleven, and drank quarter a bottle on my way home on foot. I felt somehow lightheaded while I was walking home. Then, about 10 minutes later, after getting home, I had another quarter. My heart started racing, and suddenly I had a bowel movement. When I came out of the bathroom, I felt a little better. Then, I took plenty of water to flush it down. In total, I just had half a bottle, but it still was too strong for me. I was lucky that I read the direction before opening the bottle, but the direction on the bottle was not clear and I am afraid that it is unreadable for some people.

review/summary: this product is not for sensitive people: it made me very very sick
review/text: I bought one of these to try after reading something online about how it works great and has no crash.  Cautiously, I drank a small sip from a bottle.  Probably less than a 16th of the two serving bottle.  Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink.  However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash.  I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day.  Similar effect, so far so good.  The third day I tried a tiny sip in the morning and developed an excruciating headache and nausea that has lasted for two days now.  I feel extremely overwired and unable to come down from it.  Very very sick.  I feel horrible still two days later and I hope I improve soon.

review/summary: Nice alternative to aspartame sugar free jell-o and fits into atkins
review/text: This gelatin tastes great and is very simple to make. I usually make it (at the last minute) and put it in the freezer for about 90 minutes and it is ready to go.  I like that the flavors are natural and not artificial, like Jell-o.<br /><br />The cost is higher than Jell-o, but it is worth it. Tastes better, no aspartame, "high" fiber, and natural flavors.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who already enjoys Jell-o but is looking to get away from aspartame and the other chemicals in Jell-o. Even if you eat the entire package, it is only 80 calories!<br /><br />I would also would recommend this to anyone on Atkins, since it easily fits within the induction phase (and all other phases). Nice way to get a sweet treat and stay on track with weight loss.

review/summary: Quick Set
review/text: I can't add much to the other reviews. This is a very good product. I was going to add a list of ingredients, but I see Amazon has added this since I bought it. About the only thing I can add is that the quick set method works just fine. This stuff dissolves almost instantly in only 1C of boiling water. Then just add 1C of ice cubes and water and stir until the ice melts. This will set much faster in the fridge. You can also use 4 small juice glasses instead of a bowl, which will help it set even faster and helps with portion control. I don't know about others, but if I make this in a bowl, it usually only makes 2 servings (or maybe only one). But if I have 4 small servings already separated, they usually last for 4 servings, which does save money as this is a bit expensive, but well worth the cost.

Jello is jello is jello and basically there are no surprises. Valued the lack of coloring and unhealthy ingredients. So why do I rate them 3 Stars instead of 4 or more? Well, the company send me an email through amazon promising a little extra if I took the time to review them, which I always almost do anyhow, but since they offered I took them at their word. I know on my first review, prior to this one, I was more generous with the stars system but this time around I am cutting down in the enthusiasm and allocate 3.5. Nice Jello, apparently many swear to the grand taste and advantage of this one but it is so hard to get too excited about Jello.

review/text: This cocoa is a wonderful, rich tasting, not overly sweet, decadent product. Made with milk, it is delicious and one can adjust it to their liking with more or less cocoa and/or milk. That said, since it is already pre-mixed with sugar, this is an extremely expensive product. Green and Black recommends 4 teaspons per cup, which means this little canister will only make a few cups.<br /><br />I grew up in Britain and cannot drink Swiss Miss or Nestle cocoas as they have no cocoa flavor at all, and are ridiculously sweet. This is a wonderful product, but if buying Green and Black's cocoa, I prefer the straight cocoa powder with which I can mix my own sugar. I can then afford to have good cocoa (hot chocolate) without breaking my piggy bank ;)

review/text: If you enjoy the strong, hearty taste of old-fashioned cocoa right off the stove, Green & Black's might not be what you are searching for.  It is, as it says, a "drink."  The taste is light and delicate, but can be adjusted to suit your taste buds.  For example, it calls for four teaspoons per cup, but I prefer to add more to get the bittersweet taste their chocolate bars offer.  If you enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV7Q0">Green & Black's dark, 70% cocoa organic chocolate bars</a>, you probably would enjoy this hot chocolate drink as well.  I'll give a quick basic overview of the drink.<br /><br />NOTE:  It is manufactured in a factory that processes nut and milk products.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Organic raw can sugar, organic fat-reduced cocoa powder, organic dark chocolate powder,organic chocolate liquor, organic raw cane sugar, organic cocoa butter, soy lecithin (emulsifier), and dairy ingredients.  There is a minimum of 16.5% organic dark chocolate and 60% cocoa.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS:<br /><br />This is based on a 4 teaspoon serving<br /><br />Calories - 80<br /><br />Total Fat - 2g<br />Saturated Fat - 1g<br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol - 0mg<br /><br />Sodium 0 mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate - 15g<br />Dietary Fiber - 2g<br />Sugars 12g<br /><br />Protein - 2g<br /><br />Green & Black's organic hot chocolate drink has a nice light bittersweet taste that many people will love.  The price is a bit higher than I've paid on the store shelves, but all things considered, not by much.  I've had to make sure that I watch the expiration dates on this one because when it gets outdated it tends to taste more like Ovaltine than a premium beverage.  Green & Black's claims it is "suitable for vegetarians" and one item of note it that a single serving contains 8% iron.  FYI, you can hold a 5.3 ounce can in the palm of your hand so we're not looking at large containers.  The taste is wonderful and well worth the premium price it commands.

review/summary: very chocolately!
review/text: When made with milk (I have not, and will not, make it with water) this creates a very rich hot cocoa.  It is not overly sweet and has a great flavor.  It blends easily and has minimal settling of chocolate particles in the bottom.

review/text: Great organic hot cocoa, with a very rich taste (especially made with 2% milk!). I used this product in a gift basket I made for a silent auction in support of a children's charity. The event was held at a very nice country club, and the elegant packaging Green & Black's organic hot chocolate really helped to pull the basket together.

review/summary: Fresh Candy, Great Taste, product weight not disclosed...
review/text: I ordered these for the holidays and they were very good and fresh. These candies in particular get stale pretty quickly so this is a good seller to buy them from. I would have given a 5 star review but I assumed they were going to be the large Chick O Sticks and they were not. The ad needs to make the individual product weight, size, etc, known to the buyer. I had no idea what the large Chick O Sticks weighed but opening the box to find the much smaller product was upsetting.

review/text: ...but the product photo threw me off a little.  For some reason I was thinking the 3 pounds were being shipped in (6) 1/2 pound bags.  Anyway, totally an assumption and goof-up on my part.  I'm leaning towards using all liquid malt extract going forward though.  I can get 6 pounds (just the right amount for a 5-6 gallon batch) shipped to my house for about $16.  The dry malt has extended shelf life, and has more malt per pound, but in terms of ease of use and economy the liquid malt seems like the way to go.

review/summary: This Stuff Is Great!
review/text: A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

After having some of this coffee at a high end restarant in Sedona AZ I thought I would order some, It had a fair amount of bittetness which was not present in the  restaurant version  The brewer machine I use does better on starbuck's.  It is good but not as good as I expected or hoped for.  Still a great purchase price

review/summary: An unfortunate pairing
review/text: Is it possible that culinary great Wolfgang Puck would lend his name to such a mediocre food product? If you buy this sauce, you'll find your answer and that answer is yes. I highly doubt that Wolfgang Puck actually tasted this sauce before he signed the contract to attach his name and likeness to this insipid product but with the other Wolfgang Puck food products I've tried lately I'm starting to see a trend. If you're going to buy this sauce anyway, just go to the local market and buy one jar to try it out.

review/summary: It'll Do
review/text: I buy this vodka sauce when my store is out of the much more flavorful Bertolli Vodka Sauce. Wolfgang Puck's version of creamy vodka sauce is a more bland-tasting sauce that doesn't add much kick to pasta dishes. I find myself having to add my own touch (seasoning) to it. In a bind, this vodka sauce will do; I'm just a little curious as to why this sauce doesn't have any punch. It more or less tastes like spaghetti sauce. Is it really a creamy spaghetti sauce? Not to mention the price is higher than a lot of sauces out there. Avoid this sauce if you can.

review/text: I bought a jar of this arrabiata sauce in my local supermarket.  It's the best commercial sauce from a jar, at least that I've ever come across. I regularly travel to Italy and DO know what good sauce is like. Maybe the other reviewers were talking about a different flavor in this series. This one's got a liitle bite to it and it's thick and rich with flavor. I'd recommend you give it a try.

review/summary: Awesome Coffee, low price
review/text: I never thought I could brew as good a cup of coffee as a fine restaurant until I bought the Dark Roast from the Organic Coffee Company. The aroma, the taste, are out of this world.  And I'm not usually a dark roast kind of drinker.  No bitterness, no after taste, like I find w/ the St*** brand so nationally prevalent.<br /><br />Also, because of the lack of customer advertising/awareness, I was able to get this coffee for only $4.00 per 12oz bag.  Almost the most inexpensive coffee on the rack.  This was at a super market chain located in New England.  But lately, the store has been discontinuing it, so as I look online, I can only find the same coffee for $10 or more per bag.  Sigh.

review/summary: Unique licorice
review/text: These licorice wheels are awesome! I love them, however, they may not be for everyone.  They dont have a traditional licorice taste, it is less dominant and more of a sweet flavor.<br /><br />They are a little "greasy" or "waxy" but I believe this is part of the preservatives.  These do not store or keep well for long periods of time, so make sure you buy them fresh, (they even have born on dates on the bags).<br /><br />I did not like these are first and thought they were weird, because they did not taste like every other licorice.  The taste grew on me and I like that you can eat them whole, bite off a piece, or unwind it into a long string. The green frogs and rainbow frogs are my favorite "traditional" gummi products but it is a tie overall.  Careful, they are addicting. :)

review/summary: Great price if you like the product
review/text: I grew up with the version of these that had a tiny candy in the center.  They were flavorful and I remember them fondly.  These aren't as good.  The flavor is not as strong and, as has been mentioned, they are waxy.  No wonder - the ingredient list contains both beeswax and carnauba wax (think car wax).  An occasional piece has a very strange chemical taste.  For the past few years I have been buying these whenever I find them in candy stores.  Although the taste is not as good as I remember, they are addicting.  If you are interested in buying these, I suggest you first try to find a small quantity locally and get this big, very well priced bag if you like them (or alternately, buy the big bag and find someone who will eat them if you don't like them).  But, be aware that this 5 pound bag can go fast if you are not paying attention.  I definitely have to get set up on the auto shipment as we finished our bag in less than a week.

review/summary: Haribo Strawberry Licorice Wheels
review/text: First discovered while shopping a local apple orchard's gift shop, the Strawberry Haribo Licorice Wheels are some of the finest we have found.  Made in France, this is a quality strawberry licorice product.<br /><br />The American licorice companies seem to be focusing on gimmicks and texture - some so soft and lacking real flavor that after I have one taste, the rest are trashed or returned to the store.<br /><br />These licorice wheels, or ropes conveniently packaged, have the right snap, flavor and aroma you come to expect from a flavored licorice.  Always fresh. Always in the right shape and size.<br /><br />For children - they will love unwinding the wheel and getting the double rope.  For adults - it gives us something to do with our late afternoon snack.  Something to play with - good for stressful days or when we need to doodle or unwind in front of the computer screen.<br /><br />Easy to handle for repackaging.  A great product.

review/text: These licorice wheels are the best. If you like licorice then DON'T BUY THESE. you will never be able to stop eating them. They have great flavor but are not filling, so before you know it, the bag is gone.

review/summary: Not the freshest product - chemical taste
review/text: Compared with the black licorice Haribo, this product seemed not as soft and fresh.  Some pieces also seemed to have an unpleasant chemical taste to them.  It's hard to know whether this was just a stale package or if the formulation differences between the licorice flavor and strawberry flavor cause the significantly worse texture in the strawberry product, but if one really loves strawberry licorice, you can still manage to enjoy this product.  Overall, somewhat disappointing.  Not sure that I would buy this again.

review/summary: I &lt;3 Haribo's Strawberry Licorice Wheels!!
review/text: Love the flavor and the chewiness of these wheels.  Like the flavor of these way more than Twizzler's strawberry--can't compare them because they're totally different in taste and texture.  They can be a little waxy but this doesn't deter me from buying more.  I eat them in the round or unwind them and eat the string, depending on my mood.  Hoping that Amazon's will be as fresh as where I can find them locally.  Amason's S&S ends up over $2 a pound cheaper than what I can get them for.  The only problem is that I'll need to practice some self control--lol. Can't wait for my order to arrive!!

review/summary: Okay...
review/text: The taste of these is great, but our bag was a little dry and chewy.  That said, the party kids ate them up without hesitation and loved unrolling them.  Might consider buying them again, but we've had our fill for a while.

review/summary: Kids like these "Wheels". Great value on Amazon!
review/text: These taste more like cherry than strawberry because the flavor is subtle.  My nieces and nephews like to unroll them as they eat them slowly.  Great deal on Amazon when compared to drug and grocery store prices.

review/summary: red licorice wheels
review/text: I Love red licorice wheels and have a very hard time finding them.  This is my second order from Hasbro for the wheels. now.  The first order was very good, this last order for Christmas was quite sticky, and about 1/2 not all of the bag of the licorice tasted like perfume or something very odd, we threw them out.
