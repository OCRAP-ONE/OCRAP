review/summary: This tea made me single
review/text: My ex is trying to sue this tea for alienation of affection.  I the day I received my first box, I dumped my significant other and never looked back.  The tea is hot, sweet enough to make me smile, and spicy enough so that I don't get bored.  When I want it, it's ready in 30 seconds, and I don't have to bob anything up and down to get it strong enough.  It's all wrapped up safe and secure for one use, and there's no mess left over.  Who could ask for anything more?

review/summary: WARNING - Not equal amounts of each flavor.
review/text: Sure wish I'd read all of the reviews on this as someone else also noted that there are only 3 each of the grape and sour apple and 6 of the bubblegum flavor. I can buy the bubblegum flavor at the local pharmacy and my grandsons don't even really want that flavor. But I didn't want to buy 12 of the grape and 12 of the sour apple (the other alternative thru Amazon) so figured 4 bubblegum would be ok as long as there were 4 each of the other two flavors. My fault for not reading all the reviews, but I think they purposefully don't tell you how many of each flavor. That to me is a marketing sin of omission. At least the expiration dates are months from now (unlike one other unlucky purchaser).

review/summary: Very Good Beans
review/text: I'm quite happy with the taste of these dried lima beans (also known as "butter beans" in some circles). These beans come in plastic bags that have a re-sealable zip-lock top, which is nice. The beans that I've used re-hydrated perfectly and had a good flavor. Lima beans have a thin skin that you may want to remove after hydrating them, which is easy to do -- just squeeze each bean between two fingers and the bean pops right out of the skin.

review/summary: Caraway Seed....interesting spice and tastes good
review/text: I ordered this thinking caraway was something else.  No matter..I put the ingredients into the machine and just for good measure I threw in 1/2 cup of sweetened cranberries.<br />I was surprised when that huge beautiful loaf came out and I tasted it.  A hint of sweet cranberries to go with the caraway...caraway reminds me of pine needles. I thought it was not going to be eaten. I had guests over the next day and I had them try it.  It was a hit!  The whole loaf disappeared in nothing flat.  Some of the best inventions happen by accident or by ignorance. (yep, thats me,,just ask my EX)<br />I made another loaf, (i had 3 boxes of the caraway mix) this time without cranberries, and it came out as it should.  It too was good.  I would buy this again.  As you can tell, I'm no fan of plain white bread.  I love adding extras.  This bread machine has turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought.

review/summary: Excellent taste. Tangy, Easy to use.
review/text: I have personally tried several different mixes for "homemade" Italian dressings in my years of cooking. This one takes the cake.  Most I have tried were too sour, or had too much added sugar.  Several just had a lot of oil flavor and very little seasoning.  Some packaged mixes from the grocery store tasted stale as soon as I mixed them.  Some I tried were very inexpensive, off-the-shelf varieties, others custom ordered from specialty food companies.  This was, by far, the best of them all.<br />The flavor is strong and well-seasoned, like a pub salad with a strong house Italian dressing. Tangy, but not sour. Very dominant flavors, not at all timid like a bottled Italian dressing, and certainly not heavy on the salt, as all bottled varieties seem to be.  The bits of vegetable in the mix were so fresh and pungent that you could taste the celery, red pepper and other flavors in the dressing, even after letting it stand for less than an hour at room temperature.  The directions are easy.  Mix 2 T seasoning with said amount of vinegar. Let stand for 20 minutes and add oil.  If you don't let it stand, the flavor is milder, but still very good.  Everyone in my family who tried it enjoyed the flavor. We tried it on a green salad, first, then made it for a picnic pasta salad which received rave reviews from everyone present.  If you don't like the dressing itself, it works nicely as a salad sprinkle for potato, pasta and vegetable salads with other kinds of dressing.  I also tried using it to add kick to a bottled dressing I was eager to free myself of, and it gave it a much-needed flavor boost.  Overall, I highly recommend this product and plan to buy it again in the future.

review/summary: Handy, fragrant, and delicious
review/text: I must say, this is something I'm using more and more in my cooking. It was a bit hard to get used to it at first, and yes - it's easier to BUY a dressing but it's so much more fun to make your own! The options are endless, and the recipies included on the container are pretty yummy. I recently made their honey mustard dressing featuring the Italian Garden Dressing Mix and it was the best I've ever had. The easiest thing to do is just pour a bit of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a bit of salt and this dressing mix on a salad mix, and voila! You have a delicious snack. Another easy thing? Rub chicken or fish in it and a bit of oil, and stick it in the oven. Easy and delicious. The smell is not pungent but very pleasant. I will definitely look for this again when I run out of my first sample.

review/summary: Excellent flavor and value
review/text: When I first looked at this product I thought it was a bit pricey (over five dollars for a small bottle).  I then  looked at the various recipes listed on the back and thought that it was worth a try. The resulting salad dressings and marinades were all quite tasty.  My family particularly enjoyed chicken marinaded in this product.  We have also used the product mixed with olive oil for dipping fresh Italian bread.<br /><br />As for the cost factor - when I compared the cost of prepared bottles of good quality salad dressings to the cost making them using this product, making them up fresh with this came out as cheap or cheaper than buying the ready made dressings and marinades.  When I also considered that I could adjust the amounts prepared for my needs, and the additional control I had over the quality I decided to replace many of the premade bottled dressings with this product.

review/summary: On the fence...
review/text: Salads are a staple in our house -- we eat them at least 5 times a week, often more.  So, I was thrilled to try these mixes out and make some different homemade dressings.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with both the balsamic and the honey mustard dressings.  They were "okay", but nothing special like I had hoped.  In fact, after one sitting, the left over dressing was thrown out (which is something I REALLY do not like to do).<br /><br />There are several dressing recipes on the container.  I have only tried the two mentioned above.  I might try the others (only because I have the mix on hand) but I am not overly optimistic about the potential.<br /><br />On a positive note, after the disappointment with the salad mix, I attempted to use the mix as a meat rub (on chicken) and found it to be quite good.  It made for a nice change to traditional baked chicken.  I will certainly use it again for this purpose.<br /><br />While I was a little disappointed in the salad dressings, I will be the first to admit that my expectations might have been too high given my love for salads.  As I said, I eat a lot of salad and I have cookbook after cookbook specific to salad-making and complimentary homemade dressings.  Consequently, I might have expected too much.  For someone less enthused, this might be a great option.  In addition, for those who enjoy a change to their regular meat, it does make for a tasty meat rub.

review/summary: Create your own herb salad dressing
review/text: This product allows people to make their own salad dressing without the hassle of mixing herbs together themselves.<br /><br />I dislike buying salad dressing in pre-made jars because manufacturers tend to add too many preservatives and use low quality oil.  This product allows me to select my own olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Then, I can add as much or as little seasoning as I desire.  In the past, I typically just mixed olive oil and vinegar together to use as a salad dressing.  This product allows me to add seasoning similar to the seasoning in pre-made salad dressings.<br /><br />This product is also nice because everyone at the table can mix his/her own dressing.  Not everyone enjoys the same mixture of ingredients and this item allows everyone to create an individual dressing for his/her salad.<br /><br />Finally, my best estimate is that this jar should be good for about 50 average size salads.

review/summary: Much More Versitle Than I Would Have Imagined
review/text: O-K, I was a little dubious at first.  A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!<br /><br />When my order arrived the first thing that I did (after smelling it) was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar.  I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was.  I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice.  There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread.  Wonderful!  Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb.  I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.  My guests commented that I always seem to have a way with seasoning.  I thought about telling them that I was using a prepared mix but decided to simply agree with them.<br /><br />Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.  It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle. I've yet to use it as an ingredient in a marinade, but I think that it would make a quick, tasty addition to some of the liquids that I am now using to add flavor to chicken and beef.<br /><br />I am really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered the other two varieties (French and Napa) on my own.  I plan on keeping them as a staple in my spice cabinet (just don't tell anyone!)

review/summary: Zesty! Plus lots of variations
review/text: I got this product today, so decided to make a salad for dinner. I sliced and warmed slightly some rare leftover sirloin steak, mixed greens (heavy on the spinach)a little shredded mozzerella and fresh parmesan cheese, and this dressing, mixed in the balsamic specification. I used decent quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br /><br />On opening the dressing container, I noticed the spicy aroma right away. Nothing on the label to indicate what it is, so I did a wet finger taste. Not too spicy, but definitely a little bite. I could taste the sea salt, too, and just a hint of sweet.<br /><br />The dressing was really good. I didn't try any other variation because I am fond of balsamic. But, I bet the others are good too. It complemented the steak in a way I didn't expect. A little sweet, very zesty, and then the bitter from the balsamic, combined with the grilled meat was heavenly.<br /><br />This dressing would make a good seasoning for meat or fish. I am definitely going to try it on chicken.<br /><br />The price is pretty reasonable for this many servings--3 containers make 8 8oz batches of dressing, each.<br /><br />This is a pretty versatile dressing mix. It gets two thumbs up from me!

review/text: I have been using this product over the past couple months.  I have made the salad dressings and the marinades.  My overall feel is I really like it.<br /><br />It's not without flaws as I found sometimes the herbs are overpowering, but with a little recipe fiddling you can fix that.  For example with the Honey Mustard salad dressing recipe I personally thought the herbs covered the honey and the mustard portion of the dressing.  I fixed that by adding more honey and more mustard.  Voila!<br /><br />I marinated some chicken breasts in each of the different marinades, and then had the neighbors over for a little BBQ and we were all impressed with the flavors.  My neighbors even asked what I used so they could purchase some.<br /><br />All in all I have enjoyed every recipe and every marinade, even when I have to fiddle a bit with it; I think it's a great product.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, July 2008

review/summary: Use your imagination and I think you'll enjoy this as much as I did
review/text: I decided to try this salad dressing mix more for the purpose of using it as a seasoning for meat than for salad dressing but I've tried it both ways. I'm always looking for new things to dress up my normal grilled chicken or fish dinners and this worked well. I used it as a dry rub and while it wasn't overly flavorful, it still added some pop to the meat. I will probably try it as a marinade next time, mixing with a little extra virgin olive oil or the like.<br /><br />I tried the vinaigrette recipe on the bottle and was pleasantly surprised. When blended with olive oil and vinegar (I used cider vinegar since that was what I had available) it has a strong herb flavor without being overpowering. The leftover salad dressing keeps pretty well for a few days and loses nothing in the flavor. In fact I think the flavor got a little stronger after sitting in the refrigerator a few days.<br /><br />This dressing mix is quite versatile and I can see myself testing it out in many ways. Perhaps a seasoning for cooked vegetables instead of he usual salt and pepper, Or maybe as a topping for a baked potato, or mixing into mashed potatoes. Pasta salad, spaghetti sauce, use your imagination and I think you'll enjoy this Herb Filled Salad Dressing Mix as much as I did. Now to try the other two flavors...<br /><br />� Kelley A.

The description is for a salad dressing but in reality it is good for so much more.<br /><br />Things I have tried this with:<br />Salad Dressing - Great Success<br />Pasta Salad (Dry sprinkle) - Great Success (Especially with Zucchini and Squash!)<br />On Chicken - Tastes really good<br />As a Dip for bread with Olive Oil - Tasty<br /><br />Overall this is a very tasty and versatile seasoning.  It goes the furthest when used as a salad dressing (64 servings) but dry it is good and goes pretty par as well.  The only negative I had was the strength of the flavors could have been a bit stronger.  I found my self adding a bit of fresh parsley or red pepper to a few things to add a stronger flavor.<br /><br />At the price an excellent value and very good product.  4 stars.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: Since I'm avoiding sugar I've taken to making my own Italian dressing mix (pretty much all commercial Italian dressing mixes are loaded with sugar and other stuff), but Homemade Dressings gets down the mix perfectly and is a lot more convenient.  The mix is all natural and tastes great, both as a dressing and as a seasoning.  If you miss Good Seasons but don't miss all the garbage that's in it, you won't go wrong with this stuff.

review/summary: Grab some oregano and call it a day!
review/text: I could discern little taste difference after mixing this with Vinegar and Olive oil as specified on the package. It's ok, but nothing really stands out with the flavoring.  Is it the "natural" angle they were going for here?  I'm not sure.  Maybe this might work better as a marinade mixture, but as for going to the trouble of mixing this with regular Vinegar & Olive oil, why bother?

review/summary: Better as an all-purpose seasoning than as a dressing...
review/text: All-in-all, the Herb Filled Salad Dressing Mix for Olive or Salad Oils is quite good, although I personally found the item to be better-used as an all-purpose seasoning. Mixed with extra-virgin olive oil, the dressing is flavorful, although you might need to add a bit more than the directions recommend. Personally, I used the product more effectively as a rub or marinade for chicken and pork. Either way, the results were delicious. As seasonings go, you could do far worse, and the value is spot-on.

review/summary: Not just for salad dressings!!
review/text: Although this product markets itself as a salad dressing mix, it's much more versatile than that.<br /><br />On the bottle you'll find instructions for creating a delicious oil based salad dressing, which is indeed good. It's a friendly blend of italian seasonings and herbs that you might find in your garden. We cook with a lot of herbs, so this is saving us the time to dry them for our own dressings.<br /><br />But that's not where the real value of this product comes. We stopped using it for mixing with salad oil, and started using it directly on cooking. Sprinkle it on chicken in a marinade before bbq, use it on red meat as well in a marinade. I say marinade, because I don't recommend putting it on the meat just before grilling, or you'll get a lot of burned bits. I would also make this recommendation on ANY herb that you put on a protein before grilling. It's usually best to save it for post-cook.<br /><br />Speaking of post-cook: this product is perfect for the dining room table. Sprinkle over scrambled eggs for a sassy taste, and don't be afraid to use this on grilled vegetables, or even on your baked potato. Trust me, we've tried it and it's delicious. If you like to stir fry your veggies to serve along with chicken/beef, use this product in your stir fry (it won't burn like it will on the grill).<br /><br />In summary - this product goes way beyond salad dressing mixture, and I would say you'll use it more as a topping vs. dressing.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: After Hydration, This Seasiong Mix Packs Quite The Flavor Punch
review/text: I'm becoming addicted to this seasoning mix now that I've discovered some of its secrets. I tried making some of the salad dressing recipes listed on the back of the jar, but I couldn't actually taste the herbs in them. So I started doing my own experimenting with the seasoning mix. I've found that I now cannot eat macaroni and cheese without it adding the dry mix to it after cooking. However, I did not like the taste when I added the dry mix to vegetables after cooking. I think the reason is that the real trick to get to the heart of the flavor of this mix is to hydrate it. It's great cooked into things rather than merely sprinkled on top. Mixed with olive oil, this makes the best bread dip that I've had from a mix (even better than Carraba's). Once the herb mix starts to hydrate, the garlic and lemon in the seasoning mix make the flavor really pop.

review/summary: Mixed feelings...
review/text: I have been trying to cut back on salt recently as a response to my husband's high blood pressure. I like the concept of having a lower-sodium salad dressing mix to simply be mixed with olive oil and vinegar...sort of like a pimped-up Good Seasons. However, after trying some of the recipes on the label I was not very impressed.  Instead, I've found it is more useful as a seasoning product on pasta, on top of homemade pizza, etc. There is a bit of salt in it, however, so if you are using it this way, it's best to keep that in mind. My next experiment is to try on grilled meats. However, as a salad dressing, I can only give it three stars.

review/summary: Perfect for the Occasional Cook
review/text: For those of us who don't keep a fully stocked kitchen but do like to cook on occasion this Homemade Dressings is quite a find.<br /><br />It makes for a quick and easy salad dressing, which while a little more work than opening a premade dressing, allows me to make it to my own taste--while saving time from having to go through trying to mix all the various herbs myself.  By adding other dominant flavors a whole new world of special creations are possible, all while staying within a budget of money and time.<br /><br />It does this by being flavorful without being overpowering in any particular flavor like so many herb mixes are.  This allows for a subtle blend that tastes great as dressings, or within sauces, or spread on chicken and beef.<br /><br />My one complaint is they don't fully specify what's inside.  The first ingredient listed is simply "spices", leaving the question "which ones?" still unanswered.  As well as "spices" this includes "sea salt, tomato powder, garlic, parsley, citric acid and natural lemon juice powder".<br /><br />100% natural, with no sugar at all to be found. I've already found myself reaching for this again and again in all kinds of cooking situations.  It's a perfect addition to the occasional cook's kitchen.

review/summary: Versatile blend of herbs and spices
review/text: The closest comparison this product has to a product commonly on store shelves is the Good Seasons brand salad dressing.  Additional recipes on the bottle provide instructions for use in a variety of dressings and marinades.  It has that "italian herb seasoning" flavor and, while they're not specific on the actual spices used, I'm guessing it's a mix of oregano, sage, basil and parsley.  Tomato powder, garlic, and sea salt are also listed as ingredients.<br /><br />Personally, I think it works good as your standard oil and vinegar italian dressing and I expect it'll give a nice flavor as a dry rub to a grilled pork loin.  I'm less enthusiastic about using this particular flavor in their honey mustard recipe and don't think it'll taste good as a pasta sauce.  I started first with their standard vinaigrette recipe that called for wine or cider vinegar and olive or salad oil.  It's decent, and I'll probably try with balsamic vinegar next, but I think it'll actually taste best with simple white vinegar.  Fortunately, each bottle needs only two tablespoons of mix so you'll have plenty leftover to experiment with.  Each bottle is rated to make eight 8oz bottles of dressing.<br /><br />One thing caused some concern.  The "freshness seal" did not seem very well sealed.  In two different bottles, simply unscrewing the top was enough to make the seal come loose.  I question whether these are really sealed at all.<br /><br />Edit:  Couple more easy recipes.  1) Sprinkle some in an omelette while cooking for an interesting mix of flavor, esp. one containing onion and peppers like a Denver omelette.  2) Use this with a little extra added salt to taste and it'll make a dynamite chicken soup base.  Other than the chicken and vegetables, no added ingredients are needed.<br /><br />I already expressed my disappointment with the seal but the cap isn't airtight either.  The mix tends to harden in humid environments so plan on using up whatever you purchase quickly or transfer it to a better seasoning jar.

review/summary: Italian Garden Wow
review/text: Homemade dressings has a hit with Italian Garden because it is so versatile.  The directions say use it for salad dressings many of which I have made successfully.  The spices give a nice punch to an otherwise humdrum vinegar and oil dressings.  Also it's easy to adjust the amount of spice in dressings, something  you can't do in a bottled dressing.  Lastly the spice mix is easy to use in a dressing and doesn't have all those ingredients you can't understand in bottled dressings.  It's a plus that it's 100% natural.<br /><br />Also this mix is good as a rub or just sprinkled on meats and vegetables.  It's great seasoning for food that you grill.  Because it is a mix of spices, there isn't one overpowering taste.  It's easy to pour, yet you don't have to use a huge amount to get good flavor.  I would buy this product again and pass it along to friends.  Give it a try.

review/text: This homemade dressing is a good tasting product but not worth the trouble. You mix the seasoning with a light olive oil before using on a salad. There is plenty of flavor, full of "italian" seasonings.  However, it is troublesome to mix the product and store the unused portion.<br /><br />Pros: you can custom tailor the amount of flavor you want in a herb/oil dressing and use your favorite brand of oil.<br /><br />Cons: you still have to buy olive oil and a storage container to prevent wasting of the unused mixture.

Don't be afriad to try a teaspoon or two--at first I was too careful about my measure. It's tangy without being spicy hot. Try it!

review/text: This is a nice change to the traditional bottled italian salad dressing. My husband and I made a nice green salad with grilled chicken to try out this dressing. I must say it tasted pretty darn good. My only suggestion to anyone considering purchasing this dressing is to mix the dressing, oil and vinegar and really let it sit for the 20 minutes the maker suggests. We were anxious to try and didn't wait the whole time and I can see where waiting would have made the dressing taste even better. Give the herbs time to really marinate with the oil and vinegar. Overall, the dressing was easy to mix and use.

review/text: Well, maybe it's not as versatile as Saturday Night Live's "Shimmer" (It's a floor wax! It's a dessert topping!) but this has food uses beyond what the bottle says. We started out mixing a nice vinaigrette dressing, but we ended up sprinkling it on grilled tomatoes, over roast chicken and in scrambled eggs with cheese. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was when we tried mixing it in with the chicken salad -- combined with mayo, it was a little too sweet.<br /><br />I like subtle flavorings and often what is passed off as "Italian" is anything but. This particular product is a very simple and unobtrusive blend that we enjoyed very much.

I'm not completely convinced that its better tasting than quality pre-made dressings. A plus is that you can tailor your flavor exactly how you like it: less oil more oil, more or less vinegar, more or less spice. I appreciate the flexibility of the mix, the flavor is good, and the label has clear and easy-to-follow instructions.

review/summary: More than just a Salad Dressing Mix
review/text: Before getting Homemade Dressings Italian Garden Mix, I had only minimal experience making my own salad dressings. I mostly made simple vinigarettes with lemon juice/ oil, etc. I made the Balsamic vinegar/olive oil recipe as described on the label and found it quite good. I made it for my family, who can be kind of picky when trying anything a little off the normal path and most them liked it in a simple salad mix with tomato and Parmesan cheese.  I think some of these dressings would make a good marinade whether to grill meat or even to bake it.<br /><br />Really though as the labeling suggests this spice mix is much for than just a quick way to make salad dressing, it's also a spice rub. I used to grill flat iron steak and it was good, though I would suggest drizzling some olive oil over the meat to avoid the herbs blackening on the grill. I did this also an some Salmon steak and it cooked much better on a grill. The spices are flavorful without being over powering. This Italian Garden  mix is good enough that I would like to try their other two varieties at some point. I would recommend this versatile mix to people who like to make their own salad dressing as well as people that grill a lot of meat, though maybe it would be good on grilled veggies as well.

review/text: This month when amazon offered some prodcuts to try in their vine newsletter this one here caught my eye in particular. I have been a person who's had to eat sugar free. low sugar foods for a while . This one caught my eye reason being I have had so many vile tasting sugar free salad dressings artificially flavored etc etc. They were horrible they sat in the fridge and ended up having to be thrown out. This product here tastes wonderful you add it to your own dressing and oil . Like I say in the title its great seasoning in soups which i tried it in also and on meats which i tried it on as well. makes for a excellent rub. The thing I like most bout it is when you use it for a salad dressing it taste good and  person will eat this they wont let it sit in the back of the fridge like some of those disgusting  low carb sugar free products on the market that are already mixed up and convienant . one doesn't mind having to mix this up to get the good flavor outta the deal  I can't wait to use it with lotta cook outs and meat marinades its so good i even gave a bottle to a friend and they too thought it was outta this world. this is another thing I know i will be back for due to not being able to eat sugar specially after august when i have my gastric bypass surgery i am really going ot appreciate these products that actually taste good like this one does.

review/summary: For Everything There Is a Seasoning
review/text: (Note: this is a cross-posting of my review of the "Napa Garden" variety of this product, placed here because this seems to be where all the reviews are going.)<br /><br />What we're dealing with here is a container of mixed seasonings with a very helpful label. They don't reveal exactly which herbs are included, but it's a good mix that works well with the "straight-up" test: take a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar, sprinkle the seasoning on top, and then dip a chunk of Italian bread in it and ciao down.<br /><br />The label is much more helpful than most mixed-seasoning labels. It provides you with simple recipes for mixing with olive or other light oil and a variety of other ingredients to produce salad dressings, marinades, dry rubs, etc.<br /><br />In the "straight-up" test, the taste was full and herbanescent (if that's not a real word, tough--I made it up and I like it!). The sea salt and lemon juice added just the right tang, and the tomato worked well with all the spices and salt to add just a tiny hint of fruity freshness.

My two kids, age 12 and 9 enjoyed it as well, it was not too "spicy" for them.<br />Handy to have around if you run out of salad dressing, since you can make your own.<br />  It has 5 cal per � TBSP unmixed.  No sugar, no cholesterol, no fat and 220 mg of sodium per � TBSP.  One container makes eight servings of 8 oz of dressing and the bottle says you can keep it up to 30 days refrigerated.

The label says it can also be used as a marinade and as a vinagrette/oil style dressing. I am looking forward to using it as a seasoning or marinade on roasted potatoes.

review/summary: Very Very Good
review/text: The first thing I did when I received this product was take off the top and inhale. The blend of herbs inside smells wonderful. So far I have used it to season chicken, fish and vegetables and have had good results. I also made a balsalmic dressing per the directions on the label and I think it tastes really good.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, this is a versatile product. You can make eight 8 oz. portions of salad dressing from one bottle, or use it to season various foods.  Either way, the results are very good, in my opinion.  I also like the fact that while sea salt is one of the main ingredients, the product does not taste salty.  I bought a couple of Costco/Kirkland seasoning products, one for fish and one for steaks, and the salt is very apparent in both.  This is a much more balanced product. Tasty, and nothing dominates in the blend.<br /><br />I liked it so much that I ordered the Napa and French versions of the seasonings from this manufacturer and can't wait to give those a try. I give this two thumbs up for taste and value.<br /><br />(added on 7/3/08): I had to update my review.  This and the other two flavors, the Napa and French, are soooo good.  Yes they are sort of pricey but compare the quantity to those little 1 oz or less containers they have at the store selling for $5 and these really are not a bad value at all.  I've been using these on all kinds of food and they are great.  Very flavorful, not too salty.  These are my "go-to" spices now.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Homemade Dressings' Herb Filled Salad Dressing Mix is wonderful idea for people who enjoy making their own dressings, rubs and sauces.<br /><br />In my household, we tried the recipe (on the bottle's label) for Classic Vinaigrette -- and were quite pleased with the result. Just two tablespoons of the mix was needed, and we were rewarded with a delicious dressing for very little effort.<br /><br />Because each bottle makes so many servings, a three-pack of this product will last you a very long time. And its versatility means that you'll find lots of uses for it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty and versatile product!
review/text: Each one of these bottles--and you get THREE--makes eight 8 oz. batches of salad dressing. So it goes a long way. I love the fact that this product is 100% natural and it's a great blend of spices that is extremely flavorful. I have tried the Classic Vinaigrette recipe, and it's scrumptious. All you do is mix 2 tablespoons of the salad dressing mix with 1/3 cup of wine or cider vinegar and 2/3 cup of olive oil or salad oil. I used red wine vinegar and olive oil and the dressing was a big hit with the entire family! Much better than the pre-mixed bottled dressings or the other mixes I've tried, like Good Seasons. I also have used the salad dressing mix as a dry rub for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and the flavor it infused into the meat was delectable. Tonight I am going to go back to the Classic Vinaigrette and use it to marinate pork chops before grilling. I also think the Homemade Dressings mix will work wonderfully as an all-purpose seasoning (like Mrs. Dash). The only minor complaint I have is that the product is pretty high in sodium, due to the abundance of sea salt in it. However, I don't think this will be a problem when used in moderation. All in all the Homemade Dressings mix is a very tasty and versatile product and I would recommend it to anyone. This dressing mix/dry rub/seasoning/marinade dynamo will have a permanent place on the shelf in my spice cabinet!

review/text: Compared to the little envelopes of Good Seasons Italian salad dressing mix this product is not only way tastier but a much better bargain.  I have to pay about $1.60 for one envelope of the Good Seasons brand but there has to be ten times that much in just one small canister of this Homemade Dressings mix.  First I made a batch of salad dressing following the recipe on the back of the canister and it is excellent.  Next I made a dip using Mori Nu firm light tofu (bought from Amazon), a few tablespoons of tomato paste, olive oil, and a tablespoon of this dressing mix, put it all in my small food processor and mixed.  Very good.  This stuff I think will prove to be super handy to have on the shelf for many reasons.

review/summary: Good, Not Extraordinary
review/text: So far I've tried this product in two recipes.  The first, a balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing, tasted rather good until the whole concoction congealed into a gloppy mess - probably my fault rather than that of the product - I may have used too much balsamic vinegar.  I also tried it as a spice rub on boneless skinless chicken breasts, and that was quite delicious.  The "spices" (mostly unidentified on the label) are a zesty mix of mainly Italian herbs with a pinch of sea salt, and while the product is flavorful, I wouldn't say it's significantly better than other spice mixes on the market, like the Mrs. Dash line.  The price seems a bit steep at more than $5.00 a bottle, but a little does seem to go a long way, and it promises to be a fairly versatile product.  I'll probably try it next, on the recommendation of another reviewer, as a pasta toss.

review/text: Finally, an herb mix that is both delicious and multi-purpose! It is billed as "salad dressing" but it is a lot more than that. You can mix up salad dressing (several recipes right on the label) but what I love most of all is how this can be used as a pasta sprinkle! Cook pasta, toss with good olive oil, sprinkle herbs, mix in some grated cheese and you have a meal that is good enough to serve to company. There is NO sugar in this mix. That's a plus for those of us who hate sugary dressings. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: A nice combination of taste-bud teasers
review/text: Although I wish the "ingredients" label would tell us what the "spices" are.<br /><br />I liked the zestiness imparted by this product, although something in it was a bit too spicy-hot for my palate, and in more than one case (marinade, and spaghetti sauce) I found that I had to add sugar (honey can be used too) to cut down on the excess piquancy.<br /><br />As a salad dressing, it imparts a nice ooomph. As a marinade to chicken it can be a bit overpowering (which is why I added the sugar).<br /><br />Although I haven't done so yet, it might be a very nice surprise ingredient to a quickbread or a flatbread.<br /><br />I used Olive oil or canola oil, and apple cider vinegar, when mixing up the marinade and/or the salad dressing.<br /><br />The lower sodium content is a big plus too.

Very versatile, reliable and flavorful, but not WHAM!, not "I have to have more of it for lunch today".  Just pretty good, alongside many other pretty good options for the summer salad season."<br /><br />Now, many montbs later, having used this on steaks, sea food, bread with olive oil, many mnay products, I want to say that I was too stinting in my praise.  This is excellent, a wonderful spice mix, something we have used, relied on, and enjoyed in many ways.  This has become a must-have for our pantry.

review/summary: New Salad Dressing Mix Is First-Rate.
review/text: A freshly minted company, Homemade Dressings, based in a suburb of Seattle has released three herbal products, salad dressing mixes designed for use with olive or similar oils.  Of the three, French Garden, Napa Garden, and Italian Garden, the latter is discussed here.  The 3.3 oz. plastic container has two pouring openings, one with a spoon in mind, the other with a trio of holes for sprinkling.  The company claims that the contents will make eight 8 oz. dressings (64 1 oz. servings).  Upon the containers are suggestions for seven uses: Classic Vinaigrette or Marinade; Balsamic Dressing; Honey Mustard; Natural Citrus Marinade & Grilling Sauce; Pasta Sauce; Dry Rub; All Purpose Seasoning; with suggestions for each application.  Also printed upon the containers are claims that the products are "100% natural" with "no sugar added".  It is additionally plain that there are no preservatives, fillers or thickeners within.  Other than "spices", interesting ingredients include sea salt, natural lemon juice powder, red bell pepper, onion and garlic.  This reviewer used the Italian Garden in the following fashion: as additive to homemade salad dressing; to pasta sauce; and as the suggested Honey Mustard dressing.  In each instance the mix added a great deal of piquant flavour to the food and must be highly recommended.  One can hope for an expansion of an already interesting line along with greater exposure, perhaps through health and nutrition oriented outlets.

review/text: I'm always looking for new spice products and combinations and it is fun to find one that is so versatile and yet one that doesn't overwhelm.  I do heartily recommend this.  My favourite use so far is very simple: freshly cooked pasta drizzled with a very good olive oil and tossed with just a bit of the dressing mix. Top that with some sliced cherry tomatoes and freshly grated Romano and you have a tasty dinner.

review/summary: Delightful Italian Herb Mix to Have On Hand
review/text: I did not have this in my hand for more than a few minutes when my husband grabbed it, pried open the inside sealer cap, and proceeded to measure it into a bowl saying, "Wow, let's try this new dressing mix"<br /><br />So, we have had a few chances to try it already!<br /><br />HOMEMADE DRESSINGS ITALIAN GARDEN Herb Mix is really wonderful.  We use many herbs in countless ways- even growing and drying out own.  This mix is an excellent quality and intensity of flavor.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />This mix is made of various spices, sea salt, garlic, red pepper, onion, citric acid, and natural lemon juice powder.<br /><br />The acid added to this mix makes it have the perfect pungency.  It accents the herbs beautifully.<br /><br />USES<br /><br />This jar has various uses listed on the side from salad dressings, to grilling marinades, dry rub, and pasta sauce.<br /><br />We have used it on pasta salad, salad dressing with lemon juice and olive oil as well as balsamic vinegar with olive oil.  We have also used it as a seasoning on eggs, on top of cucumber with a little fresh lemon juice, and with tofu dishes as well.  I also recently used it in a zucchini marinade for grilling- YUM!<br /><br />MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS MIX<br /><br />My family loves this mix.  We have been using it constantly since receiving it for just about anything we can think of.<br /><br />The sea salt makes this perfect- I do not use regular salt if at all possible, and the sea salt compliments this perfectly. The garlic is not too much or too little, and the flavor of the herbs is nicely blended.<br /><br />The label says that it makes 8-8oz dressings,and that would be a very heavily herbed flavor.  If you like less flavor, you can do with less if desired.<br /><br />The jar is a nice solid plastic jar with a shake or pour top on it, and it keeps the flavor in nicely.<br /><br />This herb mix was a BIG hit with my family.  It is definitely worth a try- and if you like to use herbs in salad dressings, sauces, and anything that you can get your hands on, be ready- you will go through this quickly!

review/summary: versatile spice for your kitchen for dressings....and MORE.
review/text: I really liked this item.  It is basically a blending of spices, an Italian blend that smells a bit of rosemary and garlic.  The container has recipes for honey mustard dressing, citrus marinade, balsamic dressing etc and suggests the use with pasta and as a rub for meat.  I made the honey mustard dressing and put over spinach greens with fresh fruit and it was delicious.  I would definitely use as a seasoning with fish or meat and thought it would also be nice to add to olive oil to dip french bread in.<br /><br />Very versatile!  Sure, you can make your own with herbs you grow or buy, but really....are you?  Yea, me either.  This was nice, simple and tasty, just like a blend you'd make yourself, but it is all done for you.  It has no sugar which is nice...why would you want that?  It is also not highly salted, but you could see bits of sea salt.  Perfectly seasoned for me.<br /><br />The salad....well, it was a hit, and I'm looking forward to trying more of the recipes and adding to my own recipes.

Simply add your own oil; olive or  vegetable oil works well.<br /><br />This product contains a nice mix of spices, and though it does contain salt, it is sea salt which gives a wonderful flavor.  The back of the package contains instructions for making some simple marinades and dressings, which is a nice touch, and gives you a great place to start with your concoctions.<br /><br />I made a great dip for bread I added a teaspoon to 4 tablespoons of olive oil and a heavy pinch of parmesan cheese. Made for a great dip similar to Carrabbas great dip!

review/summary: not too good
review/text: I was disappointed in this product.<br /><br />I tried the included recipe for "Classic Vinaigrette" - which consists of olive oil, red wine vinegar, and the salad dressing mix. The resulting dressing was greasy, salty, and overwhelmingly herbal in smell and taste. The herbs were so strong that the dressing smelled and tasted acrid and almost medicinal. Immediately I felt that I'd wasted my olive oil.<br /><br />Then, I tried using the dressing as 1) a dressing for a lettuce salad, 2) a dressing for pasta salad, and 3) a marinade for chicken...<br />1) As a salad dressing, it was pretty bad. Too salty, too greasy.<br />2) As a pasta salad dressing, it was also quite bad. The greasiness was terrible here; it made the pasta slimy. Also, the herbs didn't distribute evenly, so some bites were full of dried herbs, and some had hardly any.<br />3) The chicken marinade was the only success. The excess saltiness is fine in a marinade. And since you discard the marinade, the greasiness and pungency do not ruin the chicken. My chicken came out tender and well seasoned.<br /><br />Finally, I stored the dressing in the fridge for future use -- it didn't keep well at all. The oil coagulated and I had to heat and stir it before I was able to use it again.<br /><br />All in all, this salad dressing mix offers no benefits - it is not very convenient, it doesn't keep well, and most importantly, the dressing just doesn't taste good. Not recommended.

review/summary: Delicious nutritious sweet treat similar in flavor and texture to caramel sauce
review/text: I'm a regular customer of RawFoodWorld (Amazon Marketplace Seller) and often drop one of their "at cost" special onto my orders of staples I purchase from them which is how I became acquainted with Cinnamon Red Maca Almond Butter by JEM.<br /><br />The website says the only ingredients are almonds but here is what is on the jar: OG sprouted almonds, OG coconut palm sugar, OG red maca, OG cinnamon, OG vanilla<br /><br />The jar says it is low glycemic but somehow I doubt that as sugar is the second ingredient and it is SWEEEEEEEEET. I mean you would NOT want it on a sandwich. I spread little on apple slices and drank a chia slushy with it to keep me from going on a sugar high roller coaster ride. It is similar to a caramel sauce in flavor and texture.<br /><br />The jar says it was ground at less than 118�F. It is also noted: cold-processed raw red maca maintains superior anti-oxidant, nutrient content. amazingly, a single maca root contains almost 60 phyto-nutrients.<br /><br />it is delicious. I think while I would recommend it to others as a sweet dessert treat to serve with something, I probably would not purchase again but make my own version with superfoods but less sweet. I think too that it is a nice novelty item to add to a gift basket as well. But not for a Dr Mercola fan as he consistently says, if it is sweet, you should spit it out because it probably isn't good for you. I try to eat a balance of flavors and this is way too sweet for me. Though it would probably mask the taste of something you wanted to eat that was making you gag.<br /><br />I bet this would make an excellent milk by blending with 2 tablespoons with 1 cup of spring water and straining. I think I will try that next.<br /><br />I just want to add one more thing. The one I received was very fresh and it was obviously made, processed, packaged, and sent to me with high quality care every step along the way.

I shared this with my hubby and his brother (both native Peruvians) and they LOVED the maca flavor.  Needless to say, they have asked me to order more for them.

review/text: My search for the best corn bread mix continues...This time it's Jiffy! That small box at the grocery store for .89 i always overlooked. Well, good things do come in small packages :) This is some pretty good corn bread. As with most corn breads Jiffy had a gritty yet delicate texture. The corn flavor is on the mild side. Not amazing like my GM corn bread, but still good. I like my cornbread sweet (cause i like sweet corn) so i added maybe a tablespoon or more of honey to the batter. Came out very good. I haven't tried all the cornbread mix's but this one right now is the best.

review/text: If you're old enough, you remember when this stuff went on sale 4 boxes for 1.00 and it wound up being a side dish with a lot of meals. Nostalgia and consistency is the best reason to buy this cornbread mix.<br />The flavor is a bit sweet, and it's not vegan friendly.<br /><br />Because of how inexpensive it is, it's the corn bread a lot of my generation grew up on. I prefer the flavor and ease of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045ZA2JA">MARIE CALLENDER'S Original Cornbread Mix</a> now and add a bit of sugar to that for a more true to my memories flavor.<br /><br />The Marie Callender's is a just add water mix, the Jiffy needs an egg and milk. Powdered is fine if you're taking it camping, and the boxes are small enough to pack easily. It cooks up in a griddle over a fire very nicely and goes well with a lot of camp and fishing type meals.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Jiffy corn muffin mix before, I'd suggest buying a box at your local grocery store and trying it before committing to a pack of 24 boxes.

I've been using Marie Collander's for years but Jiffy had a big sale so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It was AWFUL! The texture is sandy and it does not rise. I baked it at the recommended temperature and time but it ends up very thin in the pan. And the taste is horrible.<br /><br />The fact that I just finished dinner and had to get on here immediately and write this negative review should be enough to scare you away from this product.<br /><br />I cannot overstate how awful this is.

review/text: This is, I believe, one of the best Knorr mixes I have ever had.  Add 300 grams of sliced mushrooms, saute in butter or margarine (butter is better) add the mix and 250 ml of water and cook for 5 minutes and voilla, a great mushroom and sauce.<br /><br />The directions are in Deutsch, but even if you are not a German speaker you should have no problems, there are pictures on the package.

review/summary: One of Knorr's best!
review/text: You simply can't go wrong with Knorr! This particular sauce mix is absolutely the greatest for pork dishes.  Having previously lived in Germany for nearly 30 years, I know that both this brand, as well as sauce mixes made by Maggi, are used in many gaste houses (restaurants) throughout Europe to create those delicious cream sauces found on e.g., pork medallions.  The unique blend of spices helps to create a taste not found in plain mushroom soup.  Of course real cream, rather than water, is usually used which further enhances the flavor of the sauce.  I usually use about half water and half, half and half for the required liquid content.  And, I never use oleo or margarine to sautee' the mushrooms.  Use real butter.  Recommend you serve this sauce over pork along with real German egg noodles (called spaetzle) and German rote-Kohl (red cabbage) for a truly scrumptious traditional German meal.  Both spaetzle and rote-kohl can be found in many of the larger supermarkets European food section.  Try to buy the rote-kohl "mit appfel" (with apple).  Or if you can't find it with apple, cut up about a half cup of most any RED apple (I use a Gala apple) and add it in.  Do not use any water as a liquid add in.  Instead, use about a half to one cup of RED wine.  I like to use Lambrusco.  Don't worry, the wine won't made you tipsey.  It simply enhances the flavor of the rote-kohl whereas water doesn't.  If you can't find these items locally, a wonderful web site for all kinds of German and other European specialties is[...]  I buy from them a lot especially around Christmas time when traditional German cookies and candies are available.  Their prices (for both their products and shipping) are a LOT LESS than those charged by the sellers listed here.  And, they have many German receipes IN ENGLISH and/or English translations for mixes requiring add in ingredients such as this sauce mix.  Their shipping is incredible.  If you love German or other European cuisine, give them a try.  You'll be glad you did!

review/summary: "Organic Flavor"?
review/text: I saw all the positive reviews so I thought I'd give this a try since it's a bit cheaper than my other favorite brands. Unfortunately, I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers, for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) To me, this doesn't taste like jasmine blossoms. Instead, it tastes and smells like artificial banana flavoring -- like what you'd find in banana-flavored chewing gum or Jelly Bellies. I don't even care for real bananas all that much, so this is definitely not a good thing.<br /><br />2) Speaking of flavoring -- the list of ingredients says "Organic Jasmine Green Tea and Organic Flavor." What the heck is "Organic Flavor"? Oh, they must mean "organic artificial-banana flavoring." ;)<br /><br />3) The strings of the tea bags are attached to the bag with a mini-staple. First off, I'm not too keen on the idea of brewing metal staples along with my tea. Second, one of the strings detached from its bag because the staple didn't hold it in place well enough -- and this happened the very first time I tried this tea. The detached string was a minor annoyance, but what if the staple itself detached from the bag and into the tea? It's small enough that it could be inadvertently swallowed.<br /><br />I think it's worth paying a little more for these (both of which I've tried and like):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028SWA7S">Choice Organic Whole Leaf Organics Jasmine Green Tea Pyramids, 15-Count, 1.05-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20E">Rishi Tea Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea, 2.99-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: I received a sachet of this tea when I ordered hot tea in a restaurant. It was so yummy that I put the empty packet in my wallet so I could look for it in a store. In every store I went into that sold tea, I'd pull out that packet and compare. I couldn't find it anywhere. They have it, of course, at the Good Earth web store but with shipping the cost was more than I wanted to pay. (Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!)<br /><br />I bought a case (6 boxes). So far, I've shared two boxes - one, a birthday gift for my best friend and one with my daughter in a college care-package.<br /><br />Hot or cold, black or green, this is my favorite jasmine tea.

review/summary: INcredible cake!
review/text: I'm giving this 5 stars but only if you're experienced in handling a really slack, soft dough and because it's so complete, authentic and VERY good tasting.  It really should only give it 4 stars because the yeast was dead - so proof it before you rely on it!  I put it in my bread machine on the 'dough' cycle and when it got all done and ready to form, it was flat as a flitter.  It was late at night so I just got out a teaspoon of my own SAF yeast and started it over - other brands would need 2 teaspoons.  I let it run long enough to get really mixed in, stopped the machine, dumped the really sticky dough from the pan into a quart sized (un-oiled) zip top bag and tossed it in the fridge until the following evening.  I would recommend that everyone give it an overnight rest in the fridge.  The dough wasn't nearly as sticky and was a 'piece of cake' to handle, albeit, I don't recommend making it in a hot kitchen.  The dough is easier to work with in a cool environment.  Keep just a light dusting of flour on your surface being careful not to work in too much extra flour...when you're rolling it out and it keeps shrinking back, just let it rest there on your dough board for 10 minutes and roll it out some more, rest again, until you get it rolled out.  I didn't get it to measurements - I stopped at about 12"X18" and it still ended up being a lot longer as I rolled it up.<br /><br />I suggest to definitely use the cream cheese and lightly toasted chopped pecans then dust with the praline sugar that's included in the package.  It could use more than an 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese, I think.  As you roll it up, sorta pull it toward you as you roll so you can roll it up fairly tight and get lots of swirls in it when you cut it.  It's real easy to make it into a circle and put the two ends together...kinda push one end up into the other one and just stretch the other end dough over it and you can hardly find the seam!<br /><br />I baked it on a parchment lined 13" pizza pan.  Form it on your work surface and move it to the pan, get it as round and even as you can - brush with egg wash - 1 egg and whisk in a tablespoon of water. Put a cup of water in your microwave and let it boil.  Quickly but carefully take the cup out of the oven and put your cake in there and close the door and you've got a perfect environment for it to raise - don't open the door until it's raised big and puffy.  It gets a lot bigger than you'd think!  It completely filled the 13" pan to the edges.  Watch it as it bakes and if it gets brown on top, make a circle out of foil and just set it lightly over the top and it'll continue to brown the sides without overdoing the top.<br /><br />It says to use 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla or water to make the glaze.  Unless you have white vanilla, use water.  Regular vanilla turned it yucky tan and I tossed it and made my own with just water.  The cake is blooming with flavor so you don't really need the vanilla essence in the glaze.<br /><br />I had never seen, eaten, made nor even heard of a King Cake before.  I have dear friends that met in New Orleans and wanted to surprise them out here in Arizona in the middle of September with a king cake for their birthdays...and a surprise it was!  He asked me if I was surprised that he knew that it was a king cake and I said no because you lived in New Orleans, were YOU surprised that I knew what one was!  They were flabbergasted to say the least - and blown away when I told them there was a baby Jesus in it (under it), too!  I will order more mixes and make them for the holidays and during Mardi Gras - and any other time I want to impress!<br /><br />When you look at your huge, beautiful, unique cake, you'll definitely see that it's totally worth the $7-$8 you have in it!  My brother in Georgia sends me pecans fresh off his tree so I don't have to buy pecans.  He even takes them somewhere and gets them shelled and sorted!  Lots of rain in the south this year so there should be an abundance of pecans!<br /><br />So, try it, you'll be really glad that you have to buy 2 when you order from Amazon!

review/text: The cake came out great.  The baby, colored sugar, icing mix, praline sugar all includeed.  You will need to add water, 1.5 sticks of butter, 3 whole eggs, 2 egg yolks, vanilla and (optional)8 oz cream cheese. You can make it in bread machine, which is what I did, or a mixer.  It is a bread so it will need to rise - you can't make it 2 hours before your guests arrive.  I let is rise overnight in the fridge (follow included directions) so I could get that step done early. I did the cream cheese filling and I wish I had spread 12 oz of cream cheese just because there were some pieces that were skimpy on the cream cheese. Very easy to follow the included directions. The kids loved it too...

review/summary: Best Gluten Free bread we have found!
review/text: On a recent trip to Utah we picked up several New Grains GF breads and found them the best GF breads we have ever had. This bread in particular is our favorite. It tastes good, has a nice texture and is amazing toasted with butter and jam. In fact, after eating this on our week long trip we decided we liked it better than most traditional breads, this bread is good.<br /><br />We liked it so much that we bought a bunch and brought it home, unfortunately after freezing it gets a little crumbly so be careful. We've had this same issue with any GF breads we've tried to freeze. If you can avoid freezing (refridgerate only), you'll avoid the crumbling issues.<br /><br />Since we liked the New Grains breads and cookies so well, we also tried cooking with their flour. Give it a shot if you like to do your own baking. New Grains Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour Mix (5 lbs)<br /><br />5 stars, for the best GF bread we have tasted.

review/summary: Sweet, sour, spicy crunchy...yummy
review/text: This is a mix of puffed rice, dried noodles made of chickpea flour (besan or gram), toasted lentils and peanuts. The name "Khatta Meetha" means "Sour-Sweet" in Hindi and that is an accurate description of the flavor of these lightly-spiced crunchy bits.<br /><br />So what do you do with something that looks like Chex Mix (kinda-sorta) and is a curry spiced flavor? You can eat it out of hand for a snack or you can use it to top a kind of salad called "Chaat." I do an Americanized version as a dinner or lunch salad and here's my recipe.<br /><br />1 or 2 cups chopped Romaine lettuce<br />1/2 chopped tomato<br />A few tbs chopped Vidalia onion<br />One medium potato, boiled and diced<br />1/4 cup Khatta Meetha mix<br />1/4 cup plain low fat yogurt<br />1 - 2 tbs tamarind chutney<br />chopped cilantro<br /><br />Toss everything together. You can add a tsp of "Chaat Masala" which is a kind of spice with black salt, a sulfurous salt that adds a sort of eggy flavor to the salad. It can be omitted. This is a rather spicy salad, depending on the spiciness of the chutney you use. It is about the spiciness of a taco salad and a bit reminiscent of one. A chopped orange is also nice added to the salad, as is avocado, cucumber or bell pepper. One concept of Ayurvedic Indian cooking is to include all the four flavors (salt, sweet, sour, bitter) as a way to satisfy the appetite. If you add a slightly bitter vegetable such as cucumber or some bitter fruit like grapefruit, and the chaat masala, you will have a salad that covers all the bases.
