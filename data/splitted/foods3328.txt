review/summary: Broken Chips
review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/summary: Best tortilla chips snack, period!
review/text: We only buy organic natural foods without any hydrogenated oil or MSG. These chips are the best we have ever tried. We like the other Garden of Eatin' flavors we have ordered, but these hot spicy blues are the best. Truly if you like spicy you will crave these and nothing else will do. Even our 9-yr-old loves them! As of this writing we are down to 1 bag and they are currently unavailable - Amazon, please BRING THESE BACK!

review/summary: A rare low-salt chip
review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

review/summary: a little too salty for my tastes....but....
review/text: I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

review/text: These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/text: I've been a subscriber to the Blue Chips with no salt added for about a year now and love them. These chips are great for nachos or with good salsa, and probably other things I haven't tried. Now that I've been eating them without salt for so long, eating salted chips is like an overload. You'll get used to it and appreciate the health benefits.<br /><br />I only wish they were cheaper and came in bigger bags!<br /><br />My mouth is watering now...

review/summary: not correc size
review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: Why do I even have other food?
review/text: I've never had traditional Irish soda bread, so while I can't speak to this product's authenticity I will say that it is amazing bread.  It is easy enough to make that even I could do it if my boyfriend refused.  It only calls for one ingredient, and that's buttermilk.  For the first two boxes, I kept a carton on hand but I got tired of that since it's not used for anything else but boxty.  I ended up buying powdered buttermilk on Amazon to use with this, and I can't tell any significant difference.  I highly recommend this if you like bread at all.  Dense, but a very nice texture.  I have noticed that when my boyfriend is making it, he keeps a bag of flour out next to him and adds a bit.  It sounds like the amount of buttermilk called for might be a little too much to make good dough, so I suggest measuring out the amount they call for but only pouring three quarters of it into the bowl.  You can always add more if you need to.

review/summary: Easy to make and yummy
review/text: You wouldn't think it could be so easy to make traditional Irish soda bread that tastes so good.  All you have to do is add buttermilk, stir and bake.  It really is that simple.  The best part though is the taste.  Garvey's Irish Soda Bread comes out lightly golden brown on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside... and delicious.  I like it with just a little butter or strawberry jam.  My 3 year old loves it too, which is great since it is organic.

review/text: I first tasted soda bread from an authentic Irish restaurant that served carrot soup and Shepard's Pie.  I have been on a quest to find that matching flavor, and Garvey's produced it.  This soda bread was as good as the home-made stuff, and so much easier.  For real soda bread, try Garveys.

review/text: Excellent product. Had a big family dinner with very picky eaters attending last week. I bought the Garvey's Organic Irish Soda Bread Mix per a suggestion from a friend that loves it. He was right! Turned out perfect with crisp outside and soft inside. Everyone in the family loved it, even the picky eaters. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Does a body good!
review/text: Wow this one whisks up really nicely! Granted I am getting better at whisking and making a nice froth on top of my matcha but this one was easy peasy! I have noticed some matcha flavors mix more easily than others for some reason and since I do make more than one matcha many days its not just due to me being better one day versus another. This one whisked up to a very full forth quite easily! I note this because I know froth is really something many of us struggle with especially when we are new to matcha so I wanted to make a note of it for those of you who may feel deflated by not getting a good foam. Get this one and you can feel stellar! lol<br /><br />Now as for taste, I am not one who has had a lot of passion fruit in their life, other than in smoothies I have got from smoothie places and those are usually so riddled with sugars and other fruits picking out the passion fruit itself was a little difficult especially not having passion fruit in and of itself.<br /><br />Now I get to taste real passion fruit! Yay!<br /><br />It has a bit of this natural rind like flavor similar to that you sometimes get in a mango or papaya. Fruits I do have personal experience with. I like it though - it really compliments the natural grassy like flavor of the matcha base! And contrary to the smoothies I have had its not that sweet. There is a tart flavor to it but not bitter. It tastes REALLY healthy, and while matcha is always healthy sometimes I feel guilty having my dessert like matcha lol although I shouldn't such as my favorite butterscotch mathca makes me feel like I'm cheating haha this one makes me feel like I am really doing something good for my body and trust me my body needs all the help it can get!<br /><br />The aroma of this one is really quite nice! It is very eye opening and even if its only a mental thing I sure can use that in the mornings!<br /><br />There is the after taste of the rind like flavor but the passion fruit flavor makes my mouth water for more, literally, as if the juices itself are pulling out the watery mouth sensation! Its strange but nice. Its like having a mouth full of juicy passion fruit!<br /><br />So I drank half of my matcha straight, then added some sparkling italian water and some sweet cream non dairy creamer to make an italian soda and OMG goodness! The flavors ERUPT into a juicy fruit gum sensation which is similar in some ways to the brandy matcha I am going to review next! It is different though as the brandy also has alcohol notes to it whereas this one does not. This is like the virgin variable you give your kids while you have the brandy one haha. Except this has that lovely awakening rind flavor in the background that lingers in the after taste.

review/summary: Fruity, light, refreshing
review/text: I've had "passionfruit" flavored teas that tasted nothing like passionfruit. Red Leaf's passionfruit matcha is not one of them. This delicious tropical fruit flavor definitely shines alongside the base matcha. I prefer this matcha cold, though I plan to try it hot come winter. It'll be perfect for summer daydreaming, because there's something about the flavor of passionfruit that screams summer. It's well captured in this matcha. The flavor isn't heavy, but I do find that just the slightest touch of milk/cream really rounds out the cup. Another hit from Red Leaf!

review/text: True, the title of this product needs to be more accurate (or change the ingredients to match the title of the canister).  At the same time, this hot chocolate has a wonderful cinnamon flavor which I haven't found in another hot chocolate.  One can always add cayenne pepper (or chili powder) to give the cocoa the kick the drinker can tolerate.  What I also like about this product is that there's no milk by-products so I can safely give it to my kids with alternative milks.

review/summary: Great for Celiacs and Gluten Intolerant and a Truly Mexican Flavor Profile but
review/text: if you are looking for "Spicey", like a dark chocolate candy bar with cayenne or chili pepper, then this is different. Much milder than a spicey dark chocolate bar, but extremely close to the octoagonal Nestle chocolate discs you find in Mexico that is dropped into hot milk to make a creamy hot chocolate. Also a good option for celiacs or gluten intolerant as it is a "dutch" chocolate and there is no high fructose corn syrup; also no preseratives. Even with no preservatives, shelf life is at least a year after opening.<br />Cinnamon profile is also very authentic.  Used to buy at World Market but they discontinued two years ago.<br />So pleased to find it on Amazon. Makes a great Christmas hostess gift or stocking stuffer.

Very disappointed especially with the high price ($12.95) at the local shop.  If you are really looking for spicy, this is not the hot chocolate for you.

review/text: I love salt water taffy, but wanted only black licorice which I couldn't find easily.  So I tried this, and the taste isn't exactly the same, but I still love it.  Also, if you're curious about how much 3 lbs is, like I was, it's about enough to fill a small shoebox.  The day mine came it was 90 degrees outside, so there was a little melting.  Luckily taffy never has a perfect shape and I just stuck it in the fridge to harden.  All in all, I might get it again.  The price is a bit of an issue, taffy always seems expensive for candy... but if I had a gift card, I wouldn't hesitate to get it again.

review/summary: A healthy snack I don't mind giving my kids!
review/text: My children love these fruit rolls... and I love that they are a healthy snack!  Unlike fruit rolls made by other brands, these are simply made with pureed fruit & fruit juice.  That's all!  No added sugars... nothing in the ingredient list that you can't pronounce.  Each roll is about 80 calories, 16g of carbs, and has 14g of (natural) sugar.

review/text: My kids had been taunted by fruit roll-ups, but I just couldn't bring myself to buy them.  Enter Fruitabu - Smooshed Fruit.  That's all...fruit...smooshed.  Yes, still has lots of sugar (naturally occurring), but has none of the extra junk you find in other brands.  My kids love them.

review/summary: Puroast Low Acid Vanilla Decaf Coffee
review/text: This isn't as good as regular coffee and it's hard to detect any vanilla flavoring but it's been a godsend for me nonetheless.  It has allowed me to drink coffee again and I'm very grateful.  It took a little while to get used to it because it is quite different from non-low acid coffee but now I really enjoy it and will continue to buy it.  I just wish it were available locally and that I could buy a cup of this in a coffee shop.

review/summary: good, but not great
review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/summary: Add lots of bits of time to your life
review/text: Not only do you not have to unwrap each caramel individually but the bits melt much faster. I put the package contents in a 1 qt. glass bowl and add 1 Tbsp of water.  Using an old microwave I heat on high for 90 sec, stir and then two more times on high for 30 sec., stirring each time. That's it! It takes 1 min. less time. Note: if using a newer microwave, you might have to lower the power - you want to slowly melt, not create big bubbles.<br /><br />I could not find these in stores in Seattle, so ordered a box of 12 from Amazon. A very smooth transaction, no shipping cost and they will all be used up long before the expire date of 9/30/2011.

I immediately went on amazon to purchase it since the inventor said he sold it on there. Thanks so much to whoever invented this fabulous product!! I just love it and have been sharing this product with my friends and family!! I obviously highly recommend it.

review/text: I love black licorice, but not just any black licorice.  I'm very fussy - I want real molasses and licorice extract in my licorice, not corn syrup and artificial flavors.  Panda is the real thing and it tastes divine.  I am on the subscription service now because this is the only licorice I want to eat and I can't always find it locally.  Also, the new ziploc packaging is wonderful - it keeps the licorice fresh and soft.  So, if you love the taste of black licorice, stop eating junk and try Panda.  You'll be hooked!

review/text: We love this style and the regular style.  Made from ground chickpeas and natural flavors, it is a great healthy snack. You can eat it in minutes of mixing but it tastes better if you let it set for an hour or two first.  A good quality EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) mixed in to taste will make it taste even better.  Our football team likes this with Fritos Scoops or pita bread.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I have been eager to try a Wispa since they were reintroduced fairly recently. I was glad I could get them on Amazon. I have to say, though, that they are no match for an Aero Bar.<br /><br />Service-wise, my candy arrived quickly, but unfortunately, it was dry and crumbly on the ends. I don't think this is the fault of the merchant; I think that the bar itself probably does not hold up well to shipping.<br /><br />The bubbles were not fully formed like the ones you find in Aero Bars. They were smaller and less pronounced. The flavor was very bland; the "bite" of the Aero Bar was missing.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried this bar, but I'll be sticking to Aero from now on.

Now I'll be on the roof a full day replacing shingles when I should have been finishing up other projects. I'm feeling pretty upset that the the manufacturer would say it is safe for use on the roof when it obviously is not... Couldn't be more unhappy with it...

review/summary: Maybe I have super moss..
review/text: This is the second moss "killing" product that I have tried for around a few trouble spots on the front lawn.  The first brand was safer brand moss killer.  It did absolutely nothing to even alter the mosses condition and smelled like I was doing little more than spraying orange juice on the lawn.  I decided to give this brand a go since it actually has more "chemical" properties to it rather than having an active ingredient of citrus.  Per the packaging instructions I gave the moss a thorough soak down with the product as I did with the safer brand product.  At first it looked like the moss was starting to turn a yellowish color at around day 2 and I thought it was working great.  That was until it rained out.  A few days later I was unhappy to determine that more moss has grown and what was starting to turn yellow has now come back full force.  *Note* It did not rain for at least a week after I sprayed this.  So, it's not like I sprayed it and then it happened to rain out a few minutes later.  Combined with the other reviewers complaints about it staining concrete and other surfaces I would suggest to try something else.  I will be trying scotts brand granules next, that actually rely on being wet down.
