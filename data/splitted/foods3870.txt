review/text: You'll have to get the treat ball to place these in - depending on the size of treats will depend on the size of the ball. Our dogs love mint flavored treats, bones - so this was a must. I have to take it away after awhile because it does get messy (on carpet especially) and I save it for later. Smaller dogs will take awhile longer to eat which is good. Make sure anytime you give your canine a bone or treat that provides hours of chewing, they are under your supervision.<br /><br />A great treat to keep your doggie busy for awhile :)

review/summary: Cute little gift set, but not for the serious lover of HOT stuff
review/text: I picked up one of these little "spicy 12-packs" last year from a hot sauce shop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I've long been a fan of the Dave's range of sauces and was very taken with the little miniature sampler bottles and the chance to try out so many of their sauces for a relatively good price. The bottles live on my desk at work and I've been merrily sampling my way through them for a while now.<br /><br />This is a great little set that will ensure you always have something slightly different to try depending on your mood, but for the serious lover of outrageously hot sauces like myself, there is nothing new to discover here. That's not a bad thing - these sauces are all as flavorful and complex as you'd expect from this company, and with such a wide range of flavors there's something to match just about any meal. If you're already familiar with some of the hotter sauces in the Dave's range, though, what you won't find here is anything new in the way of sauces that will give you that endorphin rush that comes from a sky-high Scoville rating. By far the hottest of the bunch here is Temporary Insanity (a "mere" Insane on the Dave's Insanity scale), and I already had a bottle of that lurking in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm not knocking this set at all, though - it's something that will be appreciated by anyone who likes things slightly on the hot side looking to sample a few and find a new favorite. If you're like me and find yourself going out to eat and wishing the place stocked some decent hot sauce, these little bottles are the perfect size to stash in your bag before you go. I polished off my mini-bottle of Rowdy Red Chile within a few days and refilled the bottle with Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce. That bottle now lives in my purse and comes with me everywhere I go, so never again will I have to endure a breakfast that fails to blow my head off in the expected fashion!<br /><br />I'd love to see a similar set featuring ALL the really hot sauces in the range - that would be something I'd pick up in a second.

review/summary: Great way to try a lot of flavors but the bottles are teeny tiny
review/text: I love hot sauces and I am always looking for new flavors and so this was a great way to try a lot of them without having to buy larger bottles. And I already found a number I will be buying the larger versions of.<br /><br />But the bottles are tiny. If you ever saw those tiny bottles of Tabasco sauce ... they are even a touch smaller than those! So at best, you will get once serving out of a bottle. Not a problem if you are expecting that. So this is mostly a heads up.

review/summary: Delicious, almost as good as Cafe Britt
review/text: I've been buying Costa Rican coffee direct from that country's largest export roaster for over a decade and love their products, especially their Tarrazu, Tres Rios and Poas blends.  But prices have been creeping up faster than other coffees.<br /><br />I tried this blend of Tarrazu from Coffee Bean Direct. I think this flavor is just a tiny bit less fabulous than the other brand, but still delicious. It's robust, flavorful, not overpoweringly strong, and not burnt or bitter tasting. I'm satisfied to drink it daily. The delivery service is equally fast, just 2 or 3 days from order date.<br />The savings are significant enough that I think it's worth a try; it's less than $8 / pound, where the other is about $13.00 / pound when you buy 5 lbs.<br /><br />I also tried Coffee Bean Direct's Italian Espresso blend and found it very tasty, but I cannot compare it as easily with other supplier's since I don't drink that flavor as often.  Finding two good ones is a good sign.  But buying 5-pounds at a time makes taking a chance on a new blend a bit scary, I think.  And I would not want to open two bags at once to rotate my morning selection since 10 lbs won't stay fresh long enough.

review/text: This is very good Whole bean coffee at a really good price.  I had tried the Costa Rican Tarrazu coffee previously and was looking to re-order, but I didn't pay enough attention, and ordered the "Dark", which I am guessing is double roasted (or French Roasted).  At first I was a bit disappointed, normally I don't care for double roasted coffees, turns out this one is pretty good, I will make sure I pay closer attention for my next order though.  This is a good full flavored coffee but not as strong as other double roasted coffees I've tried.

review/summary: Like sweet?
review/text: I was totally disappointed with this coffee.  I love Costa Rican coffee but not this one.  For my taste buds it was WAY too sweet as I like a more bold and balanced flavor like Tullys Italian Roast, and the Costa Rica Dark Roast at some of the Costcos.  I started using this by itself and the ladies here, who love chocolate, loved it and rated it a 9.  So, I tried to balance it by grinding it with 50/50 ratio with French Roast from Trader Joe's which helped, but I finally found the right blend when I added Trader Joe's Italian Roast in 50/50 blend.  Would I order this again?  No.

Compared to the prices of other Costa Rican Dark Roasts, this is the best deal going.  For example, most other companys charge about $9 per 12oz bag. Coffee Bean Direct comes out to $5.88 a 12oz bag and I feel this is better than those others. I used to buy from Cafe Brit, but that will now change.

review/text: For years I couldn't really drink coffee without suffering some kind of upset stomach, be it cramps, nausea what have you.  I discovered The Bean at Coachella this past April, and I have to say that this is a coffee saver for me!  The low acid/antioxidant mix is exactly what I needed.  I can now enjoy coffee again, without the nasty stomach side effects.  If you have ever suffered from the same symptoms due to coffee, you might want to try this brand.  The Hawaiian Hazelnut is precisely the blend I usually drink, so I am thrilled that the Bean has introduced it.  I highly recommend it!

When I saw this, I saw two things (Hawaiian blend, and Hazelnut) so I immediately wanted to try it. So I bought it, and brewed some as soon as I could and I really, really like this coffee. This coffee seems to have the perfect balance between the coffee taste and the flavor which is awesome because many times flavored coffees taste just like a regular coffee blend.<br /><br />The only thing that I did not like was the fact that the bags are not resealable.

review/text: This really is good coffee. It's smooth and goes down easy which is why I'm giving it five stars. However, I was looking for an organic Hazelnut coffee. This isn't it and unfortunately it's difficult to tell from description and reviews. So, for the record, there is NO HAZELNUT FLAVOR (in my opinion) associated with this coffee. Maybe that's obvious for more knowledgeable coffee drinkers, I don't know. I tried researching to make sure I was getting what I wanted, an organic hazelnut-flavored coffee. Anyway, I hope that this review will be helpful for someone looking for the same thing.

review/summary: Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!
review/text: We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.

review/summary: Egyptian camomile
review/text: Although I received this tea prior to expected receive date, I was originally disappointed with what I received from the seller. I wrote to the seller and told them that the tea I received didn't have any camomile flowers in it. I was quite disappointed. I am very glad I did this because the seller immediately contacted me back with an explanation, and to let me know they were shipping a new bag of Camomile. The original bag contained tea from the bottom of the barrel. They apologized, and shipped the new tea. I received the second shipment before the original shipping date had passed. The quality of the tea was much better. I was very happy with the way the seller handled this problem.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NGJDL6">Egyptian Camomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea - Loose Leaf - 8oz - .5lb</a>

review/summary: The only tomato soup I will eat
review/text: I'm really really picky when it comes to tomato soup and this is the only brand I like.  I usually buy it in our local grocery but thought I'd try getting it on Amazon.  I should have looked a little closer to the description....the photo shows the 32 oz. box but this pack you are getting the 16 oz.  boxes, which makes sense given the price....I thought I was getting a killer deal because the 32oz boxes go for $6 each in the store and these were working out to like $2 something.  They do have a 6 pack of the 32 oz soup that works out to about $4.14 which is still a good deal.  My own fault for not realizing the photo is the wrong one.  The soup is still tasty and came packaged well.  Good for our cool winter nights in February.

review/text: Found this soup for $1.25 box at Big Lots and thought I would give it a try.  OMG it was soooo good, I ran to look at the label to find out how bad I'd been after having a big bowl.  Pleasantly surprised to realize not only is it organic, but there's no heavy cream and it's low in fat!  Went back and cleared the shelves.  Perfect for a quick and tasty lunch or dinner during these cooler winter nights.  Great with garlic croutons, garlic bread, or grilled cheese.  To really go all out, dress it up w/some fresh basil and a dollup of sour cream or creme fraiche - as good as any tomato bisque I've had in a restaurant.

review/summary: Best tomato soup
review/text: I have a hard time finding packaged food of any type, without dairy in it; even potato chips these days have it. The Imagine Organic is just tomato soup, no other BS in it. It is the best tasting too. At one time this soup could be purchased at TJ's, but since they have their own brand, it has dairy & I can't consume it. There are health food stores with it, but I wanted to give Amazon a try. It was delivered as promised & in good condition.

review/summary: Quite Good. Low In Fat And Calories.
review/text: I picked up a box (16 ounces) of Imagine Organic Creamy Tomato Soup at my nearby grocer. I'm certain it is exactly the same soup as this, but it comes in a slightly different package. Right on the outside, it says "New Package same size." In any case, I had a bowl with my evening meal. It was quite good. I wouldn't rate it with the best tomato soup I've ever had, but it was much better than ordinary canned varieties. It has a good fresh tomato flavor and a nice creamy texture that allows it to go down easy. The soup seems a little high in sodium, not apparent by taste, which seems to be the case with many prepared soups. The fat and calories are low. It's a nice soup and went well with the other foods I had.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Delicious (I mix it with other whole grains)
review/text: First time I've tried this grain.  I mixed it with some organic quinoa that I recently purchased.  It was delicious!<br /><br />I combined the two grains (the amaranth and the quinoa) together (1/2 cup of each) and rinsed them first (which can be a chore with the amaranth since the grains are soooo tiny -- you really need cheesecloth to strain the amaranth grains when rinsing).<br /><br />Then I soaked the combined rinsed grains (in 1 and 3/4 cup of warm water with 1 tablespoon + 2 1/4 teaspoons of raw apple cider vinegar - I use Bragg's) for 7 hours.<br /><br />NOTE:  I did the soaking in my rice maker on the WARM setting (when soaking grains you want to keep the mixture warm) so at the end of the 7 hours soak I just flipped on the rice maker from WARM to COOK and let it cook (my rice maker shuts off automatically when the grains are done).  (Yes, you can just cook it in the water that it's been soaking in!)  I added a little sea salt to the mixture and gave it a good stir.<br /><br />Made 2 very delicious servings.

review/summary: Finally, baby prunes that aren't like water!
review/text: I looked everywhere for prunes for my son when he started solids and was getting constipated.  It seemed like my only choices were prune juice (which ended up everywhere), or watery stage 1 prunes that barely stayed on the spoon.  I saw these on amazon so I gave them a try and they were great.  Perfect thickness for a stage 2 food, my son loved them (and would probably eat them every day if he could), and not as much mess as juice or stage 1 prunes.

review/summary: Great texture, unbeatable price
review/text: These prunes are just the right texture because they are not as runny as stage 1 prunes and stay put right on the spoon so feeding isn't so messy.  I had a big problem with stage 1 foods running off the spoon and getting all over baby, the floor, etc.  I am only able to find stage 1 prunes in my local stores, so it is great that I can order them and they ship really fast.  Also, the 4 oz size is great.  We use 1/2 jar each morning with oatmeal cereal, and so one box lasts almost a month!  Of course prices change, but they are DRAMATICALLY cheaper than Gerber, and larger jars than Earth's best while also being a thicker texture.  I haven't tried any other varieties from this brand, but I highly recommend the prunes.

A base of brown sugar, cayenne pepper, lemon pepper,garlic, and cinnamon, sprinkle on liberally. Its not too hot but it does have transformative power. Also works well with John Boy and Billy's Original or Hot Grillin' Sauce. (THE best BBQ sauce on the market).

review/summary: New formula and not as good as it used to be
review/text: I'd been feeding the flaked salmon entr&eacute;e to my cats for a few years and they really loved it. However, the formula has just changed. It used to have a solid consistency, and now it is very `soupy.' If you shake the can it actually sounds like you are shaking a can of soup! Not only were all of the cans I recently bought from Amazon like this, but I also went to a pet store and shook the cans there and they too were `soupy,' so it wasn't just a bad batch that I received. I think Blue Buffalo is now watering down the Flaked Salmon canned food, which is a shame. This food isn't cheap and I don't want to buy a watered down version of what they used to sell.<br /><br />I've switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WFQC">Blue Buffalo Healthy Gourmet Flaked Tuna Entree Canned Cat Food</a>. It still has the original consistency and my cats are very happy with it.

I made the mistake, however, of assuming that, just becuase I found a product on AMAZON.COM that I was assured of getting a good price.  Rather than check the price on these Keurig K-cups, I ordered my favorite brand, ASSUMING I was getting a good price.  After receiving these, I learned from a friend that I had grossly over paid; I learned that I could find this product on coffee K-cup websites for half the price.  I was very disappointed that AMAZON.COM did not gurantee the "best price".  Next time, I'll be more aware.

review/text: Green Mountain coffee is always amongst the best and most tasty of coffees on the market.  Once again, they score extremely high with their hazelnut, which is possibly the best flavored coffee I have tasted.

review/summary: Light roast not Regular!!!!!
review/text: This is NOT the regular roast Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee that came along with your Keurig Coffee maker, but a much lighter roast. The picture is misleading and shows the k cup that matches the regular roast. The light roast has the word Noisette written under it. I ordered two boxes and received this lighter roast, I noticed the word light roast on the box as well. I complained and was told that they would send me the regular roast, but to my dismay they once again sent me the light roast. I find the light roast taste similar to run thru coffee and has a weak hazelnut flavor. I am very disappointed in this whole transaction and will order straight from the wholesaler next time. Sorry, Amazon I really love shopping with you, but ya'll drop the ball on this one.

review/summary: New to Keurig and fond of flavored coffee, but this stuff is weak
review/text: I'm not someone who needs incredibly strong coffee, but after we received a Keurig as a wedding gift, Green Mountain Hazelnut and French Vanilla were the first two  packs of K-cups we bought.  We were disappinted with both.  The flavoring is good, but the coffee itself is weak, even with the coffeemaker set lower.  Recommend you buy Coffee People Jet Fuel and some flavored creamer instead.

review/summary: Decent, not as good as Green Mountain Coffee Brew Over Ice Hazelnut
review/text: I purchased this due to originally trying Green Mountain Coffee Brew over Ice hazelnut and loved it. I thought they used the same coffee and just slapped a Brew Over Ice logo on the product but they do not. The Brew Over Ice variety offers a better hazelnut aroma and tastes a bit more like hazelnut all around. While this Hazelnut K-cup isn't bad, it's not the best, it's definitely not the worst. I typically do not drink flavored coffee (Unless it's at Starbucks) but I was expecting a lot more hazelnut than this has offered. If you're looking for a good coffee with a hint of hazelnut flavor, this is great. If you want to be hit with hazelnut flavoring try something else or buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RM">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

review/text: I like Green Mountain coffee and have for quite some time. These K-Cup packs seem to lack the punch of freshly brewed Green Mountain in can get at your local neighborhood convenience store. This particular blend I found rather lackluster and just plain weak. Still, it was good in a pinch.

review/text: It was a little weak for my taste however I do like the flavor of it. If you want a light flavored coffee this is a nicely flavored coffee. If you have more of a taste for a medium strength coffee as I do this might not be for you. I personally won't buy this one again but I can't recommend against it as it may be perfect for some people.

I didn't know just how much I didn't like Hazelnut until a friend gave me a box of it because she didn't like it. I don't like it either.<br /><br />However, if you are a lover of hazelnut coffee, this is probably very good. In fact, every other Green Mountain K-cup that I've tried has been very good. This one is just a matter of personal taste.

review/text: Nabob is my very favorite Tassimo coffee, and I was horrified when Amazon dropped it from Prime. Then for a while it was only available from a Canadian shipper (it's made in Canada), and the delivery time was ridiculously long (over a month!). When I last ordered it, it came from Florida and was delivered promptly, and I was very pleased. Now it's finally back on Prime and even available on Subscribe and Save! Yay! This coffee is just what I want coffee to be: smooth, mellow, neither burned nor weak, in two words: Just Right! Goldilocks and I agree that Nabob, indeed, is the perfect coffee!
