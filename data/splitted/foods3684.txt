review/summary: Go Caribou!
review/text: OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school librarian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K-Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee-fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm brewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the librarian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the librarian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?  Thanks, Keurig, for making Caribou a part of my daily life!

review/summary: Good entry in the K-cup portfolio
review/text: Caribou makes a series of coffees; my current favorite is Mahogany. However, this, too is nice on the palate. The package describes the taste thus: "Caribou blend begins with a delightful heaviness on your palate and finishes with a relaxing balance of bittersweet chocolate and fruity flavors."<br /><br />For tree huggers and environmentalists, Caribou--as a company--is a member of the Rainforest Alliance, designed to "protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that depend on them. . . ."<br /><br />The coffee? I like it. It is not my favorite K-cup product, but it is tasty. I would have preferred a bit more boldness to the taste, but it is smooth and has a nice aftertaste.<br /><br />If you've entered the Keurig world, this might well be worth trying out. . . .

review/text: There is not much to say about this Caribou medium blend coffee.  It has an unremarkable flavor with a hint of bitterness.  A bit of cream and sugar will cover it up, but that shouldn't be necessary given the coffee choices available.<br /><br />Drinkable, yes.  The coffee isn't so bad that I must throw it away.  I'll finish them off, but I won't be a repeat purchaser.

review/summary: Makes a good cup of coffee
review/text: I tried this k-cup in a sampler pack. Is full-bodied and tastes good but has an aftertaste (more like afterBITE). I like my coffee smooth, so that was a minus for me, but definitely not a deal-breaker. Made this flavor more than once, and the taste was consistent with each cup. Also, I can use the 9oz setting on the Keurig and the coffee does not taste watered down.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I used to enjoy coffee from my local Caribou cafe. When I moved to a location that didnt have one I tried the Caribou blend K-cups.  Caribou blend was never my favorite, but it was all the store had at the time, so I gave it a try. The flavor is incredibly flat, one dimensional, with a bitter aftertaste, and generally unpleasant aroma (sour).  It was so off that I checked the expiration date, but found out it was still months away.  I wont buy this flavor again.

review/text: I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full-flavored coffee and this is not it.  There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other.

review/summary: First coffee I drink without sugar and milk
review/text: I started drinking coffee at the age of 2 when my grandpa would sneak me some in my cup. Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: African Red Tea Rooibos Face Cream
review/text: I purchased this cream after struggling with eczema in my face (around eyes,cheeks,chin)and on my neck for more then 6 months. I tried lots of other different creams - Eucerin, Cetaphil, Aquaphor, baby lotions, even some corticoids. Nothing helped. Sometimes it got better after corticoids the eczema even disappeared. But only for like 3 days and then appeared again. Then I tried Aubrey Organics Rosa Mosqueta Rose Hip Moisturizing Cream. It got much better. The affected areas were nicely moisturized after using this cream. But again, it didn't disappeared. Then I tried the African Red Tea Rooibos Face Cream. After one week of using it, the eczema was much much better. The affected areas were not dry, not red, not itchy. I used it like 5 or 6 times per day (just on the areas that were bothering me). After not even 2 weeks of using it, the eczema was completely gone! Only one tiny spot on my chin remained. But I got rid of it soon too. I'm still using it. Just 2 times per day (morning, evening) and I'm fine. I've been using this cream for 2,5 months. I really recommend it.

review/text: that's the way to describe this product.  not only did it taste incredible but the packaging is gorgeous, verging on sexy and sleek, for a water bottle!  the smart part about the packaging is it allows for the bottles to sit tight against each other taking up less room in the fridge.  though i'm a huge fan of peppermint water because it IS so stimulating yet soothing for me, i can't wait to try some of the other flavors!  keep up the good work, ICIO! -JC

review/summary: If you like rich bold coffee, this is for you
review/text: I like strong flavorful coffee in the morning. I usually buy coffee shop brands since I've never found a store brand that was bold enough. I decided to try this upon seeing a great deal on Amazin and good reviews. I'm really impressed. The coffee is strong but not bitter; flavorful without having to use a ton of grounds, and the price just makes it a great buy.

review/text: I have been drinking Peet's coffee (mind you I still love Peet's, but it is 14 miles for me to drive one way to buy it and on sale is $9.99) so I thought I would try this in the dark roast Italian blend. I love a full bodied dark roast. I tend to go with this blend or french roast and this is  yummy... I will definitely be buying this on subscription as it is less per pound and just as good, and you can't beat Amazon shipping to the door....

Coffee was FRESH with an expiration date sometime into next year so that will not be an issue. I drink this every day.<br /><br />If you like dark roast coffee, then you will enjoy this.

review/text: I decided to try other "Italian Roast" coffees to compare both quality and price, with my preferred Extra Bold Italian Roast, by Starbuck's.  I have tried several now, and 8 o'clock is my favorite one.  I find that the 8 o'clock does not have that bitterness I find in the Starbuck's brand, and I enjoy the taste of 8 o'clock's as well as I do the Starbuck's.  The 8 o'clock coffee is several $$ less in price, and that always helps!!  I would encourage others to try 8 o'clock's and see if they don't agree.  Thanks Amazon

review/text: I quite like this coffee from Eight O'Clock Coffee.  Dark Italian Roast is a very smooth dark coffee with no bitterness in taste or aftertaste.  Even as it cools there is no bitterness to it (and I mostly drink it black).<br /><br />I wouldn't say it is the most bold coffee I've ever tasted, but it certainly is good.<br /><br />I use a rounded tablespoon of coffee per 5 ounces of water and it brews up a nice strength.

review/summary: Marvelous Maranatha PB
review/text: In the weight control program that I follow, peanut butter is either a "fat" or a "protein".  With that in mind, I have tried different peanut butters and have narrowed my preferences down to two brands, Maranatha being one.  My reasons:<br /><br />-Organic: made with certified organic peanuts and if that is important to you, then Maranatha is a great choice.<br /><br />-Additives: NO hydrogenated oils, NO sugar added; no nothing except for a tiny trace of salt.  But, this does not taste salty at all<br /><br />-Great taste: This should have been first.  Maranatha has a mild, mellow, peanutty taste. I really do like it.<br /><br />-Great texture: truly smooth and creamy. Easy to spread even on soft bread<br /><br />Hint: This is NOT homogenized; the oil is on the top of the peanut butter when you open the jar.  You have to mix it in but, fear not!  Stick a butter knife down into the middle of the jar and move it ever so slightly, creating an opening into which the oil can flow.  Repeat this a few times and most of the oil will be gone from the top.  Stir and then enjoy.  You will NOT have to mix again.<br /><br />Summary: A wonderful way to get those "fat" allowances from a healthful type of fat.  This peanut butter has made my weight control easier because I substitute it for far less satisfying fats and it seems as though I am eating something sinfully sensational.

review/summary: Lush Berry Flavor...
review/text: If you like berry preserves, you will definitely like the lush berry flavor of Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Northwest Triple Berry Preserves.  The preserves contain only four ingredients - berries, sugar, pectin, and citric acid.  Like old-fashioned, homemade jams, jellies, and preserves, this product contains no corn syrup or artificial preservatives.<br /><br />The combination of blueberries, blackberries, and red raspberries is interesting.  However, the blackberries overwhelm the other two milder-flavored berries so that Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Northwest Triple Berry Preserves could easily be mistaken for blackberry preserves.  There is, however, a hint of the red raspberry taste; but it is not prominent.  Nevertheless, the taste is incredibly rich and full-bodied; this characteristic was a strong factor in the five-star rating.  Blueberry pieces are also evident in this product; most seem to be whole berries.  Individuals who have a problem with getting seeds lodged in their teeth or those who suffer from diverticulitis may want to avoid this preserve.  It is loaded with blackberry and red raspberry seeds!<br /><br />I am not fond of the thick consistency of Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Northwest Triple Berry Preserves which makes it difficult to spread.  I solved this issue by scooping the entire jar into a bowl and beating it with my portable mixer.  This broke the jell down to a spreadable product and did not otherwise affect the preserves.  I thought that Smuckers could have cut the sugar content of this product so that it was less sweet.  However, my preference for a less sweet preserve is not shared by other members of my family and most individuals will agree with their assessment.<br /><br />Smucker's Orchard's Finest Preserves Northwest Triple Berry Preserves is an excellent product.  I would suggest checking prices which vary widely on this product.  Most local grocers sell it for about $3 per jar.

review/text: It's nice to find the Pamela's gfcf Chocolate Cake Mix in a 25 lb bag.<br /><br />I repacked it in qt size freezer bags (1 lb 5 1/2 oz which is what the individual bags of mix contain) and it gave 18 bags of mix or 18 cakes worth.  Still more expensive than non-gfcf, but a great deal for the convenience of a specialty mix.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this product (and thus the 4 stars rather than 5) is that NO baking instructions were included.  Luckily I had a bag left from buying the individual mixes, so used the instructions on that.

review/text: By far the best tasting protein "bar" i have ever had. It resembles the taste/consistency of a cinnabun more then a protein bar though. It is very dense, very sweet, and also packs in a whopping 25grams of protein per bar. The only downside is that its hard to have just one!<br /><br />More seriously, though, the product is a tad expensive for a protein bar. In my opinion i would treat them as either a meal replacement or a treat after a huge workout. Casually eating these will end up making your wallet get slimmer (almost $2 per bar) and your belly a bit bigger (considering they have 300+ calories each). However as a meal replacement you cant beat it and the taste is phenomenal.

An unexpected surprise! It looks too good to eat..<br /><br />So I take my first bite.... it's softer than I expected. It reminds me of cookie dough. But it tastes so good! I really taste the cinnamon, the icing, and it reminds me of an actual cinnamon bun! I eat one bite.. and two... before I know it the bar is gone!  Oh no... I see on the package that it says how awesome it would taste heated up in the microwave for 10 seconds!  Now I need another bar to try the 'heated up' version!<br /><br />So yummy and unlike any protein bar I have tasted. Two thumbs up!

review/summary: My current favorite
review/text: Just bought a box of this recently, and it's now among my favorite protein bars with regard to taste, up there with Clif Builder's (Chocolate and Peanut Butter) and Met-Rx Big 100 Colossal (Crispy Apple Pie) bars. Like the other reviewers said, the Cinnamon Bun flavor pretty much tastes like a real cinnamon bun (haven't tried the other flavors yet). I say "pretty much" because it still has a very slight gritty texture that's characteristic of a lot of protein bars (though it's possible it was made this way to emulate cookie dough). It's also pretty dense (i.e.; hard), but so is the Big 100 Crispy Apple Pie bar.<br /><br />Anyway, the first time I tried it (straight out of the package, non-microwaved), truth be told I wasn't completely blown away as I was with my other favorites, but it was still a welcome change of flavor. When heated up though, the taste ramps up several notches. This bar really is FAAAAAAR better when warm, and now I can't get enough of it. haha.

review/summary: It tastes real, but Gluten Free
review/text: I really missed Oatmeal, I know it sounds crazy, but I did.  All the other rice cereals did not cut it.  This is like real Oatmeal but it only takes 3-4 minutes.  Add some brown sugar, salt and nuts and it's perfect - and quick!

review/summary: Daughter really likes it
review/text: I normally do not purchase foods that are not organic or at least organically produced, but my daughter loves this type of cereal and had not found anything she liked that she could eat since discovering she has celiac sprue. She really enjoys this product for taste and easy preparation. We do not use the microwave (health hazard--look it up--outlawed in the Soviet Union since the 1970s for that reason) so she has only cooked it on the stovetop. I gave it four stars for not being organic, but if that's not important to you, consider it a five star rating.

review/text: Found this cereal on last trip to New England and was really upset when I returned to California and couldn't buy it. . . Was so happy to find it on Amazon. . . buying more because my husband who is not "gluten free" has discovered it and eaten my supply. As a transplanted Bostonian, I also love the Cranberry.

review/summary: FABULOUS OATMEAL
review/text: One of the things I missed when I went on a gluten-free diet was being able to eat oatmeal.  I bought a couple of different gluten free oatmeals, but they contained tough, inedible pieces of something........like husks maybe??  Anyway, I found some Holly's oatmeal and porridge in the store and I absolutely love it.  I highly recommend it if you are an oatmeal lover!

review/summary: Good canned food for your puppy, if he eats it!
review/text: I purchased MANY of these cans to feed my Labrador puppy. Since he was used to dry food, when I started using this canned food he jumped all over it! He would it like there was no tomorrow. With time, however, the enthusiasm went down little by little until it came to a point where he didn't want to eat the canned food anymore, only as a WAY LAST resort. The quality of the food is great, and they have different flavors to choose from; but that means nothing if your dog doesn't eat it. Every dog is different, so may have more luck than me. As of the food itself, I would recommend it.

After months of using this product on and off, I can honestly say that there is a noticeable difference in my milk production when I am using it.  The cookies arrive quickly and are tasty.  I do freeze mine after the first couple of days to maintain the freshness.  I have tried both the cranberry nut and the chocolate oatmeal, and love the chocolate oatmeal!

review/summary: Those flames get me higher and higher
review/text: I used to be addicted to Atomic Fireballs when I was 13.  I would go to the party store and buy handfuls of them.  I would promptly eat 'em all that same day.  I'm talking about the jumbo ones, not the smaller ones.  These things would burn a "hole" in the inside of my cheek/mouth and I'd be on a huge sugar high.  These things gave me incredible hyperactive energy with their sugar and red hot cinnamon flavor.  Just what you need when you're 13 - more energy!  They're not called Atomic Fireballs for nothing.<br /><br />If you're like me and like red hot cinnamon flavored stuff and haven't tried these ever, I highly recommend them.  Have plenty of water with you to put out the fire.

review/summary: Yum Yum Eat Em Up
review/text: My kitties love most all of the canned Fancy Feast foods. When i try to change between the sliced, flaked, grilled & feast they have stomach issues so i only feed them certain feast flavors. I buy this because most have the Liver, Chicken, Beef etc. listed as the first or second ingredient. When i do want to treat them to something special i buy one of the other like flaked . This way i stick with cat food instead of giving people food. My cats give 4 paws up.
