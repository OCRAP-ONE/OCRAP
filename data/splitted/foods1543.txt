review/summary: not good at all, artificial taste and flavor
review/text: I have read all reviews and found them suspiciously favorable with just a few very real ones!<br /><br />Mighty Leaf has good teas, no doubt.<br />However; not all of their teas are good.  I'll say around half not as good as they claim to be.<br /><br />Too much artificial flavor in Mighty Leaf Green Tea! You can buy Celestial Seasonings Teas three time cheaper with the same result.<br /><br />Wasted money.

review/text: I used to have to drive miles to buy these candies, and the store only had them in the Spring.  Now they're available anytime I want with just a few clicks on the computer.  They are excellent candy with fruit-flavored liquid in the center of dark chocolate and a hard candy shell.  My guests love them, and they make wonderful gift candies as well.

Stateside man goods packaged the product nicely and Amazon always ships things perfectly.  Well worth a taste.

review/summary: Quality Salmon Eggs
review/text: These have been the best salmon eggs that I have had outside a sushi restaurant.  They are very fresh, and the eggs are whole, not crushed or broken in any way.  They arrived frozen solid, packaged well.  My only complaint is that 2.2 lbs is too much to freeze as one block.  As you don't want to defrost the entire block to extract those you want to use, my solution was to use a heavy knife to knock off a section.  This works pretty well but it does damage the eggs where the knife is inserted.  Creative packing could have solved this problem.  Even so, this is a quality product.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

I only buy the purest and best olive oil, for taste and to get all the therapuetic health effects that I now know about.....no wonder Americans don't understand the effects, they don't receive the effects! The US is the biggest market for inferior oils. The DeCarlo's have a top notch, quality operation and are passionate advocates, supporting olive oil production as a culture to be carefully maintained.  Why risk buying anything else but the very best? I anxiously await further regulation of olive oils, either by Italy or the US, to clean up the olive oil industry.

review/summary: A Good Way To Start Your Day
review/text: I was delighted to find Bob's Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Rolled Oats on Amazon. I have always had to order these oats on line because the stores in my area carry only the gluten-free version of this cereal.  The cereal I received from Amazon was fresh with a date of expiration well over 2 years in the future. I prefer to purchase the case, which includes 4 packages of  32oz bags. It is much more economical buying this product by the case than individual bags.  The bags arrive housed in a heavy cardboard box which would be used as a display box in stores. I have been eating Bob's Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Rolled Oats for a few years.  I started having oatmeal for breakfast because I read so many books and watched so many doctors on TV extol the health benefits of whole grains, especially, whole grains from oats.  Having always been concerned about my weight, I worried such a substantial breakfast would cause me to gain a few pounds. This has not been the case at all; in fact, just the opposite has happened.  This cereal is low fat and cholesterol free. It is filling and that feeling lasts all through my morning. I have read the reason eating oatmeal makes you feel satisfied longer is because the fiber slows down the  digestion of the oatmeal. Fiber from oats provide two types of fiber, soluble and insoluble.  Both are important for good health but soluble fiber, in particular, has been acclaimed for it's role in the reduction of LDL (bad) cholesterol.  Soluble fiber is fiber which dissolves in water and therefore absorbs the LDL cholesterol and takes it out of the body. If you did not have soluble fiber, the LDL cholesterol would be reabsorbed by the body. Insoluble fiber passes through the intestines and acts like a broom to help push the products of waste through your system.  Each 1/2 cup dry measure of Bob's Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Rolled Oats contain 5g of dietary fiber which consists of 1.6g of soluble fiber and 3.4g of insoluble fiber. I add a tablespoon or two of ground flaxseed to add fiber, omega3 and other essential fatty acids to my breakfast.  I make this oatmeal every morning. The instructions on the bag read to bring water and salt to a boil and then add the oats. I prefer to bring the water to a boil with the oats in the pan. It seems the individual grains of oats are a little softer when you put them in cold water and then bring it to a boil. I don't add salt. I don't think it needs it for my taste. When the water reaches a boil, I lower the heat so that a mild simmer is maintained. I often sprinkle cinnamon on the oats. In 10 minutes I am ready to sit down to a nutritious, delicious, breakfast which will do my body good.

review/text: I have been buying dried peaches all the time through Sahara. My local store has increased the price this year and I started looking on Amazon. Found this one and ordered. It took almost a month to arrive and smells terrible. I am pretty sure that the manufacturer used Sulfur dioxide to process the peaches and left this stinky smell. I was in a hurry to travel to EU for a month right after I received the peaches and was not able to file a return. Do not buy if you care about your health. The product description does not include using this chemical for processing. I gave one start because I could not give lower.

review/summary: A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course
review/text: My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner.

review/summary: Not Worth The Money!
review/text: As a former chef, I guess I expected a lot of of these steaks when I ordered them.  I had worked with USDA Prime cuts of beef in the past and thought that these would be worth the money.  I prepared them in a manner I learned in culinary school, insuring a well-crusted exterior with a perfect med-rare interior.  The results were less than impressive.  Actually, given the cost, they were down-right bad.<br /><br />When I first looked at the steaks I was wary.  One of the key indicators of Prime meat is ample marbling with fat.  Both of the steaks that arrived looked, to my eyes, to have a fair amount of intermuscular fat but certainly not what I would have hoped for given the nearly $100 price tag.<br /><br />A high grade USDA Choice would be a comprable product and this grade is readily available at normal grocery stores (not just Dean and Deluca type places.)<br /><br />Save your money.  Shop wiser than I did.

review/summary: Reliable product, conveniently packaged
review/text: Cornstarch is cornstarch - what can one say?  I do like this brand because the packaging fits in with my other Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flours and starches on my pantry shelves, and the relatively wide mouth of the bag makes it easier to measure in the quantities I use in gluten-free baking than the boxes in which cornstarch is normally sold in grocery stores.

review/summary: Tasty coffee
review/text: I really enjoyed all but 2 of these coffees, they are very sweet and flavorful. I still use the mug today, it has a convenient lid that is very easy to take apart and clean. The tin is still around too, and paint hasn't even come off of it yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes coffee(unless they only like really strong, dark coffee). Would make a great gift for a college student or younger person who drinks coffee.

review/summary: Read the warning on the bottle.
review/text: Before ordering this product I compared the reviews between this product and the dozens of similar products containing the Ghost Pepper.  Since Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia hot sauce seemed to have the best reviews it is the one I picked.  At only five ounces it is not exactly a bargain.  Keeping in mind the fact that I could not find any sauces containing the Ghost pepper locally I was not concerned with the price.  So I took a leap of faith in Dave's sauce.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I received my bottle in only two days using Amazon Prime.  It came in bubble wrap and was completely safe in it's packaging.  After popping off the seal I took a big whiff and passed it around the room.  The aroma was fantastic and a kick in the face at the same time.  Our mouths watered immediately.  Ignoring the warnings of my family, I had to try a dab on my finger right away.  The taste was great but soon came a wave of intense heat which overpowered the taste.  My eyes watered and I smiled in satisfaction as I reached for a cold beverage.  My money did not go to waste.<br /><br />At dinner time I decided it would go great on my chicken.  I only wanted to pour a little on.  I shook the bottle anticipating the thickness would not allow the sauce to come easily out of the bottle.  I was wrong.  A big glob covered my meal.  My wife argued with me not to eat all of it and get some off the chicken.  But like most husbands, I did not listen to my wife.  I did not want to waste it.  So i took the first bite...excellent taste...but then....oh god...for some reason the spiciness made me crazily devour the whole thing.  What a dumb thing to do.  The next half hour was torture.  My eyes were running and red, I got the hiccups and felt as though I wanted to throw up but did not.  I drank all of my soda fast.  I slammed my hands on the table in agony as my wife prepared the milk which could not come fast enough.  I was in bad shape.  I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies.  Dave...You got me.<br /><br />On closer inspection of the bottle, after my episode, I discovered the warning.  Use a drop at a time.  Bah! Stupid me.  Well...you know what they say.  Good stories usually start out with a bad decision.<br /><br />This product should come with a dropper.  It is definitely a favorite in my book.  I will buy it again but with more respect for the sauce.

review/summary: His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
review/text: I was scared at first so I only tried a small dab on a chip. My taste buds never noticed the flavor as they were all immediately set to cursing and swearing in a tirade against me. Powdered glass lined my throat with every breath. My head turned into a big sweaty tomato and my feet started walking me in circles around the kitchen.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it was my own thought, an angel from above, or my wife who was watching me, but someone called me an idiot. I would have responded, but my tongue was in revolt and my throat had revoked all passes--nothing in or out.<br /><br />After six or seven minutes I crawled back to do it again. I shook the bottle hard and the thick sauce landed in a small glob.<br /><br />Oops.<br /><br />I stared for six or seven seconds thinking of my manhood, and decided to fear nothing so small. I remember my wife rolling her eyes, and I remember stepping on one of my children, but not much else is clear until I was standing over the toilet, holding a box fan, and praying to God. I could feel the hole in my stomach but saw no blood, so the fan remained more important. After thirty minutes my temperature dropped back down into the triple digits and the tears and hiccups finally stopped.<br /><br />I spent most of the night thinking about life and death and decided to give it a couple of days before trying again. I hope you like it as much as I did!

review/summary: Way too spicy to enjoy
review/text: This is a really spicy hot sauce, the spiciest I have ever tried. But I found out real fast that it is just way too spicy to really enjoy. I am a spicy food lover, but I do have my limits and this reached it almost immediately. This sauce to me just seems more like a fun thing to have around rather than to actually eat with. I use this mostly when friends come over and I want to get a good laugh out of it. But I have never actually put this on my food, except for the day I got it. It is not so spicy that you start crying or anything like that, but you stop tasting things after a couple DROPS. Like I said, this is awesome to have around but not an everyday type of sauce.

review/summary: very hot, yet flavorful
review/text: I was surprised how hot this sauce is - I tried it next to the "new hottest pepper" Trinidad Scorpion sauce, and I thought this was hotter.  Probably the Scorpion sauce (from another, local manufacturer) is watered down a bit more.  But although this sauce is extremely hot, it has a very nice flavor.  I would rate it as a good "flavor/heat ratio" a la Tabasco -- quite often these sauces try to just be hot and the flavor is secondary.  But not in the case of Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce.  You just have to start with very small amounts as it can heat things up ridiculously fast (my usual "dump a teaspoon on a veggie burger" was ridiculously over-hot).

review/text: Although I love habaneros, this sauce had me worried. It had warnings on the bottle about keeping it away from children and pets. I carefully shook a few drops onto my grilled vegetables, half-expecting clouds of smoke. I opened a bottle of kefir and positioned it within arm's reach in case I needed first aid. And then, I tried a bite with just a drop of Jolokia pepper sauce on it. The verdict? Awesome! I ended up using about half a teaspoon. The Naga Jolokia is my new favorite pepper and this is my favorite pepper sauce.

review/text: This is crazy hot. I thought I was decent with hot food, but this stuff had me drinking a half gallon of milk in under 20 minutes. When you try it, avoid getting it in the back of your throat. If you do anyway, don't talk or laugh. haha It makes it hurt more. Fun to try though and it has a great taste. I recommend it to anyone that loves hot sauce and people that want to try it for fun. The amount I tried was probably about half the size of those taco bell packets(hopefully most people understand that amount) for one taco.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS STUFF
review/text: This is easily the hottest ghost pepper sauce I've ever tried, and I've tried almost all of them. If you don't like hot stuff, or haven't tried it in a long time, GO EASY ON THIS. It is hot.  But I've had this for a long time now, and I've found that if you have it regularly, you can build up an immunity and it won't be quite so hot. It's still hot enough to make me tear up and sweat all over, but the first time I tried this I couldn't breath, talk, and tears were coming both because it was hot, and because I was crying from the pain. Nowadays I can practically take this stuff like Tabasco. So just so everyone knows, if you don't eat hot stuff regularly, it will hurt. It also has one of the best flavors of any hot sauce I've tried.<br /><br />P.S. - anyone suffering from extreme burn, torture, and unimaginable misery from this sauce, try just stuffing your mouth with sour cream, apparently that's the best remedy. I've never tried it, but supposedly it's way better than milk.

review/summary: Horrible service
review/text: I had ordered 2 bottles of the hot sauce and also paid 1-3 day shipping on it.  I actually paid more for the shipping than I did for the 2 bottles of sauce.  I did not receive my packagae until 9 days later but I was shorted a bottle.  I wrote to the company and told them of this.  They agreed to sending me another bottle free of shipping.  Mind you, this is a $5 bottle of sauce.  Three days later I receive an email stating that they reviewed their camera recording and it was clear that there was 2 bottles shipped together and that the weight of the package was correct for the amount shipped.  So they insinuated I had lied to them.  I am not sure what happened on their end, but there was only 1 bottle of sauce in my package.  Not sure why someone would lie over a $5 bottle of sauce so they could get it for free.  It is a shame because granted, the sauce is hot but good, and they would have received several orders from some from friends, but knowing what the company has accused me of can guarantee no other orders will be placed.  Word of mouth is a company's advertisement, and it is unfortunate this company will not be getting any positive feedback from me.  I have never been accused of lieing and take great insult over it that this company would do so.  You can be assured I will be ordering from some other company in hopes that the shipping rate is equal to the time paid for, and where the company sends the correct amount ordered.  Makes me wonder why the company is so upset to lose the $5 bottle that is owed to me due to their mistake, possibly because they have treated other customers with the same respect which is none!!

review/text: I was hopeful on this product as far as heat goes. I was not disappointed. This sauce definitely has some kick to it. My only disappointment is that the burn lasts only a short time. That and you can definitely taste the extract. I have not tried ghost pepper without extract but I have had pure sauces of other types of peppers. I think next time I will try a pure sauce with no extract to see how the flavor is. For those who like heat though this product is great!

It's good on everything but be prepared this is not your every day hot sauce read the warning label on the bottle. One website put this sauce at over 600k scovils so if your new to the REAL hot sauce market be prepared with a glass of milk and test just a drop don't be stupid and cake it on a chip or cracker trying to be a bad a$$ you'll regret it lol. I've enjoyed murdering my taste buds for years and this is still very very hot but very flavorful as well and I will most definitely be buying another bottle soon as I have used almost half a bottle in 3 weeks.

review/summary: Very good value
review/text: This is good extra virgin olive oil from Baja California, the little tail of Mexico between the Pacific and the sea of Cortez.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable (2x750ml bottles for 25 USD) and definitively a good value. Compared to most Italian or Spanish premium extra virgin olive oils, the flavor is much more subtle but still well balanced and quite refined. It definitively brings to mind olive oils from andalucia - most likely due to the use of Spanish olive varieties. In fact, given it is so hard to find good quality olive oil for sale in the US (see below), this is definitively a good choice.<br /><br />A note of caution: Olive oil is best fresh and only keeps for up to 1 or 2 years (even if kept away from sunlight and heath). NEVER buy bottles without expiry date. I see often very expensive Italian bottles for sale that have been on a shelf for years and completely rancid (the taste turns oddly sweet with notes of petrol). These bottles had an expiry date (excellent) and the date was very reasonable. Keep in mind that olives are harvested towards the end of the fall each year, so that European and North American oils are at their best at the beginning of each year, while Chilean ones go the opposite way.

I've really been amazed at how good it is, considering the great price!  The bottles also have a handy retracting spout that pops up when you remove the lid, a nice feature to throw in for the customer, especially when you're trying to spread the oil without 'dousing' a dish.<br /><br />I'll never buy grocery store olive oil -ever again- after finding THEIRS at such fair prices. You don't come across many EVOO's that have as much flavor as Baja Precious... and the price is just a bonus!  I'd still buy it at twice as much.. Without even blinking an eye.<br /><br />Really, do yourself a favor... buy a 2-pack here...<br />Pull up Rick Bayless' "mojo" recipe.  Use 1 bottle for that, and just wait to see how much you love this EVOO, and having some GENUINE Rick Bayless mojo to cook with in your fridge for months!<br />Mojo makes everything you cook in it absolutely !~AMAZING~!<br />Trust me... Try it out, you'll love it!<br /><br />Truly delicious product from a great producer! A+

review/summary: Very good jerky
review/text: My wife gave me a package of Buffalo Bills "Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces" for my birthday. So being the cool guy that I am, I took it on a recent 4-wheeling trip and shared it with my compadres. Here's what they had to say:<br /><br />"WATER!!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br />LOL! Seriously, this IS good jerky. But it's a tad bit salty, and has a VERY distinct soy flavor. Maybe because the first three ingredients are beef, water, and soy. haha! If you do not like soy, you will NOT like this jerky. But that aside, it was a good-sized bag, and we demolished it in pretty short order. The pieces were not too big or small, and it was not chewy. It was maybe a tad bit hard, but it was not sinewy. This was premium beef - no grissel! I highly recommend this and other Buffalo Bills jerky products.<br /><br />Just be sure you have something to drink (it goes great with beer)!

review/text: This jerky is my favorite.  Is easy to eat yet has substance. Thick chunks that aren't mushy.  The flavor is excellent and you can tell it's made from quality meat- no stringy or "mystery" surprises.  I'm hooked!<br /><br />*************************************************<br /><br />Just got a new batch and I have to agree with the reviewer who also just got some of this- SALTY!  Can't taste anything else.  Does seem a little greasy but it was on my step (delivered there) and it was 100 degrees today.  May have been from that.  Texture is the same but that salt.  Hope it's a fluke.  I'm calling them tomorrow!

review/text: This jerky might not be for everyone, but this is exactly how I like my jerky.  It has a natural look and taste, as if I made it myself.  I have been struggling to find a jerky that is not processed, soft, and chewy like every Jack Links makes.  You can tell immediately Jack Links is fake.<br /><br />This jerky has a nice smokey flavor.  It's tough and gives you something to chew on.<br /><br />I'll be buying this Jerky again and again.

Check out their 1.4lb jerky, much better than this.<br /><br />UPDATE: I was contacted by Choo Choo R Snacks and they offered to replace this pack with one of my favorite (more expensive) at no cost to me which i gladly accepted. They said if you don't like it, contact them and they'll make it right. Other reviewers mentioned the saltiness is only with this new lot, so check for their update when you order. Thanks Choo Choo, i will buy again!

review/summary: I like salty
review/text: I'm known to be a salty person, so that may be why I like this so much. This is so much better than chewy jerky. I'd much rather have dry leathery jerky than chewy, greasy jerky. To me, jerky should be salty to help keep your sodium during a long trip or physical activity. I don't write reviews on Amazon much, but felt I should chime in on this product. Funny, but my local Sunoco station in Pgh carries this brand and it's the only one I buy, except if I visit my home state of Texas and go to Buccee's gas station where they have a full and I do mean FULL jerky deli style counter with all kinds of fresh jerky by the lb. It is a jerky lover's dream.

review/text: I am on an aircraft carrier, in the middle of the ocean and have been for 5 months now.  I orded this jerky and when it came in, I was salivating to try it.  Hands down the best jerky I have had, it wasn't full of tendons or fat, it wasn't chewy, and it wasn't as dry bark.  Perfect jerky, prime cuts of beef, the right texture and taste.  I shared two pieces out of the bag, then felt the urge to conserve the rest of the jerky for myself.  If you order a bag, order two, that way you can hide one for yourself then appear to be a giving soul with the other.  Keep it for yourself.<br /><br />Jason Cohen<br />Master Sergeant<br />USMC

I posted that feedback around 9am yesterday morning and had gotten a phone call directly from the vendor less than 3 hours later.<br /><br />Buffalo Bills apologized profusely about the dry beef jerky I had gotten. They also said they were going to send me a replacement and assured me it would be good. I, of course, withdrew my original, neutral feedback and replaced it with this feedback.<br /><br />I am very very impressed with Buffalo Bill's customer service. Mistakes happen to everyone and it is the ones that step up and immediately resolve the issue like they did that get my full five star ratings such as this one.

review/text: This jerky is inedible.  You would have to reconstitute it in beef broth to be able to chew it.  Additionally, all you can taste is the hickory smoke and salt.  It might be leather for all I know.  I purchased several other varieties from this manufacturer, and they are all of similar poor quality.  Avoid.

review/text: This beef jerky is good and solid.  I use the word solid because it is not moist.  The heat also overwhelms the smoke flavor (at least for me).  I will definitely consume this, but will buy another flavor next time.<br /><br />I've also tried the original flavor which is very good and moist and the barbecue, which is very moist and absolutely delicious.<br /><br />If you like your jerky chewy with some fire and some smoke flavor, buy this!

review/summary: Honestly, the best beef jerky I have ever had...
review/text: I have ordered probably $500 of jerky from various online companies in the last 3 years and I can say this is for sure the best jerky I have ever had.  The hickory flavor is great and salty.  It's the kind of snack you just can't stop eating.  The other great thing is I like the pieces, instead of long strips.  It much nicer to be able to just pop bite size pieces in your mouth, rather than try and use your side molars to rip a long piece of jerky apart.  I have probably gone through eight bags of this product and have two in the cupboard.  Just do it.

review/text: I really like ChooChoo R Snacks Jerky, their quality is exceptional as I have stated in a previous review for their "Big Slabs" and their "Country Cut". But this Jerky which I got today with the soy sauce is really not my taste, it is absolutely salty, and the soy overpowers the meat flavor itself, and far as smoky flavor is concerned, there is none I can taste,the jerky is also unusually greasy, really coated in grease to be factual. I will personally only stick with ordering their "Country Cut" and their "Big Slabs" where you taste the good flavor of the meat, and the jerky is moist, but NOT greasy.

review/summary: Too salty, doesn't taste like beef
review/text: I was really disappointed by this beef jerky, especially since I ordered a whole pound.  The jerky is way too salty, so much that I worried about the health effects.  Also, it tastes like it has been soaked in some kind of artificial beef broth that completely eliminates the natural beef flavor.  What is the point of that?  Why would anyone do that unless they are using inferior meat and looking for a quick path to flavor.  Trust me, it's not worth it.  Truly hickory-smoked beef just accentuating the flavor of the meat would be wonderful.

The bag isn't reclosable, so you need to transfer the contents to a reclosable container.<br /><br />This beef jerky comes in small pieces (strips), which we liked.  The color is black, very black... thought this was odd?  The smell is smokey... no beefy smell... not real appetizing.<br /><br />This beef jerky is "tough" & needs to be worked over (chewed) before you can enjoy the taste... that is, if you like very salty + smokey!  Still... the meat quality is good, with little gristle or inedible pieces.<br /><br />We wanted to like this beef jerky, but it's down there with one of the worst tasting that we've tried.  We won't be buying this beef jerky again!

review/summary: Excellent Way To Purchase Sweet 'N Low
review/text: A small few of these may be "leaking" sugar, but you get that with the smaller boxes of grocery store boxes too.  This is my second order.  I will only order these from Amazon in this size as it is such a money saver.

review/summary: I ordered this but I got "Sweet Mate" instead.
review/text: Sweet Mate is a generic version of "Equal", apparently. The box on the outside actually has a sticker that says "Sweet and Low", but it's not.

review/summary: Great taste!  We use it on popcorn, etc.
review/text: Great taste!  We use it on popcorn, with popcorn seasoning and corn on the cob. The seasoning, or salt then sticks to the kernals.  Nearly as good as butter.  Quite expensive, compared to standard pan spray products, so we do not use it to spray the pans.  I can't tell you how well it works as a non stick spray.
