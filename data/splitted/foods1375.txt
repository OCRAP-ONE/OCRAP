review/summary: Great conditioner!
review/text: My hair looks great when using this conditioner and although I do have dry skin and a dry scalp this conditioner makes my scalp feel a lot more moisturized and a lot less dry. I don't use this conditioner as often as I should but when I do I really like the results. If you have dry skin and are looking for a conditioner you could do a lot worse than this product.

review/summary: A little light
review/text: For my particular hair I think this conditioner may be not quite heavy and intensive enough. It's really not bad, but it's also not something where the results really stand out beyond what I've experienced with a variety of other conditioners on the market. I haven't noticed any particular change in my scalp, for better or worse either.<br /><br />I'm going to keep using it and see how things go, but for now this one isn't making a big impression one way or another. It just does the basics that I'd expect.

review/summary: This Conditioner Works Fairly Well
review/text: What made me want to try this product, Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy, Moisturizing Dry Scalp, besides that, was that this is a new product line.  To be honest, their product line is so extensive, it was kind of hard, at least for me, to know which product would be the correct one for me.<br /><br />In the end, I decided to go with the Moisturizing Dry Scalp version, but I was only able to order the conditioner version, and not also the shampoo, which is what I would have ordered, both of them, because I have found that when you use both the shampoo as well as the conditioner, the results are better than if you had used only one of the products.  The shampoo version was already out through the Vine Program, which is how I was able to order this conditioner.<br /><br />First of all, I like the sleek, modern design of the bottle, tho I would have preferred that the opening be on the top of the bottle, rather than the bottom of the bottle, which is how it is.  I guess due to the shape of the top of the bottle, maybe that made the option of having the opening be on the top of the bottle instead of the bottom of the bottle, how it is, impossible.<br /><br />The bottle opening is to the left of the bottle, so you just open that rather than other bottles, where the whole opening has to be opened up, like if the opening is on the top of the bottle, at least for some shampoos and conditioners, to enable you to be able to dispense the shampoo or conditioner that you need.  In any case, I prefer the opening to the bottle be on top of the bottle, and not on the bottom of the bottle.  It's a personal preference.<br /><br />The bottle size is 12.7 ounces, which seems standard as far as the size of the bottle, unless you buy the supersized bottle in a shampoo or conditioner.<br /><br />I love the scent of the conditioner, which thankfully I love it, because I always smell scented products. If I do not like the scent of a product, I will not purchase it.<br /><br />The bottle says there are 10 Vitamins and Nutrients.  The back of the bottle says it provides up to 2 times more moisturization, but that is if you use both the shampoo and conditioner.<br /><br />So, it's kind of hard to judge how well this product really works, without also using the shampoo too.<br /><br />I did like how it made my scalp feel, but then I normally do like how most shampoos and conditioners, in the dry scalp version, make my scalp and hair feel.<br /><br />Having very, very thick hair, I cannot just use a conditioner.  I also have to use a conditioning, detangling spray, in able to brush my hair out when it's wet.<br /><br />So, in all fairness it is kind of hard to judge this conditioner, without being able to try the shampoo too.

review/summary: I like the product  but the packaging leaks
review/text: I tried this even though I had previously not like another clear scalp product.  The long lengths shampoo and conditioner had not worked well for me but I decided to give the brand another try.<br /><br />Like the first Clear Scalp product I ordered, this one had leaked substantially.  I would estimate that about 1/5 of the product had leaked into the plastic wrapper surrounding the bottle.<br /><br />Other than that this was a completely different experience from trying the first product.  I really liked the smell.  The conditioner felt like it soaked in and rinsed out nicely.  My wet hair felt smooth and tangle free.  I live in the high desert so my hair gets dried out terribly.  It is also color treated.  But the Dry Scalp conditioner made both my scalp and hair feel good.  My hair was soft but had no  flyaways.<br /><br />For the price and performance I will keep using this product.

review/summary: Pretty good conditioner
review/text: I have hair that is thick and goes about 3" past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this conditioner works pretty well. It is smooth and goes on easily.  It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/summary: O.K., But Not For Me
review/text: My hair is fine, slightly dry,and I have periodic dandruff. I massaged this product into my hair, waited 2 minutes, and rinsed my hair first with warm water and then cool wate. I wasn't pleased with the end results and thought it left my hair sort of greasy and limp. I also detected some build-up which is definitely not something I want.<br />In all fairness to this product, I suspect I should have not used this formulation. I used a similar product by a different manufacturer  recently and had exactly the same results with the exception that I paid at least $2 more. I suspect that if I had thick or coarse hair this would have worked as promised. As for the build up,  i can't say. This just doesn't work well on straight and extremely fine hair.

review/text: I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for a month, and I am pleased that my dry, itchy scalp--probably caused by medication I am taking--is much relieved.  The fragrance is very light, and it doesn't take a lot of the product to get the job done.  My hair and scalp feel clean and it lasts the three days between shampoos.  I like the packaging, too.

review/summary: Really helped dry scalp!
review/text: I take medications that really cause my scalp to be dry and itchy, especially in hot, dry weather. I tried the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Conditioner and I liked the way my scalp and hair felt and looked afterwards. The downside was the fragrance - it was too strong for me, but I have respiratory issues that make me extremely sensitive to most fragrances, and have to be very careful with any product, preferring unscented if available. This fragrance is pleasant but not for me.  I would definitely try the product again if it came out in an unscented or very light fruity/citrus fragrance, not floral.<br /><br />When I received the product it was tightly wrapped in plastic, but the bottle was leaking.  The manufacturer needs to address that, perhaps with a safety seal under the cap both for leakage and consumer protection.

review/summary: Nice Conditioner
review/text: I have thick long hair and this conditioner worked great for removing tangles and making my hair soft. It does not have a strong, overpowering scent. You do have to make sure to rinse it out well, as this is a thick conditioner. My hair tends to frizz and this helped my hair with that also.<br /><br />The product was shipped wrapped in plastic and in a box, but the top still leaked a little bit. The weather in my area has been in the high 90s, so I don't know if that contributed to it.

review/summary: An Inexpensive Little Gem ...
review/text: I used "CLEAR Moisturizing Conditioner" in junction with "CLEAR Moisturizing Shampoo." The results were better than expected. Here is my experience:<br /><br />Having long wavy hair, I first experimented with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR Strong Lengths Conditioner</a>" (paired with the moisturizing shampoo). After a week of use, my hair was surprisingly weighty. It appears that the product had been causing unwanted build-up. So, I used a different brand of shampoo/conditioner for a few days and then switched to this conditioner (with the same moisturizing shampoo). The results were greatly improved. My hair was bouncier and still shiny. So, the lesson here is that you might need to find the perfect combination of CLEAR products for your hair.<br /><br />Other notes:<br />I really like the "upside-down" design of the bottle (it helps prevent that awkward "vigorously shaking the bottle in the dangerously slippery shower" moment). Likewise, I enjoy the pleasant scent (but, those who are sensitive to perfumes may this product overwhelming). However, if you have long hair like me and are considering the "Strong Lengths" conditioner, you should know that this "Moisturizing" one is best for non-processed/non color-treated hair. (If you have longer, processed hair, then "Strong Lengths" is probably a good bet. It is thicker and coats damaged hair).

review/summary: Save dry hairs!
review/text: I am IN LOVE with this conditioner! I was skeptical trying it since I've tried so many hair products over the years that only dry out my hair & make it frizz, but I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The conditioner had leaked a tad during shipping, but it was in a plastic bag so it didn't get everywhere. I simply rinsed off the top & no harm done.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the sweet, floral smell. It's feminine & flirty and I immediately loved it. The texture is thick and creamy; exactly what you want for a serious conditioner.<br /><br />My hair is fairly long, naturally curly, and thick. I wear it naturally (air-dried and curly) about twice a week so that it can recuperate, and flat iron it to death the rest of the time. I want my hair to be as shiny, soft, frizz-free, and generally  healthy as possible either way I wear it, which is a tall order.<br /><br />In order to accomplish this I've developed an optimal routine over time & experimentation. I use a miniscule amount of shampoo ONLY on my scalp, & condition the bottom half of my hair BEFORE rising. This way, the shampoo is pulled through the strands & cleans them without overly-drying the bottom half.<br /><br />After rinsing, I then fully condition my hair... now with three conditions. Adding the "CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner" has made a noticeable difference in my hair. It smells wonderful, is even silkier & less prone to frizz than ever. I can even go out in the hot, ultra humid summer weather without worrying about it puffing up and frizzing!<br /><br />I will DEFINITELY buy a new bottle once this runs out. I'd like to try the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY shampoo version as well. I strongly recommend this conditioner for those with medium to dry or curly hair.

If you have flakes, or dry feeling hair, I recommend you give Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty products a try.

review/text: This conditioner is great for "outdoor living."  My hair is a wreck due to lap swimming.  And the sun in the Sunshine State makes it worse.  This conditioner fixes these problems, better than the athletic conditioners that I have used in the past.  Its application is creamy and not greasy.  There is no need to turn around and then wash this conditioner out to due any gunkiness. After using, my hair is easier to comb and lighter to the touch.  Also, using this every other day seems to work just fine.

review/summary: Nice conditioner - smell is OK - leaves hair soft & with almost no tangles
review/text: Very nice conditioner! Contains natural oils & left my curly hair a lot more manageable, even after a bath with Epsom salts!<br /><br />Didn't do much for my scalp (but then my scalp is only dry in hot or very cold temperatures, which don't generally last too long in S. CA.<br /><br />Can back comb right through when wet.<br /><br />Smell is OK - not my favorite, but is OK and doesn't bother me after use. (I prefer natural pure essential oils rather than chemical scents)<br /><br />I'm not sure why the cosmetics industry uses so much titanium dioxide in everything from toothpaste (very concerning if you have kids around, but not great for adults either, but it Does apparently make your teeth whiter, and hair more reflective I imagine, yet I can't help but wonder how daily exposure affects a person?!?) or coloring for their products that are used daily (I suspect the red dye #33 might be the culprit that caused some itching after a couple of uses itching? Could have been something else, or just "that time of year"?)<br /><br />Thankfully this conditioner doesn't contain Formaldehyde, like many, many shampoos & conditions do, & that can cause allergic reactions - especially after using them for a long time.<br /><br />Overall, works well, smell is OK, not bad, but not a favorite scent (but neither are some really great, truly natural shampoos & conditioners!)<br /><br />It does work nicely. If I had to just grab something and the store didn't have my brands, then I would be drawn to this & a few others.<br /><br />To be fair, if you look at the labels of just about ALL good shampoos and conditioners, there are going to be chemicals.<br /><br />My favorite conditioner is Vegetable glycerin with my own blend of sweet PEOs (pure essential oils) from a respectable PEO brand... great for hair, dry skin & you can choose & create your own scents by mixing your own oils. (NOTE: If you do decide to make your own, MANY so-called "PEO blends" are adulterated, or stretched out with cheaper oils!<br /><br />Oils vary WIDELY by price... for instance orange oils are roughly $4 an ounce, while real rose oil (Rose absolute) is roughly $435 per ounce! Aura Cacia is a VERY respectable brand/dealer of PEos and there are others, but that one comes to mind. If it says "blend" or x% Rose (or whatever you favorite oils, go elsewhere for your PEOs.<br /><br />I just planted my own roses and use a rose "tea" & open the windows and doors when the roses are blooming!<br /><br />Really, this is one of the better "see it everywhere" products out there, although I'd like to see REAL natural products that work & they do exist!<br /><br />Many chemical additives can be absorbed through the skin.<br /><br />My philosophy is that if you wouldn't eat it, then you probably shouldn't be putting it on your skin, with the exception of mud & mineral baths, which are incredible, and are fine with me in a bottle as well, IF naturally occurring and non-toxic!<br /><br />For a drug-store brand, they did pretty well in comparison. The small is nice, but not a favorite & it does get the tangles out!<br /><br />I'd rather have a natural formula, or make my own, but this one, if you need to jut grab some conditioner & it's good after a swim in the pool as well! Pretty good, but lost a star for the chemicals that weren't needed or really desirable IMHO & the smell was a bit odd.

review/text: My husband and I eat peanut butter by the spoonsful.  We had been buying Skippy Natural Creamy for several years and liked it very much.  Recently, when I bought it I noticed that it is now Skippy Natural Creamy with Honey.  I like honey so I thought it would be the same wonderful peanut butter with honey instead of sugar.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Instead of replacing the sugar with honey, they have added MORE sugar in the form of honey.  It now has 5 grams of sugars per serving instead of the 3 grams it did previously.  And it tastes so sweet now that the sweetness masks the natural peanut flavor. If the old style is not still available at the same price then we will be switching to Jif Natural.

They are in individual bags and ready to go...just soak and boil.  Done!  No mixing, no mess.  Be careful, though, when removing them from their individual bags as they are hot and you must use your fingers to open them.  There are little tabs to hold onto, but it can still be a bit precarious.

review/text: I love old-fashion puddings and this mix delighted me, my grandchildren, my children, and even the neighbors. I left a loaf of wheat bread out overnight to harden, then crumbled into my big mixer along with the pudding mix, crushed walnuts, and ingredients as listed. My entire condo was filled with the aroma within about ten minutes in the oven. By the time the large pan of pudding was baked, the aroma was out into the street. I topped it with raisins for the grandchildren who like them and left them off for those who do not. Vanilla ice cream and whipped cream topped off the steaming hot pudding. The next time, I added even more walnuts and some dried cranberries to one end--amazing!! I next want to try sourdough bread with diced apples. This is as good as it gets!!

review/summary: Very healthy lasagna, not bad but don't expect it as same as regular lasagna.
review/text: As long as you won't expect to taste as regular lasagna, this is pretty good as whole wheat lasagna. A bit gummy, different texture from the regular type, of course. For the health benefit with flaxseed, I can take it to substitute regular ones occasionally. One thing to point out is that one package may not be enough for traditional lasagna recipe.

review/text: Have been disappointed with typical store bought "healthier" pastas, but this brand has never let me down.  Consistency is same as traditional pastas... cooks, tastes and reheats just as well.  So much better for you too, being organic and whole wheat.  I am so pleased to have discovered this brand. I can't find it in local stores yet, so God bless amazon! We are big on healthy eating but also at having some kind of pasta at least once a week, so buying in bulk on amazon at a good price really suits our grocery buying purposes. So pleased that amazon offers so many organic choices that don't necessarily break the bank.  I buy local meat and produce from farmers, but for packaged organic foods, you can't beat amazon.

Once water is added, you get a very sweet, milky tea product: the exact same thing can be replicated at home with Lipton tea bags, 2-3 teaspoons of sugar and 1/4 cup of milk.  if you're looking for mill-tea, look elsewhere.  If you can't be bother to buy Lipton, sugar, milk and mix them together yourself, then go ahead; I guess this works.

review/text: The bar itself was decent and didn't have many calories associated with it. I generally try to avoid snack foods but this fact made it fairly easy for me to grab one or two of between meals.<br /><br />The taste though was semi decent and nothing special. If you don't like the taste of dates I suggest you avoid. At times it tastes like a neutrograin bar and other times it tastes like dates themselves.<br /><br />I also had, on several occasions, the unfortunate experience of getting some of the bar stuck in a tiny hole in my teeth. It's very hard to remove once it's stuck up there I can assure you.<br /><br />It's a decent bar for a quick snack but nothing too special.

review/text: Seems to be a consensus here with most of the reviewers that this is a decent product. I concur. The nutritional value is high; the flavor is decent, with a good synergy between the strawberry, dates, and oats; and it is vegan and certified organic for those who care about this.<br /><br />Now, here comes the however part ... The product description says that there are two servings per 1.7 oz bar. Now, 1.7 oz = 3 bites. Which means that a serving size is 1 1/2 bites. Just who is it who makes up these standards anyway? This is ludicrous if you ask me. The cost/benefit ratio here is so low as to be ridiculous.<br /><br />So, if price point is not an issue with you, then this would be a fair product. It will be interesting to see what the retail price is set at. THAT could be the product killer.

review/text: I was really looking forward to trying the Pro Bar fruition Strawberry bars.  I love snack bars and often will have a couple for breakfast. Nutritionally, these bars are great loaded with fruit and fiber and some protein.  They're 100% Vegan and non-GMO. My only problem with the bar is I'm not a big fan of dates and these taste overwhelmingly like dates.  The bars say they are made with organic dates and oats.  The taste of oats is pretty neutral.  I was expecting a bar that tasted like strawberry with some oats and dates along for the ride.  Instead this bar tastes like dates with the strawberry thrown in along for the ride.  Neither of my daughters is a fan of dates.  One wouldn't even try the bars.  The other took one bite and wouldn't eat any more.<br /><br />If you like dates and strawberries, I think you'll love these bars. They're soft and moist.  And, as I said, nutritionally, they are a winner. But, expect a big date flavor.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy yet pricey
review/text: I think some of the other reviewers are being a little unkind. To be honest if I had read the reviews before deciding to order I probably would have passed. As it was, I only read the other comments AFTER having tasted the bar. My considered opinion is that as far as healthy energy bars go "Fruition" hits the mark. It is a little like the texture and taste of a fig Newton without the soft cookie shell, but it has a very definite strawberry flavor that I personally like. It made a great mid-afternoon snack - though I'm not sure that just one bar would constitute a meal replacement. The main drawback to the product is the price. I'd have to be convinced that there were other tangible health benefits to eating this bar in order to justify the high price at over $2 per bar.

review/summary: The taste is the problem
review/text: The fact that that this bar is made of healthy ingredients is good, and, as a snack, is is healthier than a chocolate bar.  It is dense and chewy, which I liked, but I could not detect any rolled oats or cashews.  What I thought were pieces of cashew nuts had no cashew texture.  The whole bar has the same dried-paste texture except for some small seeds, possibly strawberry seeds.  Unfortunately, I did not like the flavor of Fruition Strawberry.  After I took a bite, I thought it was made from fig paste, but the list of ingredients shows date paste, it appears that dates and strawberry together taste similar to figs.  In any regard, if I have not seen the packaging, I would not realize the bar had any strawberry in it.  Furthermore, in my opinion, Fruition Strawberry bars are very sweet.  I consider them high in sugar - 22g per bar (one bar is 160 calories).  I compared a Fruition Strawberry bar to my preferred Nature Valley Trail Mix Fruit and Nut bar, and Trail Mix has only 14g of sugar AND five times less sodium than Fruition.  In addition Fruition Strawberry is quite pricey - the price per bar is four times that of Trail Mix.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Wy wife really likes these bars.  She likes the texture and the flavor, although she agrees that the bar does not taste like strawberry.  She also agrees that the bar is pricey.

review/text: I love the taste--and especially the texture--of these bars. They're moist and chewy, but not at all sticky or gooey. The texture is almost like a brownie, dense and chewy. And filling! As good as they are, you're not tempted to eat two, because one is satisfying enough.<br /><br />The sweetness comes mainly from fruit sugars, but as I don't have a sweet tooth, it was slightly too much for me. However, I'm assuming that most people have a higher tolerance for sweetness than I do, so they'll probably find the level to be just right.<br /><br />Of all the "healthy" bars I've tried, I have to say this one has the healthiest ingredients. And at only 160 calories with no saturated fat, I feel good about eating it, because it's not just a candy bar in disguise like most bars. My niece is used to there only being "healthy" food at Auntie's house, but I think this time she won't mind!

review/summary: A blah date paste based bar
review/text: The name of the bar is "Fruition", but really all the fruit in it is just dates. Dates are not a super nutritious high-antioxidant fruit, they're just really sweet. The bar basically has a datey and brown rice syrup taste, with just a hint of mild berry flavoring... it doesn't taste authentic and bright and exciting. Hardly any cranberries! Also, the chias are a little annoying; they get stuck in your teeth after swelling; however, there really isn't that many chia seeds to state a "superfood" claim.<br /><br />This bar I thought to try, because it seemed similar to Betty Lou's Just Great Stuff Superberry Acai bar (which I love, and has a great ORAC score), but it really doesn't have the nutrition or flavor that Betty Lou's bars do. It's really too sweet and nothing special. I'd say the best part about it is the packaging--the designing of the film is nice. Based on the beautiful packaging, I was hoping for a great tasting nutritious bar. Not so much. :(

It feels almost chalky or sandy in your mouth.<br /><br />While it doesn't purport to be organic, some reviewers have already said that this product is "organic" and "natural". This is not the case. While some organic ingredients are used, the bar is not 100% organic, like other products on the market.

review/text: I gave one of these to my sixteen-year-old niece, who took a couple of bites and summed it up: "When you first open it, it smells like you're going to get a tangy strawberry flavor, but when you eat it, it there's hardly any strawberry flavor at all." After she went home, I found that she took maybe 2 bites and then left the bar on her plate.<br /><br />The first time I ate one, a week or so earlier, the phrase "hint of strawberry" came to mind as a better description of the flavor. It should be noted that, in terms of nutrition and ingredients, there is no downside at all (unless you're counting carbs: 34/22 sugars). I've eaten a few of them over the past few weeks. I did not find them nearly as bad as some of the one- and two-star reviewers, but cannot find anything about them that deserves more than three stars.

review/text: I'm a big fan of snack bars, as I often eat them at work when I'm facing late afternoon hunger.  I tried this Fruition Strawberry Bar and had mixed feelings on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Texture.  It reminds me of a Fig Newton's texture.  It's not crumbly, so it won't make a mess (which is a big bonus for snacks on the go).  But it also isn't too gooey and sticky.<br />- Two servings of fruit in each bar.  Since very few people get their full allotment of fruits in a day, this definitely helps.<br />- Four grams of fiber.  Not a huge amount, but again, most people don't hit their fiber target in a given day.<br />- Contains a lot of organic ingredients and is vegan.  Some people may not care about this, but it's very important to others.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- High price.<br />- High sugar (22 grams)<br />- Strawberry flavor is not strong (and it's low on the list of ingredients). The primary ingredient is dates.<br /><br />Mixed feelings:<br />- Taste.  It's not the greatest tasting thing, but it's not bad either.  I don't picture myself ever craving one.  My vegan sister-in-law tried one and thought it was disgusting.<br />- Calories.  It contains 160, which is high or low depending on what your alternative is.  Is it healthier than eating a vending machine candy bar?  Of course.  But it's also higher than eating actual fruit, or a Fiber One bar (which is around 135 calories).

review/text: The ingredients list for the probar is pretty marvelous; everything is organic.  The consistency appears to mainly comprise dates, which is fine with me, since dates are delicious.  There is a slight hint of strawberry; the box hypes the addition of a super-food ingredient called a chia seed, but I couldn't see the seeds.  Perhaps they were ground up and added with the rest of the bar.<br /><br />While the bar may appear to be unappetizing, it tastes delicious and wholesome.  The sweetness is perfectly balanced.  The only downside is that each bar costs roughly between $2-$3.  If you absolutely must have your intake of chia seed and it must be in bar form, then you can't go wrong with the probar.

review/text: This bar ranks pretty highly in its genre. I like that it is organic and vegan, and only has 160 calories. It also has 4g of fiber and very low fat, which is great. I didn't expect it to taste like a candy bar or granola bar, but I think it tasted better than others in the same genre, like some soy bars. The strawberry flavor is pretty light, but it's there. I also liked the density and the texture. It's not gooey or dry and doesn't stick in your throat. It was also filling and energizing enough as a snack. I would have ranked this with five stars, but I can't picture myself buying it because it's so expensive for only 12 bars. If it was half the price, I would definitely buy this product.

review/summary: A Healthy Alternative
review/text: This bar is like a healthy fig newton without the outer cookie part. That is the best way for me to describe the taste. This date and oat bar was better than expected. Sometimes these healthy bars are like eating grass, but this one had decent flavor. Also, this was pliable and easy to chew. My six-year-old son loved it and ate a whole one himself! Incidently, being six, he has loose front teeth. As he was eating one, he lost his tooth! We think he swallowed it! Yikes! He enjoyed the bar so much, he never noticed. Give it a try. It would be a great pick-me-up for hiking or snacks for vacation.

review/summary: Good Concept, Bad Taste
review/text: My family and I eat a lot of organic foods, and when I saw these Fruition snack bars, I was excited to try them, and offer them as a healthy alternative when my kids get hungry for a snack.  As with most of the other disappointed reviewers, I am not a fan of the Fruition Probars.  In theory, Probar came up with a great concept for a quick fix bar.  The ingredients list has mostly organic ingredients and foods that are good for you.  Organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, strawberry puree, and chia seeds make up the bulk of the bar.  There are very few fillers or chemical ingredients added--things that I am trying to avoid in food products.  These would make an ideal snack, except the taste and texture of these bars is pretty unappealing, and despite the fact that these are healthy for you, it keeps me from wanting to eat them.<br /><br />As other reviews have pointed out, there is very little strawberry in the bar, and the overriding taste is date and mashed oats.  The bars themselves resemble a suet when you open the wrapper, and the texture in your mouth is like sticky, slightly hardened, pasty oatmeal.  The bars may be healthy, but the experience of eating the bars leave a lot to be desired.  They are visually unappealing, as my nine year old pointed out (and thus refused to try) and the texture in your mouth is not all that great either.  If you are using the bar as a meal replacement, or for a quick snack, you will be left wanting for something else, including a giant glass of water to wash it all down.  I think that Probar is on to something in trying to create a healthy organic snack bar alternative to what is on the market, they just need to figure out how to make it taste (and look) better.  I give the ingredients 4 stars and the taste of the bars 2 stars.

review/summary: Fulfills the "health food" stereotype
review/text: Confessedly I rarely to never eat health food (certainly not if it can be avoided), so the Fruitation strawberry bar met every one of my stereotype expectations: awkward taste, terrible consistency, and wholly unfulfilling.<br /><br />Light on strawberry and heavy on... dates, barley, and other unpallatables, this bar doesn't really deliver on its flavor promise.  Much worse though, it has the consistency of instant oatmeal that's been left out for 2 or 3 hours, then shaped into a bar - soggy and moist-ish, providing enough solid substance to chew against, but barely.<br /><br />I do give the bar props for the whole no-gluten, no-sugar thing, and again my view could be wildly skewed by my virgin innocence to health food stuffs.  For me, trying the Fruitation bar was a less-than-pleasant experience I shan't repeat.

review/summary: Good Taste, Just OK Nutrition
review/text: I received the ProBar Fruition Bar in Strawberry flavor; the label said it's made with organic dates and oats. Each bar has 160 calories, 2 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber, 22 grams of sugar and 3 grams of protein.<br /><br />The bar is 1.7oz, so pretty small, but I found that eating just one was satisfying enough. (I loved the wrapper - it just looked very fresh - but that's irrelevant) The ingredients were pretty straight forward with no confusing chemicals. Even though the bar was supposed to have a strawberry flavor, I could taste more of the dates and any strawberry flavor seemed artificial despite the fresh strawberry puree ingredient.<br /><br />The bar does not look very appetizing, but the taste is OK. Compared to many other nutrition bars out there, it wasn't overly chewy and did not leave a cardboard taste in my mouth. However, I think that 160 calories and ESPECIALLY the 22 grams of sugar is a little much for a tiny bar. If those 2 factors were balanced by more fiber and protein, I'd feel better about eating it. If you follow Weight Watchers, each bar is 3 points.

review/summary: Superfood is an Overstatement
review/text: These bars have a pleasant strawberry smell, but little strawberry flavor.  Nor do they seem to have much strawberry in them.  I suspect the claim to their having two servings of fruit is based on the main ingredient, date paste.<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, I prefer to have quantifiable nutrition in what I eat.  These bars contain no recognized vitamins whatsoever and small portions of only two minerals.  I suspect this is because the primary ingredient is fruit sugars.  On the plus side they do contain a lot of fiber and highly touted Chia seeds, which can't hurt.<br /><br />The taste was not bad at all, but I do't recommend eating it without something to wash it down.  I also did not find it very filling, despite all that fiber.

review/summary: A low-fat, high-fiber vegan bar
review/text: These dense, moist bars made mostly of date paste aren't pretty, but they offer a relatively healthy alternative as an on-the-go meal supplement or breakfast.  The bars are chewy, with a bit of seed crunch from black and white chia seeds.  They taste more of dates than strawberries; strawberry puree is fourth on the ingredient list, after date paste, rolled oats, and brown rice syrup. The cloying sweetness of dates simply overwhelms the berry flavor, although the strawberry taste and scent are there.  For me, that isn't a bad thing -- I like dates -- but people expecting a fresh, dominant strawberry taste will be disappointed.  The cashews cannot be easily detected in the flavor, either, although they add to the protein.<br /><br />With 22 grams of sugar, the bars aren't a good choice for people trying to limit sugar intake, although the modest 2 grams of fat (no saturated or trans fat) works for those who are on fat-restricted diets.  The primary nutritional benefit of the Fruition bars comes from the fiber (4 grams) and protein (3 grams), with antioxidants from the fruit, nuts, and whole grain oats.  They contain no vitamins and only a small amount of minerals (4% RDA of calcium and 6% RDA of iron.)  In fact, the complete absence of vitamin C suggests just how few strawberries each bar contains.<br /><br />Because these are vegan, they contain no dairy products -- no eggs, no milk, no butter, no whey.  They are the organic counterpart of the usual meal and sports bars, both in taste and texture.  If you don't like dense and chewy sports bars, you won't like these, but if you do and like the taste of dates, try these out.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/summary: my 3 year old loves these
review/text: there is a lot of sugar but mostly healthy ingredient but best of all, my three year old loves these healthy snacks. They have the consistence of a date bar, and since it is basically a date paste, that makes sense.  They are not "too" sweet, even though they have 22g of sugar. I think they are tasty, especially with a cup of coffee and are way better for you than a donut, at and 130 cal. a lot less fattening. They are pretty good size for a fruit bar and filling. I'd buy them again and recommend them.

review/summary: This tastes very healthy! And that's the problem...
review/text: Organic, natural foods should taste great and be satisfying. While these bars are very healthy for you, they taste too grainy and heavy. Eating them makes one happy for trying to eat healthy foods, but they honestly do not taste that great and it's a bit of a chore to finish even one bar. I wish that there was more fruit flavor in the bars because the fiber taste seems to overtake the fruit flavor.

review/summary: Not much strawberry taste, mostly date
review/text: After opening the package, I was surprised the unappetizing product was even edible. It's a dark mass of gooey nuts, oats, dates, strawberries and etc. Surprisingly enough the gooey product didn't adhere to your teeth and make you crave brushing your teeth right away.<br /><br />Tastewise, it was edible and kind of sweet, but it's not something I would pick up normally and eat as a snake. The only time I would eat such a snack would be if I had no other food and was hungry. The 160 calorie per bar is great, but I couldn't get much strawberry taste from it. The date taste was overpowering and does remind me of the fig newton bars.<br /><br />Both my husband and my 6 year old tried the bar, but immediately after taking a bite their faces cringed. While they could swallow it, they did not enjoy the taste whatsover.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to others who are extremely food conscious and can take the expense of these snacks. Otherwise, I'd prefer eating fresh fruit over this product.

review/summary: Based on taste, I would give it a lower rating...
review/text: Ok, first I have to say that I do not buy many organic food products, my guess is that my taste buds are not as used to this kind of food as other reviewers.<br /><br />I opened the package and as soon as I did, I had my three kids sorrounding me with their hands trying to reach the box, so I gave them each one, my oldest son opened his first, he took a bite and immediately gave it back to me, he said "it tastes funny" I told my other son to try it before he opened his just to see if he liked it, he tried it and gave me his unopened bar back to me, he said "it does taste weird!" Yeah you guessed it, my daughter didn't like it either!.. Ok, so I thought it was just the kids, "they're not into the grown up stuff!" I took a bite and I knew what they were talking about! It tastes like some kind of flavorless hard Jelly, It does not taste like strawberry at all to me (although you can feel the seeds!) In my own opinion, if you've never tried this kind of organic food, you probably won't like it. And just to be fair, I did give one to one of my co-workers since he only eats organic food and he loved it, he even asked me where I bought them.<br /><br />At this price (around $2.25 per bar) I think you can probably find something more nutritious and with better taste, but that's just me.

review/summary: Very healthy and they taste good but the cost exceeds what I would pay
review/text: Very healthy and they taste good but the cost exceeds what I would pay<br /><br />A single 1.7 oz Fruition Strawberry bar is the equivalent of eating two servings of fruit. These bars are made of strawberry, dates, oats, chia seeds and cashews. The bar is very filling for the size and it serves as a good appetite suppressant. Each bar contains 160 calories, 4 grams of fiber, 2 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein and 4 grams of dietary fiber. However it also contains 22 grams of sugar and 34 grams of carbohydrates which seems to be a little high. The chia seeds make these bars rich in antioxidants and omega-3. These bars are 100 Vegan, Non GMO and certified organic by QAI.<br /><br />**These bars are made in made in a facility that processes nuts and they contain nuts**<br /><br />I have to admit I was skeptical when first opening the package and they don't look incredibly appetizing but they taste much better than they look. You will immediately smell the strawberry but thy do not have a strong strawberry taste. The closest thing I can compare these bars to is original fig newton bars. They really taste quite a bit like them. I let my kids try one and they both liked them a lot. I liked them but the cost is beyond what I would pay for them. The cost of these bars is about 5 to 6 times the cost of granola or cereal bars and I just can't justify that. I think these bars are a good option and they have their place but it's not something that I will be purchasing on a regular basis. It you are totally committed to a 100 Vegan diet and cost isn't a deciding factor for you then you may feel differently than I do.

review/summary: Probably healthier that a lot of other bars
review/text: The PROBAR Fruition bar is probably healthier than a lot of other bars or snacks on the market.  The strawberry flavor was not very prominent, and the bar has a bit of an apple flavor. I didn't think that it tasted bad and will continue to eat them. The bars were dense, but pretty smooth with just a little crunch from the nuts and seeds. The nutrition facts from the box states:<br />Serving size: 1 bar (48g)<br />Calories: 160, Calories from fat: 20<br />Total fat: 2g,  3%<br />  Saturated fat: 0g<br />  Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg  1%<br />Total Carbohydrate 34g  11%<br />  Dietary fiber: 4g  16%<br />  Sugars 22g<br />Protein 3g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 4%<br />Iron 6%<br />Percent values based on a 2,000 calorie diet<br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Organic date paste<br />Organic rolled oats<br />Organic brown rice syrup<br />Strawberry puree<br />Cashews<br />Apple juice infused strawberries<br />White chia seeds<br />Black chia seeds<br />Natural strawberry flavor<br />Strawberry extract<br />Tocopherols<br />Natural flavor<br />Ascorbic acid<br />Citric acid<br />Arabic gum<br />100% vegan; non GMO<br />Certified Organic by QAI<br /><br />Tocopherols are defined as "fat-soluble vitamins consisting of tocopherols, especially alpha-tocopherol, that are found chiefly in plant leaves, wheat germ oil, and milk and that act as antioxidants in the body." I thought it was interesting that the bars were certified organic, but the strawberry puree, the apple juice infused strawberries, and the strawberry extract were not identified as being organic.

review/summary: Decent for snacking
review/text: Since my brother is very into healthy and nutritious food, I gave him a box of these to test and taste. He said:<br />"These are excellent as a meal replacement or snack. The organic ingredient composition combined with the great fruit taste and chewy texture make it the healthy choice for exercise and outdoor activities. Only main downside is the regular price, which is roughly double the cost of competitors."<br /><br />I had a couple, they do indeed taste good, not too try like some other energy bars, and not too crunchy where it'll break your teeth! You can taste the strawberries inside and it's pretty decent for a snack too. Interesting that there's "unprocessed dates, oats, and cashews" inside, I wouldn't have noticed the dates and I'm not a big fan of those.  Not sure if I felt "full of energy from dawn until dusk" after eating these, but I'm sure it'll work for some!

review/summary: Tasty Trail Treat...
review/text: New "PROBAR Fruition Snack Bars" come in a variety of fruit flavors and provide a tasty quick energy kick on the trail, based on an intriguing mixture of high energy dates, rolled oats, and fruit.  At 160 calories per bar, a snack doesn't have to wreck a diet, and the fruit flavors, especially the Lemon, Cherry, and Strawberry, really stand out strongly.  The bars are a bit pricey per unit, which might be a good motivation to buy in the quantity offered by a 12-count box.  The bars seem to hold up well in rucksacks and pockets, although they need to kept above freezing to be chewable.  Highly recommended.

The texture was what I could not get past, despite loving Larabars, Bumblebars, and Kind bars, these fell no where in that range of textures.  I put the rest of the box out in the company break room and solicited other opinions.  "Tastes like strawberry scented cardboard." "Nasty." "Not my cup of tea."  Most were too polite to say what they were thinking other than "eh", but the mid-chew face, eyes darting for a trash can, panicky look that someone would watch them spit it out, were all the review I needed.  I didn't hear much else out of a group of folks who will eat just about anything, and Fruition bars lingered on the table for several days.

review/summary: Same niche as LaraBars, but not my favorite bar
review/text: I have become a fan of LaraBars, and their single-digit number of ingredients, and was expecting the ProBar to be similar. It is and it isn't.<br /><br />I'm comparing specifically the Strawberry ProBar Fruition to the Cherry Pie LaraBar, as that's the most similar kind of LaraBar I've tried.<br /><br />Having tried the two side by side, I suddenly realize that the LaraBar is like a fruitcake, only a really, really good one oozing with tart cherries and nuts. The ProBar reminds me of a Fig Newton. There's not the outside crust, but a bite of the ProBar is very reminiscent of a bite of Fig Newton to me. Including the texture with the tiny seeds. This is almost certainly because the second ingredient in the ProBar is rolled oats -- the cakey flavor (the LaraBar has no grain).<br /><br />The ProBar also seems sweeter to me, which I don't like, and I guess at 34 carbs to the LaraBar's 30, it IS slightly sweeter.<br /><br />They are both 1.7oz, FWIW.<br /><br />The LaraBar has more calories (200) than the ProBar (160), and 8 grams of fat to the 2 grams of fat in the ProBar. So that's something to consider, depending on why you are contemplating this purchase.<br /><br />For me, the whole-foods aspect of LaraBars was one of the draws, and I prefer that to these. But depending on your needs, these might fill the bill. More like a cookie to me, but very tasty.

review/text: I had initially been really anticipating the arrival of these bars in order to see just how they compared to my snack bar standby, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, well I have to admit that now that they have arrived, I am a bit disappointed. For one, they are 160 calories per bar where my Nutri-Grain bars are at 130 calories per bar. Also, I think that the Nutri-Grain bars are better tasting than these ones, which I found to have very little strawberry taste to them at all. More of a faint hint of strawberries, rather than actually tasting like strawberries.<br /><br />I don't think these are bad snack bars at all, I just feel that Nutri-Grain are much better with more flavor and less calories.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Martial Artist/Krav Maga Instructor<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/text: These bars are pretty darned good - which is to say better than I thought they'd be and better than my first impression. First impression upon opening a bar was - um, they look dark and gritty and not too tasty. And, ok, they are are dark and a little gritty. Then again, they're tasty, too. They enough to take the hunger away and I like the fact that they're organic - a big plus.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy them again. Much better tasting than a lot of the fiber bars you can find - these actually have fruit taste to them - and just enough to satisfy you until the next meal.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: I am on a constant lookout for breakfast bars or snack bars for myself.  Every morning, I have a banana and a bar of some sort.  I was very excited that I got to try these.  They are good but it reminds me of a fig newton type product.  I am not a big fan of the fig newton because of the taste and texture but I can eat them.  This product reminds me of that, with a strawberry flavor.  I had one every day and they do fill you up and I did feel I had "good" energy.  I would buy them in a store as a change of pace.  As I said, I do go on searches for the perfect breakfast bar, and since I haven't found one yet, I do alternate among my favorites.  I could see myself buying this about every 3 months or so.<br />It's good and if you like the fig newton thing, you will love it !

review/summary: Good for you and filling.
review/text: I guess when I think of superfood, I think of sprulina. These bars did not have much strawberry flavor, but then again, it also did not have the artificial flavor that you would expect from other snack products. You would taste much more strawberry flavor in fresh strawberries. We recieved a whole box, which was much better getting one or two and so I was able to share with the family and got favorable feedback from all.<br /><br />My family loved it much more than I thought they would --- I like to have them with my coffe in the morning as I get up much earlier than the family and I need something to eat before breakfast and this helps to have something good in my stomach. They are also not chewy and gooey like some energy bars are.<br /><br />They are also good for a snack before going to the gym, if you need a little extra energy (as I do). But don't expect an overpowering strawberry flavor.

review/summary: Better than the Usual Snack
review/text: Forget the candy bar, and don't worry about trying to pack fresh fruit in your knapsack.  the Fruition Strawberry bars are tasty, satisfying, more convenient and at least as healthy as the fresh stuff.<br /><br />I like it's collection of grains, nuts and fruit that DO NOT try to masquerade as something else.  This is a good tasting snack, it's not a meal substitute and nothing incurs my dietary ire more than the implication that you'll get "everything you need" in one meal bar etc.  I would categorize Fruition as a healthy snack, and one that is far more appealing than the empty calories of a carb and sugar-loaded candy bar.

review/summary: Healthy and Tasty
review/text: Tastes amazing, good for you, small, 170 or so calories.<br /><br />You can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals.<br /><br />Perfect in every way, and organic!<br /><br />The only "con" i have is the price, it's almost 2 dollars a bar, which is kinda high for buying in bulk (it is a small bar after all).<br /><br />The organic protein bars I usually use contain almost twice the calories, are still raw and organic (though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar), comes in at about the same price.  It can be used as a meal replacement, which makes it worth the value.<br /><br />If amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to 16-18 dollars, I would highly recommend this, and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month.<br /><br />These things are AMAZING

review/summary: Palatable, but flat.
review/text: While I admire the ambitious effort to make a raw food snack that includes a vast array of additional nutrients, this just didn't do it for me.  I wish I could recommend something else that is better, but I'm new to the world of raw foods and found this to be bland and just a tad "chalky".  The texture is somewhat moist and chewy, but leaves a dry feeling in the mouth after chewing for a while (and you will have to chew for a while).  My husband thought it was "okay" but it didn't leave him asking for more, and my kids were not impressed, either.<br /><br />I do give it 3 stars because it's very healthy and you really can taste the strawberries in this. It's not a hint of strawberry, but has a good, fruity flavor. However, it also has a strong, oat-ey flavor, as well, making it taste somewhat like a stick bar of dry breakfast oatmeal, if you could imagine that.  If you like your foods a little on the milder side with few seasonings, this may actually be appropriate for you. If you're like me and prefer something strong and flavorful, this probably won't float your boat.

review/summary: Great Snack Food - But Sweet!
review/text: These are among the better tasting "nutritious" snack food bars on the market.  Upon my first bite, my taste buds were almost overwhelmed by date flavor.  Looking over the ingredients, it was no surprise to see that the main ingredient was date paste.  The strawberry taste was apparent, but it was more of a strawberry finish than direct flavor.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, there aren't a whole lot of protein or vitamins in this bar.  Make no mistake, this is no power bar or cliff bar.  What it lacks in those areas, however, it makes up for in flavor and fiber.<br /><br />I'd definitely order these again; they're great on the go, and make a good healthy dessert alternative.

review/summary: powerful strawberry bars!!!!
review/text: Since I am a health and fitness nut, eating the best protein bars is in my<br />top list of priorities. As a first-time Fruition patron, I can honestly say<br />the bar was quite satisfactory. I was happy with all nutritional content;<br />however, I was a little disappointed with the number of carbohydrates<br />included in the bar. Carbs are always good, especially after an intensive<br />cardio workout, and especially if complex, but I am always picky about the<br />number of carbs in any nutrition bar; therefore, that somewhat bothered me<br />(and yes, I am aware that many of the best protein/energy bars do include a<br />high number of "good" carbs; however, the carb factor is something I have to<br />accept). Aside the carb factor, I was happy with all other nutritional<br />aspects of the bar, such as the bar only being 160 calories (considering its<br />size!), the bar including two servings of fruit, the bar having 4 grams of<br />dietary fiber, and the bar being organic and high fructose corn<br />syrup-less!!!! The taste of the bar was not the best I have tasted, but it<br />was tasty nonetheless. In fact, my three year old-toddler, has favored this<br />strawberry-flavored bar as his current favorite snack food, which suits me<br />well, because he is a thin child, and if these bars please and nourish him,<br />I have no complaints. Buying the bars in bulk is probably a better choice,<br />because it is certainly more cost effective. "Great bars worth the price" is<br />certainly my review.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I love the idea of snack bars, but have never really found any I like. This one is different!<br /><br />The flavors are clean -- it tastes like real food -- and the consistency is completely edible. It does get stuck in your teeth a bit, but not in that cement-like way that many of the others do.<br /><br />The ingredients are great: Organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, strawberry puree, cashews, apple juice infused strawberries, white chia seeds, black chia seeds, natural strawberry flavor, strawberry extract, tocopherols [doesn't note origin], natural flavor, ascorbic acid, citric acid, arabic gum.<br /><br />They're also 100% vegan, and labeled as non-GMO.<br /><br />They have 160 calories per bar, and 34g of carbs (4g of dietary fiber). Only 2g of fat. I think I'd prefer a bar with more calories, fiber, and maybe even fat (I'm not eating a snack bar to lose weight, I'm eating it to keep going without stopping for a full meal), but this is enough to tide me over for an hour or two. With other energy bars, when my body uses it up, I *crash*, and feel so hungry I think I might be sick. With these, it feels more like a naturally-occurring hunger, and I have sufficient time once I realize I'm getting hungry to actually procure some "real" food.<br /><br />All in all, these are a great option if you're looking for a snack bar, even if the natural/organic thing isn't the primary thing you're interested in!

review/summary: Light on the strawberry ...
review/text: I really wanted to like these.  I often carry another "all-natural" fruit/nut bar (Larabar, usually cherry flavor) to tide me over on my weekly commute to/from "the city" for rehearsals, and figured these fruition bars would be a nice flavorful alternative.<br /><br />Sorry, but it just didn't work out.  These have a somewhat "pasty" texture, and a very strong flavor of dates, which is OK, I suppose.  After all, the first ingredient listed is "organic date paste."  I would emphasize the "paste" part of that.  What's really missing is the STRAWBERRY.  I could almost forgive the texture if these had more strawberry flavor.<br /><br />As it is, these are super sweet, with a rather off-putting gummy-pasty texture, and the overriding flavor of dates.  I just can't give these more than three stars.

review/summary: Good taste, filling, healthy
review/text: While I usually eat granola bars for a quick snack, they're not especially good for you nutritionally.<br /><br />I decided to try something different and went with the Fruition Strawberry bar.<br /><br />They're 160 calories with 20 calories from fat. They have very low sodium and are vegan to boot.<br /><br />I like the taste a lot, it has a definite fruity taste and isn't sickeningly sweet or cloying like some of the granola bars I've had in the past. The texture is soft and moist and won't leave a ton on crumbs in your lap as you snack. I like nibbling a bit as I drink my tea.<br /><br />Since they're soft and moist, they stand up to being in a jacket pocket or a backpack and won't disintegrate into a pile of crumbs as you hike.<br /><br />One warning: they're more likely to appeal to the adult palate, both of my kids vastly prefer the sweet granola snack bars. Don't be disappointed if your kids aren't enamored with them.<br /><br />Bottom line: tasty, good for you and hiking friendly.

review/text: I like the natural fruity flavor.  It's not overly sweet, but it's not cardboard.  And the thick, chewy texture is fine with me.  I find these bars rather filling for their size.  Although they have 160 calories, only 30 come from fat.  Fruition bars seem to have everything going for them.  So what's not to love?<br /><br />Well, there is one thing -- as of this writing, a box of 12 bars runs nearly thirty dollars!  Even other organic fruit bars can be had for less than half that much.  I'm not sure what makes Fruition bars so pricey.  But I can't imagine paying that much for a dozen fruit bars.

review/summary: a healthy go-to snack
review/text: The Probar fruition strawberry snack bar is very good.  I especially like the ingredients of dates(one of my favorites), oats, and strawberries, all mixed together to form a tasty, fruity concoction.  They remind me of Fig Newton cookies(another fave!).  It would be interesting to try any other flavors that Probar makes.  Being organic, and Vegan, the snack bar would appeal to a number of people who are looking for a healthy go-to snack.  I don't know much about the Chia seeds, but think that they are similar to flax, in their usage.  All the other ingredients seem to be natural, and not harmful.  I only gave the bars 4 stars because they are a little too chewy and gummy.  I would have preferred a slightly drier bar - I'm sure the culprit is the dates(which I do adore!).  They are a deliciously fine product when you crave a quick healthy snack!

review/text: The fruition bars, like most "superfood" bars, are not the most tasty things to eat. This being said, they are definitely moister than many. In fact, they almost seem like shaped goo/paste (which makes sense considering the main ingredient). It's almost as if they are uncooked (which they very well may be).<br /><br />Taste aside, the bars are definitely filling and do not make me gag in the same way that other, more drier/powederier  bars do. I will definitely be eating the rest of the box, but once they're gone, I think I'll choose something else, especially considering the $2.00+ per unit price.

review/summary: Expensive but decent
review/text: I eat a lot of these types of snack/meal bars.  This one gets high marks from me because of several reasons.  First, the texture is good.  I like that it isn't crumbly or hard, it is soft and chewy without being too gooey.  I'm not a fan of cracking my teeth trying to eat a bar.  One thing I would recommend to try to improve is to make the packaging easier to open.  Sometimes it's easy to open, and sometimes not.  I tried for over a minute to get into this bar the other day because I was sitting in the car, and I didn't have scissors with me. Another plus with this bar is that it should hold up well in the heat.  It hasn't been hot enough (yet) here in South Texas, but in a few months, it is going to be too hot to be traveling around with chocolate coated snack bars.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, you can't go wrong with everything that is in this bar, unless you have allergies to any of it.  Always read through the ingredient list just in case.  I understand that the chia seeds (white and black here) are good for filling you up, and taking away that hungry feeling.  Lots of Omega-3 fatty acids with the chia seeds, antioxidants are a good thing.  The strawberry bar contains 160 calories, has 3 grams of protein, no saturated fat, and 2 grams of total fat.  It includes 4 grams of dietary fiber, which is something we could all use more of.<br /><br />I would say that a bummer about these bars is they are pretty pricey.  I'm not saying that it's not worth it, but any bar that costs more than $2 is expensive.

review/summary: Good but pricey
review/text: Upon opening the package, this snack bar left a mixed first impression.  Visually, the bars are hardly the most visually appealing product I've had, but the strong strawberry smell did promise a tasty snack.  Unfortunately, the promised flavor was never realized.  The texture and flavor of these bars is probably most similar to the filling of a Fig Newton.  While that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it wasn't quite what I was expecting from a snack bar that was labeled as being strawberry flavored.<br /><br />While these snack bars are probably relatively healthy for you (they have NO high-fructose corn syrup listed on the ingredients, and precious little in the way of other sweeteners), they are very expensive.  At more than $2.25 per bar, only the most dedicated vegan or organic food consumer is likely to be willing to buy these.  Personally, I'm not convinced that these are worth the price.

review/summary: Good Bars but Not Worth the Price
review/text: I received these bars as a promotion, so that I might try and review them. After about a week of having one each morning and taking a few into work for light "on the go" snacks, I grew to like them. Chewy, decent (but not overpowering) fruit flavor and filling. That is when I decided I might buy some of these to incorporate into my breakfast routine.<br /><br />After seeing the price, I can confidently say that as good as these bars are, I will not be buying them. They are simply overpriced. The taste is decent (though I agree with another reviewer that there is way more fig than strawberry), the taste is not outstanding or significantly better than the run-of-the-mill breakfast bars at your local grocery (the kind which are half as expensive). As each bar is 160 calories and 1.7 ounces, the bars are simply too small to pay the per-bar price (do the math and I think you'll agree; better yet, calculate a per-ounce price with 12 bars per package and you'll REALLY see what I mean). Yes, these are 'vegan' bars but unless you are vegan (I am not) and cannot find a lower-priced alternative, I'd say that these bars are priced higher than they are worth.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying that these aren't good bars. They have a nice chewy texture, are decently sweet without being sugary, and are a filling quick breakfast or mid-afternoon snack. I simply think it is a shame that they are priced so high. If they were priced lower, I'd have given these five stars.

review/summary: A rare "power" bar...packed with super foods, low on calories
review/text: As a weight loss coach and foodie who concentrates on natural foods, I tend to shy away from most snack bars, energy bars or protein bars no matter how "nutritious" they claim to be...because I am a label reader.<br /><br />Many have as many calories as a full meal or contain things like high fructose corn syrup, or other things to mask the taste of vitamins added or artificial ingredients.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, are  made with organic dates and oats, and packed with antioxidant-rich "superfoods" and low calories and fat.  Making them both a great meal replacement or snack bar. They are EXTREMELY filling...high fiber foods are slow to digest so it's very satisfying yet low in fat. (160 calories, 2 grams fat, 4 grams fiber)<br /><br />The texture is similar to a fig newton bar, and the taste is kind of a combo of a fig newton bar, apple juice, strawberry puree, a bit of cashews and oats. Probably because it contains all of the above (except there is date paste rather than fig...not much difference.)<br /><br />They are healthy and satisfying...making them a great treat.<br /><br />Negatives: For me, I wish they were a tad LESS sweet. I'd prefer to taste more oats and less of the natural sweeteners but that is simply personal preference. There is no sugar on the ingredient list but it's sweetened with the strawberry puree, brown rice syrup, and apple juice.  An adjustment of more strawberry paste to less brown rice syrup would probably create a better balance of flavors for me as well even if the sweetness wasn't adjusted because the brown rice syrup creates a sugar taste vs. a fruit taste.<br /><br />This would be a great breakfast due to it's low calorie content yet filling nature and ability to "grab and go" with the bar on a busy morning.

review/summary: Chewy Date Bar
review/text: fruition claims their bar is a "fruit-based superfood snack bar designed to be satisfying while on the go without added fat and calories." Each bar is 160 calories and contains 2 grams of total fat and 34 grams of total carbohydrates. When I first open a package it has a strong strawberry smell but does not have the taste to match it even though strawberry puree is the fourth ingredient and there are three other strawberry ingredients as you go down the list. The ingredients are all bound by a date paste that bind them all together and give it its chewy texture and its grittiness I think is attributed by the cashews and chia seeds. It may be all organic but of 39 grams the bar consist of 22 grams of sugar and 20 milligrams of sodium.<br /><br />I must agree with many that it does not taste like strawberries and it does leave an after taste that to me is more nut flavor. A single bar does take away the hunger pangs and left me feeling satisfied. I would eat these but would not seek them out. One aside; I find it funny that of all the fruit flavors fruition sells they do not have a date flavored one as that is the main ingredient of the bar. Of course I have not had a good tasting date since I returned from the Middle East.

review/summary: TWO NEW FANS...
review/text: I wasn't aware of Fruition Probars until I tried the new strawberry flavor.  I expected a hard-to-chew granola type bar (I hate granola snacks).  I thought I would hand them over to my husband and use him as a Guiney pig.  But as soon as I opened one I could smell strawberry and dates -- yummy.... I found the bar firm, but soft to chew. It really is tasty, and I appreciate that it's natural, low in calories, etc... We tried the bars when hunger hit and stopping to eat wasn't an option. Just one probar took the hunger away.  My husband's job is physically demanding. This power snack made such an impression on him he wants to try the other flavors.  I highly recommend the new Strawberry Probar.

review/summary: Horrible texture
review/text: These bars are horrible.<br /><br />They have the texture of wet particle board, just like sawdust and chalk.  Makes me think they ground everything to fine powder and mashed it all back together.  The whole thing would've been better if they left the cashews whole and crunchy, the dried strawberries whole and chewy, and the oats whole and crunchy too.<br /><br />A strong strawberry flavor may have made them edible, but the bars don't even taste like strawberries.  The strongest flavor is dates, and I like dates, but no way can they stand their own with the vile texture.<br /><br />On the plus side they are vegan, non-GMO, and organic.  I appreciate that, but these are bars I could only eat if I was trapped somewhere without food.

review/summary: Edible, probably good for you...that's about it
review/text: Labeling these as strawberry flavored borders on false advertising; they're made primarily from dates and rolled oats and that's pretty much what they taste like.  There is strawberry in them, but I really can't taste it.  They are by no means inedible, but they have sort of a gummy, mildly unpleasant consistency.  Since they're mostly dates, honestly I'd rather just eat a handful of dried dates (I really like dates; it's sort of ironic that they took something I like and screwed it up so they could make a bar out of it).<br /><br />I guess they're a fairly healthy thing to stick in your desk if you may want a snack...but I'd have to be pretty hungry to really enjoy them.  I'd be happier snacking on dried dates and maybe some nuts.  My kids HATED them.

review/summary: Did not care for flavor or consistency of this bar
review/text: I was really expecting to like this all natural, organic fruit bar, but, frankly, I did not particularly enjoy it.<br /><br />It has a strange, grainy and chewy consistency, which put me off right away.  I could taste some strawberry, but mostly I could taste dates.  I do like dates. I like all kinds of dried fruits, but I, personally, would not buy this product.<br /><br />I usually eat Nutri-grain bars and here is a breakdown of the two bars.  The size of the Probar is 1.7 oz. compared to the Nutri Grain of 1.3 so that must be taken into consideration:<br /><br />Nutri Grain<br />Calories - 130<br />Total Fat 3 grams<br />Saturated Fat 0.5 grams<br />No Trans Fat or Cholesterol<br />Sodium - 105  mg<br />Carbs - 24 grams<br />Fiber - 2 grams<br />Sugars - 12 grams<br />Protein - 2 grams<br /><br />Probar Fruition<br />Calories - 160<br />Total Fat 2 grams<br />Saturated Fat - 0 grams<br />No Trans Fat or Cholesterol<br />Sodium - 20 mg<br />Carbs -  34 grams<br />Fiber -  4 grams<br />Sugars - 22 grams<br />Protein - 3 grams<br /><br />Based on the above comparison, Probar is probably the healthier choice.  If I could get past the consistency, that would be the best choice, but I guess my palate is not suited to my eat this kind of snack bar.  I struggled to finish just one.

review/summary: Better than most, could be less sweet
review/text: The Fruition Strawberry bars are among the better tasting nutrition/snack bars out there. Nutritionally they are solid, made from fruits, seeds, nuts and oats. There are even 4 grams of dietary fiber which is great. My one concern is the whopping 22 grams of sugar. That's excessive. There is a likely cause, which is the added brown rice syrup. Not sure this bar needed that additional level of sweetness. Also, they are 100% vegan and non GMO, and certified organic by QAI.<br /><br />Thing is? The price. It's simply far too high. At over $2 per bar, there are better options on the market. The lowest price I could find online still put them at $1.75 per bar. Too high to buy regularly for me, sorry Pro Bar! Normally I would have removed a star for the very high price, but this review is based solely on the product itself since buying it was not part of my experience.<br /><br />If cost is no object to you, these are a great alternative to processed candy snacks though.

review/summary: Delicious and FILLER-FREE!
review/text: Unlike sports bars and energy bars, there are absolutely no filler ingredients in this bar.  It is date-based, with natural flavorings and seeds added, and most of the ingredients are organic. This is a vegan bar, which doesn't much matter to me since I'm not even close to vegetarian.  But I do tend toward the healthy side, and finding a bar that is good for you, and delicious, without loads of added sugar and JUNK, is a great thing.  They're dense, but they don't feel "heavy" in your stomach.  It's a pleasant texture, with none of that sawdust-feel that comes with "healthy" sports bars, and no "crisp-rice" that comes with some energy bars I've tried, which it seems to me are nothing more than Rice Crispies Treats.<br /><br />I'm using these bars as in-between snacks to stave off hunger, say, before a late dinner, or after a workout when it's not quite time for a meal.  Dates are full of natural sugars, so they are also high in carbs. Even though I'm low-carb, I won't hesitate to enjoy these once a day.

review/summary: Healthy Tasty Snack Bar
review/text: This is a review of Fruition Strawberry bars<br /><br />Nutrition: Each bar contains 160 calories.  This seems to be a little higher than in some other bars I have, especially since the description says that it does not contain "extra" fat and calories.  Still, 160 calories is not excessive, especially of you're looking for an energy boost during or after exercise.  It only contains 2g of fat, and no saturated fat, which is good. It does have a fair amount of fiber (4g), again, a good thing.<br /><br />Ingredients: It claims to have organic, vegan, non-GMO ingredients, which is good.  Because of its bad rap, many foods are now using alternatives to high-fructose corn syrup, which seems to be in about everything.  There is none of that in these bars. However, the third largest ingredient in these bars is "rice syrup."  This is really just a form of sugar (maltose, glucose and maltotriose).  Other major ingredients are made from dates, strawberries, and apple juice.  Although these are "strawberry" bars, Strawberry puree is the 4th ingredient, when listed by volume. It also contains strawberry flavoring, Arabic gum and several other ingredients.  Overall though, all of the ingredients seem reasonable.  The ingredient list is much shorter than on similar bars and they were no unpronounceable chemical in the list.<br /><br />Taste:  Overall I was pleased with the taste of the bars. They were not overly fruity or excessively sweet and had a nice consistency.<br /><br />Final Verdict:  Although I did some nitpicking, these are reasonably healthy fruit bars and have an enjoyable taste.  I'd recommend them if you looking for a healthy snack in bar form.

review/summary: Fruition PROBAR - Flavorful, easy to eat, and filling
review/text: The Simply Real Fruition PROBAR is tasty, filling and easy to eat.  The strawberry bar has a mild understated flavor to it.  There is a nice fig Newton-like grittiness to it, due to the cashews and seed pieces that are in the bar.  For just 160 calories, it is remarkably filling to eat.  This is light enough to eat on the run, or just before a run or workout.  This is a terrific alternative to other health bars.
