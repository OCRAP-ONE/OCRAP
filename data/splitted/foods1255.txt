review/summary: Too many broken cups!!!
review/text: I was so excited to see that I could get flavored coffee creamer cups in bulk. They came in the mail at a decent time, but I have thrown out way too many broken cups that have leaked all over the other cups.  Out of 192 single serve cups I think I've thrown out 15 that were punctured.  That may not seem like a lot, but these coffee creamers are like precious gems to me. I NEED them for my coffee and I hate running back to the store to get more.  So, my only complaint is that I received too many punctured cups. :(

review/summary: Bad packaging!
review/text: The packaging of the creamers did not hold up to the test of shipping.  About a quarter of the creamers were cracked open and covered the inside of the box.  They smell amazing but it doesnt out weigh the hour that it took to clean up and the 46 creamers I lost.  I do not blame Amazon.com, International Delight, nor the shippers, but the combination of the three didnt get the package to my door unharmed.

I have ordered the Irish Creme version three times and they have all been received in perfect condition so it must be the shipper.

I have not had a problem until this shipment - I ordered both the hazelnut and french vanilla and both boxes were leaking - one pretty badly. After spending about 30 minutes cleaning them out and throwing away the broken ones, I am going to have to give some consideration to whether I order again. At the very least, I think there should be a discount on an order that is leaking!

review/text: I bought these to try the individual creamers. Found I do not like them. The box had several that had opened and the inside was sticky. I found them to be a messy and pain to open and throw away. I will stick with powder creamer. I also like the flavor of the powder. It is more intense. These have a milder Hazelnut flavor if you prefer milder in your tea or coffee. They are good quality.

review/text: This is one of my favorite Hazelnut cream. I use it all the time at 7-Eleven. But I would rate it more but need to let everyone know that the picture listed of the "Nice Product Display Dispense Box" is NOT what you will get, instead you will get a regular BROWN shipping box with a bunch of loose Hazelnut creamers in there then packed in an Amazon box. I rated it at 3 stars due to what you see pictured is not what you will get, plus the packing was just poor and cause more than 1/2 of all of the cups to leak.

review/text: Making coffee is such a ritual and having these handy creamers in the pantry makes for a very nice treat when it's time for a hot cup of coffee. They are also kept in the breakroom and since they do not have to be refrigerated they make for a very nice option for our clients. Great value too since we can purchase such a large number of cups at one time. Very handy on the road too. Toss a few in a briefcase or in the car and have them if you are on the road and want to flavor your coffee when on the road.

review/summary: A Different Brand of Butterfinger
review/text: This candybar is basically just a different brand of Butterfinger.  The taste, though not as good as many other types of candybars I've tried, is good and peanuty.  Like the Butterfingers do, Clark bars stick to your teeth.  But the Clark bars seem to be a little bit lighter and flakier then Butterfingers, so they're easier to get off of your teeth.  At least that's what I think.  Overall, if you like chocolate with a crunchy peanut center, I say Clarks are decent.  But my personal favorites are Kit Kats, 3 Musketeers, Milky Ways, and Reeses.

review/summary: Another great Dorset product, with tons of raisins and a berry twang
review/text: I am on the record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269FEIG">elsewhere</a> saying that Dorset Cereals are the best mueslis in the world, and I'll stand by that. For my personal taste, however, the nuttier mueslis outpace the fruit-packed ones -- such as this one.<br /><br />This muesli has a strong fruit taste, but despite the "berries and cherries" name, the fruits are mainly raisins and related types like sultanas. Berries, blackcurrants and dried cherries provide a distinctive and tangy flavor that outweighs their relatively small volume in the overall product mix. Still, I docked a star from the review because I feel the name is a bit misleading. Berries and cherries actually account only for a very small percentage of the fruit mix.<br /><br />Despite my nitpicking, however, this muesli -- with its walloping 50% ratio of fruits, nuts and seeds -- still stands head and shoulders above most other types, except the nuttier Dorset brands. If you prefer a fruity to a nutty muesli, jump all over this one, it's made for you.

review/summary: Great for kids, too!
review/text: I'm down to one dental cleaning a year (no insurance) as a result - we use this gum.  A TON of this gum!  The gum has a GREAT start flavor - it lasts all of two minutes (that is enough for the xylitol to work, though).  The gum stays soft and chewable - so I keep chewing it for about another hour - it just has no more taste - not that big a deal to me.<br /><br />Now for WHY and HOW I use this gum:<br /><br />All the tiny cavities that I refuse to get filled have stopped hurting.  This is only one step in a process.  Our dental hygiene goes something like this:<br /><br />Morning:<br /><br />Floss daily with one of the GLIDE products<br />Listerine rinse after floss<br />Sonic care with tons of toothpaste<br />Rinse with a flouride rinse and NO drink or food for 1/2 hour<br /><br />Then, during my commute (about 40 minutes) I use two or three pieces of SPRY - it helps alleviate the traffic frustrations, too!  LOL<br /><br />Then at my desk, during the day - three to nine more pieces.<br /><br />Nighttime - usually am so dead, I really make the effort to brush and then fluoride rinse and crash.<br /><br />I haven't had a cavity filled in a few years and I am sure it is in part because of xylitol - and the other part is the fluoride rinses.  Like I said - the little annoying cavities that would zing me once in a while are all gone.  I've heard about re-calcification - and that can only happen if you get rid of the underlying bacteria - which is what the xylitol in the gum helps with.<br /><br />My dentist does give me a lot of crap - how I don't make it every six months and about my refusing x-rays -- he is FOREVER trying to shove extra, really expensive x-rays down my throat - the last time we had a fight about this - so I am looking for a new dentist now - but I think - unless you have dental issues - once a decade or so - is enough for x-rays.  AND they cost $300 a pop, too.  NO THANKS!<br /><br />The kids (ages 4 and 5) also chew this gum sporadically throughout the day.  They have NO cavities.  They love the fruit flavor Spry.

I also love it for spicy dishes, such as Moroccan cuisine, when I don't want a strong green olive taste in the dish. This oil has a medium-light flavor with a very nice mild peppery aftertaste.<br /><br />I use this oil for medium-high temperature saut&eacute; and for all spicy dishes. It's nothing special cold in salad dressings or drizzled over dishes (except for highly spiced ones). For drizzling or when I want a stronger green olive taste, I use the Zoe Arbequina olive oil, which is excellent for these purposes.

review/summary: Disappointing: Good taste, but in a plastic bottle
review/text: The olive oil tastes OK for the price. I gave it two stars because the oil comes in a plastic bottle, which is the type of container in which cheap olive oils come in. Plastic is known to leak chemicals into the product, especially oils. This not only affects the taste but has negative health consequences. Oil should neither be stored in plastic, nor in tin cans (sometimes treated with BpA). Oil should come in glass.

review/text: It is a crime and a cruel twist of fate that the tastiest and best flavored salad dressing is being sold at such an outrageously high price.  25 dollars for TWO bottles?  What kind of nonsense is that?  Even at the grocery store you can buy 4 bottles for 25 bucks and I consider *that* insanely high dollar.  Well, olive oil will forever be my favorite salad dressing flavor (especially with Cardini's croutons, yum yum!) but the truth is, you're expected to spend way more than any reasonable person should have to.

review/summary: Teas are good, Box is Described as Solid Wood But Feels Thin
review/text: Although the box is described as made of solid wood, it felt rather thin and lightweight. The photo makes it look thicker than it is. In opening the package with a scissor, I accidentally scratched the bottom of the box with the blade, which left a deep indent and showed me how thin it was. Decent for the price but don't expect anything more.

review/summary: Plastic Anyone??
review/text: Being someone who's baked a great deal in my life, as well as finding creative ways to making eating healthy delicious, I guess you could say I am a "foody" of sorts, as well as a connoisseur of foods of all types, especially when it comes to flavor. Considering the economy and the fact that it's hit each of us a great deal, I usually do my shopping for spices and extracts at places like Christmas Tree Shops, or Ocean State Job Lot, with the occasional time here on this site when purchasing something else. That said, I did none of those three. Also, I'd like to add, considering the first two options for shopping, I've never ONCE had an issue with flavor, or freshness when it comes to those products. I decided on one recent trip to Walmart, only initially purchasing almond milk, walking towards the register, as I was passing the baker aisle and noticing the Watkins label, to buy a few extracts from this particular brand, as, I figured, it was a decent, reputable brand. How could I go wrong?? And so, ideas of delicious oatmeal recipes and once in a while, adding a flavor that would go well with my chocolate casein, or whey protein, my grubby hands grabbed a few of Watkins flavor, rum being one of them. In fact, rum extract has become somewhat of a staple when I decided to buy it on a whim at Ocean State. I LOVE adding rum flavor to my shakes! This one was such a HUGE disappointment, and not to mention, questioning what is in it, aside from the ingredients listed.<br /><br />Once I got home, I opened each package, and, in doing so, smelled each one, as we all know, every extract from every brand can differ in taste and smell. Once I got to the rum, I cringed a bit. The smell is most familiar. A bit of a plastic-type smell, but oddly, more of a smell of something out of a nail salon or nail tech school. I should know, I used to do  my own nails. The smell was that of acrylic liquid! I gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking, it probably tastes fine ,but it doesn't. Tastes gross. Like a chemical, or plastic, or, who knows, maybe it is acrylic liquid. I know everyone's taste buds are different and if you're willing to give it a go, by all means, go for it, but as for me, I will NOT be purchasing this particular brand of rum extract again! GROSS! If I could give it zero stars, I would. It's that bad to me.

review/summary: Love Watkins
review/text: I have been using Watkins products as long as I can remember.  My grandmother started me off using Watkins Vanilla.  She said she remembers the "Watkins Man" coming to the house making deliveries. My girlfriend was a distributor of Watkins, so I always had what I needed close by or she could order it for me.  Well this year she decided not renew her license, so I was left trying to find my favorite products. So I came to Amazon since they have everything and they had it...YEAH!<br /><br />Joy McNamara Enterprises shipped my products to me really fast it almost seem like I got them overnight.  When I run out of products again I will definitely use Joy Enterprises.<br /><br />Suggestions for someone that don't know too much about the product.  I love all of the extracts, some of my favorites are below:<br />Vanilla<br />Rum<br />Butter<br />Lemon<br />Caramel<br /><br />Menthol Camphor Ointment (this is 100 times better than Vicks)<br />Pedro Salve<br />Menthol Lavender Drops (this has saved me many nights when my daughter woke up coughing uncontrollably, I would take her in the bathroom run the shower for the steam and put some of these drops in the tub and let her inhale the steam and menthol drops).<br /><br />I was not paid to say any of this, I'm a Watkins lover and will always be!

The chocolate is good but it's a moot point if the beans are too hard.  They don't have a good coffee flavor, because you can't chew them up.  And your mouth and teeth are left with little bean shards to finish.

review/summary: Bagged popcorn that actually tastes good
review/text: I originally purchased one bag of this popcorn on a whim at a local Marshalls store.  I loved it and more importantly my extremely picky 2 yr old loved it.  Since neither of us are big popcorn fans, this brand was a surprise.  Most bagged popcorn tastes old or artificial (to me) and the microwave stuff is either filled with so many artificial ingredients that you feel guilty eating it or it tastes like plain, hot, cardboard.  This brand is so delicious that I ordered a whole box full (12 bags) and both my daughter and I snack on it all the time ... and since it's organic and not overly salted, I don't feel guilty eating it or giving it to my child.  Best supermarket, bagged popcorn I've ever tasted.<br /><br />p.s. This brand's avocado potato chips are delicious, too.

The nutrition facts say that there are 3.5 servings per bag and there are 130 calories per serving.  I am confused by the fact that the ingredients list organic safflower, organic sunflower, or organic soybean oil, yet the bag also states, "...we lovingly air-pop all those premium kernels into fluffy white bursts of natural goodness."  I thought air-popped meant no oil, yet the ingredients list oil and the calorie count indicates calories from oil (50 calories from fat).  Wouldn't this be healthier and more nutritious without the oil?  It is nice having a quick, already prepared snack, but I think I will go back to popping my own with my hot air popper when these are gone.

review/summary: Figures Don't Lie, But Liars Figure
review/text: Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.  Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!<br /><br />The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate, but since it's 600x as sweet as sugar, they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar. But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates.<br /><br />This could really screw up somebody on Atkins' Induction phase.  For example, the day before I learned this, I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda.  I didn't know that in 2 quarts I was drinking down 24 carbs!<br /><br />What to do?  Find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose.  They use water as the filler, it's super-concentrated still, and it truly has 0 carbs.  I look forward to the day when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda.  (That's 0.0g, not 0.49g!)

It contains<br />maltodextrin -- as do the packets.....BUT NO DEXTROSE!  Dextrose, and sucralose, (the main ingredient), are both SUGARS...but Sucralose, of course, is sugar with a hydrogen atom changed for a carbon atom, (or some such thing)....and so a new, safer "sugar" results!  No "cloying" taste, when used to excess, as "real" sugar has.  So, sucraLOSE, though a sugar, is a sugar of "a different sort"...a safer sort, for diabetics and pre-diabetics.  Granular Splenda has ONLY Sucralose and Maltodextrin...whilst the PACKET variety ADDS the Dextrose....Another form of sugar which is NOT as safe, (for diabetics and pre-diabetics), as sucralose is!  (If you don't believe me that a different formula is in each variety, read the labels, as I did!)<br /><br />This said, I have heard my sister say that there is research that sucralose COULD lead to a shortening of "t" cells in the body...the cells that grow shorter, anyway, as we age.  So, imbibing sucralose -- in any form -- could shorten life...according to what my sister has heard and said, anyway.  How much it shortens life -- if at all -- is something I don't know.  What I DO know is that diabetes -- in any form -- can definitely shorten life, if not treated properly!  I'm a pre-diabetic -- who actually got Type II -- then lost it, (because I lost 30 pounds!)  This may not work for everyone...but it did work for me, so I pass the info on.  A quite thin friend of mine has Type II.  She also has a very negative attitude towards life.  Losing weight obviously will not help her.  Having a more optimistic, (yet still realistic) attitude will.  But it's hard to convince nt negatively-minded friend of this.  Hopefully, this advice of trying to be more positive -- and also losing weight, if possible -- can help others.  Nope -- life isn't perfect for anyone.  But if you sit down, and list the 10 best things in your life in one column, and the 10 worst things in another, you'll see how things balance out, and hopefully, get a more realistically-positive view on life!  Hopefully, too, this realistically-positive attitude -- combined with excercise and diet -- can help regulate...or, perhaps, eventually eliminate, any person's case of diabetes.  Certainly, excercise, good thoughts, losing weight, and correct diets, can't hurt.  Even using Splenda Granulated can't hurt -- too much -- if one cuts down, just a bit.<br /><br />All in all, Splenda Granuated is a great product, and I'm SO glad to see it is now in the "super-economy" size.  When I looked at the "5-pound equivalent bag", I noticed Amazon isn't sellong that any more.  But a notice that the larger-size bag IS being sold on Amazon, should be mentioned there!  Splenda Granulated, even if does break down T-cells (quickly or slowly...I don't know), is still a great product!  Use in moderation -- or as moderately as you can -- though!

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: Didn't make sense to keep buying this in the stores. Cost twice as much, and I had to buy it one box at a time. Saved money, shipped for free, bought a bundle of 4 on Amazon Subscribe. I'm officially ready for winter!<br /><br />Although my wife prefers some other brands, I always liked Lipton because the teas tend to be strong. The trick is to not let the tea-bag sit too long in the cup. No more than 1 minute or the tea gets too strong and the naturally decaffinated label gets traded in for a mind-swimming caffine rush. I have the process perfected.

review/summary: Start here to switch your kids away from colas
review/text: This is a genuinely delicious tea at a great price for the quality you get.  It sounds from the name that it must be cloying, but it definitely isn't.<br /><br />If you have kids you are trying to wean away from colas or other over-sweetened drinks, this is THE tea to do it with.<br /><br />I always serve this tea (sweetened) when my friends come over with their kids and invariably the children go gaga over it.<br /><br />If you have kids hooked on sweet drinks, I recommend starting with this tea first, since everyone seems to love this one.  Also try Celestial Seasonings' Black Cherry Berry and Tangerine Orange Zinger.  Add sugar or Stevia as you first make the switch and then slowly reduce the sugar content.<br /><br />I myself drink this unsweetened and steep it using cold water instead of boiling water and the flavor comes through beautifully.<br /><br />About the brand, Dilmah's lower-end teas are absolutely delicious.  You can't go wrong with any of them.  You'll never go back to the bigger brands once you try Dilmah.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of the "pack of 6" aspect.  This tea is perfect as a stocking stuffer/gift for the kids' teacher/etc., since it is an unusual flavor and very hard to find in stores.  But most likely you'll want to keep all 6 boxes for yourself.

review/text: These are so good! Got them at a sale in the store. Wasn't sure if I'd like them since they are somewhat different from regular ramen noodles which I love. Turns out I love them! They are so much better than the normal ramen & they are still easy to boot. The noodle does have a little different texture to it, but I find I like this.better to. The broth that comes with it isn't to overpowering. I do add a little soy sauce when I want a little zing to them. But most of the time I have them with just the enclosed flavor packet. You have got to get these. Highly recommend.

review/text: Fair Trade, yes. My daughter says they should call it "Fair Trick". I love some of the other Wholesome Sweetener products, particularly the dark brown sugar, but this one is lumpy, tasteless, and grey! Looks and tastes like spackle. Have to sift to remove the mothball-like clumps. I get fooled by this stuff about once a year around the holidays when I'm feeling all joy to the world and making baked goods with organic ingredients I can afford about once a year. And then I remember: organic powdered sugar is kind of like organic Cheeteos. If you're going to do it, might as well go with the real thing. You'll be twice s happy and spend about half as much.

I used it to sprinkle sugar on top of cookies and I had to sift it first, but there was still some clumps in the sifter.<br /> I also used it to make icing and that came out without clumps.  So, the sugars ok, but it's got to be sifted if you don't plan on mixing it with any liquids.

review/summary: Great gum, terrible price!
review/text: I have consumed no fewer than 30 or 40 packs of this gum over the past year or two, mostly because it consistently outlasts other gum (both in flavor and texture--it doesn't become very tough, even after hours of chewing). I'm not a fan of all of the plastic each one comes wrapped in, as that contributes yet another large supply to our landfills, so I knocked off a star for product packaging.<br /><br />That being said, this Amazon price is absurd. The only place you'll see a buck seventy per pack is at a convenience store--grocery stores are 40-50 cents less, and the 3-pack at a grocery store comes out to about a dollar a pack. The TEN pack should be cheaper, because you're buying more! Costco and Sam's both sell these bulk packages for less than a dollar per pack of gum...

It is 90 calories with 18g sugars, with 20% RDA of vitamin A and 40% of Vitamin C. For comparsion Sweet Potato Mango is 80 calories, 6 grams sugar, 380% Vitamin A and 25% Vitamin C. It is not so much the vitamins but there is A LOT of sugars in this vis a vis their other antioxidant blends. I would go with a different choice.
