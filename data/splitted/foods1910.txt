review/summary: Nice product, smaller than expected
review/text: I purchased these for my daughter's birthday party, intending to incorporate them into a centerpiece. The description says that the sucker is 6". I thought that would be for the candy part, but apparantly that includes the stick as well. I really wanted the larger version, so I was a bit disappointed. I will still be able to use them, just not as originally intended.

review/summary: Not so fresh....
review/text: I have been using this product religiously for about a month now and cannot see/"smell" that it has done anything to help with the bad breath issue that my cat has.  I measure the amounts exactly so there is no issue there.  Maybe it will work all of a sudden right when I need to  buy a new bottle of it?! I would have to say avoid this product at this point and try something else.

I've found it very hard to find a granola bar of sorts that doesn't have processed sugars, gluten (wheat, flour etc)  is quick to eat and tastes good! Thank you so much! :)  The brownie granola bar is just so flippin good! I'm glad it was recommended to me and I will continue to get them. I can't wait to taste the other flavors!

review/summary: Healthy snack/ energy bars!
review/text: I just love all the granola bars from Granola Gourmet.  I met the founders of the company at our local Farmer's Market and have really enjoyed talking to them about how the company started, etc.  Any of the flavors they offer are really wonderful, each with their own unique and satisfying flavor.<br /><br />I like to use these healthy bars for my mid-morning snack or when I go for an extended walk on the weekends.  I try to be careful to eat healthy foods, and do not like the usual "energy bars" that are glorified candy bars and not as tasty or healthy for you as they would like you to think.  These bars really are healthy, taste great and they provide just the right amount of energy I need, plus they leave me feeling satisfied.<br /><br />I cannot ask for more in a snack bar, and I wish to highly recommend them to anyone looking to find a healthy energy bar to get them through the day or to include with their workout, camping or even backpacking trips.

I eat them at room temperature, I heat them in the microwave for 5-10 seconds- and yummy- melty chocolate brownie and sometimes I freeze them when I feel like having a frozen candy bar.  I keep them in my car and have them on the go.

review/text: Maybe it was just me, but to me, these had the most horrible taste. There was a bitter smell to them also. Needless to say, they only made it to the circular file. There wasn't a thing in them to remind me of brownies. The bars completely crumbled into tiny pieces. The flavor was extremely off putting, there was something in there that just didn't belong. I was very disappointed because I love a good granola bar. I think they should be chewy and flavorful, and these didn't even come close. 'Course this is just my opinion.

review/summary: Collector item price gouging at it's Finest ...and tastiest
review/text: First off, I'll clarify what the product is... a limited-print collector's boxed set containing 1 each of all 16 can designs of "Elixir" beverages released as part of a larger promotional campaign for the Japanese release of Final Fantasy XIII in December, 2009. The release by Suntory was officially licensed by game developer Square-Enix and limited to 30,000 units, with each case having a small numbered plaque and documentation of its number. It has a unique "Tumbler" which is a disguised martini shaker, pouring holes and all in the lid. Mixing recipes neither included nor endorsed in any way, of course!<br /><br />This is 110% for jet-setting fans of the video game series or very niche Japanese rarity collectors, and even then it's a comedic chop to the wallet and not a purchase one should likely brag about much for several years at minimum. I suppose I can't argue that it's likely a good 'value' for persons already paying anywhere from $5 to $10 for single cans of the drink. On the other hand, many persons with collecting in mind won't want to drink the cans or recycle them because of their presentation as digital artwork.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it is a site to behold when opened and propped up for display on its included fold-out stand... in a strange kind of collector's way, as if to say "this looks really cool, but why it is cans of a soda-like beverage?" It's a whole lot larger than it looks and ridiculously heavy, but the case as a whole has a radiant pink hue to it and looks like some kind of alien artifact tomb of knowledge. This hologram-like effect is present on the can labels as well, and are easily the most stunning canned drink I've ever seen and probably every will. The livery for the game is obvious, but tasteful, and with it placed on the box cover like a book title it adds to the hypnotic and inexplicable appeal.<br /><br />If you're coughing up this much to buy and almost double again the price because of shipping, just drink the things since you'd never forgive yourself if you didn't. It's actually pretty tasty; lightly carbonated with a light citrus tingle and lingering fruity scent. I can't think of any "normal" beverage to compare it with, unfortunately, but it's distinct in a good way. Given you'll be consuming something worth its water weight in gold, I'm really sorry if it doesn't suit you. The "gimmick" of the drink is that it has a light sampling of the more gentle ingredients in a standard energy drink, but at this point that's not going to matter to you.<br /><br />My given overall 4-stars as a "toy" is for the collectability and absurd nature that draws in anyone who would ever set eyes upon it, and the design and quality of the package as a whole being very impressive considering that it's literally a case for some cans of soda in an evening gown. Sounds ridiculous, is ridiculous, yet the classification as a collector's set and limited printing is warranted. You won't know whether to be excited or ashamed when it comes to your door, and this might result in disappointment for the aforementioned lack of mixer recipes.

review/summary: Yes, really! The sensory experience of sugar cookies. :-)
review/text: A slightly vegetable-tasting herbal tea, the main ingredients of milk thistle and roasted barley recreate the smell and flavor of cookie dough, bringing to mind the scent of plain white flour. With the addition of orange peel and vanilla, the flour-like scent of the milk thistle and barley becomes a touch sweeter, and like magic you have the sensory impression of warm sugar cookies. The scent is much more convincing than the flavor, which is not going to confuse anyone: it's herbal tea and tastes like herbal tea and not at all like cookies. But the magic is still there. I'm sure children will be amazed to experience water and a tea bag painting such fun sensory pictures. Ordinarily I would never add cream and sugar to herbal tea, but the cookieness (is that a word? cookieosity?) of the tea tempted me to do it, and the result was actually quite pleasant. This is not a tea I would drink outside of the season, but it's a warm and whimsical tea to share with children and friends.

review/summary: A mixture of stale and not so stale items
review/text: I sent this basket as a gift, the person who received it was appreciative of the gesture and so did not inform me of the quality of items until a much later date, almost six months after I had sent it. Her main complaint was that when she opened the packets of Godiva biscuits the chocolate coatings separated themselves from the actual biscuit and the biscuits crumbled in her hand. Since the Godiva Chocolate Brand has been one of favorites, she was completely turned off with the rest of the basket and basically dumped it in the garbage. I guess that these baskets are not in any great demand which would explain the fact that they had been packed sometime in the past and left to go stale in some corner, and then sold to some unsuspecting customer.

review/summary: Much better than the photo shows - huge amount of food in giant basket
review/text: I was going to list every item they sent but Vine Voice Reviewer "Mrs. R. Henderson" has kindly done that.  The only difference I think is that I seemed to get a few more small items tucked in here and there - just extra single cello-wrapped chocolate dipped Oreos and pretzels.  Everything else was virtually the same.  The Godiva Box of chocolates was one that if you bought in the store, you'd pay at least $25 to $30 for depending upon the type of box you chose.  Mine came in a HUGE and sturdy olive colored wood and Raffia woven basket that in and of itself was a gift.  The basket had wooden handles that were cut  to a pattern and the raffia was woven through the wooden frame.  This was all topped off with an elaboprate burgundy ribbon that again would be suitable for re-use on a Sunday hat or another gift.<br /><br />I wanted to upload some photos of the items all dissassembled and show as they are but the moment I ordered it, the item became unavailable and I am guessing this is due to the hot weather.  When the item becomes available again, I will include my photos so you can see that Wine Gift Baskets has been paying close attention to the complaints about the quality and number of items in their baskets by increasing both to created added value.  I feel this was an appropriately priced gift that anyone would be glad to receive provided they don't live in a hot temperature climate that would melt the choclates, candy and cheese.<br /><br />I will update this review when the item becomes available once more.

review/summary: Nice Blend Of Sweet And Savory: This Pricey Basket Makes An Impressive Upscale Presentation
review/text: I tend to be fairly pragmatic when it comes to gourmet gift baskets. They always seem like a great idea, but oftentimes fail to live up to the price valuation placed on them. As someone who frequently purchases gift baskets (I average four to six a year and at one time procured hundreds as corporate gifts), I was actually pleasantly surprised by this offering from Wine.com. While I did receive this product free of charge, my evaluation is based on the same criteria I would use had I purchased this as a premium gift. Last year, I received a complimentary basket from Back Mountain Baskets (represented through the igourmet label) that I awarded the lowest possible rating due to amateurish packaging and a lack of luxury products. So again, I'd like to commend Wine.com for the appearance of the California Bounty Basket. When you purchase a gift basket, two things are relatively certain: 1) you're going to overpay for what's actually included, and (2) at least you're going to get something presentable and of gift quality. And this, at least, looks expensive and will represent the giver in a positive light!<br /><br />Basket:  I did not receive the exact basket pictured in the sample photograph (this is oftentimes not the case, and doesn't matter to me as long as the substituted one is presentable).  In this instance, I'd say the replacement was a major upgrade!  I got a very handsome wicker basket with sturdy wooden handles, almost like a shallow serving tray.  It's lovely and the user will surely be able to repurpose it!<br /><br />Wrap/Packaging: The basket was carefully packed in one large box, and then that was placed in a larger shipping container to avoid potential damage.  The basket was wrapped in tightly fitting cellophane (no tears or unsightly pockets) with a big professional looking burgundy bow. Very elegant. Furthermore, the assortment inside were placed perfectly and secured (in some instances) with tape to insure that everything looked just right when the gift is opened. It simply looked expensive.<br /><br />Contents: I was pleased with the contents. I might not have selected everything included individually and didn't love everything, but that's part of the gift basket experience--to sample brands/items you would not ordinarily.  I'm not sure I got the California influence (as the title of the basket would indicate), but that wasn't a big problem for me.  Although there is some variation (I suspect), my basket included 18 items including Parmesan Peppercorn Cheese, Pistachios, Almond Roca, Honey, Spicy Mustard, Godiva Chocolates, Olives, Butter Toffee Pretzels, Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies, Three Pepper Water Crackers, Smoked Almonds, Cashew Roca, Godiva Biscuits, Butter Cookies, Wafer Rolls, Breadsticks, Mocha Almonds and Tavolare Savory Snack.  Nice blend of sweet and savory, not recommended for those with nut allergies!<br /><br />Value: As I mentioned, the cost of any gift basket surely exceeds its content value. You are paying for the experience as much as anything. With its luxurious presentation, this is upscale gift quality. Whether the price is right for you is a matter of personal decision, but this made an extremely impressive visual gift whose contents were just interesting enough to make it seem fairly exotic as well. KGHarris, 5/12.

review/text: My gift basket arrived in a huge box..actually it was in a box inside an even bigger box with plenty of paper packing and a clear plastic wrap seal so the basket and all the goodies arrived in perfect condition. I really liked that almost all of the sweets, snacks, nuts and treats are from local California companies. Everything was fresh and delicious. The Butter Cookies were amazing! Same with the Wildflower Honey and nuts. I can't choose one favorite. I think anyone would enjoy this basket for the interesting (and tasty) assortment of treats.<br /><br />Basket includes: Tavolare Savory Snack Mix, Artisan Break 3 Pepper Water Crackers, Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies, Holly's Bakery Traditional Recipe Butter Cookies, Napa Mustard Co.

review/summary: Good basket - and huge.
review/text: This isn't one of those rinky dink baskets with a bunch of products that have HUGE boxes and like 3 crackers in each. I've gotten those before, and they suck. It's so misleading, and so frustrating as a gift recipient to prepare to dig into something great only to find the box is all empty air with a small cellophane package inside!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Proper sizes of actual foods<br />- Almost everything was actually pretty tasty<br />- The basket itself is huge. Seriously, this thing could send a full grown adult down the river. Made it actually useful for other purposes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The cookies were melty, and had to be tossed. Summer in St. Louis.<br />- Some of the items were just eh. Not great, but not terrible.

review/summary: Impressive looking, good tasting and good packaging.
review/text: The main problem with sending gift baskets is wondering how fresh each item is and if it arrived in good shape and was well-received by the recipient.<br /><br />This basket fulfilled and exceeded expectations in that:<br />1) All items were well within expiry date. No stale items.<br />2) All items were in good shape, no broken, melted, crumbled items, or dented boxes<br />3) Each item was secured in its place by a combination of paper padding and the entire basket was shrink-wrapped in plastic. There were no bits of tape and glue sticking items together as is common among other gift baskets. Removal of each item from the basket was frustration-free<br />4) The gift basket itself was shrink-wrapped in plastic and then wrapped with a large burgundy wired-organza bow that held its shape.<br />5) The basket itself was double boxed for shipment.<br /><br />In addition,<br />6) each item either came from California (the theme of this gift basket) or was from a Californian gourmet company.<br />7) All items were either brand name or boutique brands in CA.<br /><br />While the actual sticker-value of all types of gift baskets doesn't come close to what is actually paid, this one seems a much better value than your typical gift basket in that:<br />8) there are full-sized retail packaged items<br />9) 2 of these full-sized retail packaged items are Godiva brand.<br />10) All items arrived in good shape.<br />11) The basket (oval not rectangular as shown in the product photo) is of a decent quality and can be reused.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for giving to an office or a family as there is enough in both quantity and selection for all to share and to suit different tastes.

review/summary: The first gift basked I've truly LOVED
review/text: I send a lot of gift baskets because I have friends and work colleagues all over, and I tend to receive quite a few as well. My favorite thing to do is empty all the containers at once so I can have a giggle at how little food is actually in the basket. I'm happy to say that the California Bounty Gift Basket lives up to being bountiful (though resonates with California, where I lived for 20 years, only to some extent).<br /><br />As with all gift baskets, almost all of the food is inside a bag that is inside a box. It makes for a handsome presentation, which is part of the wow factor of receiving a basket like this.  Some observations:<br /><br />- Came in a basket that was rounded, sturdy, and big with handles<br />- Delightful assortment of items, a real tasting adventure<br />- Enough for my whole family of 4 to enjoy over two weeks (ok well the toddler didn't have much)<br />- Some really nice 'luxury' items like Godiva chocolates (more than 50% dark chocolate) and Godiva cookies<br /><br />Savory<br />- Snack mix (cracker rounds, pretzels, etc mixed together): tasty and very crunchy<br />- Three pepper water crackers: nice with the cheese<br />- Artisan breadsticks: rather like mild Ritz crackers in long thin crunchy form<br />- Smoked almonds: very salty and smoky well roasted almonds<br />- Parmesan peppercorn cheese: typical non-refrigerated soft cheese spread<br />- Pistachios<br />- Olives: fancy and tasty small green olives<br /><br />Sweet<br />- Toffee pretzels: a combo of sweet and savory, very interesting<br />- Jar of Wildflower honey: this is a pretty big jar<br />- Butter cookies: not like other butter cookies I've had, these were more like molasses cookies but still good (and crunchy)<br />- Chocolate chip cookies: the chocolate was mild in these, they were a little more like shortbread cookies<br />- Godiva cookies (biscuits): some had the chocolate separated from the cookie, but were still delish!<br />- Godiva box of chocolates: boxes this size are very pricey, so I was happy it was full sized for sharing<br />- Almond Roca (2 pieces): love, just wish there were more pieces!<br />- Cashew Roca (3 pieces): still like the almond better!<br />- Wafer rolls: a nice light treat<br /><br />This is a basket that not only looks impressive but also has a delightful array of goodies in good portions to enjoy.

review/summary: Smucker's Orchard's Finest Coastal Valley Peach Apricot Preserves
review/text: I love a good preserve and this version of Peach Apricot is a great tasting one.  I buy all kinds of preserves.  I've tried national brands, store brands, foreign brands, specialty brands that I pick up while on vacation, and homemade.  As far as the Smucker's Orchard's Finest, I have tried the Strawberry, Tart Cherry, Blueberry, and Triple Berry, and the Peach Apricot.  I find that the Peach Apricot is my favorite.  I have compared it with a number of other Peach or Peach Apricot jams and preserves and can't find one other that is as good.  My wife loves it also and we go through a least a jar a week.  In fact the only thing wrong with it is that the jar is too small.  I wish they made this in an extra large version.  We spread this on whole wheat bread and the flavor is strong enough to hold up to the whole wheat bread taste.  I like to go picking fresh tree ripe peaches when in season and enjoy the super sweet taste of a fully ripened peach.  This preserve has the right sweetness and flavor that brings that sweet taste to mind.

review/summary: Great authentic Upstate NY Spiedie Taste
review/text: I'm a New York transplant in North Carolina, and when I found this marinade in my local supermarket I went nuts.  Not because I had heard of the brand name (I hadn't), but because it brought back memories of years I spent in upstate NY during and immediately following college.<br /><br />Spiedies themselves aren't anything new.  They're just shish-ka-bobs.  Skewer some meat and veggies, throw them on the grill, take them off and slap them on some bread (or maybe serve them over a bowl of rice) and there you go.  Upstate New Yorkers seem to take pride in their spiedies though, and the marinades used are all very similar in style and taste, so the spiedie experience seems to take on a life of its own - and it is something that is uniquely New York.<br /><br />My wife and I purchased a bottle from the store and marinated our chicken for several hours and grilled it up.  Oh man, did this marinade hit the spot!  It tasted like everything I remembered from those years of eating them in college.  After finishing the chicken, we went back out and bought 2 more bottles and marinated our next batch of chicken for a full 24 hours.  Wow is it good!  You really should try this stuff if you are a fan of marinades and grilled meat.  By the way, this would work wonders with lamb as well.<br /><br />Look for it at your local supermarket.  If you can't find it, order it here.  You won't be disappointed, and you'll probably become a fan. Trust me.  ;-)

review/summary: Really good BASE for Amazing Tortilla Soup
review/text: This is impossible to find around here now and paying this price online is way out of our budget.  But when we do come across a package, it's one of the best tortilla soups I've ever made - WITH my creative additions :)  I use this as just a base.  Standing alone, I don't think it's that tasty.<br /><br />Here's what I do:  I mix the soup according to the directions (omit 2 cups of water, you're going to replace it later) on the package and put it in my crockpot on med or high, depending upon how much time you have.  The longer you cook it, the more flavor it gets but if you cook it too long on high, the liquids will evaporate and then it just tastes bad.<br /><br />THEN I add:<br />3-4 large boneless/skinless chicken breasts<br />one can of Ro-Tel<br />one 8oz can of stewed tomatoes (with the juice)<br />one can of chicken broth (this replaces the cups of water you left out originally)<br /><br />Let this cook to on med for about 6 hours, or until the chicken breasts are done.  Remove the chicken and shred it, then drop it back in.  At this point, add in:<br /><br />one 8 oz container of sour cream<br />8 oz bag of shredded fiesta cheese blend, taco cheese blend (or whatever kind of cheese you like that includes cheddar)<br /><br />Stir everything up until you're sure the sour cream and cheese is mixed in.  Put the lid back on, turn the crockpot up to high and let it cook for about another 30-45 minutes, depending on how hot your crockpot gets.  Once the "broth" is a creamy, smooth texture, it's done!<br /><br />Serve in bowls with fresh tortilla chips or strips on top (or on the side to dip as you eat).  This makes a very creamy soup, too soupy for dip, but a nice thick filling soup that is pretty spicy (the Ro-Tel makes all the difference).<br /><br />Tastes GREAT heated the next day, freezes OK, but can tend to get a little watery that way, so I don't really recommend it.

review/text: I try not to change anything the first time I use a recipe, but I added leftover turkey breast to this soup and it was delicious.  You can spice up or add to the soup, but it is fine as is--very hearty with beans and vegetables in it.  Taste is subtle with light flavor of cumin, so you can make it hotter or chunkier or just eat it as is.  This is a great deal and makes 8 servings, so it will really fill you up quickly if you serve guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and/or chips with it.  Great for vegetarians.  Nice quick tasty meal to add a little more variety to eating meals on the run and on a budget.  Eight thumbs up from our house!

review/summary: A great variety of sea salt!
review/text: This was my first sampling of the varieties of sea salt out there.  I didn't really expect there to be much difference between the products (other than the color of  the salts), but I was *so* wrong.  Here's a rundown of each salt's characteristics:<br /><br />New Zealand Salt -- tasted the most like table salt, but it was SO strong!  You definitely won't need as much of this salt as with regular table salt.  Probably less than half as much to give your food the same amount of saltiness that you're used to.<br /><br />Alderwood Smoked Salt -- like regular salt, but with a smoky barbecue-ey flavor.  Even food cooked indoors tastes like you grilled it over an alderwood fire.<br /><br />Alaea Hawaiian Salt -- the most mild of the three, with a slight "ocean-ey" flavor and aroma.  I think this would be the perfect salt for seafood.<br /><br />After trying these three salts, I realize that the different sea salts really do taste different.  I now want to try them all!

Since the floral component of this Multi-Spice is quite small (floral powders easily overwhelming other flavours if overused), I ended up with quite a bit left over for use in my perfume-making hobby or in sachets, etc.<br /><br />I found this to be a high-grade powdered lavender, the floral 'nose' being greater than the (wholly expected and natural) bitterness of it.

review/summary: Great Price on Saffron with Subscribe & Save!
review/text: I just ordered this McCormick saffron and I can't wait to try it.  It's a really good price on saffron.  I like McCormick seasonings so I'm sure it will be good, fresh saffron.  I like that it comes in a glass jar to maintain freshness.  I use a lot of saffron so I need a good price on it.<br /><br />I hope Amazon keeps it at this price.<br /><br />4/29  Update:  Saffron arrived yesterday.  Sturdy glass jar containing saffron inside of a waxed paper packet which was inside of an envelope.  Demonstrates care for delicate, expensive product.  Expiration date on jar is for 2014, so very fresh.  Looks and smells fresh.<br /><br />5/05/2010  Update:  I have been using this saffron every day and I am really happy with it.  It is potent and fresh and gives that beautiful yellow color to my grains.  I use it in all my grains: rice, quinoa, barley, kasha.  I use it in my curried cauliflower and potatoes too.  Great deal on the world's most expensive spice!<br /><br />Subscribe & Save is a fantastic deal on this product.

review/summary: Great Saffron!
review/text: I tried several Saffron from local stores, and they all came disappointment. Either they have a really bad smell or they are not fresh or flavorful. Then I decided to use a more expensive one (or probably the most expensive one on the shelf) and the result turns out great! the product was sealed in the little envelop inside the sealed glass can to preserved the freshness of the saffron. With just a little of saffron in the Paella, it make my Paella very flavorful and coated with beautiful golden yellow color. The taste was superior, I can taste saffron even with very little saffron in it. Combine this spice with other spices I brought from McCormick for paella, and they all are great!

review/summary: Saffron: An Important Spice for Brain Health
review/text: Saffron comes from the flower of the crocus plant (it's actually the plant's dried stigma) has a reddish thread-like appearance, and is a rich source of carotenoid antioxidants.<br /><br />Used since ancient times for a variety of medicinal purposes (saffron is known for its immune-boosting power, among others), in the modern day it is widely used in Persian, European, Indian and Turkish cooking, both for its unique sweet, grassy flavor and its ability to add vibrant yellow-orange color to foods.<br /><br />There are quite a few studies that reveal saffron's beneficial properties, and one of the most recent showed promise for treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. In a 22-week, double-blind study of patients with Alzheimer's, a saffron supplement worked as well as the drug donepezil (brand name Aricept), but with significantly less vomiting experienced among the saffron group.<br /><br />The researchers noted:<br /><br />"This phase II study provides preliminary evidence of a possible therapeutic effect of saffron extract in the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease."<br /><br />It is becoming increasingly clear that supplementing your diet with foods and supplements rich in a variety of compounds, such as vitamin E, folic acid, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), and ALA (alpha-lipoic acid), may help reduce oxidative stress and delay the progression of age-related cognitive decline. And it appears saffron is no exception.<br /><br />Separate research has shown saffron to help prevent and treat dementia, and inhibit platelet aggregation (which can lead to blood clots) and lipid peroxidation (which causes cell damage). It's also known to have chemopreventive properties against cancer, which are also strongly associated with the common saffron alternative turmeric (which is often referred to as Indian saffron). While in China, Marco Polo in 1280 AD recorded information on turmeric in his diary:<br /><br />"There is also a vegetable which has all the properties of true saffron, as well the smell and the color, and yet it is not really saffron."<br /><br />So, turmeric has been used as a substitute for saffron (an old world spice) in Europe for over 700 years, and this spice has been found to have many of the same health advantages, including showing promise for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If you've never tried saffron, the reason may be because it's earned the moniker "most expensive spice in the world." There are only three stigmas in each crocus flower, and it reportedly takes 80,000 flowers (about the number of plants on one acre of land) to produce one pound of saffron. Turmeric is much easier to come by and is also much less expensive, while offering many of the same potential health benefits, as well as the same characteristic yellow color.

review/summary: Convenient, reliable source for an elegant spice!
review/text: Because of its premium price, Spanish saffron is almost impossible to find in the spice section of even the most up-scale supermarkets.  Many stores have resorted to keeping this product in the "customer service" area where you have to wait in line and ask for it (who has time!).<br /><br />I was delighted to find that I could subscribe to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012ORCPY">McCormick Spanish Saffron, 0.06-Ounce Unit</a> delivered to my home on my schedule -- and for a price that is lower than most market prices for the same product.  I enrolled to receive a bottle every six months.  I may have to increase the deliveries.  Having fresh, high-quality saffron on hand has inspired me to use more of it than I did when relying on the cut-rate stuff readily available in middle-eastern or Mediterranean markets.

review/text: Personally, I prefer to make my own cranberry sauce, but my husband insists on the canned version;  and it must be jellied, not whole.  So every time I make turkey for dinner I have to go out and buy a can of sauce.  The last time I did that, I paid $2.49 a can; I was "fit to be tied"!  So, I decided to take a gander at Amazon and there it was, a case of my husband's favorite sauce for a lower price and what's more; an abundant supply.  Yes, I realize it will be cheaper in November and I will stock up then.  For now, I am happy!

review/summary: Best chocolate I've ever tasted.
review/text: When I was a little girl my grandmother would go to visit her mom in Germany. The best thing I can recall about it was when she would come back with these lovely little blue square chocolate bars that I thought were amazing. I still do. Eventually we could buy them at a specialty store here in my hometown, and now I can buy them at Target (thank you, God) when they're in stock (which is hardly ever, for the milk chocolate).<br /><br />To say that this chocolate is the best I've ever tasted is a complete understatement. All those years ago I had no idea, really, because we got them so rarely - plane tickets to Germany not falling of trees, you see. I didn't realize exactly how much of a delicacy it was until I was able to get it regularly and believe you me, there is no comparison. Hershey's? Not anymore. Reese's PB cups? Only if I'm craving. Dove? Oh hell no. Godiva? ...Sometimes, lol.<br /><br />Ritter Sport? There is no comparison. It really is the perfect chocolate. Smooth, creamy, melting just so on the tongue. Not a trace of bitter, not overly sweet, an exquisite balance of flavor no matter what part of the tongue it hits. I would recommend this chocolate to anyone, anywhere. There is none better.

review/summary: Delicious German Chocolate
review/text: Ritter Sport Milk CHocolate bar is a basic milk chocolate candy bar. It comes in a rather thick brick divided into 16 squares. These are large candy bars, the nutrition information says it's about 3 servings, a child or small person would probably be happy with 4 squares (1/4 of the bar). Personally, I eat the whole thing, If I bought these by the dozen, I would not be small.<br /><br />THe chocolate itself is wonderful, smooth and creamy. It has about 30% cocoa content. If you prefer dark chocolate, Ritter Sport's dark chocolate candy is wonderful too.<br /><br />Last week, we ran out of chocolate chips and wanted cookies, so we all coughed up our squirreled away ritter sport bars and broke them into bits. THose cookies were the best we've ever had.

I opened my first can of Diced Chik last month with a little trepidation after buying it at a local Kosher grocery store for a whopping $5.99 a can. I opened the can, turned to the fridge to get some mayo, and turned around to discover my three kids chowiing it down right out of the can! The taste and texture really are so good that you truly can eat it right out of the can, no sauce, no cooking, nothing! There aren't too many meat substitute products out there that can boast that!<br /><br />In the past month I've used Diced Chik in chili, soup, tacos, omlettes, a pot pie...it's great for kids who may not like the flavor of beef substitute products. I have yet to find anything you can't use it in. For my family of five, we definitely need two cans for dinner. Our brownie troop has several vegetarian girls and we are definitely going to be taking Diced Chik camping with us.

review/text: It's great for making a chicken salad sandwich as it is a small dice.  It also works well to make a small dice Waldorf Salad.  Convenient, shelf stable staple to have on hand for homemade fast-food fare.

review/summary: Ever Increasing Price?
review/text: I actually purchased this in April for $33.18 per case and I came back to purchase another case and the price is now over $54 on Subscribe and Save?  I am confused as to why the price would increase so dramatically over the course of 3 months.  I can actually go purchase this cheaper in my local grocery store since this huge price increase, so I cancelled my Subscription here on Amazon.

review/summary: Try it in tortilla soup or over rice.
review/text: My family loves Diced Chik!  And now, thanks to Amazon's Subscribe & Save, we'll always have them in our pantry.<br /><br />One of our favorite uses are with Emeril's tortilla soup recipe that you can find on Foodnetwork's website.  We also like to use it in a sauce over rice.  Saute sliced onions in margarine, add a can of mushroom soup (don't dilute it with milk or water), then when that's all heated up, add about 1/2 cup of peas (more if you'd like) and a can of Diced Chik gravy and all.  Heat that all up and scoop over rice.  Quick, easy, and delicious.

review/summary: Consistency of chicken but not the taste
review/text: TVP has the consistency of meat but has an alien taste.  I knew this before I purchased this item but I bought it anyway because it's high in protien and fat free.  Whoever said the broth tastes good is obviously a vegeterian who has forgotten what real chicken tastes like.<br /><br />I've used this in various soups and in moderation it's tolerable.  I wouldn't serve this to anybody unless I asked them first.  TVP is a highly processed product which is far from natural.  I'm only eating this to loose a few pounds while dieting.  I wouldn't consider making this part of my regular menu.

review/summary: Not my favorite meatless meat...
review/text: Actually, I generally really like meat substitutes, but I found that this particular product fell flat with me. Although the texture was nice and chewy, there was a canned flavor that I just couldn't get past... the smell was akin to lower-quality canned meat (remember Vienna sausages or deviled ham?).  I had to rinse the "chik" off to get rid of the thick-ish brine in which it was packed, which made it marginally better. There are other canned products that I like, such as Cedar Lakes hot dogs and the "tuno" that Worthington used to make, so it's not about being canned.  I do regret buying an entire case.  My suggestion is to buy one can to try it, then go on to buying by the case if it's up your alley.

review/summary: Mild, Good for morning
review/text: When I first got my Keurig this was on of my go-to flavors.  I'm not really a huge coffee drinker.  I like this because it's mild and I don't like really strong coffee in the morning.  I've had my Keurig for about two years and since have expanded on some flavors a bit and while I still like this one, I do like some that are not as "thin" as I think this one is.  However, the Green Mountain is still a pretty good brand compared to many out there - I tend to lean toward the Caribou Coffee when I purchase now.

I like it for the price but tend to like the hometown favorites vendor a little better as far as responsiveness, packaging and amount of candy received.

review/summary: great treats!
review/text: My dog loves these treats!  I put them inside the Everlasting Treat Ball and he loves getting through the first cookie to get to the treats inside.  The flavors are varied and he doesn't get tired or bored with the tastes.  You can also divide the treats in half to make them smaller and I use them that way both inside the treat ball and as training treats.  This is a great product which comes packaged in a zip-lock foil bag so the treats stay fresh for a long period of time...if you can keep them away from your dog long enough!  I will buy this again because my dog likes them and because I like to vary his treats.

review/summary: Expensive, Unintersting
review/text: StarMark Every Flavor Treats / B0009YF43U<br /><br />My puppy is in treat training, so we have plenty of different treats on hand. I slice them thinly for training, so that he doesn't get too satiated in training and so that his weight won't become unhealthy. I really didn't need any new treats for training, and certainly not these treats that work out to almost a dollar an ounce! But we recently bought the Everlasting Fun Treat Ball and found out, after it arrived, that our regular treats would not fit in the new ball. These treats were recommended for filling the ball. I hate to throw good money after bad, but I thought maybe these would be a fun enough diversion that it would be a worthwhile treat for the puppy, so I went ahead and bought some.<br /><br />The good news is that these treats do fit in the Everlasting Fun ball - almost as if the ball were made with these treats in mind! The treats slide in between the "teeth" of the ball opening easily, and the teeth don't catch at the treat (and my fingers) as they had in previous attempts to fill the ball. The treats are also very pretty, the different colors and flavors are neat for us humans to look at. The bad news is that the colors and flavors seem lost on my puppy, who much prefers his Omega ball, with its puppy kibble and occasional freeze-dried liver piece. He'll play with the Everlasting Fun treat ball and these treats if I give it directly to him, but when left to his own devices, he'll go back to his liver-laced kibble. I was expecting these treats to be exciting enough to hold his interest, but he seems kind of bored with them, and he seems to eat the treats more because they are there and less because they entice him - definitely not like the four or five other types of treats we use.<br /><br />This 5 oz. bag will fill our Everlasting Fun ball at least twice and maybe three times, but the ball is small enough that this isn't terribly impressive. Since he doesn't seem terribly interested in the treats, I'm thinking about slicing them up and adding them to his food, just to keep them from going to waste.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Effective and cost effective
review/text: My GoldenDoodle likes this treat for training and also for use with the everlasting treat ball. To make these cost effective I split them in two and also mix them with his regular kibble (only 1/5 treats) when stuffing them in the treat ball. I bought these for treat variety, to save money on the refill disks, which my dog loves but are expensive, and also to save time cutting up the Van Patten [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633V3O">Natural Balance Beef Formula Dog Food Roll, 4-Pound</a>food rolls. I am buying my second bag today.

review/summary: Part of my training pack
review/text: I buy different types of treats for my dogs and keep them all in a large Rubbermaid container on top of the fridge.  The dogs go nuts every time I reach for that box.  I think they enjoy the variety because after I give them their treat they still look at me like "what else is she gonna give us" and sometimes I swear it's more like "but mom, I don't like that kind, I want the other one".<br /><br />I mix all kinds of mainly dental treats together in the box.  Rawhide sticks (all colors and flavors, not just green ones), Greenies, Dingos, CET and also use some rawhide bones.  These treats help scrape plaque from their teeth while chewing before tarter can form if given after meals or once a day.  My dogs do not get soft food or treats unless we are training.  Saving soft treats for training makes them want it all the more and the hard food is better for their teeth and digestion.<br /><br />I have a Miniature Pinscher and 2 Pomeranians that are prone to tooth loss so taking care of their teeth is very important to me.  My oldest Pomeranian is 6 years old and just had his first professional cleaning and that was mainly because it is hard for me to get his back teeth because his mouth is so tiny.<br /><br />They love when they see the bag of treats come out of the cupboard because they now it's the soft stuff or the small one bite treats and they are more receptive to training and their sessions go much faster.<br /><br />I would recommend these treats as part of a variety.  Mix it up so your dog doesn't get bored and use different shapes to get different angles on their teeth.<br /><br />[...] Thanks!

review/text: I wish they came in a larger bag, we go through so many of them. My 11 pound mixed breed will just gobble them up if I let her. They fit perfectly into the Starmark Bento Ball or to just give as a training treat (we have her in classes). But every time I get the treats out, all the cats want them, too. They are soft and segmented so they can be broken in half and last a little longer. Please make a larger and more economical bag for families with lots of pets!

review/text: I bought these for the everlasting treat toys that I bought my dogs.  They were cheaper than the only pet store that carries them around here.  However, the dogs seem more attracted to the larger treat on the other side of the toy and these sometimes just sit in the toy until I remove them.  I am trying other small treats to see if they work a little better in attracting their attention.

review/summary: Great Treats for Clicker Training
review/text: I tried these treats after the success I had with the Everlasting Treat Ball (made by the same company).  My dog goes crazy for them is the only reason that I didn't give them a Five Star Review.  The treats are so attractive that the dog has trouble concentrating.  They are a great size for Clicker Training and apparently pack a lot of "high value" punch in a small treat.  Try and put these in a treat pouch or zip lock bag to contain the aroma so you can get some training in along with the treating.<br /><br />I also thought they were a little expensive for the amount you get, but it is very good for motivating a dog.

review/summary: Great treats, but smell awful!
review/text: My dog Nova loves these treats, they are great for training. However, these and all the other "everlasting" products give me a very bad headache. They smell VERY strongly and I cannot get around it any way, even if we give them to her outside, she smells like if for hours. Perhaps it is just me, but if you are at all sensitive to smells, you might want to pass on these particular treats. I would reccomend "Wellness" treats, my dog loves them and they don't have that horrid smell, and are also better for your dog, ingredient wise.
