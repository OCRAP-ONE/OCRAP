review/summary: Great with Salmon
review/text: I found a recipe for Broiled Sweet and Spicy Salmoon with Spinach rice that called for red pepper jelly. I searched for this jelly in several stores and only found one brand available and unfortunately it wasn't kosher. I ended up ordering this one, which is Kosher and it's yummy with the salmon. If you want to make this dish, check out my post on my web site KosherTreifCooking for the details. I can't wait to try the red pepper jelly with other recipes as well.

review/summary: Next Best Thing to "From Scratch"
review/text: I usually make my own chicken stock from scratch, but sometimes what I've got on hand isn't enough to fill the pot. When that happens, this is my go-to bouillon. It's also great for when you get to the bottom of a big pot of soup, and it's super thick. Adding a little of this vegetable stock can stretch out that last bit without sacrificing flavor. I've tried a lot of different chicken bouillons, but none of them have the wonderful flavor this vegetable one does. This is also the only bouillon I will drink straight, when I'm feeling sick. It's delicious!<br /><br />The sodium in this is comparable to other bouillons, and MSG (in some form, frequently listed as "autolyzed yeast extract") is in pretty much every canned soup and stock out there. Very few people are actually sensitive to it, or they would have gotten sick every time they ate Campbell's soup as a kid. But they see the scary letters and get alarmed. It's just silly.<br /><br />While I do think you should try to keep processing foods like this to a minimum because of the high sodium levels, a little bit here and there won't hurt you. Fast food and processed meals like TV dinners and Top Ramen are far worse. Practice moderation in all things and you will be fine.  :-)

WHAT are they thinking when they pump this garbage out and box it up?  Hey Knorr - if we all end up too sick to work from eating this kind of so-called food,  we won't have any money to give you.  If your conscience won't cause you to use wholesome ingredients maybe the thought of losing out on sales will.

review/summary: Pork Rind Critique
review/text: Price and shipping was acceptable but I have sone comments on the pork cracklings:<br /><br />1: They were sort of bland. No seasoning was added.<br />  I had to add some salt and BBQ spice to them.<br /><br />2. Some pieces, (4) in 9 bags, still hair hog bristles on them.<br /><br />3. The pieces were a proper size. Once in a while a huge chunk would be in the bag.<br /><br />4. The texture was very good. Crunchy and chewy.<br /><br />In Comparison with cracklings imported from England, I found yours to be not as rasty.<br />Your price and prompt shipping somewhat offset this. More seasoning is needed in your crackligs.

review/text: There is no caramel flavor here to be found, unless you add your own. The coffee itself is good but it is very disappointing if you are expecting it to taste like caramel. For people who dislike flavored coffee this might be a good choice (though why would those people be looking at this product I'm not sure...) The description has one thing right - "hint of caramel". With this subtle a hint, I don't think anyone would guess it was caramel flavored coffee without reading the label.

review/summary: Caramel Flavor So Mild, It Barely Exists...
review/text: I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee.  When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it.  Caramel-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial, e.g. Ghirardelli Chocolate Caramel flavored coffee.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark.  The Caramel Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no caramel odor and has even less caramel taste.  Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging.  In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup.  This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor.  Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew.  If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's and put the word "fusions" in the search box.  You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.

review/summary: Strange Color, Smells Weird, Bad Aftertaste
review/text: To give a bit of credit the side of the bag explains that the coffee is a dark roast flavored with burnt sugar, licorice root, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg - not quite the delicious buttery caramel that they picture on the front. I feel it's deceiving though - the coffee looks unusually dark, has a strange chemical smell [perhaps from the licorice, but I love licorice and this smells like a solvent] and a noticeably bad aftertaste. Even with extra cream. For the eight bucks I paid in-store I'd rather have bought some Folgers and a bag of Werthers caramels to mix in - would have been a better value.

I was so excited to set up my coffee maker so that all I had to do was hit the switch in the morning! There is nothing I love more than the smell of fresh coffee when a new package is opened but when I opened up this coffee I almost gagged. The smell was overwhelming, sort of like burnt dirt. It was extremely dark in color too, almost like soil. I still have yet to hit the brew button on the coffee maker tomorrow morn, but I figure I would give it a fair shot. After reading some of the reviews here tonight, I am already expecting to be tossing it down the drain.

I'm not a hardcore Starbucks fan, but I saw this on the shelf and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I'm actually typing this immediately after having taken one sip of the coffee this morning. I was skeptical the second I opened the bag; the aroma was just...weird. It didn't really smell like coffee; it certainly didn't smell like caramel. But I made a pot and took that first sip. And then I googled to see if I had missed the news about a poisoning scare with this coffee because it was just AWFUL. It has an unnatural burnt/chemically taste to it. I've choked down some bad cups of coffee in a fix, but I'm not going to do it from my own sofa. This pot of coffee is going down the drain and the remainder of the bag is going in the trash.<br /><br />I'll take a second sip, just to be sure.<br /><br />Nope. Still completely undrinkable.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Since I spotted this coffee on the shelf, it has been love at first sip.  It is a smooth, full-bodied, bold cup of coffee with just the right amount of caramel overtones...not sicky-sweet caramel, but just a delightful cup of coffee with a wonderful aroma and just the right touch of caramel for the mature coffee drinker.  I prefer it black, but for a wonderful relaxing drink for dessert, I sometimes add a bit of sweetener and half and half....HEAVEN!  I have also tried the cinnamon and vanilla, but the caramel is my favorite.

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: Good coffee. little caramel flavor. I feel that I can never go wrong with Starbuck's coffee. The taste is bold and smooth and comfortable. I also love caramel. I have had other caramel coffees and loved them. This was not one of them. The coffee itself does not disappoint, but I think they had a factory worker wave a caramel over the top and that was all. Not much of a caramel flavor.

review/summary: Perfectly balanced flavored coffee that is all NATURAL
review/text: I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees because 99% of them use natural and ARTIFICIAL flavorings thus they are strong, smelly, and have a bad aftertaste.  This coffee enticed me as it is all natural and the caramel flavoring comes from caramelizing sugar which is subtle yet smoothly delicious as it adds a rich buttery flavor that comes through cup after cup.<br />My mom does not drink anything but Folgers but when she came by for lunch she asked for coffee and I handed her a cup of this blend since I had brewed it for me and she loved it.<br />She even took the remainder of the bag home to enjoy.  That alone impressed me!  I have tried the cinnamon & the vanilla natural fusions and did not like them as much as this one. This is the only one I will buy again to enjoy on chilly fall evenings.

review/summary: Unpleasant flavor
review/text: I have been using Starbucks coffee for quite awhile and I do like it. When I saw the $1.50 coupon for their fusion flavored coffee I thought I'd give it a try and purchased the caramel flavored. The first pot I brewed full strength. It did not have a caramel flavor nor did it smell of caramel, it had a phony chemically taste. I first tried to drink it black and since that did not taste good I added half/half and sugar, it still had a unpleasant flavor. I tried diluting it with regular coffee (1 TBS caramel fusion and 4 TBS regular coffee) and it still had an unpleasant aroma and flavor.

review/summary: I am not a coffee drinker, but I love this coffee
review/text: I normally do not drink regular coffee. I will enjoy a Cafe Mocha or a drink made with expresso and heavy cream...so it basically doesn't taste like coffee. I bought this because I love caramel flavored drinks. I will agree that the caramel flavor is not as strong as one would think, but if you add a flavored creamer, it tastes wonderful. I used a caramel macchiacto creamer and it was delish. I can't wait to try this with a mocha flavor and maybe some Cinnamon and sugar.<br /><br />I never encountered the "chemical" taste mentioned above.

review/summary: Coffee Lover finds absolute Favorite!!
review/text: I love coffee. I hated it as a child only because mom did and i expect the stuff dad drank was crap.. i do remember him buying folgers instant when it first came out and saying it was one of the best..<br /><br />First time was the very early ice coffees at Duncan. From there any new brand and style. Gloria Jeans was favorite for years. Starbucks makes a great, well anything. i am not big into buying all there flavor enhancers. There standard expressos and capuchinos work best for me. Green Mountain has (before tasting this) the best IMO for the flavors. there are a few other brands that make good flavors but too many taste manufactured and candy like. i have a very enhanced sense of smell and taste. it is great for when i need to pick out fresh and quality but terrible when i smell bad odors.. so when i taste and smell things that are very strong to me , others don't notice or it seems very slight. With it so enhanced at times i get over load and have a hard time breaking it down. just some background so you understand that this really is a above and beyond flavor, for the ones that want it at times. don't get me wrong, i love just plain good coffee, but now it is nice to know i can get the best of flavors and coffee in one cup. i haven't had that option before.<br /><br />Hubby just bought me a bag of the flavor fusions carmel. first time ever. i usually go through a pound of beans in a month. Not sure if this comes in bean from but that is ok if i have them pre ground. i just like the flavor better of freshly ground but this coffee is the most smooth, the flavor is blended so well. Nothing about it tastes manufactured. If you try it with cream and sugar it is kicked up another notch of smooth flavoring.  WOW<br /><br />for now i have my favorite and my once a cup with no company coming over has now changed to 2+ before noon.  The bag he bought this saturday is 1/2 full. That's a record for me and it will make incredible ice coffee, i just know it!<br /><br />Best so far!!

review/summary: Best Sauce in a Jar.  Period.
review/text: The Marinara and Tomato Basil sauces are the closest to real Italian sauce that I have ever tested, probably better, having just returned from 2 weeks in Italy.  And we ate very well there.  I had tried in vain for years to find a good sauce in a jar but had no luck.  Until I tried the Batali sauce.  It's in the weekly rotation now.  Worth every penny.  Better than going out to eat without a doubt.

review/summary: Eat it by the spoonful
review/text: I just finished eating a few spoonfulls of Mario Batali Marinara, directly out of the bottle, as I waited for my pasta to cook. That is how delicious this stuff is -- fresh, garlicky and all-around yummy. It is not tomato-pasty like most other sauces. In addition, it does not contain sugar. I don't care for artificially sweet marinara. I appreciate that this sauce lets the plumb tomatoes pull through and donate their natural sweetness. If you like the same 'ole sauces that your supermarket traditionally stocks, I can see how you might not enjoy this product. This is a culinary treat and a welcome advancement in prepared food -- I for one will never go back! Thanks Mario.

review/summary: Great Marinara
review/text: I can't understand the one-star reviews. "Runny?" That's hyperbole. This is marinara and the consistency is one of this sauce's assets. Ragu it ain't. Speaking of, it's also not cloyingly tomatoey like a lot of bottled pasta sauces. It's not sweet, which is as it should be. I thought it needed a little salt to bring out the flavors more, but that's just my taste and it's easily fixed. It's great right out of the jar, but makes a great base for other sauces, and it's really good to dip fried calamari or cheesy garlic bread in. Great bottled option if you're not into making your own all the time.

review/text: I can't believe that this sauce is not better received in these reviews.  My wife and I love this sauce.  I find it SO much more authentic than Classico, Ragu, or similar generic sauces.  They use San Marzano tomatoes and fresh garlic.  I guess it's what you get used to.  This is not the typical schwag you get out of the bottle, but rather much more like something you would be served in a restaurant.  We buy it at Costco and get two bottles for around $7.  For a sauce of this quality, we find it to be a reasonable price.

I can't believe this great chef put his name on the sauce. It is runny, tastes foul, and has a stale aftertaste. Too bad, I was looking forward to tasting something supposedly made by this chef since I don't live anywhere near one of his restaurants. The only thing that saved dinner was some frozen marinara left from another night.<br /><br />Don't buy this sauce!

review/text: All of my Serenity House Teas arrived today and they couldn't have arrived on a better day:  I had to have a 3 hour MRI and my back was terribly sore, it was miserable outside weather wise, cold, rainy, dark and dreary.  When I opened the box, the very first tea I came upon was the Double Double Chocolate.  I made a pot in my new Breville Automatic Tea Maker which has a automatic infuser basket which is wonderful for making the perfect pot of tea.<br /><br />I could smell the chocolate flavor filling the kitchen from the "Double Double Chocolate leaves."  In fact when I opened the factory sealed bag from Serenity House the aroma of the chocolate tea leaves was so aromatic it was heavenly!<br /><br />When I poured the cup I thought I would need to add sugar but decided to take a sip first and I was glad I did!  The tea was perfect!  The chocolate flavor was out of this world!<br /><br />This is the perfect tea for anytime but especially when you may be feeling a little down, or you might have the need to lift someone's spirits as a gift, or a pick me up, or for that<br />special time when you want to tell someone "you care" or as a "get well present" to the chocolate lover in your life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea!<br /><br />I did buy 7 or 8 other teas from this vendor and I must say that I was highly impressed by the speed of shipment, the packaging, the way the teas were wrapped and the care they took to individualize my shipment.  I am very delighted with the service I received and I know I will be ordering again!<br /><br />By the way, the labeling on the Serenity House teas are perfect!  There are instructions on the front and very clear instructions on the back as well.  Unlike other teas that you order online from other vendors, Serenity House takes all the guess work out of how to make the perfect cup of tea!<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you!

review/summary: This is not an ordinary dog food, this is real meat
review/text: My dog loves this. Had to switch from dry to wet food because she has something called mega-esophagus (where the esophagus is compromised) Started off with cans of IAMS and wondered why should I pay extra for "premium" dog food such as Dogswell. So I decided to do the research and find out whether the extra 80 cents (80% more than a can of IAMS) was worth spending per can. I mean dog food is dog food right?<br /><br />So what's the difference? Well I found out that dog food that contains "meat by products" or any "by-products" consisted of not only livestock deemed "inedible" under human standards (bones, intestines, hoofs, hair, etc) but it also contained dead zoo animals, road kills, and *gasp* euthanized DOGS and CATS with their (flea)COLLARS on! Goto [...] and educate yourself about dog food. This may give your dog an extra 5 years of life.

He is thirteen and recovered from an accident I credit the food. Thanks

The chicken he would eat but it didnt agree with his tummy. Now he found the Lamb Stew Recipe here with Dogswell and he loves to eat at mealtime!  My dog loves the chicken jerky treats that Dogswell makes as well, great product and healthy ingredients, highly recommended.

review/text: For a premium cost and marketed food, this doesn't look very premium. I can buy much cheaper food (less than half the price) at PetSmart that has actual chunks of meat and more importantly that my dog doesn't sniff and turn away from - and dogs will eat ... well lets just say just about anything<br />Bought it because of the supposed benefits for dogs with hip problems, but not worth the cost.

review/summary: Just like Hansens Black Cherry Soda
review/text: Over the years I have tried many different sodas, and since I used to drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBRQ0A">Hansen Beverage Diet Black Cherry Soda,  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, I was looking forward to these. The taste did not disappoint, they are genuinely black cherry.<br /><br />They have a more subtle taste than some of the other beans, and while it lingers, it becomes more of a jelly bean (sweeter) losing the full flavor as the bean disolves in your mouth. And while I enjoy the black cherry flavor, I really wouldn't get as excited about this single flavor the way I would some of the others. To put it plainly, I would enjoy it as a part of a mix, but wouldn't go looking for it. Compared to other jelly beans, this would rate a five, but compared to the other beyond gourmet beans, it ranks middle of the pack.<br /><br />If you would like to try it in a mix, I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBMAS8">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Soda Fountain Mix</a> as a good choice. It not only has this particular flavor, but it also focuses on the other soda flavors. I think you might be happier that way.<br /><br />I originally received a complimentary pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> from the distributor and found them some of the finest jelly beans I have found. If you have not tried any of the flavors, it is a good place to start.

The item is usable and none spilled in shipment but the dented corners would prevent me from giving it as a gift or reselling it to someone else.  We use this product a LOT and Amazon was the only place that I could find it!  It arrived about a week after being ordered (good timing).  I WOULD buy this product from Amazon again.

I was amazed when my friend gave me 2 bags of this and observed after a meal that my blood sugar went down without taking my medication. I recommended this to my co-worker and he was surprised as well. This tea really works! Better than taking medication with all that chemicals. I've been ordering this tea as soon as it starts to get low. I would recommend ordering online coz if you find this in any oriental store, prices are way too high.

review/text: I'm an expat from the UK and have been in the US for 14 years. I felt a much needed trip down memory lane was in order this Easter and snapped up the old UK Christmas staple "Quality Street" giant tin of sweetie goodness. Now if you know the Quality Street brand then you're good to go as this big two pound octagonal tin has all the favorites. But if you're unfamiliar with these 'magic moments' then you're in for a real treat. There's lots of various chocolate and caramel/toffee candies wrapped in bright multi-colored shiny foil with each one, from the strawberry delight to the big toffee penny, a taste sensation and in my humble opinion far surpasses the treats you can get in the US.<br /><br />Take a trip down Quality Street - you won't regret it.

review/summary: My Cat Went BERSERK When I Opened These
review/text: Our cat is pretty picky.  He eats a raw handmade dinner at night and a high quality dry food with water in the morning.  He is an outdoor cat.  When I get something new to give him, he often will look at me partially interested and then take a sniff or a lick and want to go outside.<br /><br />When our cat is hot, he often is not very interested in food.  He flops down and complains all day when it is hot, but does not like much of anything- food included.  The day I got my package of these treats in the mail, our cat was flopping underneath some planters on the porch.  He was not overly interested in me when I came out the door, other than to give me a tiny "Mew" to let me know he was there.<br /><br />I walked over to him with the box of sealed treats and told him I had a treat for him.  He began to sniff the air.  He almost never does that- especially with a sealed bag in a box!  I opened the box and then struggled with the bag as the peel off top which leads to a zip lock back inside did not come complete off.  The cat jumped on my leg and began to help me open the bag.  Clearly he was interested.<br /><br />Then I finally managed to get the bag open, and I broke one of the thick cakes of treat in half and held it up to him.  He leaped in the air and grabbed it with his paws like hands, and forced it on the ground where he held it in place with both hands and claws.  He held it and chewed on it with passion until it was all gone.  He even licked little crumbs up off the floor, something he almost never does.<br /><br />I decided to give him the other half and told him that it was all he would get.  He jumped in the air and begged until he got the cake from me.  He did things he rarely does when I offer him anything to eat.  Then he polished off that too.  When he was done, he went back to being the ultimate cool cat and adopting his sense of boredom at my existence he went back to flopping under the planter.<br /><br />These treats smell delicious, stay fresh in the bag, and I have to say that these treats bring about such a passion and excitement in our cat that he gets all happy and really into the process of eating a treat, licking it all up until it is gone.  I rarely see him get this excited over any food item except his homemade dinner at night.  I can not recommend these highly enough.  I am thinking these will be a regular feature at our house from this point on!

review/summary: Anyone remember dissecting owl pellets in grade-school?
review/text: That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn't care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don't consider a bad thing) and I'm always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I've found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I'd like to point out there wasn't and currently isn't an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions "Your dog's instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients..."  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they're really trying to appeal to a 'natural/holistic' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don't know to be 'real' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I'd probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few 'questionable to me' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn't bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn't care for them and I couldn't coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That's a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his.

review/summary: 4 Out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: OK, I have to say this is an expensive doggie treat, but my dogs practically steamroll one another to get to the treats. The circular disks of freeze dried chicken are rather big- bigger than a silver dollar and more than a half inch thick. They are very light because of the nature of the treat, and the dogs practically inhale them despite their size. I have 4 dogs and one is somewhat picky, but they all love these treats.<br /><br />There are under 20 treats in the package, so for $10-13 per package and with 4 dogs, they get about 4 treats a piece per package. And since these are treats, not bones, they don't last very long. I think these might be the "Doggie Christmas Stocking" type treat for special occasions, not an everyday treat due to the expense. But nonetheless, the dogs LOVE them!<br /><br />**4 stars due to price, but product gets 5 stars!

review/summary: Strange stuff, but the finicky cat likes it.
review/text: I don't know what I was expecting with these, but I guess I was thinking the "bites" would be cat-sized, not Great Dane-sized. The "bites" are about 1.75" in diameter and look like miniature hamburger patties. They are very light weight and are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />We've got two cats, the finicky one, and the one who will eat anything.<br /><br />After breaking one piece into about 5 smaller chunks, I gave a chunk to each cat and was pleasantly surprised to see them both eating them, and actually chewing - they usually inhale smaller treats, so it's nice to see them actually put their teeth to use!<br /><br />I'll definitely continue to purchase these, as it's tough for me to find anything the finicky cat will eat, I just wish they came in a smaller size.<br /><br />I've added some images of the product so you can actually see what you are getting. This 4-ounce package contained about 18 pieces.

review/summary: Large and awkward size for cats, might be better for dogs
review/text: Another reviewer said these looked like "hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say "Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight."  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />"Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food."<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />"Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience."<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.

review/summary: My Cats Love These
review/text: We have 3 cats and 2 will eat almost any treat, but one is very picky. It was around noon, so my one cat was  in the kitchen, looking for "lunch". I had just fed them an hour earlier, so there was no way I was opening another can of food.  I thought this would be a good time to try out the New Raw Boost Bites.<br />I took one of the pieces (they are quite big and look like a bite-size cookie) and broke it into smaller sizes. For dogs, I imagine you would not have to do this.<br />Well, they gobbled it right up! I had to break apart another for them right away. Then satisfied, they forget all about lunch and went to go relax. I guess these are a satisfying enough treat to tide them over until dinner.<br />Knowing these are not only tasty (at least from watching them eat them) but also good for them makes me feel good about feeding them to my cats.  You get about 18 in a pack, so I will be saving them for rewards or special treats.

review/text: This was listed as a cat treat. On the package it is stated to be for cats and dogs. I got them for my cats and thought it strange that the treat itself was the size of an oreo cookie. It is kind of crumbly like a stale cookie, but filled with real ingrediants like chicken and turkey. I had to crumble it into bite size pieces for my cats. They did eat it, but were less than enthusiastic. They prefer Temptations treats apparently. This would probably work better as a treat for dogs.

review/summary: Both cats liked them
review/text: I have used this brand for my cats and they have liked it (different flavors of wet food including rabbit and duck). When it comes to treats, my two cats tend to have different taste. I got them these treats and they both liked them. The treats are about the size of a chicken nugget but they are very light and almost crumbly. They smell fishy to me but they are chicken. The directions say they are treats for dogs and cats and to give 1-2 for each 20 pounds. Since my cats are about 10lbs each I decided to split 1 between the two.<br />I have had a good experience with this brand and I recommend it.

review/summary: My dogs love these
review/text: Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats are just the perfect snack for my Westies.  My male has allergies to most of the ingredients in dry dog food so I am very happy to recommend these treats for your dogs.  Convenient, tasty and they smell good too.  I will be looking for Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats at my local pet stores.

review/summary: Our Dogs Love Them
review/text: We have two dogs, a chihuahua and a beagle.  Both of them love the Boost Bites Treats.  As soon as they see the bag, they come running for their "cookie".  The treats are shaped like little cookies and are light brown in color so they actually look like gingersnaps.<br />The nutrition data and info on the label is impressive regarding how these treats can help your dog's digestion and provide other health benefits.  That's always nice to know - that you're giving your furry babies something that they love and it's good for them as well.  The treats are pretty soft so easy to chew for both dogs although I have to break up the one that the chihuahua gets - the cookie is a bit too big for her mouth.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful product to pamper a beloved pet.

review/summary: Probably better for cats and small dogs
review/text: For those who like are feeding their dogs the raw food diet, these bites may something you could use for treats.<br /><br />There's nothing artificial in the ingredients. As listed on the box: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove.<br /><br />This treat is labeled for dogs and cats but I have large dogs (80+ pound Labs) and these treats were finished in less than 5 seconds. For large dogs, I think this may work out better as a training treat - they are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />There are 18 in a package, about the size of a silver dollar, and about 1/2 inch thick. They have the  consistency of freeze dried food and were very quickly eaten by my Labs.  All loved it but for the size of my dogs, it's an expensive treat.

review/text: I have a box of Milk Bone flavor snacks, a box of Beneful Baked Delights and one of Raw Boost Bites, lets see how they stack up with the first few ingredients.<br /><br />Milk Bone: Wheat flour, wheat bran, wheat and bone meal, poultry by-products, beef fat, wheat germ, salt---and then a list of ingredients that no one can pronounce.<br /><br />Beneful: Wheat flour, ground corn, glycerin, sugar, corn gluten, water, chicken by-product, preserved animal fat----and then to the food color dye etc...<br /><br />Raw Boost:  Chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkin seed, apples, carrots, butternut squash, flax-seed, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, vinegar, parsley, salmon oil, citric acid, rosemary, blueberries etc.  No food color, preservatives that are difficult to pronounce.  They are made by a small company in NE that obviously care about the health of our pets.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is the amount moisture and protein.  Milk Bone: 12% moisture, 15% protein.<br />  Beneful: 20% moisture, 14% protein.<br />  Raw Boost:  4% moisture 40% protein.<br /><br />Rather interesting I thought, we usually don't have time to check out what's in our pets food at the store, always in a hurry.  I just thought you might like look at this too.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats!  We have two min. schnauzers who always love their "goodies"----and they are rather picky about their food.  The Raw Boost Bites passed with flying colors, so I (with tongue in cheek) think these are the ones that picky pets would choose.<br /><br />Would recommend this product to any pet lover.

review/summary: Tasty but expensive freeze dried pet treats
review/text: My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.

review/summary: My Cat and I Share a RAW FOOD Diet
review/text: NATURE'S VARIETY INSTINCT RAW BOOST BITES FREEZE-DRIED TREATS (aka "Boost Bites") provides a little treat for my cat, that isnt the JUNK FOOD normally found in name brand cat treats. The Friskies cat treats contain Brewers Rice, chicken meal, corn meal, animal fat, animal liver, malt, artificial flavors, brewers yeast, and a chemistry lab of various preservatives, and artificial colors.<br /><br /> Compare that to the RAW ingrediants of BOOST BITES: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey liver and heart, Pumpkin Seeds, Apples, Carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseed, clay (for natural vitamins), broccoli, lettuce, spinach, kelp, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, Vitamin E, Rosemary, blueberries, Alfalfa sprouts, permissons, sage, and clove.<br /><br />The BOOST BITES are a RAW FOOD. For years I've been eating a raw food diet for dinner, consisting of MUESLI. Muesli was invented by a Swiss doctor, consisting of various raw grains, dried fruit, and unbaked seeds and nuts, soaked in soy milk. The concept behind raw foods, is that cooking destroys the enzymes in food, as well as many vitamins, which our body requires. If I'm going to eat a raw diet for my health, I might as well share that benefit with my cat. Our pets arent that different than us, and i'm NOT anthopomorphizing. They require these raw enzymes just like we do, and our pets are healthier with them. If I didnt believe in the health benefits of raw food, I wouldnt spend the extra money for Muesli.<br /><br />Needless to say, a raw food diet means nothing to my cat. He eats Boost Bites cos he thinks they taste great. In fact, I gave him a taste test, placing a bit of BOOST BITES, next to his Friskies treats. He goobled down the Boost Bites, and left the Friskies Treats lay there untouched. (Tho he ate those too, when he figured out he wasnt getting more Boost Bites.)These cost a bit more than the treats from the grocery store, but they are his vitamin suppliment. Along with the EFA fish oil capsels I squeeze on his food, my cat's recieving an excellent diet. His digestion is good, and his coat doesnt flake off all this excessive dander, that used to cause him to scratch himself raw. A healthy cat is a happy cat. And a happy cat, is a happy cat owner.

review/summary: Three cats said Neooooooow
review/text: I sure liked the ingredients, the description and even the smell of these treats. But my three cats weren't even intrigued enough to taste them, so regretfully they have given these treats one star. The treats are really large and probably more suitable for a dog. Of course, I broke the treats up into manageable sizes for cats, still no luck. Well, cats are known to be finicky and mine are no exception. One day they love something and the next day they could not care less. I will give the remainder of these treats to my daughter who has three dogs and will update my review if, in fact, they shed a different light on Raw Boost Bites.

review/summary: A big hit with my two 3-year old felines. And a Google check okays its fat content
review/text: Being totally clueless about minimum recommended content of protein, fat and fiber in feline diets, and considerably worried about the healthfulness of this product after reading another Amazon reviewer's warning of what he found to be the way-too-high fat content of these treats--the label says "crude fat (min.) 34.0%"--, I went online and found a link to a National Research Council site titled "Your Cat's Nutritional Needs: A Science Based Guide for Pet Owners"  which appears to be the work of a cadre of science professors from about a dozen universities.  They say:<br /><br /> "The maximum amount of fat in the cat's diet can be reasonably high without any<br />known adverse effects. In many cat foods, 50% or more of the energy comes from<br />fat. Studies indicate that cat foods containing even higher amounts of fat are safe.<br />At a minimum, cat foods should have a fat content of about 9% of dry matter."<br /><br />Which is a relief, considering how much my two three-year-old cats, Purrcilla and B.J. Honeycatt, seem to love this stuff.<br /><br /> I think this is the first pet treat I've ever seen that is labeled as being for both dogs and cats.  The size of these dry treats--there are about a dozen and a half of them in this 4 oz. bag-inside-a-box, each about the size of a half inch high stack of silver dollars--is  more dog friendly than cat friendly, but the discs break in two easily; Once a day I crumble and split half a disc between their two bowls as a topper for their wet food...or sometimes instead, use it as a bedtime treat. So for two cats I estimate getting about a month's worth out of this package.<br /><br />I've bookmarked the site mentioned above for future reference (too bad Amazon doesn't allow us to link to outside sites in our reviews).

review/summary: "Your're trying to poison me, I just KNOW it"
review/text: My Australian shepherd (AKA "garbage-gut") would kill for these. On the other hand she would kill for a chicken strip or a bite of buttered toast so I don't know if you should depend on her for a review. My ultra-suspicious , paranoid  cat (who has NEVER eaten a treat) sucked these right down when I crumbled them by her food. ...."I just KNOW you're trying to poison me, you old bat.".... They have excellent ingredients, no grains or gluten.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's fair to take off a star for price. I try to get the best food for my pets (I pay $50 for a bag of blue buffalo for the dog) but ,to be honest ,I don't think I could justify over $40 for a pound of treats, good tasting and healthy or not.If YOU can these would be a good choice.

review/summary: Dog Liked It
review/text: What can I say?  The dog liked it - I certainly didn't taste it.  He didn't gobble it down at first since it was something new so let me describe it....<br /><br />I handed it to him and, after a few cautious and tentative sniffs he took it from my hand and took it over to his favorite spot.  He set it on the ground, licked it a few times to roll it over and sniff the other side - this went on a couple of times and humorous to watch.  From there, he was like a little kid and took a small sample bite to give it a try.  After a few tentative chews and a reluctant swallow, he looked up to see if it was ok to proceed.<br /><br />Proceed he did, as he crunched away at the remainder of the treat and, after a satisfactorily smack of the lips he ran over to beg for another (which he didn't get).  I do like the fact there is a lot of meat products vs. garbage in the Made in the USA treat!

review/summary: they don't last long....
review/text: Okay, I'm rating these based on my cats' reactions to these treats. While one is the exact opposite of a picky eater (ANYTHING that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind), the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks.  Needless to say, the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more.  Cat #2 took a little more time/investigation when it came to the treat (that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute, something I really don't put past her), but once she tried it, she was much quicker eating the second bite.  Finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients/less crappy filler is a great thing.<br /><br />That said, these things are NOT cheap.  You do not get a lot for your money, though at least if you're buying them for cats,  you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece. I can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing - at least while on the current budget.
