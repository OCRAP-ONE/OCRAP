review/summary: tasty but a bit expensive
review/text: These are much better than I expected. They have quite a bit of flavor and go great with a cup of coffee in the mid morning when there is a craving for something sweet but not indulging in something like a donut or other high calorie snack. I like these and the the strawberry ones are good too. Don't expect to get full on eating a packet of these. They just fill in between meals.

review/summary: GOOD BUT.........
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317HLQA">Special K Fruit Crisps, Blueberry, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I ordered these fruit crisps to add a little extra something to my low cal diet.  They are good in both the blueberry and strawberry flavors.  The only thing that I found dissappointing was that they were very thin and after eating one pack I felt as if I had eaten nothing.  Some of the low cal bars are thicker which makes them more satisfying. It is true that you get 2 to a package but because they are so thin 2 bites for each crisp and they are gone I did not find them satisfying.  I wish they were somewhat more substantial in size, but since they are described as crisps not bars I guess the size goes along with the description. I should have paid more attention to the word crisps and realized that they would be very thin.  Had I realized this I would not have ordered them. I understand that calorie watchers cannot eat voluminous amounts of food, but these are almost like eating very thin wafers. The one good thing is that they do taste good and I will finish them rather then having to throw them out or return them. it's just that there isn't enough to eat that would make them memorable. I am undecided as to whether or not I want to order them again, probably not. If you like very thin snack crisps that disappear in 2 bites each these are for you. Volume wise they did not make the grade, but in all fairness to Kelloggs this product does fit its description, crisps not bars.

review/summary: The Best Cola Ever!
review/text: This is my number one favorite soda. I was a verified true blue Coke-a-holic. So when I say this tastes like Coke.... well... it really does. It actually tastes like a little bit flat coke(as Coke is very overly carbonated)...but has more flavor so it's not so bad. If you want a healthier alternative to the popular drink - caffeine free, no artificial flavors, pure cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup... the flavoring comes mostly from clove, licorice, and vanilla. Very tasty... I save mine for special meals. You can usually find these in specialty grocery stores for $5-7 per 4 pack, and also comes in Cherry Cola flavor.

review/summary: Made this soup yesterday - a hit in our house!
review/text: I poured this bag into a slow cooker and set it on high for 3 hours then low the rest of the day.  If you started it earlier I think the low setting would have worked just fine.  I added some minced onion, a can of diced tomatoes, spices, and filled the slow cooker to the top with water then just left it.  We enjoyed a bowl last night and another bowl tonight for supper with a salad.  The blend of barley and black beans is very hearty, filling, and yummy.  The rest of the soup will be frozen as lunch leftovers to take to work. How easy that was!

review/text: I bought this at a discount store and to my surprise, Amazon carries it for less than what I paid for it. I use this as a meat substitute for part of the ground beef in a variety of recipes. I've been using this soup mix to make everything from chili, to taco meat (use equal parts ground beef and beans--season well), to various soups. It adds nutrition and fiber and great taste for a very low cost. Highly recommended!

review/summary: A great, healthier treat!
review/text: My dogs love these treats. The bite size makes it perfect for use as a reward for obedience training. The fact that it does not crumble easily makes it easier to just throw a handful in your pocket to go for a walk. Most importantly, the ingredients are natural and human grade. The wheat flour used in it is much better than corn.<br /><br />I've read about these treats a few months ago but could not find a local retailer that sold them. Amazon, at the time, did not sell it either. Other online retailers were charging $5-$6 for shipping, which is as much as the 8oz. bag itself. Amazon now sells this item and their price combined with the free shipping makes this a very good deal.

Don't do it, unless you're planning to use the treats for gerbils!  They're basically super small broken bits about the size of grape nuts that the dog inhales, many times having to cough it back up.  The regular size is definitely the way to go.

review/summary: Tastes great + strengthens and rebuilds enamel
review/text: I and my 7 and 9 year old daughters like the taste of this gum, but the main reason we buy it is because it has calcium in a form that can be directly absorbed from your saliva into your teeth, and utilized to strengthen and rebuild weak spots in your tooth enamel. The specific chemical is calcium casein peptone-calcium phosphate, a lactose-free milk derivative.<br /><br />Natural saliva has calcium in it; this will give it a boost, especially important if you have dry mouth. A decade ago I had the idea of rinsing my teeth with a liquid calcium supplement, thinking it would boost my saliva's calcium, but after a couple wasted years, I read that the calcium in your saliva has to be bound to other, specific chemicals in order to be absorbed and used by your teeth.  This product fits the bill.<br /><br />I also use ACT enamel-restoring rinse. The ACT rinse has a similar calcium product but also has fluoride.  Too much fluoride can be have negative effects on teeth, so I use the rinse twice a day, as directed, and chew the gum during the day to promote salivation (with its own calcium) and boost calcium levels without overdoing the fluoride.<br /><br />Individual packs can be expensive, so I used to get boxes at Sam's Club. Unfortunately, Sams discontinued the product. Now I save on shipping by having the boxes delivered from Amazon every month as a recurring order.

The fact that this gum has calcium is a great selling point for me. The extra minerals that this gum provides is supposed to help strengthen teeth and enamel. If this gum is any help at all for preventing cavities, then it has paid for itself many times over.<br /><br />Not to mention, it tastes delicious. The only downside-- once people learn you have this gum, you might have to share!

review/text: Our dog is very healthy and happy on this food! He has no digestive or skin issues and he is never sick. He's an 8 year old American Eskimo Dog. We walk him a LOT, but he still doesn't need to eat as much as the package indicates. He eats the "weight loss" amount, but he's not losing weight, he's maintaining his weight. This isn't a complaint at all, but if you're going to feed this food to an older dog or a dog with a slower metabolism, monitor their weight carefully and make sure you're not feeding too much!

After switching, which had no effects on her GI, the redness went away. She also had has no tendency to want to eat this after it was digested (if you know what I mean!) which can be an issue with many weight management foods.<br /><br />I did my homework online and read a lot of online sites before switching. I can say hands down, Wellness CORE is a great food and if you can afford the small increase in price, I think you and your furry friend will enjoy its benefits.

review/text: I have two golden retrievers with hearty appetites.  Feeding them regular dog food makes them overweight.  I switched to Core Reduced Fat when I began to worry about the quality of the food I was feeding my dogs.  I had fed my dogs expensive dog foods which I got at the grocery store.  When I read the ingredients, I decied to look for something better quality.  From my research I learned that high quality dog foods prevent illness and disease and increase life-span.  Core is made with ingredients like real chicken--not chicken by-products or lots of grain.  Afterall, dogs are carnivores.  Since my dogs have been on Core they have not had the usual ear infections, skin allergies and irritations; their coats are beautiful; they have lots of energy and are overall very healthy.  The extra money I pay for this high quality dog food I definitely save at the vet!

I will keep buying this from Amazon for as long as my dog wants it, and I am pretty sure that is going to be a long time! :)

review/summary: Portly Bagle Loves It! I know it's healthy.
review/text: I have a portly beagle, who is beyond cute but 2 lbs over weight. However, keeping her weight down as she gets older was very important. We'd been using the normal Wellness Healthy Weight and she seemed to enjoy that. We changed her to the CORE after she started to get red skin on her belly. After switching, which had no effects on her GI, the redness went away. She also had has no tendency to want to eat this after it was digested (if you know what I mean!) which can be an issue with many weight management foods.<br /><br />I did my homework online and read a lot of online sites before switching. I can say hands down, Wellness CORE is a great food and if you can afford the small increase in price, I think you and your furry friend will enjoy its benefits.<br /><br />This smaller 4-pound bag is nice for taking to grandma and grandpa's for when she visits. We usually pick up the 12lb bag for our day to day feeding at home. I did notice more and more local stores starting to carry this, so I think the Wellness CORE is starting to pick up market share.

review/summary: My dog loves this
review/text: For what it's worth, my 9lb. yorkie-poo loves this food, more than the other types of Wellness. The local Petco carries every flavor but this, so I have to order it on-line, but it is really worth it. Whenever I read about a dog having "..re-newed energy", or "...a shinier coat", I always scoff because that has never been the case with my dog. Even with the foods he loves, but with this particular type of dog food with this particular company, I have to say it's true. I tried all of the various Wellness foods, and he was okay with them, but this is the only one that he's ever really emptied the bowl, every time. That includes the Super 5 Max, or whatever it's called, the food for smaller dogs that somehow finds grains acceptable.

review/summary: Texture
review/text: The pieces are VERY hard.. in fact, too hard for my 12+ year old to eat dry. I have to soak it in some beef or chicken broth in order for him to be able to eat it. I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help. I have no idea how the taste is, because I don't eat it, but I did try biting into a piece to see how hard it was and it was. My dogs seem to like it as long as it's softened for them though.

review/text: great food choice for those that are looking for alternate protein source. Our dog is allergic to chicken and beef. This is the first food that didn't smell intolerably fishy (even the lesser quality wellness ocean smelled nasty). Believe me, it's still fishy, but tolerable.  After a few weeks on Wellness Core Ocean, her coat is super shiny and soft.  Would purchase again!

review/summary: Helped my dog loses weight
review/text: I have two basset hounds and they tend to have weight problem especially since they have a mommy that dooesn't like to see them go hungry.  I feel good giving my babies this food because this company has a good reputation and they are consistently on the many lists of good pet food by independent raters.  I feed my babies half dry kibble and half home cooked chicken, turkey, beef fresh meats, and they also get daily multivitamins.  Jake actually host 2 lbs so he will get to keep the same amount bMy problem is that they get too much treats, mainly because I give them treats every time I have to give them medication or clean their ears.  So I decrease the food amount at breakfast and dinner to make up for the daily treats.  I also add some warm water to the dry kibble and let it soften the food, then add probiotic powder when cooled, and home coooked meats and vitamins. I like this brand as well as the Blue Buffalo and the Simple Life brands.  I wish Simple Life will make weight management foods.  I like the foods that are kept in special type of metallic zip lock bags to help keep it fresh.  Make sure you check the expiration date and odor to ensure the foods are not expired or have "off" odors.

review/summary: Wise switch from Iams Low Residue Formula
review/text: When my Rhodesian Ridgeback-mix developed mild pancreatitis two years ago at age three, my vet suggested Iams Low Residue food.  Over the last year, however, she's also developed severe skin allergies (but mostly air-borne, I think)and was losing hair in small patches so, after some research I added MSM to her diet and decided to eliminate grain. Wellness CORE Grain-Free food was the perfect choice because it is also low-fat (too much fat aggrevating her pancreas).  In the month she's been on it--both dry and wet formula--her coat has improved and she even seems perkier!

review/summary: Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!
review/text: Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is "sub-par" compared to the "very top" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: It's a miracle.
review/text: Got a shelter dog back in November... Bichon Frise.  We have been thru 7 different brands of food and also boiling chicken and rice for him as well. His digestive system is a mess, and recently we learned his pancreas  numbers were off as well. This is why we decided to go low fat.<br /><br />It has been 12 days and the improvement is remarkable. We finally have good poop. It's a miracle!  PLUS he liked it right away as well.<br /><br />I researched dozens of dog foods over the last 6 months, and recently at least 6 low fat dry foods. This one appeared to be the best, and it is definitely the best for our dog!  We are VERY HAPPY with our choice. Plus it magically comes to the door via UPS.

review/summary: GREAT Dog Food
review/text: This is wonderful food, and would recommend it to anyone with a dog needing to lose weight, with a sensitive stomach, or allergies.  I had my toy poodle on Iams for 7 years.  I never did research on dog food, the breeder I bought her from had started her on Iams, so I continued on it.  She steadily put on weight over the years, & I switched to Iams Weight Control.  After continuing to gain weight, and just generally have no energy at all, I thought it's time for a drastic change.  At this point, I did A LOT of research on dry dog food.  I wish I had done this years ago!  I came to find out, that a lot of the well know brands, do not have quality ingredients.  After lots of research, I decided the Wellness Core Reduced Fat Grain Free was our best option.  She's been on it now for 5 months, and has went from nearly 8.5 lbs to just barely over 7, and still counting.  She seems to feel so much better.  AND...she loves the food too!

And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Very good!
review/text: I have drank Community Coffee for many years but recently became concerned about the effects of caffeine. Not being a fan of decaf, I decided to try this one. I am very pleased that it has most of the same flavor as the full caffeine version that I have had daily for about 25 years. My only beef is...why can't you get it in 1 lb. bags??<br />**Update** I have just received my second order of this coffee, and I do have a major problem with it. All of the coffee appears to be stale. Anyone that drinks coffee knows that the quality is greatly dependent on how fresh it is. The bags I buy in the stores have a "sell by" date four months or more away. These bags are within a month of their "sell by" date, which is a deal breaker for me. I will go back to buying it in the store. I guess in this case you do get what you pay for.

Some are naturally de-caffeinated, but the packaging on this coffee does not state that it is.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a purchase we will make again.

review/text: I constantly use this on flounder, tilapia and salmon when I need a very tasty and easy way to cook my fish.  It doesn't take a whole lot of sauce to do the trick and you don't need to add any other spices or do anything special.  Your fish will have a restaurant taste with practically no work or time.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Firm and mashed style. All organic spices. Not oily. Not super spicy, but the chili, cayenne, paprika flavor notes are more prominent. [I add my favorite habanero salsa.] Approx. 305 calories, 21g protein, 3.5g fat, 630mg sodium per can. Lower sodium allows the flavors of any accompaniments to come out. Also is a great choice for those who like refried beans but watch their sodium. Hearty bean 'base' or paste that can be used with many types of cuisine or appetizers. Great company. Kosher parve. Also really liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTKQO">Eden Organic Rice & Beans, Caribbean Black Bean, Lundberg Brown Rice, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> by Eden which has been popular.

I was VERY disappointed once I did.... they are the most bland and tasteless refried beans I have ever eaten.  They are NOT spicy at all.  I would never purchase them again.  A much tastier choice (and lower in calories) is La Preferida Fat Free Refried Beans, however Amazon does not have a subscribe and save option for them yet, so for now you get a much better deal buying them at your local grocery store.

If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

review/text: This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

review/text: I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/summary: Good Basic Tea
review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: i was a die hard Teavana fan until they discontinued (retired) several of my favorite teas<br />including Assam Gold Rain FTGFOP though i had some left i decided to give this a try and was<br />pleasantly surprised, it is full bodied w slight astringent qualities balanced by sweet notes at<br />the start w a nice malty finish.<br />i drink it straight up w raw sugar &/ or raw honey.<br />it is about the same price as Teavana's Assam was (if you buy it on Amazon) i will be buying more soon<br />my friends and family love it also by the way.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I've only done this tea as a cold brew iced tea. There is no bitterness, just a smooth, refreshing, green taste. The ginger is very strong. I love ginger, so that is no problem for me. A second brew was significantly weaker, so I will stick to one brew per batch of leaves with this one (I am able to get three quality brews from many green teas).

review/summary: weak Earl Grey
review/text: This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.

review/summary: A lovely tea
review/text: After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/summary: Sweet Jasmine
review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Good all around tea
review/text: This tea is my go to tea for everyday!  It is nearly indestructible!  I've forgotten about it and it has steeped for 15 minutes and still tastes great!  I can brew it, put it in my travel mug, go to the gym and an hour and a half later it still tastes great!  Can't beat the value either at about $5 a bag.  If I recall correctly it is about $7 at the Stash store in Oregon.  This is the tea that got me drinking green tea!
