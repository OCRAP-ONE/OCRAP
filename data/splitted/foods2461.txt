review/summary: Cute but definitely not worth $30
review/text: I purchased this for $7.40 for my husband and had it shipped to his office. The candy was a big hit with he and his coworkers! That being said, I would never pay full price ($28) as there's not a whole lot in the box. If you can grab this when it's &lt;$10 and get free shipping I say go for it! :)

review/summary: Not a lot of candy, some items easy to find elsewhere
review/text: About 30 small pieces of candy, lots of shredded brown paper, and a nice box.  Half the stuff I'd have trouble finding.  The cool factor here is "This is the candy that mom and dad had when we were kids".  I was a little hesitant about the candy cigarettes, pipes and cigars, but that was part of the era.

review/summary: Perfect for Simulating Starbucks White Chocolate Mochas
review/text: I recently purchased a coffee maker and numerous ingredients in an attempt to simulate Starbucks White Chocolate Mochas in an attempt to save money. This being one of the primary ingredients I have mastered and possibly even exceeded my expectations and now I am saving over $5/day that I used to spend at Starbucks. It is much nicer to drink my Coffee from my home office without having to make the daily trip to Starbucks.<br /><br />I use this Frappe Mix along with a Senseo Coffee maker to create my own White Chocolate Mochas and it has been a huge success. I will be ordering more of this mix once I run out.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish it came in some sort of can with a scoop instead of the bag that it comes in.

review/summary: Part of my Starbucks replacement recipe
review/text: After getting somewhat addicted to Starbucks White Mocha Frappe's, I decided I could probably save a lot of money and make my own.  I bought this and Torani's White Chocolate sauce.  I also like mine with a pump of Sugar Free Hazelnut, so I also bought Torani brand through Amazon.<br /><br />For coffee, I bought 2-lb bags for French Roast beans at Costco.  I grind and then make a strong pot of coffee (14 heaping teaspoons per 10 cups of coffee).  After the coffee is made, I pour it into ice cube trays and freeze them.<br /><br />The recipe is to add about 1 ï¿½ cups of milk (I use 1%) in a blender, about two tablespoons of the White Chocolate Frappe mix, one "squirt" of the white mocha sauce, and one pump of the SFH.  Last, I add eight coffee ice cubes. I blend it all up, and it makes about 20 oz. of Frappe.<br /><br />Both my wife and I like it as much if not more that Starbucks, and of course it's much cheaper.  By using both our Prime membership and the Amazon Subscribe and Save, it's even less, the supplies are always on the shelf.<br /><br />The only little annoying downside (why I didn't give it five stars) is that the instructions say to add one scoop to make a frappe.  Unfortunately, they don't include a scoop in the bag, nor can I find a definition of a scoop.  So I just experimented until I liked the taste.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBYPEI">Torani Original Mocha Sauce, White Chocolate, 16.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RM">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: So good!
review/text: Definitely tastes like white chocolate, not vanilla (as someone asked in the comments of a review.) I mixed it up as the directions stated and it tasted like a perfectly blended milkshake - minus the ice cream, of course. If you're looking for an amazing drink, try it out!<br /><br />For those curious, it does contain coffee, but I couldn't taste it. Try adding espresso instead of milk for extra coffee taste. Alternatively, Big Train's White Chocolate Frappe mix actually does taste strongly of coffee, but I don't think the flavor for it is as good as MoCafe.<br /><br />Other reviewers for MoCafe drinks complain about the "scoop" system. The back of this bag actually lists what a "scoop" is: it's 8 tablespoons.

review/summary: Waste of my money
review/text: I was so excited when I ordered this product and received it today. When I put the box on my counter I notice powder spilling out of the packaging box. I opened up the box and the bag had popped open about half an inch at the top and about a cup of powder had spilled inside the box. I don't know whether it had burst open or been open but I personally don't trust an open food package when I buy it. I can't even return the product because of it's "no return" return policy. Waste of my $25 and extremely disappointed...stick with starbucks and don't let what happened to me happen to you.

review/summary: Great on many foods
review/text: I got introduced to this Tabasco at Chipotle. Since then, it has become a staple, going on all Mexican food that I eat at home and then also on random other food items. For instance, it adds a great kick to macaroni and cheese. My wife likes it (and other Tabasco items) on her eggs.<br /><br />Regarding the price, you can typically find the price in store the same here, if not better. I wouldn't pay more than about 90c per ounce, and usually I can get it about 60c per ounce at Target (though the Targets in Boston are awful, so we pay extra since we don't visit Target here any longer).

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

The only other complaint I have is that some of the flavors taste the same but they are still good though. I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Earthy Rich Flavor for Cooking & Gourmet Treats
review/text: Truffle paste is an ideal treat because the flavor remains consistent, and it has a much better shelf life than fresh truffles.  The taste of this particular brand is earthy and robust; it's excellent for both cooking, and serving over crackers when entertaining guests.<br /><br />You can whisk the truffle paste into a sauce, or add it to mashed potatoes to give it an intriguing new taste for company (add it after a dish is prepared, or it will lose some taste and aroma).  While only an ounce, this tube of white truffle paste should last you a while.  I spent a great deal of time shopping around for truffle paste (typically $30-$90 an ounce), and ultimately bought this one on Amazon.<br /><br />The taste is excellent, although I didn't consider it to be worth $90.  I would recommend trying this brand at least once, and making the decision for yourself.

review/summary: Gerber's fruits are cooked
review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

review/summary: The cat loves this food.
review/text: Cats don't like change. My cat likes Fancy Feast Chunky Chicken Feast for his wet food. That's what he like to eat. If I try to feed him something else, I waste my money. He's eight and it's been this way since he was a kitten. So, my goal was to find the food the cat likes for as cheap as I can buy it. Having Amazon deliver a case of the stuff monthly is easy. It's cheaper than carrying home a case from Wal-Mart too.

review/text: I ordered this tea because I had an old box of Select Eyebright which even a year after expiration had a strong and pleasant taste.  But those bags were sealed in foil pouches.  The tea I ordered on this site came in cellophane pouches and had little smell or taste -- even when I used three bags per cup!  Even the exterior of the boxes had pale colors, like cheap printing, compared to the old, glossy box.  The think the company decided to save money both on the tea and on the packaging.  A waste of money, for me.  I will look for a loose herb mix now, organic if possible.

I use these for sauce and anything that requires canned tomatoes and I have never been disappointed. Also, as a bonus, unlike most you find on a grocery shelf, these tomatoes contain only 1% ( 20 mgm sodium ) per serving so this is a real consideration if cooking for someone on a low sodium diet.

I found them at Bloom for slightly over $4.00 a can - which is still less expensive than 12 cans with "free shipping".<br />Just thought I would share. I had never heard of San Marzano tomatos until I watched Giada Di Laurentiis. They are imported from Italy, so that's why they are a bit costlier. I suppose if you live near a Wegman's too, they probably have them there as well. I am always looking for the best deal! Cheers!

Here's my advice: rip open a package, pour it out on your cutting board and cut it into bite size pieces with your kitchen shears. I find even the toughest pieces manageable after that.<br /><br />Still--the first time I bought it (at a Whole Foods), I happened to get a package that wasn't as tough. So I agree that the quality control could be better. And some pieces seem nicely seasoned while others feel a little like eating leather.

review/text: Our greyhound absolutely loves these bones! Even though it's designed to clean her teeth, I think she plans her day around the opportunity to chew on this luscious bone. She knows she gets the bone after she finishes her dinner. I think she would eat sawdust to get to this bone! Like the original Coke recipe, does it have Cocaine in it? Our dog is a loving, docile pet, but regularly growls if we try to take it away from her...we give her 1/3 of a bone after each dinner meal. Too much of this product seems to effect the stool negatively. If you want  your dog to place you on a pedestal, buy this product!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.
review/text: I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.

review/summary: Fragoli Wild Strawberry Liqueur - best of class
review/text: Got my hands on a bottle of Fragoli Wild Strawberry Liqueur a few days ago, and it was fantastic - probably the best strawberry liqueur on the market, period. The tiny wild strawberries in the bottle are a bonus, attractive and delicious strung on a drink pick as a garnish.<br /><br />If you see it on the shelf, don't pass it up!

review/summary: Love this pasta
review/text: I was looking for ways to add more beans (and more specifically protein with less carbs) to my diet when I found this pasta. I love it. It has the same taste and texture of any full or multi-grain organic pasta, but with only 16g of carbs compared to DeBoles with 46g/serving. That was a no-brainer for me. I'm not a huge pasta fan, but at least if I am going to have spaghetti this makes much more sense than regular pasta. :)

Also the price was great for as many that were in the package... I ordered these very close to the holiday and they arrived earlier than expected!

review/text: I have three children, one with a restricted diet.  These cookies allow her to have a special treat very similar to the real thing.  I think they are better than real chocolate chip cookies.  I use soy milk or smart balance instead of the butter.  The dough is very sticky and make sure to not over cook them.  We have tried several brands of pancake/waffle mixes too.  Cherrybrook Kitchen products have the best taste of any we have found. Enjoy -

review/summary: Great Cookie
review/text: These cookies are a great member of the Cherrybrook Kitchen family. I've noted that some people have stated that they have a gritty texture. Although they are a bit more "gritty" than traditional wheat cookies, they are the best wheat free mix that I have found. They cook up quick and easy. In addition, they are the ONLY milk and egg free mix that I have found that<br />1. That works<br />2. Tastes yummy<br />3. You don't have to use egg replacer, etc.<br />These are also great to eat RAW since they don't have egg. My son's favorite thing to do is make the dough, cool it, and dip it in melted Enjoy Life Chocolate chips to make chocolate chip cookie dough bon bons. A favorite of everyone at our house :)

review/summary: The BEST Gluten free, egg free, soy free, dairy free mix!!!
review/text: I've tried all the various gluten free mixes out there that don't have soy in them (we avoid soy) and as we also avoid egg and dairy I have to use substitutes for those in any mixes or baking I do. This mix has none of those allergens already in it and doesn't require any of those be added either! Of all the mixes I've tried these have THE BEST flavor, texture and over all quality. If you melt/heat your butter/oil it will melt the chips when you mix it together and you can then have chocolate cookies - I do this a lot and add shredded coconut and almond essence, which is super yummy!<br /><br />This mix is great - I can't recommend it highly enough!!!!

review/summary: Dented Cans Every Time
review/text: Hi, I order cases of canned crushed tomato all the time because it's much easier to receive by mail on the doorstep than carrying from market.<br /><br />Cento tomatoes are good along with Muer Glen tomato, this is about damaged dented cans received each time.<br /><br />I typically order Muer Glen organic canned tomato and now trying Cento.  Each time several cans arrive dented.  Amazon is good about replacing since food items cannot be returned but they need to do something about the shipping to prevent the cans becoming dented.<br /><br />Last week a case of Cento cans arrived with 9 badly dented cans out of 12.  I am sure Amazon will replace or credit but they need to do something about shipment, perhaps label Fragile and put more padding.<br /><br />A couple of times with Muer Glen there were several cans with smaller dents and I just kept them rather than keep contacting Amazon.<br /><br />Again Amazon is very good about rectifying but I'm not sure what can be done to prevent the dented cans during shipment, it's not convenient to have to keep sending emails about the issue each time.  Maybe they should check the cans prior to shipment in case they are receiving them dented, not sure.

review/summary: Good Product But Apparent False Advertising and Labeling
review/text: Any Cento products I've used are of good quality, and I like these crushed tomatoes for aroma, taste and texture, however, they do not appear to be real Italian tomatoes as represented on the product labeling as well as the Amazon website. The Amazon Product Description reads "The official seal of the Suolo e Salute s.r.l. on each can, guarantees Cento Organic Tomaotes (sic) are grown naturally and chemical free. Freshly packed". This statement suggests they are imported from Italy. I could not find this seal or statement on the can or can label. The Amazon Product Description also says "Product of Italy", but there is no such labeling on the can, in fact, there is no country of origin shown, which is unusual in the industry these days. The label does however read "Not From Concentrate" and "Some manufacturers of tomato products use a mixture of reconstituted tomatoes. But not Cento". Checking the Cento website I see that some tomato products they sell do show "Product of Italy" but this one does not. The image shown on the Cento website accurately depicts the item I have.<br />Cans are stamped "Best By 03/01/14".<br />For my intended uses and the price paid via Amazon Subscribe & Save I'll continue to use this product but am also sourcing actual Italian tomatoes and may consider the Carmelina Brands imported by Mangia, Inc and sold through Amazon.<br />And this particular case of 12 cans arrived with most cans dented, as usual, but still usable.

Once you taste this type of tomato...you will agree....it is the best for sauce...nothing compares to it.
