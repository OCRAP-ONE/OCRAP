review/summary: My dog loves Nylabones
review/text: I have a pit bull mix who chews through almost all "indestructible" toys in about 5 minutes. This is her second Nylabone and she just loves them. Her tail when nuts when I pulled out this circle one. My parents' dog has the same chew and their pup loves playing tug of war with it. Nylabone is about the only thing she hasn't been able to destroy and I will continue to buy lots more!

review/summary: BEST chew toy ever!
review/text: My dog and I LOVE this chew toy. It lasts virtually forever. Cooper is a 130lb Bullmastiff and she's had her Nylabone Chew Ring for over a year. We've tried the Nylabone chew toy in the bone shape, but it eventually gets chewed down and becomes a choking hazard. Since this is ring-shaped, your dog can chew forever and it won't get smaller! Beware though, if your dog is a strong chewer, the smooth texture becomes sharp. We haven't noticed her mouth bleeding, but  since Cooper also likes to carry her ring and toss it in the air, she sometimes scratches us with the sharp edges. She likes to fetch her ring too. I recommend this chew toy to ALL dog owners. I've bought this at pet stores and its half the price on Amazon. Cooper has 3 : )

review/text: This product is made in the USA which means there are no concerns with toxic ingredients.  The shape is ideal since there is no need to be concerned with choking hazards when they worry it down. My two dogs who agree on nothing else agree on this: love the rings!

review/summary: All around fun for dogs
review/text: This Nylabone is a winner in our house. We were glad to find this because other than Kong and SOME bouncy balls she will destroy any toy. Indestructible toys are a must in our house or they are dead in 5 minutes. The more playful dog is really enjoying tossing this one for herself to chase, jump on, and flip around in her mouth. She is chewing it too, but does more playing with it at this time. Our playful pup is about 50 pounds and I think this toy would be a good size for dogs up to 75 pounds before it seemed too small.

review/summary: Great for chewers
review/text: I have 5 dogs, and they all simply LOVE this ring. It lasts quite a while, the first one lasted almost a year. Good for dogs that chew through toys, it's harder for them to chew on/grasp (no corners to focus on) but still keeps their interest because they have to try to figure out the best way to chew on it.

review/summary: Not indestructible, but a good toy
review/text: We bought this for our extreme chewer abotu 6 months ago.  While it is by no means indestructible, it did take him about 2 months to chew through it.  In the following 4 months he's managed to chew off about 1/3 of the ring, which makes this by far his longest lasting chew toy.  As a plus, he seems to really enjoy the ring shape, as it allows him to put one paw through the ring to steady the toy while he chomps away.  A good toy for extreme chewers.

I rate this product as pretty darned good although I agree with another reviewer who thinks it should be a bit thicker.

review/summary: Excellent Chew for large dogs
review/text: I have a Lab/Rottie mix who is now 2 years old. I gave him Nylabones chews at my vets recommendation when I brought him home when he was 8 weeks old. He loves them and chewed only the Nylabones, he didn't chew my furniture nor our shoes not even my houseplants. Now at 2 years of age and 98 pounds the nylabone ring and the nylabone wishbone are still his favorite chews and he still has the originals from when we brought him home. He is healthy, his teeth are in excellent shape and it keeps him occupied for hours. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Yummy, funny, fragile, and repetitive
review/text: These treats are really great but have some major downfalls. First off, the box is relatively small and comes with only about 10 cookies. The fortunes inside are rather witty, but they repeat to the point of obnoxiousness. The first four cookies I pulled out all had the same fortune! Additionally, almost half of all my cookies came crumbled. Of course, the dogs don't care about whether the cookie is in pieces or not, but it was a bit of a hassle to pour out crumbs for my dog. So if you're OK spending an unjustified amount of money for a funny box and a few yummy treats, than this is a perfect treat for you and your dog. However, you won't get the bang for your buck with this product.

review/text: My Australian Cattle Dog loves these treats. The fortunes are hilarious, making the cost so worth it. He's a bit of a picky eater (just like his father), so it's always a good find when I find a treat he really likes. These chicken liver treats are a real score, even if he can't sit still long enough to hear the entire fortune. Each cookie is individually wrapped then placed in a take-out box, which is clearly marked as a dog treat. The best fortune so far? "Confuscious say dog sitting in pew not necessarily at church."

These little toddler meals are simple, easy, and best of all, loved by my little munchkin (17 months old).  She lives two hours away with her mother, who is in college, so I send these meals to her apartment so that she has them there, as well as when she's with me (every other week).  They may be a little costly and not on a college student's budget, but I'm happy to ensure that my little munchkin has healthy meals that she loves and that make her feel independent (she can feed them to hershelf).  The size of the meat and carrots and green beans are perfect for a toddler.

review/summary: Gerbs; the name says it all
review/text: This product is not good and varies in consistency.  The taste runs from a faint chemical (much like benzine) to stale, to an occasional nutty flavor.  I bought another brand at the same time to compare: Sweet Gourmet.  No comparison, spend the few extra dollars.  I've eaten about an half cup and I'm tossing the Gerbs.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was first introduced to these French Cherries in Kirsch Brandy at an upscale restaurant in my town.  They are delicious and way better than Maraschino cherries in cocktails and other uses.  I was delighted to find them on Amazon in this size and the smaller ones.  They keep forever, so I went with the big jar.

review/summary: Worth trying if you like Angostura
review/text: I bought two bottles of these bitters -- one for myself and one for a gift.  I use bitters almost exclusively in making Old Fashioneds.  My standard bitters is the ubiquitous Angostura product.  The Angostura has a milder flavor -- with the Fee Brothers you'll need to use about half as much or your drink will be, well, too bitter.  The taste is similar to the Angostura but different enough that you'll have to try it to see if you have a preference.<br /><br />The 12.8oz bottle is an excellent value, especially if you can get free shipping.  A 4oz bottle of Angostura is pushing $7 in local stores now and you need to use more of it.

review/text: I ordered these to arrive on my Husbands and my Anniversary. They came on the day, were packaged well and were healthy when the package was opened.  Not one flower or leaf was broken and there wasn't even any petals loose in the bottom of the box.<br />The box was marked "Fresh Flowers on the side with a warning to keep cool and out of direct sunlight.<br />These flowers were shipped on the 2nd of April and 5 days later they look better that when they arrived.  The flowers arrived fresh and healthy but most were in bud, today every single flower is open and still perfectly healthy.  They look as if they could live forever.<br />The bouquet itself is quite large with at least 25-30 blooms, 10 of those being large,single specimens such as lilies, carnations and asters, the rest is made up of smaller roses, asters, lilies and a wonderful mix of greenery.<br />I would most definitely buy again from Falcon Farms, these are among the best cut flowers I have ever bought.

But, when the flowers were received by my daughter, there was no bouquet but a box with a few flowers. I sensed the big disapointment of my daughter who was celebrating her 40th birthday.  I wanted to surprise her and I got her terribly disapointed instead.

review/text: Bai has continued to impress me with their beverages and the Tanzania Strawberry flavor is no exception. The strawberry drink tastes like the real fruit -  no artificial flavors here. And while the flavor taste real, it's not overpowering, just simply refreshing. As someone that typically drinks lots of coffee to get that caffeine, I have finally found a drink that delivers caffeine (with antioxidants to boot!) without a lingering stomachache afterwards. After drinking bai Tanzania Strawberry, I feel refreshed, energized and ready for my day. Great product.

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

review/summary: The Best Chai...
review/text: I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/summary: Superb Green Tea, Organic, Excellent!
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender.

review/summary: a bit disappointed...
review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/text: I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new "everyday" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days.

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/text: I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/text: This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!
