review/summary: Taste and consistency appear more to the real thing
review/text: I grew up in the tropics where the best shade at the beach is from a palm tree. Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.<br /><br />Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.<br /><br />I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)

review/summary: A refreshing natural taste..feels like straight from a tropical beach
review/text: No need to read reviews and search any more..the best coconut water is definitely from Zico! I am not surprised that this product is always on back order at Amazon. After all, it is so fresh, tastes purely natural, and is extremely refreshing, that anyone who tries it once will love it. We have been using it since last 4 months and have been so used to it that I had to use the "Subscribe n Save" option which beats the price of this product from everywhere else.<br />It comes well packaged and the containers are very easy to store, carry, and drink directly from the bottle. Love this product and highly recommend it!

review/summary: This stuff is great!
review/text: What this is:  coconut water - not coconut milk - flavored with chocolate.<br /><br />Coconut water is taken from green coconuts - they haven't had the time to form the meat or milk yet.  Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts.  It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories.  I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.<br /><br />This chocolate flavor is excellent imho.  It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.<br /><br />Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.<br /><br />Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.<br /><br />About me:  I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give "5"-star reviews.

review/summary: Only good if it's offered for a fair price!
review/text: Zico is a very mild green coconut water that lacks the sweetness of the Vita Coco brand. I mostly drink coconut water for the benefits so the specific taste range is broad for me. I don't like the floating prices on this site because when I purchased it, it was a good deal (especially coupled with free shipping). I've since seen the prices rise to almost double at times PLUS shipping sometimes which is severely unfair. I can find this at the supermarket so if it's not cheap enough here I'm not buying it. Bottom line!

review/summary: packaging seems good, changes to coconut water formulation not
review/text: Unfortunate that Zico natural coconut water was reformulated when this bottle was introduced. I like the convenience of the bottle, and find it easy to believe that the bottle is environmentally friendlier than the tetra pak, but the flavor of the coconut water is unpleasant--the kindest characterization I can come up with is "flat". Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging. A look at the nutrition information on the label makes it clear that there is a difference in the two products, though I haven't analyzed the changes. Will not be purchasing any more of this product.

review/summary: Coconut + Chocolate = Bliss!
review/text: I love coconut water in all its raw incarnations: Brazilian, Thai, Indian. I'm hit or miss with the fruit juice blended beverages of any brand. Along comes chocolate Zico. It doesn't seem right given the consistency and flavor of coconut water. Well, it is creamier in appearance than any other water or blend -- as it, well, should be. You wouldn't mistake this in a glass beside the plain variety. The flavor is rich, very cocoa and in surprising harmony with the coconut core of it all. I enjoy it because it tastes more like a treat than the regular and goes down smooth just in case I really need the hydrating lift! You've done juice blended coconut waters. Now try this. Be careful of price they really shouldn't be more than twenty dollars per case!

review/summary: I taste zero plastic, just great coconut water
review/text: I am amazed to see so may negative reviews. Best I can guess is that the bottles the negative reviewers tastes were mishandled somehow. Maybe they got too warm or something during shipping.<br /><br />I buy Zico Natural in the plastic bottle from my local grocery store all the time, and they are the closest thing to actual fresh coconut water I have found. I love fresh coconut water, and I absolutely hate anything that tastes like plastic or metal.<br /><br />In fact, I dislike most bottled or canned coconut water because of the off tastes, but I simply don't taste anything wrong with the Zico Natural in plastic bottes.<br /><br />Accuse me of working for Zico if you like, but as you can see I am a long time Amazon user and reviewer.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: Had come across a number of comments mentioning that the taste isn't the same as it used to be.<br /><br />I don't know how it tasted previously, but the contents of this packaging are perfectly fine in taste. I found that cooling the contents a bit tasted much better than consuming them at room temperature or chilling them.<br /><br />Also, the contents contain more sodium than water but, then again, you derive maximum benefit from coconut water if you use it as protection against dehydration or for replenishment, and not as a substitute for regular water. Also, drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade seemed to make me feel more bloated - so far, I have experienced nothing of that sort with Zico. Admittedly, carrying a Powerade bottle to the gym looks much more normal than carrying a Zico coconut water bottle :-)<br /><br />For what it's worth, my mom-in-law suffers from hyperacidity and has found the Natural variant of ZICO to be a blessing.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars because I haven't been consuming it for long to know what side effects there might be, and nothing beats real coconut water, right out of a tropical coconut.

review/text: This product is absolutely delicious. I purchased a case and received it in 2 days thanks to amazon prime. Its been less than 24 hours since I've had the Zico and I've already drank around 5 or 6 bottles. Its an excellent cure for dry mouth and is great for quick hydration. It is basically chocolate milk except not horrible for you. It may actually be better tasting than chocolate milk. There is some sugar which could be a concern for some people, but for people who consume it moderately and don't have health problems its hardly a concern.<br /><br />This beverage is best served cold, if not slightly frozen.

review/text: I really like Zico in the tetra pak. When I tried the bottled formula, I didn't realize that the formula was any different...I just thought it was a new bottle. My reaction to every sip was that it tasted and smelled very plastic-y. It seemed that sitting in the plastic bottle was imparting a plastic flavor to the drink. I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back! I then did a little research and realize that this is the new flavor of this formula using a new variety of coconut and from concentrate. I really don't like this new flavor at all. I will not be buying this product in the bottle again.

review/summary: Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!
review/text: Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is "natural" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to "optimize" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's "optimized" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to "optimize." (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under "Todd O'Connor". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by "Todd O'Connor" and under Alio "Alio"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio "Alio" confirming the fake identity.)

review/summary: Zico coconut water is great, but you may get a bad batch
review/text: I've ordered Zico Mango Coconut Water three times from Amazon. The first two times, the dozen I received were fine. This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a "slightly imperfect" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution.

review/text: I was fooled into getting this as BJ's because it was cheaper then the boxes, and there is a reason! It's not pure and it tastes like crap. It has a lot less Potassium in the 14 ounce bottom (569) compared to 700+ in the boxes that are 3 ounces smaller! Stick with the boxes, trust me!

review/summary: Not a good change
review/text: I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn't made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. It's as good as the old Zico was if not better.

review/summary: Tastes like Yoohoo, no kidding
review/text: I've been on the search for palatable coconut water for the last month or two and I finally found it in Zico's Dark Chocolate coconut water.  Every week, I would drive over to my local Whole Foods, pick up a few boxes of any brands I could find comparable flavors for and I always made sure to buy two or three at once to compare flavors.  Nothing ever really stuck taste-wise until I found this and it's absolutely delicious.  If you remember drinking Yoohoo as a kid, you'll recognize this taste immediately.  I don't know how Zico did it but this tastes identical to that chocolately smooth goodness of my youth but, you know, much healthier.  I will say though, it tastes much better cold -- as the bottle says -- but that doesn't mean it's bad when it's warm, it's just better cold, that's all.<br /><br />I also carry these to the gym and when I run obstacle course races, especially if I'm unsure of what the post-race rehydration drink will be (typically Powerade or Gatorade).  I honestly didn't think much to Zico's claims on their site and the bottle that it supports "rapid hydration", whatever that is, but I do know that its huge amounts of potassium have kept me from bonking after a race to maintaining my perk.  I typically pound one of these and one to two bananas or Larabars post-race and I've certainly jump started the recovery process better than I ever did with sports drinks or water alone.  After I'm done in the gym, I chug some Zico to cool off and wash the taste of electrolyte-flavored water out of my mouth.  I can definitely tell a difference in my moods after racing or lifting when I drink some coconut water versus when I'm just drinking water alone.<br /><br />For me, no brand can touch Zico in the taste department on this one.

review/text: Yes, it says "Made from 100% Natural from concentrate and added chemicals". Taste like combined un-natural stuff (chemicals), not even close to "Foco Coconut Juice, Jugo de coco", which is cheaper and more natural and better taste. Though I gave 2 stars because of the packaging. Decent and looks nice.

review/summary: A Good Mix Of Electrolytes After Heavy Workouts.
review/text: I recently discovered Coconut water to be available in a nearby grocery store so I've been trying several of the different flavors. The latest is Zico  Mango. It's all right. It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: 1 Liter for about the calories of a can of coke
review/text: First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water.  I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add.

I did a marathon in January and the chocolate Zico was my best friend during my training. Not only was it refreshing after my long runs, but I instantly felt rehydrated. I have told anyone that I meet to try it after long runs and they always come back and tell me how I was right. I have probably gotten at least 5 other runner's to be Zico drinkers :)

The only downside - having to stop yourself from downing a whole case of ZICO.

This stuff tastes amazing and doesn't taste "watery" or "watered down" at all. It's has a rich chocolate flavor and is basically a dairy-free way to enjoy chocolate milk. Plus it has all of those good electrolytes :)<br />Definitely worth a try!

review/text: And I gotta say......I like it!  I did a lot of research on coconut water before I purchased.  Zinco brand seemed to get better reviews, and people saying it actually has ALOT more electrolytes etc.  I have heard the benefits of drinking this versus Gatorade etc and wanted one that didn't taste like crap.  This is chocolate flavored.  Well , anything chocolate in my book is a winner.  the product arrived fast, and was packaged very well. I put a few in the refrigerator and in a couple hours, I tried one.  It didn't gag, or spit it out. It actually has a once taste to it.  Kinda like watered down chocolate milk.  Didn't taste any coconut flavor, just chocolate.  It filled me up, and seemed to make me have a little energy,  I plan on using these as after workout drinks, or even after too much  indulging in the wine, I think these would help!  Lol.  So I am pleased with the price, the packaging ( recycle) and the taste.  Also happy that this brand has been rated the best out of the top 3, for it's "quality".

review/text: Chocolate Zico is great!! Though I should start with the fact that we don't really enjoy Coconut Water as a whole.  The regular (non-flavored) is great mixed with OJ or in a smoothie, but the flavor is not that appealing.  I know people love the stuff, we just have not developed a taste for it yet.<br />The Chocolate however, is not like typical coconut water as it also has some coconut cream and yummy dark chocolate.  The flavor is reminicent to Yoohoo, but without that milky taste or concerns of lactose digestability.  It is rich tasting, but not heavy.  We often drink it after a Bikram Yoga class and it hits the spot.  Not knowing much about cocounut water and it's benefits, we are learning quickly, there are many.

I'd buy both Zico and O.N.E. again..but Zico was a little cheaper! great deal!

review/summary: Much better quality than competitors!
review/text: We saw a comparison of coconut water brands on Dr. Oz. At the time, we were subscribing to Vita Coco.<br /><br />Zico has the fresh taste and consistency of real natural coconut water, whereas Vita Coco has a taste that suggests it is not as fresh or not as pure. Zico is more like fresh-squeezed.<br /><br />The only reason we had purchased the Vita Coco brand initially was that it seemed more available in local stores (as a backup, we love you Amazon and would never ever go to the store if we didn't have to).<br /><br />Zico packaging was the same as VC in my opinion and has no issues. We ordered the 33.8-ounce 6-pack to make the cost much less comparable to VC's 12-pack of 11.1-ounce cartons, and that seems to have been a happy accident as a space-saver (for us) in the refrigerator. Now one container looks right instead of 3 or 4 of the other.

review/text: I love coconut water, but usually stay away from the flavored options. Tried this on a fluke, while in an airport, and thought it was delicious. It tastes very similar to a Yoohoo, if you're familiar with that drink. Not quite the "refreshing" taste that I think the plain coconut water has, but definitely a tasty beverage that I find enjoyable. If you like chocolate, this is a good beverage.

review/text: Flavourful coconut taste and in a sturdy-package...difficult to damage cardboard carton....however, every two or three shipments brought a plastic top with damage or the collar where the plastic meets the cardboard separated and leaking.  Amazon is wonderful about replacements, but it's a shame the container isn't a bit more dependable.  I do recommend Zico as my second best choice....Amy and Brian being first, but talk about damaged containers!!  Had to cancel my purchases from Amy and Brian due to so many cans being dented and mangled.

review/summary: Really icky stuff. Go with the Tetra-Paks instead
review/text: I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of "natural flavors", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA">ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks.

review/text: The coconut water tastes good, it's like most other coconut waters on the market. Good coconut flavor, a little salty from the electrolytes, but overall pretty good.<br /><br />The pineapple "flavor" however, ruins it. At the price I bought it for, $6 on Amazon Warehouse, I'd buy it again, because coconut water is usually fairly expensive and the stuff is still decent, but the pineapple is like a bad afterthought, like your in-laws staying over for a week and then telling you they'll be here 2 more nights.

review/text: I don't think I would want to drink it daily as it's a little on the sweeter side. If I keep it room temperature and then pour over crushed ice it tastes just like chocolate milk which is novel as I don't consume any dairy. I don't think I would like it without being over ice, though. My kids use coconut water for workout recovery drink. Thought they might like this for a change but both find it too sweet to drink straight from the bottle.

I bought several brands and flavors and tried them.  I found the Zico to be the best tasting, and I really like the chocolate.  This stuff has great electrolytes and way more potassium than a banana ([...]).<br /><br />I keep them in the refrigerator and chug one after my runs.  If I run a race or drive to my runs, I often stick a couple in a small cooler to drink afterward.<br /><br />The price here is less than my local grocery store, and you can't beat Amazon Prime shipping.

This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There's also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth!

review/text: Starting off- I hate the taste of coconut water. I like coconuts, coconut milk and things that are flavored with coconut, but the water is aweful! I have been only drinking the chocoloate coconut water (which is mixed w/a little coconut cream), but at 110 calories and sugars added I decided that I need to expand my horizons. I did hesitate b/c I read many of the reviews and some people received bad batches (if I were this person, I would have definately contacted the company)- however my batch was good! And while this doesn't taste like the chocolate coconut water (which tastes like slightly watery chocolate milk), this is pretty decent and I will continue my subscription.

review/text: I ordered this looking at one show on TV which said this product has lot more vitamins and minerals as compared to other brands. I drink a lot of coconut water after exercising. When I tasted it for the first time, the taste of zico was weird; it tastes like plastic mixed with coconut water- but it does not actually have any plastic. It is just that the coconut water has a different taste. It is not sweet and tastes very bland. But after trying out 12 bottles, I found my older brand to be very sweet. My husband likes Zico better so I guess I am going to alternate the subscription between Zico and the other brand.

We bought a coconut maybe once a year.  Now it's readily available all over New York City.  I have tried all of the flavors and in my opinion the Mango is by far my favorite.  It is a wonderful balance between staying true to a real coconut water flavor and taste with a compliment of Mango flavor.  I am a huge fan.  I feel a burst of energy every time I drink it and it tastes so great.  When I have it in stock at home, I drink more of it than tap water.

review/summary: Zico deserves ZERO STARs
review/text: I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as "Pure Premium Coconut Water" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is "Plastic".<br /><br />I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for "Vita Coco".<br /><br />I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is "vent it out" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.<br /><br />BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me.

review/text: I've never been a big "health nut" and but when a "health nut" friend of mine had me try a Zico coconut water drink (plain) I was under the continued opinion that stuff that's "healthy" for us isn't healthy for the tongue (i.e. taste).  It wasn't until I was at the local supermarket and tried the Zico Chocolate Coconut Water and fell in love with my first "health drink".<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that you try this great drink before supplies run out!  It's a very popular drink and according to the agriculture website coconuts are becoming harder to get because of the broadened use of coconut water and milk.  So as I said TRY it before they run out.

review/text: I love coconut water... and I love chocolate and putting them together only seemed like a match made in heaven. The first time I tried it I became hooked but once you are 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through the 12pk I felt like I may have had enough of it and wanted just plain coconut water. I definitely like the chocolate flavor but it is more of "I need to be in the mood" type of thing rather than being able to drink it daily like I can with plain.

review/summary: Clean, fresh taste to me
review/text: This is the only coconut water that I really like. I have tried others but they almost made me sick. This has a fresh clean taste that I really like. I hope all the batches stay the same.

review/summary: Great refreshment after exercise
review/text: I got a sample of this at a local running competition a couple years back and they've had me hooked ever since.  Totally refreshing after a run, definitely prefer the flavored to the plain (the plain takes a bit milky to me).

review/summary: Some Liked It, Some Didn't
review/text: I really liked this coconut water and got to drink all of them myself without hiding any in back of the old bottles of salad dressing because the rest of the family didn't care for them.

review/summary: Chocolate is the best flavor, besides the original of course
review/text: Although some compare this flavor to chocolate milk, it goes down much smoother (less creamy, more refreshing like coconut water). Bonus, it has less fat and sugar than chocolate milk!

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: While I love chocolate, I normally do not like chocolate flavored things. You know, things that aren't chocolate but are meant to taste like chocolate, such as chocolate Bonne Bell Lip Smackers, chocolate flavored Skittles, and cheap "chocolate" easter candy. I thought this would taste like super-watery chocolate milk and kept the first bottle I bought in the fridge for a month because I was too scared to try it, but I was completely wrong. It's delicious!!! If I had to describe the taste, it would be like melted dark chocolate gelato with a hint of coconut. I work at a small, outrageously overpriced local grocery store and we are selling it there for 2 dollars over the price of the per unit adjustment of a case here on Amazon (though I bought my bottle at one of those trendy chain health food stores for 1 dollar more over Amazon's price). So buy one bottle to see if you like it, and order the rest on Amazon. These prices can't be beat.

review/text: This stuff is amazing.  Somewhat healthy and tastes like a chocolate shake.  Recommend buying if you like coconut.  Shake it up good, though.
