review/summary: my favorite white chocolate
review/text: I've tried over 20 different white chocolate bars and this is my favorite by a good margin. My search for good white chocolate began years ago when I realized the caffeine in dark chocolate would sometimes give me a migraine. White chocolate has much less caffeine that dark chocolate but its also a struggle to find a tasty white chocolate bar--they just don't get the same love dark chocolate does. Most white chocolate doesn't taste like chocolate (rather they taste like vanilla and sugar) but this white chocolate has a distinct, rich chocolatey flavor. Its not the same flavor as dark chocolate but its a great flavor in its own right. Its my favorite white chocolate so far.

The chunk light they make is slightly better. 1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style. I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can. When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time. DON'T BUY.

review/summary: Delicious, but pricey
review/text: It is delicious.  Just what you'd expect...they picked the very best peppers and aged them longer.  The sauce is a little thicker than the traditional Tabasco.  It really is magnificent, but not at this price.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've consumed $25 worth of hot sauce in a little over two weeks (5 ounces).  I would spend another $25 for a special occasion, or another keep sake/display item for my kitchen, but it's not priced for ongoing consumption.  Perhaps there's a middle ground?  Something a step or two above the original version?  But then again, I'm very happy with the original.  I would surprised to find someone who loved Tabasco more than I do.<br /><br />P.S.  I just realized that you can get the "undressed" 5oz bottle (without the wax seal and chain around it) of the reserve for $10 at the tabasco website.  Well worth it.  I wish I had know before I ordered 2 of the wax/chain versions on Amazon (one for consuming and the other for display and consumption years from now).

review/summary: Had to try
review/text: Being a hot sauce aficionado I had to try Tabasco's specialty version of it's venerable sauce.  Yes, I go and try dozens  of sauces a year - based on mango, carrot, tomato.... including jalapeno, serrano, cayenne, ghost, jolokia, habanero... but there is something about original Tabasco that keeps it a staple in the fridge next to all my exotic sauces.  So, again, I saw this version of Tabasco and jumped, despite the price.  It was worth trying but I was somewhat disappointed that it had only the most subtle difference in taste from original, mainline Tabasco.  It is a nice difference - a sort of mellowness behind the vinegar bite.  I'm glad I tried it, but after it runs out I'm back to original.

review/text: I purchased this fas a gift for someone who likes licorice and had high expectations based on some of the reviews.  It had a nice tart apple aroma but unfortunately the taste did not live up to the smell.  Not particularly sweet or tart and we both found it had a chalky mouth feel as it dissolved with a little bit a a chemical aftertaste.  I personally found that my tongue stung a little bit after I ate the piece.  Of course, taste is a subjective thing, so to each their own but I am sending it back.  Also, the bag had a tiny hole which I discovered after the fact, so the product may also have been a little stale.

review/summary: YUM!  smoooooooth chocolate
review/text: I have never been a fan of anything but milk chocolate.  Having embraced a low-carb lifestyle, however, I decided to try dark and bittersweet varieties since they have a much lower sugar content.  I went through quite a few brands, and many dollars, and most were just TOOOO bitingly bitter for my tastebuds - until I happened upon the Perugina at, of all places, my local produce market, owned by some very nice Korean folks.<br /><br />This is the best dark variety of chocolate I've eaten at ANY price.  I break off two squares (it's conveniently scored) which amounts to approx. .3 ounce, and let each one melt in my mouth.  The texture is silky smooth and the bittersweet is not TOO bitter!<br /><br />There may be more discerning tastebuds out there but for my taste this is perfect.

review/text: Does it taste better than cinnamon toast crunch? Honestly probably not. Does it taste amazing in milk? YES, it is the best waffle crisp imitation in milk that we have. For someone who has been missing waffle crisp for years, this is something great.<br /><br />It is hard on the roof of the mouth if you do not let it get wet first, so be sure to let it get as soggy as you can stand first.<br /><br />Since eating this more, I have to add that I think this tastes a lot better with soy milk (plain flavor) than real milk. It mixes a lot better that way in my opinion, and I like soy milk and "real" milk about equally just drinking either.

It really reminds me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQN6K">Cookie Crisp Cereal, 11.25-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4ATQ">Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a> still has the best cinnamon flavor. It's pretty expensive, too. I probably won't buy it again.

review/summary: Nice strong lavender flavor
review/text: I use this for making lavender bread which turns out amazing every time. (I also use it on chicken, making my own Herbes de Provence blend). It's just a nice consistent flavorful lavender, from box to box. I like that it's organic but especially that  Spicely owns all of its own facilities, so there's no chance of cross-contamination (with nuts, soy, or gluten, for example).<br /><br />The boxes are pretty small, so I go through a lot of them. (A larger 8-16 ounce container would be MUCH APPRECIATED to reduce the wasteful packaging) But excellent quality is never cheap. I'm glad to pay extra for a very good product. I used to live near near lavender fields where this sort of product was easily purchased in small family-owned shops. It's harder to find in stores or over the internet. So I'm thrilled to have discovered Spicely.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good concept...inconsistant design.
review/text: We use pretzel M&Ms in this for our three year olds during potty training.  It works 85% of the time.  Sometimes the M&Ms get stuck in the spiral.  The problem is that there is no way to get into the spiral part of the machine to get them loose.  There were a couple times where the M&M got stuck and we thought it would render the entire machine useless but we played around with it and luckily, it came out.  The coin mechanism is also inconsistant.  85% of the time, when you put a coin in it works.  Sometimes though, you have to turn it twice.

When you open the pack you have to restrain you self from sniffing it up your nose. I keep the open pack in the frig; not like I have to as the family plows through a pack a week. For store bought coffee this rivals some of the more exotic sourced coffee.

Usually drink shots, not mixed, so the pure espresso flavor is important. I have tried some beans from small roasters that I like a bit better, but they are MUCH more expensive than these and not worth the extra cost on a daily basis.

I had half a bar before my run tonight and half a bar after and it felt light on my stomach and I had steady energy throughout.<br /><br />So many energy bars out there are full of junk (and things I'm allergic to) and this is natural, portable and is nicely sweet - like the fruit that it is. Very minimal ingredients - fruit and chia seeds. A GREAT option for anyone trying to keep with whole foods. I also love the chia in it  - the crunch is nice and I feel good eating chia, so it's a bonus for me.<br /><br />Drink a little water with anything with chia in it as they absorb water. A great product - I will be taking a whole bunch of these with me for the marathon and to have handy for training! Seems like a healthy option for kids, too - softer than a fruit leather and not too sweet. Grateful to be finding more healthy products out there like this.

review/summary: Allergen Friendly
review/text: DISCLAIMER: Since I am not anaphylactic to corn, I cannot say whether they are safe enough for someone who is.<br /><br />I recently found these FruitChia Bars at Whole Paycheck for just under two bucks a bar and decided to buy one of each flavor to test them out.  These are pretty tasty bars with a little crunch from the chia seeds.  If you have some gaps in your teeth or a lot of dental work, these little chia seeds may get stuck and you might find yourself digging them out afterward.  Chia seeds are similar in size to poppy seeds.<br /><br />I am intolerant to corn and all its derivatives.  I have found I feel better when I also avoid all grains, dairy, yeast, soy and other legumes, (chicken) eggs, potatoes, and refined sugars.  That makes finding any prepackaged food that is also safe for me, a rarity.  I'm currently trialing these and haven't noticed any reaction, but I'm not as reactionary as many other of my corn allergic friends.  For now, I would say if there are any corn derivatives used in the manufacturing, processing, or packaging, it's minimal, so anyone who calls themselves "corn light" (able to handle some small traces and cross contaminations) would probably be okay trialing these.  My son reacts to gluten more so than any of his other multiple food intolerances, and he has been fine with these as well.

review/text: Great idea to add L-Theanine, Lemongrass extract, Ginseng, and Gingko Biloba into a tasty carbonated drink. L-Theanine is derived from tea leaves, and seems to be the newest trend for people that want to just chill. The price is a little expensive to drink on a regular basis, but the 4 pack is more reasonably priced (I'd buy cases if I were a millionaire). I've only tried the Tropical Chill flavor, and can tell you that this is dabomb. I'm pretty positive though that one day this formula will be mainstream, and replicated like the energy drinks have been. This drink really will take the edge off, and make you feel less anxious. The Chill Group out of California will always be remembered by me as the pioneers of this refreshing drink that helps you "just chill".

review/text: I needed a very good product for my dogs in the Vetri-Science Glyco-Flex Stage II joint support.  This product came highly recommended from my Vet.  I reviewed the Amazon site for what I thought was a good price when the Ad showed 2 bottles of the product.  I thought I was getting two bottles for the price.  I only received One bottle.  I wrote the company customer Services who agreed that the two bottles was misleading and they would get back to me the next day after she talked to her supervisor.  That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response, even after 3 other emails from me.  This company is very, very poor in customer service as well and misleading in their ads.  I believe that Amazon is partially at blame for this problem and that this company should no longer be able to sell their products from Amazon Market.  Avoid PetFoodDirect.com because you will get taken.

review/text: This gum still has all the "grape-like flavor" I remember from my childhood.  The box was shipped inside a sealed cellophane over-wrap.  So, if you want to get more than 1 box it will stay fresh.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product. The freshness is nothing compared to what you would find in the grocery store, and my kitchen was filled with the fragrance when I ground a tablespoon in a mortar and pestle for a dish I was preparing. I also ordered several other herbs and spices from this company and was not disappointed in any of them.

review/summary: Made my dog sick; $400 vet bill.
review/text: I bought these for my 3 month-old lab. I also bought some other treats (dehydrated liver, Kong biscuits, bully sticks). 1-2 days after feeding these to my lab she got violently ill -- vomiting and diarrhea. Took her to the vet and after an overnight stay and IV fluids, the vet had no idea what it was. They decided to x-ray her to see if something was blocking her intestines. Nothing. After antibiotics and rest she was back to her normal high energetic self. I gave her more of these sweet potato fries about a week after her first sickness episode.... and 24 hrs later she was vomiting again.  I was worried, but figured that it must be something I was feeding her. I then examined the package and saw these are made in China.  I threw them out and my puppy has been fine since. Logic points to these treats.... I will no longer buy food items for my dog from China. Nobody else has posted anything about ill reactions to these treats, but search around, lots of dog treats from China are making our dogs sick.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: I got a dog from the SPCA a few months ago, and learned that in addition to being slightly overweight, he also requires a grain-free diet due to allergies. He also can't have chicken and a few other things, which makes it hard to find treats I can give him. My vet suggested these, since she gives them to her own dogs. My little guy loves them! They're also low calorie, so I can provide them liberally without worrying. I have since shared some with friends, and their dogs love them, too. I have seen these in my local pet shop for a few dollars more, so I think the price is good. I've gone through a couple of containers by now and my dog still comes running for them when I say "treat!". Highly recommend these.

review/summary: Not the same quality as previous purchases
review/text: I used to buy these from Amazon at least 2-3 times a month.  The last 2 shipments were hard as a rock and the potatoes looked like plastic.  I definitely did not give these to my shih tzu. The treats used to be softer and you could tear them into smaller pieces.  The last ones I received I couldn't even cut with a knife.  I won't be buying these any more until I start seeing some positive reveiws.

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA!
review/text: These are manufactured in China.<br /><br />While my little Maltese absolutely loves these, I can no longer risk his life by buying anything for him to eat that is made in China.  It seems that every couple of months in the news, there is a new set of canine deaths being reported by owners who fed their dog(s) food or treats manufactured in China.  It is really scary.<br /><br />My dog is like family to me.  I'm not going to risk his life or a huge vet bill to save a buck or two on food made in China by a culture of people that lace toys they sell us with lead and other harmful chemicals.

review/summary: My 7 dogs LOVE them!
review/text: After reading the negative review about the person's dog getting ill from these, I had to add my own 2 cents.  Like that person, I never buy anything made outside of the US for my dogs.  Until I bought these, on accident.  I can sympathize with his dog getting ill -- but I have 7 dogs and they all love these and have never gotten sick.  I keep the jar (love that it's a jar) by the door as a potty treat reward.  They love them.  I have all different breeds and sizes.  Even a bulldog with a sensitive tummy.  She has no problem with these.  These are the only treats I will buy from another country.  They're healthy, low calorie and my dogs will come inside from way back in the yard for these!<br /><br />Update 11/28/11:  Ordered my third jar of these and they were hard as a rock.  Not fresh and pliable as the first two jars.  Contacted Amazon CS, who wanted me to return them for credit.  Too much of a hassle...I tossed them.  Not buying these anymore.  Switching to another brand. Freshness date was many months away so it wasn't a rotate stock issue.  Changed my star rating from 5 stars to 1 star.

review/summary: If theyre Hard, Try this
review/text: i'm noticing some people complaining that in recent times the sweet potato treets are coming "hard as a rock"...i too have gotten them that way and frankly don't understand why one shipment can be perfect while another can be so "off", but Ive figured out a way i can still give them to my dogs and they can still enjoy them and they don't go to waste (frankly they're too expensive to) ... have 2 dogs, so i usually give them 2-3 sticks each per serving. i take them put them in a small bowl put enough water in the bowl so they are floating and then microwave them for exactly 22 seconds, then let them sit for about a minute, afterward i swirl them around in the bowl , them drain out the hot water and then put some cold water in the bowl to cool them down, drain again, dry them a little on a paper towel and then give them to the dogs...they actually like them better this way, they're still chewy but warm and softer. You might give it a try.

review/text: Our dog really likes these treats. We used to buy another brand of dried sweet potato fries, but they apparently have quit making the sweet-potato only treats.  The Beefeaters brand dried sweet potato fries have the consistency of stiff leather, so our dog actually chews them instead of swallowing them whole.

review/text: My pup has been eating these since she was just 8 weeks old and she LOVES them (she's 5 months now).  I cut them up into bite-sized pieces and that way it lasts forever.  These treats are also very chewy so your dog actually has spend some time to eat these instead of snarfing them down.  That's probably the best part of these, to me.
