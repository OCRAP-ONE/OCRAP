review/summary: Flavorful and filling
review/text: I don't even like vanilla flavoring.  I'm more of a chocolate shake kind of guy.  But I have to say this was quite delicious.  Almost like it shouldn't be good for you!<br /><br />The last protein shake I had was grainy, but this Gatorade Shake was the complete opposite.  Extremely smooth and rich.  Filled me right up without any bloating or indigestion, as these kinds of shakes can do sometimes.<br /><br />I'll have to drink a few more to know if there's any improvement in my health.<br /><br />For now, a big thumbs-up on this shake!

review/summary: AS GOOD AS A SODA FOUNTAIN SHAKE
review/text: Remember how good a soda fountain milk shake used to taste?  Creamy, rich, absolutely delicious.  Wish you had one now?  Well, there is something that is just as mouth-watering  and that's Gatorade Nutritive Shake.<br /><br /> Plus, this shake contains carbohydrate protein and vitamins that my fondly remembered shake did not.  It not  only tastes good but it's good for you.  I'm going to keep it on hand for those days when I can't stop for lunch or have to zip out of the house without breakfast.<br /><br /> However, I still miss soda fountains!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Too many calories!
review/text: Taste: The taste was very appealing. It was very flavorful and sweet and had the texture of a vanilla milkshake. In terms of performance/protein drinks, this ranks very highly compared to the rest of the competition.<br /><br />Packaging: The packaging was a little lacking. The overall design on the can was pretty appealing, however, instead of printing on the can, the printing was on a plastic sheet wrapped around the can. This caused it to interfere with the mouth of the can and plastic was able to work its way inside my mouth.<br /><br />Size: The size was 11 fluid ounces, which seemed a little bit small for a post workout shake, depending on how rigorous your routine is. In general, it is a pretty good compliment to a high protein meal post workout.<br /><br />Nutrition: This product has a very high calorie content compared to what it offers in protein. It has almost 400 calories against only about 20 grams of protein. If you are just starting out and are looking to put on weight quickly, this would probably be a very good place to start. However, I would not recommend this product to those trying to build lean muscle.<br /><br />Overall: I would say this product would do well for those trying to put on weight quickly. It's high calorie content against a decent amount of protein makes it a pretty good weight-gainer. However, if you are either trying to lose fat or put on lean muscle, I would not recommend use of this product.

review/summary: great drink but.....
review/text: I drink these drinks after a work out and they are great! I went ahead and ordered about ten cans the other day and they arrived on time. The only thing is almost all the cans are about to expire. That is the biggest problem is they send older cans so you can't order a lot at a time. Love the drink but not sure we will order this drink from amazon again because of this.

review/summary: I Drink This Milkshake!
review/text: These Gatorade nutrition shakes are easily the best tasting energy/nutrition/protein shakes I've ever tasted. The consistency is nice and smooth with zero chalkiness, which most energy shakes are ruined by. This one is just perfect as far as flavor and consistency.<br /><br />To other reviewers saying the shakes have too many calories and not enough protein: these are not intended specifically as protein shakes. That's why they're called "Nutrition" shakes. If you want a specific protein shake, there are many of them available. I look at these as a light meal replacement or as an after work out energy replacement.<br /><br />An interesting note: The cans are made of steel not aluminum; they are much heavier and stronger than aluminum cans which means they can be stored in a gym back and not accidentally get burst open.

review/summary: Light on the stomach!
review/text: For decades, Gatorade is synonomous with sports, athletes, performance,  health, hydration and nutrients and vitamins.  If your intention is to use it as a higher level like sports training, performance, endurance, energy, etc.,  then this is the product for you.  If your level is for just fitness and exercise, then this can only be a great enhancement.<br /><br />The shakes provided by Gatorade are not thick, so it's not quite the "shake" feel, athough it is very tasty being that it is specially made for athletes, etc.<br /><br />For me, interested in only fitness and exercise, I will maximize with the protein benefit as a quick meal enhancement.  I like the low gram of fat, and no trans fat.  For others who need the specified amount of nutrients, this is sufficient.  This is tasty!!  Rizzo

review/summary: Tastes good!
review/text: The drink tasted  pretty good (a bit like liquid white chocolate), but at 370 calories a serving/can you want to be doing some pretty serious exercise as that represents about 20% of a typical calorie intake. it also contains 1.5 grams (8% RDA) of saturated fat and 1.5 mg (5% RDA) of cholesterol, so you might need to consider this if you are watching your intake of these. the main ingredients  are water, sugar  (28g) and protein (20g).<br /><br />If you are doing some serious training this is a compact source of energy to keep you going.<br /><br />I dropped a star because of the saturated fat, cholesterol and high calorie content.

review/summary: Make My Protein Shaken, Not Stirred
review/text: To be honest, I expected this to taste terrible, so I was pleasantly surprised when I cracked open the can after leaving it in my fridge overnight and shaking it well before opening it, that it did indeed taste like a slightly melted vanilla shake.<br /><br />I work out 3-4 times a week and find on those days after working out that I will be hungry quite quickly as my metabolism is set on high for hours afterwards, but I don't want to over eat. I could see this shake as a great option for those times. While I was only given one sample can to try, so can't attest to long term effectiveness, I can say that it is a tasty, filling shake, (it should be for 370 Calories) that would be a good option for someone to consume after working out or playing a fast paced sport.

review/text: This product gets 3 stars from the taste alone. Most protein shakes taste like chalk mixed with milk. But this one has a very good taste that makes you want to drink more of it. It is high in protein o it would be a great drink to have after a rigorous workout. The biggest downfall for the product is it has a lot of sugar in it. I try to avoid a lot of sugar so this wouldn't be the drink for me.

review/summary: revv  is my new favorite
review/text: I used to be a big fan of Jet Fuel but I found it to be a little bitter. I ordered revv as part of a promotion with Keurig and I am amazed at how good this coffee is.<br />It definitely has the same kick as Jet Fuel but it's sooo smooth. I didn't think a coffee this strong could be this smooth. I love it.<br />I was worried when I ordered 2 boxes  in a buy 2 get 2 deal. I thought "what if I don't like it?" But I went ahead to balance the order out. Now I'm sorry I didn't get 4 boxes of the stuff.<br />If you like your coffee with a kick, you've gotta' try this. If you want a bigger kick try the revv pulse. (My caffeine addiction hasn't escalated to pulse levels yet)<br /><br />Kuerig Owners make sure to register your brewer with [...] and become eligible for a buy 2 get 2 purchase. It's an excellent deal.

I've used this as a substitute in recipes when calling for brown sugar (and have had to guess a bit about quantity) and it has worked well. I recently made a pumpkin bread using it and the whole family enjoyed! Warning: the bottle top does get sticky and feels a bit crumbly from the honey that can remain on it. To avoid this I have stopped using the flip top and simply remove the top entirely to measure out the honey I need.

review/text: I bought this honey substitute and a bottle of Nature's Hollow Honey Substitue for a side-by-side comparison with Honey Tree Imitation Honey, which I have used for years. I believe this product has a slightly slimy texture and "mouth-feel". It also lacked the pronounced honey flavor I find in the Honey Tree. Although it does not cause the gas "problem" that can occur with large comsumption of Honey Tree, I believe I will stay with Honey Tree. Note: I have used Honey Tree as a base for pecan pie (instead of Karo syrup) and it was just okay. Excess gas was a definite problem as I always eat a large slice of pecan pie. I intend to make a pie with the Natrazyle. If it is better than the Honey Tree I will report back.

review/text: Seeing that this is a chocolate bar, you would think the first ingredient is cocoa, but no it's not. I bit into the bar and taste sour and moldy. It doesn't even smell right. I didn't taste any chocolate. The term "milk chocolate'' is misleading. Actually, milk chocolate is 90% milk, milk fat, sugar, and soy Lecithin. The rest is cocoa, artificial flavors, and preservatives. The U.S. government only requires 10% concentration of chocolate liquor in milk chocolate bars. And Hershey, for your information, has reformulated their chocolate products to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier, which makes it taste even worse.

review/summary: hershey's milk chocolate bars, pack of 36.
review/text: Unfortunately the Hershey bars arrived melted and i had to throw them out. The special "packing" was completely melted and, naturally, did not preserve the candy. It was a somewhat expensive lesson for me to learn. I did notify the seller but never heard back from anyone.

However, when the price was calculated, e very high shipping cost did not appear until the very last click. For some reason, I did not see how much it was and I paid $50  for shipping just 3 bottles!  Because of this, I won't be ordering again.  My fault for not triple checking.  The items were as described and were delivered safely, it is just the high cost of shipping that would prevent me from re-ordering.

review/summary: Best tasting whole wheat pasta I have found, but expensive
review/text: A lot of phobias about whole wheat pasta tasting horrible can be put to rest with this pasta. It has a nice smooth texture unlike other brands that are reminiscent of tree bark.<br /><br />On a diet? This pasta will FILL you up! You wont want to go back for seconds. I could easily eat twice as much white pasta.<br /><br />The only reason your not buying this pasta is because it costs more. You are correct this pasta is 5x more expensive than good old white pasta. Here is a little hint: (buy in bulk) Thats what I did. Amazon has this pasta in cases of 12 that sell for 30% less than what my local mega-mart charges.<br /><br />Until I find another whole wheat pasta that is cheaper and tastes as good as this one. I will not buy any other brand.<br /><br />Update May 2012<br />Still the best pasta. My local grocer finally dropped their prices on this product to a realistic level. Buying in bulk online is still cheaper, but just be mindful as prices fluctuate. I really wish they made more shapes in this pasta, like orzo or pastina.

To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.<br /><br />One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!

review/text: As part of my healthy eating plan, I gave up eating anything made from processed flour.  Bread and cereal weren't a problem -- lots of good whole grain alternatives available -- but great whole wheat pasta has been elusive. My main complaints: its general mushiness, even when cooked according to direction; and its bland texture.<br />The DaVinci brand, most notably the penne, is my new favorite.  It has a rich taste and a nice texture, and it seems to resist the mushies, particularly if you cook it al dente.  Delicious.<br /><br />And best of all: Amazon delivers a case of it to my door every three months.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I first remember Martinelli"s Apple Juice from the days when we used to use Martinelli's Sparkling apple juice as a non-alcoholic toast at Thanksgiving dinners. It was bright, fresh tasting and delicious. More recently, my wife bought a case of the 10-ounce bottles at our local warehouse store. We found out that our toddler loved the stuff. My wife wanted to pick up another case, but it was gone and hasn't returned as yet. So what are you gonna do? Well, it's available in other sizes, so today she came home with a couple 1.5 liter bottles. It's not as handy as the small bottles, but we'll make do. The important thing is the juice. She regards the bottle as important in that it is PBA free and that's important for the little one. She also likes fruit juices that are pure juice, especially if they are not from concentrate and have no added ingredients. Martinelli's Apple Juice fits her requirements. Plus, it's delicious.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I did my research and felt that this was worth a shot. It quickly cleared up the infection and quickly healed my wound.<br />Fast forward 3 years and I have surgery to repair a broken leg. Unfortunately my incision opens and instead of spending hundreds of dollars on prescription treatment, I went ahead and ordered this product. After using it for a few days my incision has completely closed. If there was a ever a miracle product, this would be it.

review/summary: Pretty amazing stuff
review/text: Great for abrasions.  Kept a slow healing/nonhealing venus ulcer on my father's leg infection free and actually healed it.  He had it for years and all the stuff the doctor's prescribed from the specialized wound care center hadn't been able to heal it.  Lots of stuff now on the market which may not be as good.  Read carefully about Manuka Honey and the various stuff that is being sold.  Seems like many companies have jumped on it and I'm not sure all are as pure or really from New Zealand Manuka "bee farms".

review/summary: Miracle Cure
review/text: I purchased this after doing research on burns. I was trying to heal a second degree and third degree burn - the antibiotic ointment wasn't working after almost two weeks. As a last resort, before possibly needing a skin graft, I purchased this item specifically because it is UMF certified by the UMF Association - THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you're going to try Munuka Honey for its healing properties. The item you buy must be on the list of certified companies which can be found on the UMF Association site. I paid for it to be overnighted so as not to loose one more day of possible healing - it came right on time and after only four full days the skin looks amazing! It's not only soft and smooth but the wound has filled in, no more deep crevasses, blistering or peeling. Will continue to use until the skin is completely healed - so glad it came in a two pack! This not only saved my skin, healed the burn but seems to be creating a field where almost no scarring, dare I say no scarring, will be visible! YAHOO!

review/summary: The commonest hing
review/text: Unfortunately, this is the only asafoetida (hing) that is readily available in the US. It is preground and mixed with edible adulterants to make it easier to handle. Unfortunately, due to this processing, the quality is not high. While it will certainly work for your recipe, it is nowhere as good as the chunks of pure sap that are harder to find in the US. Search out the good stuff if you know a reputable spice merchant.<br /><br />If you're in NYC, I've found better quality hing at Dual Specialty Store in the East Village. It's still not as good as the super stinky chunks of Afghani asafoetida that I picked up in Varanasi, but it will do.

review/summary: Does stink before cooking, but tastes and smells great after!
review/text: Well, I really love this spice because I was told to avoid garlic and onions for the next six months by my doctor. I didn't think I was going to be able to make it through life without the two main flavors that are in just about everything. I did some research and found this spice was used by buddhists as a replacement for garlic and onions. I decided if it works for them it should definetly work for me. And it does! Just a pinch in the skillet with a little olive oil flavors anything I cook in it so nicely. The smell is VERY strong, but only before you cook with it. After it is in the oil or food you are cooking it mellows out to a nice onion/garlicy scent and taste. I didn't try it dry because the smell is so pungent it is a little intimidating, but my husband did and said it isn't bad. I use it for salad dressings and anything that just can't do without garlic. I am very happy with the purchase although I have so much of it from buying in bulk on Amazon I may be looking for an airtight container to put it in now!

review/summary: The Best You Can Give Your Dog--If You've Not Earning Minimum Wage
review/text: This food is fantastic. I used it for a year then switched to a holistic, premium brand dry kibble (Wysong), and am now considering going back to Dr. Harvey's. This is why:<br /><br />1--On Dr. Harvey's, there was less poop, it was practically odorless, and healthy and firm (the higher quality food you give your dog, the less it stinks and the less comes out. I've noticed a huge difference now that we're on kibble.)<br /><br />2--It gives your dog a variety of food. Every time you make a new batch, you rotate the protein source--chicken, beef, scrambled eggs, turkey, fish, and even chickpeas and lentils (both of which our dogs LOVED!) and a different oil source (flax oil, fish oil, olive oil, sesame oil). I know people have done it for years, but it just can't be completely healthy to feed your pet the same exact thing day after day, year after year. There's just something very counter-intuitive about that...<br /><br />3--My dogs' breath was better on Dr. Harvey's--no joke! I brush my dogs' teeth every night and I can tell that it's gotten worse since we stopped feeding them Dr. Harvey's (and nothing's changed in the brushing).<br /><br />Now, I should let you know why we switched from Dr. Harvey's in the first place:<br /><br />1--It is a little on the expensive side. You can rotate with cheaper protein sources (lentils or chickpeas for $1/lb or eggs) to make it more affordable some weeks, but dogs need MEAT, and the only kind worth buying--that doesn't come from horrific living conditions and is not pumped with hormones--is expensive (though for good reason--watch "Food, Inc."). I found boiling whole chickens made it more affordable ($4/lb) than deboned chicken breasts ($8/lb), but they still need that beef, and that we couldn't get that too often for them. (Ethical turkey is expensive, too.)<br /><br />2--It's a bit high maintenance (my husband would say 'very'). There were several times we ran out and I had to go to the store, come back and cook up a batch for my hungry dogs (1 hour after 'asking' for it...). Now that we're on kibble it's so simple and convenient, and our dogs go hungry less often.  (Note: if you are more organized than me--which is likely--you probably wont run into this problem :) Also--you could also do this differently--we weighed out each and every portion we gave our dogs (one got 7.5oz, one got 4.5oz per meal), and that also added some time. Also, it takes 10 minutes to defrost it if it's frozen and you didn't defrost ahead of time. Dr. Harvey's also added more dishes (for the cooking, the measuring), which is tough living in a small, NYC dishwasher-less apartment.<br /><br />Those two last points aside, I kind of miss our Dr. Harvey's days. It always deeply warmed my heart to feed my dogs 'real' food that was so colorful (peas, carrots, spinach, beets!) and that smelled sooo good! We'll see--if their 'conditions' don't improve (bad breath, softish stool, itchiness), we might go back to Dr. Harvey's (and if we can find a place to get affordable, ethical meats.)<br /><br />And just because this Amazon ad does a horrible job of telling you about the product, here are some important details:<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Brown Rice, Organic Kamut, Organic Oats, Organic Spelt, Organic Barley, Organic Triticale, Potatoes*, Carrots*, Zucchini*, Sweet Potatoes**, Peas**, Broccoli, Green Beans, Beets, Calcium Citrate, Parsley, Lecithin, Garlic, Bee Pollen, Nutritional Yeast, Alfalfa, Rose Hips, Red Clover, Oat Straw, Flax Seed Meal*, Papaya, Rosemary, Dandelion, Peppermint, Ginger, Spirulina*, Fenugreek*, Basil Leaf, Fennel Seed. (*Dehydrated; **Freeze-Dried) (incredible, right?!?!)<br /><br />And how we made it:<br />1--Pick a protein and cook it up (our dogs didn't take to raw beef or chicken very well, but you can also do raw). Weigh the cooked protein--this determines the proportions of everything else you add (water, Dr. Harvey's Mix, and oil). Process protein if need be (boiled chicken or turkey breasts, hard-boiled eggs.)<br />2--Boil up needed amount of water in a big pot. When boiled, add needed amount of Dr. Harvey's dehydrated mix to the boiled water. Cover and let it sit and rehydrate for 8 minutes.<br />3--After 8 minutes, add the cooked protein to the big pot of rehydrated Dr. Harvey's mix. Add needed amount of oil. Mix it all up, and it's done! (The dogs go NUTS over the first, warm batch of Dr. Harvey's! I don't blame them--it smells sooo good!)<br /><br />We would make big batches and put 3-days' worth in the fridge (maximum amount of time) and freeze the rest.<br /><br />Note: it took us a while to figure out what proportions we needed for what. The instructions on the sheet inside give you guidance, but I ended up making my own chart because their's wasn't very helpful.  Also--we needed a scale (you might, too) to measure out how much protein you have--which will determine how much Mix, water and oil to use. It's a little tricky, but definitely manageable.<br /><br />Dr. Harvey's is fantastic, and he has a grain-free version, too (Veg-to-Bowl), which I have yet to try. I forgot to mention--I even spoke to Dr. Harvey myself when I had questions! How's that for customer service?!<br /><br />In sum, Dr. Harvey's is great if you're a very conscientious pet parent and know what's good for your pets (like me) but not so great if you're a struggling grad student short of time and cash (like me). Good luck!

She loves it and what's great is that she doesn't have the multitude of problems associated with poor intentinal health like she used to.  No more gurgling stomach and vomiting!  My friend has a little Rottwieler puppy that had bad kidneys.  The vet said she would die soon.  We went into action and discoverd that Dr. Harvey's food is actually easy on her kidneys.  She has gained 12 pounds in less than 2 months which is a miracle.  She is playing again and getting very sassy!  I will keep my girl eating what she loves; Dr. Harvey's. I tried a bite myself and with a little salt and pepper, I could eat it too!

review/summary: Healthy, easy to make, and apparently very tasty!
review/text: All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!

review/summary: This dog food woks wonders on my dogs
review/text: I have been using Dr. Harvey's Canine Health Miracle Dog food for more than 4 years. I found this product through a friend who has dogs with similar finicky eating habits. My two dogs would pick at or just turn their noses up to any of the generally available brands in the supermarket as well as food I got at my vet. They had also been having skin irritation problems. As soon as we changed to Dr Harvey's they wolfed down the food and after a couple months the skin irritation problems disappeared. Both dogs (1 Border Collie 13yrs and 1 BC/Australian Sheppard mix 16 yrs) had developed arthritis in hip and shoulder joints prior to starting the new food and again after a few months of the new food their pain level seemed to decrease. When the BC was 15 we had blood work done and the Vet said she had never seen blood so clean for a dog this old. We are sold on the properties of this food, and have started using it on our latest rescue dog a 1 year old Australian Cattle dog, and she loves it. The con to this food is the prep time, but we make a batch and freeze half so we are not making it every night. If you care about your dogs health and don't mind spending a little extra time preparing the food then you should give this one a try. I have not tried any of the other "Health" dog foods available, so I can only compare this to supermarket and vet quality dog food but I will never go back, my dogs health is too important to me.

review/text: Our 7 year old boxer is allergic to many store brand dog foods. We spent months trying to find one that didn't make him sick. The solution in the end was to make his dog food ourselves. It was quite a procedure since he's 70 pounds, but Dr. Harvey's food has made that SO much easier. I prepare it according to directions, add the protein and then divide it into his containers for his meals. I freeze lots ahead so I don't have to make it every day. If I had small dog, making it every day would be easy, but for large dogs, I find it easier to make a large batch and freeze ahead, taking them out a day or so before needed. Best dog food ever.

My wife and daughter were shopping in Japan Land and there was a refreshment kiosk with a huge barrel bucket of Pokka Canned Coffee on ice.<br />I neede a quick caffine hit as Epcot is huge (Walking forever!) and was more than pleasantly surprised at the flavor of Pokka. It tastes great and gives you that boost of caffine to keep you rolling along. I conquered Epcot and went back for another can of Pokka before the drive home to Tampa!!<br /><br />  Now, I keep them in the fridge at home for a wake-me-up on my drive to work. You have to at least try it and see.<br />I think you'll be a happy camper!<br /><br />Jim, Tampa Fla.

review/summary: I love this lower salt alternative
review/text: This one has so much flavoring. My kids and husband both love it. Its a lower salt seasoning with such vibrant flavoring. I use it when making eggs for breakfast all the way to making gumbo for Christmas. I would recommend this to my family and friends.

review/summary: A great blend for Southern dishes
review/text: We love it our shrimp & grits, in our gumbo, and beans & rice.  Picked it up on a whim while travelling and now it's a staple in my spice drawer.  I like to give it as a hostess gift too.

review/summary: Heavy garlic
review/text: Although highly rated by experts, too much garlic smell for my taste. Going back to Shark brand after 4 bottles of this.<br />Notes:<br />1. Smaller bottle than most; may be convenient at table.<br />2. Like some other good imported brands, no chemical preservatives. US Huy Fong has chemicals, probably because it' s left out all day on restaurant tables.<br />3. Top is weak--hinge broke off before fully used.<br />4. After #3 top very hard to put back on.

review/summary: Yummy! Perfect For Finish This Drink Cocktail.
review/text: When looking for a "green" signature drink for a geeky wedding we came across the Finish This Drink recipe. It called for Kiwi syrup which we could not find locally in any store. Amazon to the rescue - this Monin kiwi syrup made a yummy drink!!
