review/summary: Hot Cocoa
review/text: Not very please with the green mountain hot cocoa product, lacking a good chocolate taste, even when you mix two of them together it doesn't make it better.  Will never buy these again, best kind is the Grove Square or Swiss Miss k-cups.

review/summary: Pros & Cons
review/text: On a positive note, Green Mountain Hot Cocoa is one of the few (hot cocoa) products that is not made with hydrogenated oils.  I, like some other reviewers, had a problem with it clumping in some (not all) of the k-cups.  What you end up with is chocolate flavored water...yuck.  It didn't occur to me to shake them up before putting in the Keurig.  What I did with the remainder of the box was open them up, empty in cup, and then put boiling water in cup.  They do have a good milk chocolate flavor and for a richer taste you can make with boiling hot milk.  Since I didn't trust these k-cups to work everytime, it seemed like a waste of money to buy them so I started buying bulk powder mix such as Ghirardelli & Starbucks Hot Cocoa (brands that do not contain hydrogenated oils either).

review/text: I am slowly realizing that no matter what flavors they SAY are in the K-Cups, coffee is still just coffee. And as for this Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa -- HO HUM. Soooooooo bland! Good thing I tried it in a sampler pack, I will not buy any more of it. I can make my own from cocoa powder and sugar, and ten times better.

review/text: My wife likes it a lot!  So that is good.  Certainly it isn't the best hot cocoa you can buy but it is pretty good and it is very convenient.  She usually makes it on the 10 ounce setting.  We always make sure to run a rinse after as it does tend to leave some chocolate in the brew chamber which messes up the next drink if you don't rinse it.

review/summary: Pretty gross..  Save your money
review/text: If there's one word to describe the taste of this product, it's gross.  Aside from the very watered down flavor, the powder has SALT mixed into it.  Not just one of the ingredients that goes into making the powder, it has uncut salt crystals mixed in with the powder.  You can actually taste that it is salty. I honestly thought it was my water, so I started using spring water.  The taste of my coffee much improved, but the cocoa was still nasty.  It was enough to make me throw away half a box.  I would not recommend this at all.  Order the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate instead.  It's a little more expensive, but it tastes 1000x better.<br /><br />Or, just use your favorite canister-pack hot cocoa mix, and use the Keurig without a K-cup to boil the water. This avoids two problems..  You don't have to run a hot-water cycle to clean the hot cocoa crap out of the K-cup housing, and you don't lose 1/4 of the powder that gets left in the botton of the K-cup as sludge.  The powder cups just don't work that well in the Keurig.

I have watched the price climb from a standard of .50 cents (on sale at.40 cents) per cup to today's so-called bargain prices of .68 cents. I know that over a year ago coffee harvests were down but that is over. In fact Brazil has a coffee glut. The price is being controlled by investors just like oil. Do not give in. I say boycott the product until they bring the price down to previous levels.

It seems like Green Mountain went heavier on the sweet than on the chocolate and the results are disappointing.

review/text: My wife gave me a package of Buffalo Bills "Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces" for my birthday. So being the cool guy that I am, I took it on a recent 4-wheeling trip and shared it with my compadres. Here's what they had to say:<br /><br />"WATER!!!!!!!!!!"<br /><br />LOL! Seriously, this IS good jerky. But it's a tad bit salty, and has a VERY distinct soy flavor. Maybe because the first three ingredients are beef, water, and soy. haha! If you do not like soy, you will NOT like this jerky. But that aside, it was a good-sized bag, and we demolished it in pretty short order. The pieces were not too big or small, and it was not chewy. It was maybe a tad bit hard, but it was not sinewy. This was premium beef - no grissel! I highly recommend this and other Buffalo Bills jerky products.<br /><br />Just be sure you have something to drink (it goes great with beer)!

To me, jerky should be salty to help keep your sodium during a long trip or physical activity. I don't write reviews on Amazon much, but felt I should chime in on this product. Funny, but my local Sunoco station in Pgh carries this brand and it's the only one I buy, except if I visit my home state of Texas and go to Buccee's gas station where they have a full and I do mean FULL jerky deli style counter with all kinds of fresh jerky by the lb. It is a jerky lover's dream.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I am on an aircraft carrier, in the middle of the ocean and have been for 5 months now.  I orded this jerky and when it came in, I was salivating to try it.  Hands down the best jerky I have had, it wasn't full of tendons or fat, it wasn't chewy, and it wasn't as dry bark.  Perfect jerky, prime cuts of beef, the right texture and taste.  I shared two pieces out of the bag, then felt the urge to conserve the rest of the jerky for myself.  If you order a bag, order two, that way you can hide one for yourself then appear to be a giving soul with the other.  Keep it for yourself.<br /><br />Jason Cohen<br />Master Sergeant<br />USMC

review/summary: Extremely good customer service
review/text: I had earlier left some neutral feedback because my original order of this product was kinda dry. I posted that feedback around 9am yesterday morning and had gotten a phone call directly from the vendor less than 3 hours later.<br /><br />Buffalo Bills apologized profusely about the dry beef jerky I had gotten. They also said they were going to send me a replacement and assured me it would be good. I, of course, withdrew my original, neutral feedback and replaced it with this feedback.<br /><br />I am very very impressed with Buffalo Bill's customer service. Mistakes happen to everyone and it is the ones that step up and immediately resolve the issue like they did that get my full five star ratings such as this one.

review/summary: Inedible
review/text: This jerky is inedible.  You would have to reconstitute it in beef broth to be able to chew it.  Additionally, all you can taste is the hickory smoke and salt.  It might be leather for all I know.  I purchased several other varieties from this manufacturer, and they are all of similar poor quality.  Avoid.

review/summary: Great service.  Good, solid beef jerky
review/text: This beef jerky is good and solid.  I use the word solid because it is not moist.  The heat also overwhelms the smoke flavor (at least for me).  I will definitely consume this, but will buy another flavor next time.<br /><br />I've also tried the original flavor which is very good and moist and the barbecue, which is very moist and absolutely delicious.<br /><br />If you like your jerky chewy with some fire and some smoke flavor, buy this!

review/summary: Honestly, the best beef jerky I have ever had...
review/text: I have ordered probably $500 of jerky from various online companies in the last 3 years and I can say this is for sure the best jerky I have ever had.  The hickory flavor is great and salty.  It's the kind of snack you just can't stop eating.  The other great thing is I like the pieces, instead of long strips.  It much nicer to be able to just pop bite size pieces in your mouth, rather than try and use your side molars to rip a long piece of jerky apart.  I have probably gone through eight bags of this product and have two in the cupboard.  Just do it.

review/text: I really like ChooChoo R Snacks Jerky, their quality is exceptional as I have stated in a previous review for their "Big Slabs" and their "Country Cut". But this Jerky which I got today with the soy sauce is really not my taste, it is absolutely salty, and the soy overpowers the meat flavor itself, and far as smoky flavor is concerned, there is none I can taste,the jerky is also unusually greasy, really coated in grease to be factual. I will personally only stick with ordering their "Country Cut" and their "Big Slabs" where you taste the good flavor of the meat, and the jerky is moist, but NOT greasy.

I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size<br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010<br /><br />Gunner  October, 2009

review/summary: Too salty, doesn't taste like beef
review/text: I was really disappointed by this beef jerky, especially since I ordered a whole pound.  The jerky is way too salty, so much that I worried about the health effects.  Also, it tastes like it has been soaked in some kind of artificial beef broth that completely eliminates the natural beef flavor.  What is the point of that?  Why would anyone do that unless they are using inferior meat and looking for a quick path to flavor.  Trust me, it's not worth it.  Truly hickory-smoked beef just accentuating the flavor of the meat would be wonderful.

review/text: There were enough good reviews to give this beef jerky a try.<br /><br />It comes vacuum sealed, which should make for a long storage life... until you open it.  The bag isn't reclosable, so you need to transfer the contents to a reclosable container.<br /><br />This beef jerky comes in small pieces (strips), which we liked.  The color is black, very black... thought this was odd?  The smell is smokey... no beefy smell... not real appetizing.<br /><br />This beef jerky is "tough" & needs to be worked over (chewed) before you can enjoy the taste... that is, if you like very salty + smokey!  Still... the meat quality is good, with little gristle or inedible pieces.<br /><br />We wanted to like this beef jerky, but it's down there with one of the worst tasting that we've tried.  We won't be buying this beef jerky again!

review/text: These gluten free sugar cones are the real deal-in taste, crunch and good shelf life.  Good enough to eat without ice cream!  Also can be used for other sweet fillings, fruits, sorbets, yogurt, etc.  Going gluten free later in life a person can really miss the taste and mouth feel of certain things-cones being but one of those.  I'm good at baking and trying to find replacements for breads and cakes, but crackers and cones are something I have to find on offer from commercial bakeries.  I search and try until I find something that satisfies the best and then I stick with that product.

review/summary: Gluten free ice cream cones!!!
review/text: Edward and Sons gluten free ice cream cones taste so much like their "normal" counter part that we didn't feel like we were missing in that important Summer tradition at all.  These cones stand up well to a couple of scoops of ice cream and look the same as regular cones so my children don't feel any different than their friends.  I packed our leftover cones in a ziplock bag and they lasted 2 weeks with out getting stale.  They may have lasted longer but we ate them all.  This is not an item I could easily make at home so I'm thrilled to be able to purchase it from Amazon.  Their delivery was quick and easy.  I even traveled with a box in my carry on luggage for our family vacation so we could enjoy ice cream cones wherever we went.  Yum!

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I bought a case on Amazone cause I had found this at Costco and was so impressed with the low sugar content, 4 grams per serving which is 8 grams cause it is a 2 serving container. No other "Aloe drink" I can find at Trader Joe's or other health conscious store has such a low sugar content, very great and the fact that stevia is being used is another big plus. So when I saw it on Amazone I was very happy and ordered a case. When I got the case I find out it is just like the others I have seen with a whopping 14 gram per serving which makes the sugar content a whopping 28 grams per container. WHAT HAPPENED. Did I get a fluke either from Amazone or from Costco? Or did you all change the formula? I would send it back if I could. Might as well drink soda. What a shame. I am a real Aloe Vera enthusiast. I believe it is a very fantastic drink but at 14 grams of sugar it becomes another sugary soda like drink. I hope this was just a mistake.<br />Update: I wrote company and found that the pulp free flavors are 8 grams. Wish Amazone had the sugar content available. No worries from now on I will order the non pulp with lower sugar content.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil
review/text: I started using the extra virgin coconut oil and I am very pleased with it. I use for my hair, as a lotion and I put it in my cereal.  I also saw an improvement in my health. It is a great product.  What else can I say, My only complain that it be prefered if the container was glass rather than plastic.

review/text: the gum is too sweet,and doesnt last like it used too.. i tested it and in 2 hrs,the gum starts to get really hard to chew,plus the taste is gone.. had to spit it.. i bought another flavor ahead of this,and that one was longer lasting.. i grew tired of chewing it.. just to see how long it will last,but i didnt last! so i guess that's a good review

review/summary: Good dog food!
review/text: My dog is very finicky on what she will eat.  She seems to like the Pedigree canned wet food but I wanted to make sure she had hard to keep her teeth clean (other than feeding treats of course). Even though she may not really eat this dry food, I will still give it 5 stars because Pedigree is a good brand of dog food. Item came at time expected. Would recommend ordering.

review/summary: Great for Senior Dogs/priced too high
review/text: My dog has always consumed and loved pedigree, but with age she had needed some additonal help. The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately. I think this dog food has helped her to get along better than before we started it. Since it is loaded with salmon/fish oil, it has a rather potent smell and has made the dog very 'gassy' if you know what I mean. Of course my kids think it is funnier than anything on TV.<br />As for the price $18.99, that is outrageous. You can get this for under $11 at Walmart and Kmart.

review/summary: My dog loves it, so do the cats
review/text: I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store.

review/summary: My senior dog looks forward to her meals again.
review/text: One of the problems senior dogs often face is a decreasing appetite. This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again. She is definitely showing the benefits of good nutrition and I hope she will remain in good happy health for several more years.

review/summary: Doggie's Change of Pace
review/text: I've been using Harmony Dry Dog Food for the past 2 years with great success. However, the last bag had a rancid oil smell upon opening. Not sure if the Texas heatwave OR a recipe change was the cause. BUT my pooch ate it, just not with his usual gusto. Making gravies to enhance it pushed me to find some healthy "mix-ins". Searching the internet for reviews and pricing of various brands, led me back to Amazon and Pedigree on sale. I've been mixing this with his Harmony. He eats the combination heartily without digestive issues. Based on his favorable response I've purchased other Pedigree brand items (dry and wet) on sale through Amazon's Warehouse Deals with equally favorable response.  I won't give up on Harmony Dog Foods BUT I'll have other options as well so my fur-baby doesn't burnout on it.

The dogs ofcourse have liked Pedigree for over a year now, But for this kind of money I want something healthier.

review/summary: GARBAGE
review/text: Don't take offense, I fed this brand for years. But, a look at the ingredients shows that it is garbage. No wonder our pets are suffering so many diseases that could be prevented with proper nutrition. Corn, wheat how this crap is legally sold as dog food or even touted as "wholesome" is beyond me.<br /><br />Want a starter book on the horrors of the pet food industry? "Food Pets Die For", check it out<br /><br />we switched to a more natural kibble several years ago but even then the years of feeding junk food did its damage. Our Dane was diangosed with lymphoma, and since has been switched to raw pet food such as Nature's Variety and Primal. If you love your pet, at least check them out. They are pricey, but for a healthier/longer life, well worth it.

Needless to say, the shipment arrived in a timely manner with no problems and my cat is  happy once again!  I hope that Meow Mix is not doing away with this flavor!  I hope it is just an inventory store problem.  I buy the beef/chicken market selects as well, so I am a pretty big investor for my cat.  Thank you and I will order again when my supply starts running low!

review/text: I am a huge fan of the Skinny Girl cocktails from the liquor store so when I saw LuLu, i was excited.  I was so dissapointed to open the cran cosmo and have it taste like cough sryup!  It was horrible, so bad that my friend & I poured it down the sink (along with the money we spent on it).  I have the rest of the bottle in the fridge and for the life of me can not figure out how to doctor it to make it drinkable.  Oh well, learned my lesson and will not stray again.  Lulu, you are no skinny girl.

review/text: Our friends from Brittany, France sent these to us so we could have a taste of France.  We received a box with a combination of plain and chocolate covered crepes.  They are deceptively plain-looking, but you bite into thin, golden flaky crepes rolled thinly into a couple inches of delicate, buttery, crunchy goodness! They are so wonderful and ours are all gone, so I came here looking for more. I'm so happy to find them!  The chocolate-covered are delicious too, but my favorite are the plain.  They are fantastic with coffee or with ice cream.  Try them!

review/text: I was so excited to find these cookies available in the US-and for a very reasonable price.  I purchased this exact tin in Brittany about 6 years ago from a little local shop, so I know these are authentic!  When I opened the package and had my first bite, I was transported back to that blustery summer by the coast.  The gavottes are crisp and fresh, were not broken up by the journey, and were just perfect.  I will order these again the next time I need a taste of Bretagne!
