review/summary: Dented cans
review/text: What more can one say? It's unbelievable how many cans are dented, and not just-a-casual-dent; these are throw-it-away deep dents, bent-can dents, dropped-from-on-high-dents. And the dented ones tend to be in the middle of the case, which means they are happening at the factory. Sometimes, Every Single Can in the case is dented. I suspect Campbell collects cans of soup that are damaged by the machines and sells it at bulk discount to .. whoever sells it to me, but there would be no way to prove it.<br /><br />They won't let me write a second review, but an edit of the existing one is allowed: subsequent shipments, including the latest, continue to be beat to hell. This one was done by the shipper - the cases were busted open and the cans scattered through the packing box. Not that much denting though. So there's that. Wish I wasn't poor, but luckily for Campbells, UPS and Amazon - I am.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: 1 star for the vendor - read below. 5 stars for the product. Spent some time in Thailand and picked some of these up for about 50 cents a pack. Yeah, they're cheap in Thailand. What we did was use a packet of this with a pound of ground chicken. We crisped up some bacon and put the bacon and seasoned browned chicken over hot rice. The seasoning is extremely spicy, but we couldn't stop eating it. I brought some back with me but somehow they didn't make it so I assume they were stolen by some fat airport security somewhere along the way.<br /><br />I was excited to see these on Amazon but can't recommend the newbie vendor Veryhug. They canceled my order even though the item is in stock. At the time they were offering free shipping. When I came back after my order was canceled, they're charging for shipping. As of now, their price is still low comparatively, but out of principle I won't be buying from them. Instead, I found a decent deal on Ebay from an established, international seller with 100% feedback. I think I'll get better service that way.

review/summary: This salt will change your life
review/text: Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.

review/summary: Trying to Upgrade Dog Food - So Far They Love It
review/text: My dogs are getting older, and the oldest has been gaining a bit of weight. While I'd love to buy them the $50 bags of food, I just can't right now. So I'm weaning them from their regular kibble to this shredded, weight management formula. I assumed they'd turn their nose up at it, but they dove right in. The shredded formula makes it easier for older teeth to chew. I got an 18-lb bag at Pet Supplies Plus for $29.98, so might want to check around for prices.<br /><br />For now, we're happy with this.<br /><br />I'm updating to five stars. After a week on this dog food, I'm using less food and they're staying full all day and not begging for more in the early evenings. I use less canned food because they don't need the encouragement to eat this kibble. Very pleased.<br /><br />Specs say this is " hard kibble and savory tender shredded pieces--for an optimum combination of nutrition and taste. Optimal protein to fat ratio helps dogs lose fat, not muscle. Contains 25% less fat than Pro Plan Chicken & Rice Adult Formula for adult dogs. Rich in soy isoflavones to help minimize weight gain. Formulated with wholesome grains, including rice and whole wheat, which are highly digestible sources of carbohydrates for energy and quality fiber sources."

review/text: I've tried other nut butters in the past, but couldn't get past the grainy texture and the ho-hum taste. This one changed all that! I LOVE crunchy peanut butter, and this crunchy almond butter did not let me down. Very creamy texture (no graininess AT ALL)with a robust nutty flavor, with nice substantial almond pieces throughout. It works well in a dip I make, and is wonderful in sandwiches. It spreads easily and thankfully isn't separated with a layer of oil on top like other nut butters I've tried. This product will replace peanut better in my house! My favorite lunch is an almond butter and blackberry jam sandwich on pumpernickel bread...drool....

review/text: We have tried every almond butter on the market, including home made and fresh store made in our local market.  None of the others come close to Barney Butter for smoothness and taste so we keep ordering it from Amazon.  The only thing I would say is make sure you read the item details as we inadvertently ended up with the small size for one order when we wanted the 16 oz jars.  Our fault of course but worth noting if you are ordering a supply like we did.

review/summary: Inaccurate product labelling
review/text: I agree with another reviewer, Silverdrake: this is NOT "almond butter," it is an almond spread made with almond butter AND palm oil, sugar and salt. If they just call it "Barney Butter" with a sub-text of "a tasty almond-butter-based spread" I would not have purchased it.<br />I didn't see the fine print, which is my bad...however, they should change their label...and Amazon should change their description.<br />I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it IS tasty...but it is more of a dessert than it is a healthy alternative to natural peanut butter (which IS 100% peanuts, by comparison). If they re-labelled it and sold it as a spread, I'd give it 3 stars (because it is too pricey for a spread, even though it does taste good).<br />People wanting real almond butter would be better-served by the real thing eg <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SHYCQQ">Maranatha Natural Almond Butter 26oz Lightly Roasted</a>

However, I found these Earth Best bars to be expensive and quite small (although my daughter does tend to have a large appetite!) and overly sweet.  I prefer the TLC Cereal Bars (found in the snack section of y grocery store rather than baby food section).  They are less expensive and larger than Earth's Best, but are made of whole grains and avoid a lot of the processed ingredients found in Nutrigrain bars.

review/text: If you make your own baby food and have been avoiding added sugar and salt - this snack is not for your baby.  It is un-naturally sweet!  Make your own... It will be nicer on your pocketbook and you can control the amount of sugar!!

review/summary: Great Breakfast Addition For Tots
review/text: I LOVE these organic cereal bars and I love giving them to my daughter. I usually couple one of these bars with a banana and some yogurt for her breakfast, and she always goes for the bar first (she LOVES bananas, so that's definitely saying a lot). Definitely preferable to the breakfast bars laden with HFCS and ingredients whose names you cannot even pronounce. The only reason I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a tad on the small side. Would be nice if there were just a little bit bigger! (My tot is a lean one, but when she finds a food she likes, she could eat it all day - I wish one of these would last her a little bit longer!)

review/summary: Great breakfast bar for toddlers!
review/text: My son loves these breakfast bars and I love that he eats them.  They are lower in sugar than some of the other options out there and higher in dietary fiber.  They still have the added vitamins of other toddler cereal bars.  Overall he could eat worse things for breakfast :-)  We use it as a snack on the way to daycare in the morning, he eats his full breakfast later at daycare.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint would be that the bars do break apart pretty easy.  This has lead to tears a few times in the mornings when my toddler is sad that his cereal bar broke.  They also don't stand up to being thrown into the diaper bag very well.<br /><br />Other than that we love these bars!

review/text: My daughter loves this product and it becomes a little treat.<br />The only reason I give only three stars here is because of the expiration date. When I ordered (April 09), the expiration date was about the end of July 09 (About 3 months away). I called the customer service but they said it is "the freshest" one. I don't know whether it is because they don't use preservetives or that is the freshest one in the Amazon warehouse.  My husband helps eating them out now.

review/summary: Healthy food for your cat may be more affordable than you think!
review/text: It was brought to my attention by a friend who owns a local pet store that many of our three cats' problems -- weight gain, shedding, and inability to hold their food down -- were undoubtedly a result of their diet of Meow Mix. So 2 weeks ago I picked up a bag of Precise on her recommendation, and the difference in the cats is astounding.<br /><br />Their energy instantly improved. Even our old, lethargic cat started playing again. As active as they now are I am sure their weight will improve as well.  Their coats have a new shine and the shedding has been reduced drastically. As for holding down their food? I have not had to clean up a mess in 2 weeks!<br /><br />I was concerned that the price per bag for 6.6 ounces of food might stretch my budget, as it is a bit more than your average grocery store/Wal-Mart cat food, but what I have learned is that with a diet rich in vitamins and meat (not just by-products) the cats actually consume less. Factoring this in, I think the cost for a bag of Precise is very close to that of a lower quality cat food.<br /><br />I also worried the cats would not like this food, as they are extremely picky and it had reached a point that Meow Mix is all they wanted.  They love it!  I will NEVER go back to cheap grocery store cat food.

It's as good as eating in a Restaurant, and if you have a gluten allergy it's you best stay home and make Thai Kitchen pad thai in your kitchen.  If you're making dinner for three, buy two boxes, one won't simply be enough. I made the Thai Peanut stir-fry with shrimp and added scrambled eggs to the finish patch.

Try all the shapes:  spaghetti, angel hair, penne, elbows, farfalle -- you'll love 'em.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />This pasta is awesome.  Tastes so good that my husband, who hates whole-wheat anything, actually loves it.  He now prefers this to any of his old white-pasta favorites and won't buy pasta at all if this is out of stock.  You won't even know that you're eating a healthier pasta, and you can successfully foist this off on non-health-food-eating guests.  We would like to order from Amazon because the stock isn't reliable at our local store.  Believe me, this is worth jumping through hoops for.  All of the different shapes are great, including the farfalle (bow-ties) which, so far, doesn't show up on Amazon, although it is available at some Walmarts.

review/summary: Love this stuff!! If only it was organic!
review/text: Barilla Plus pasta saved me when my oldest son was a toddler and would eat almost nothing. I searched for something he would eat that was high in protein and fiber. That's when I found this pasta.<br />It's high in protein (egg whites so not for vegans or egg-allergic), high in fiber AND has a bunch of healthy Omegas too!<br /><br />Most importantly--it doesn't TASTE "healthy". A lot of whole wheat pastas cook up mushy or too hard or taste grainy...just not like regular pasta. Barilla Plus doesn't. It really tastes like regular pasta. And my kids love it.<br /><br />I've been using it (fusilli, penne, spaghetti, farfalle) for more than 6 years now and my whole family loves it. I've even made it for guests (adults and kids) and no one ever guesses or even asks if it's special pasta. It's yummy stuff.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's not Organic. Then it would be perfect. :)

review/summary: sounded good, but...
review/text: I bought this in a hurry, not realizing until it was too late to cancel (5 minutes later O.o) that this product is in fancy packaging meant to be used when hiking or camping.  Black beans aren't my favorite thing; however, I love hummus, and thought it would be good to try something different.  As it turned out, I don't care for the taste of it at all, and it triggered a migraine both times I ate some.  I threw the rest of it away and nobody else that I know is willing to try it...hopefully whoever picks up the remaining 5 packets at the food bank will enjoy it.<br /><br />Casbah makes a wonderful traditional hummus and is sold in 12 - 6 oz. units, whereas you get only get 6 - 3.6 oz. packages of this stuff.  My advice is to try to find a single package in a store to try before purchasing it here...otherwise you could end up blowing almost 20 bucks like I did.

review/text: I normally feed Acana grain-free but saw this on sale and decided to save some money.  At first my dogs were leery of it because it has a strong fish smell.  Once they tried it they liked it.  It has excellent ingredients and no fillers and is very high calorie----not for couch potato dogs or they'll gain weight.

review/text: I transitioned my little Shih Tzu over to FirstMate puppy food.  She is doing really well on it and she poops less.  Her activity levels are good and her coat looks great!  I think it is very important to know what your dog is eating and what fillers are used in their food. I was very impressed with the ingredients that go into their dog food.  At their website, [...], it will educate you about their products.  I highly recommend them to anyone with pets whether you're a breeder or buddy!

review/summary: Dogs LOVE this!
review/text: I have two dogs. A terrier-poodle (5 years old, 13 pounds), and a purebred maltese (4 years old, 7 pounds). They are both very active, and maintain their weight without much difficulty. They are healthy and active dogs, and I absolutely adore them! I care about the foods that they eat, so I make a concerted effort to make sure that I am feeding them the best foods that I can provide. While I believe the best foods, nutritionally, are whole foods, eating human foods frequently has not been good for my doggies teeth. It makes their breath smell worse and increases the plaque on their teeth.<br /><br />The next best option is frozen dog food or raw bones, but neither of those options are suitable to our lifestyle. So I look for dry dog kibble made with a solid ingredient profile.<br /><br />With the melamine, pet-food scare that was in the news a while back, I was/am more comfortable with food that is made in North America. FirstMate owns and operates their facilities in British Columbia, Canada. They were the first company to produce grain-free food in 1995. 73% of the protein is from wild herring (local from BC!) & Chicken. The remaining 27% of protein is from the barley, rice, oatmeal and potato.<br /><br />My dogs are happy on this food. It doesn't seem to cause them any stomach upset, excess gas, and their coats are nice and shiny. 5 out of 5 in my books. :)

review/text: I can't say enough about this cake mix. You only have to add water and a small amount of butter. I ran out and recently purchased a store bought cake mix and I was grossed out by the stick of butter and 3 eggs the recipe called for. This cake is light, moist and rises perfectly every time. They also have white and yellow cake mixes as well. I'm going to purchase one for my Mom.

review/summary: Doesn't have to be creamy or sweet - microwave recipe
review/text: This is one of my favorites, but I don't like hot cereal that is creamy or sweet.<br />I found a method that works for me using the microwave oven, which isn't mentioned on the package.<br />I have a 1000 watt microwave oven.<br />For one serving: Heat 1/2 cup water on high for 2 minutes in a tall microwave-safe container. I use a 4" high covered Corningware pot.<br />Add 1/4 cup cereal and heat at 30% for 2 minutes. The reduced power keeps the cereal from boiling over.<br />Add a very small amount of water, if needed. (Having insufficient water can impact how well cooked the cereal will be.)<br />Cook an additional 5 minutes at 20%.<br />If desired, poach an egg on top for the last 1.5 minutes or so. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil on top before serving. Add seasoned salt to taste.

review/text: I am avoiding wheat, but used to love Cream of Wheat.  I had been eating pretty low carb, but wanted to add back a few good quality carbs, so I picked this up when I saw it at a local store.  I cooked it in water with sea salt, added some walnuts and frozen berries, and took it to work for lunch.  I heated it up, added a little stevia and some good cream, and it was amazing!  It would also be good with coconut oil, for dairy free good fats, or coconut milk! Yum!

review/text: I've been looking for a tasty canned iced coffee ever since the short-lived availability of Caribou Iced Coffee, which, amazingly, was sold by Target.  This stuff aint it.  It really has no coffee flavor.  In fact, it tastes almost exactly like one of the Slim-Fast "dieting" drinks.  It's WAY too sweet, and that's coming from someone that regularly adds a healthy amount of vanilla creamer to his morning coffee.

review/text: I purchase these through Amazon's subscribe and save program. I'm a big fan of artichoke hearts and love them in salads or just as a quick snack. The taste of these is very good and they are firm, not mushy as some brands I have tried. The problem is the consistency of quality is not there. Some cans have hearts that are brown (or turning brown) and do not look good enough to eat. I have unfortunately thrown many cans out because of this. Amazon is very good in their customer service and refunding my money if I ask them to. I don't think the poor quality is just from the inventory Amazon has as I have this same problem with this brand if I buy a can in the grocery store, some are good, some not so good.

review/text: On Subscribe and Save these are a very good value. They are very tasty and surprisingly not very salty at all. I rinse them off as a rule, but they really don't need it. I like just snacking on them instead of sweets, each can (not each serving--each CAN)is 90 calories, can't beat that. You can really tell the difference between brands when, as I needed to do, I had to use up one can of another brand in my pantry to add to the three cans of Cento I was using in a recipe. I noticed that many of the outer leaves were tougher and more fibrous, inedible. Cento brand artichokes are tender. I like them in salads and on top of homemade pizzas. I also appreciate the pull-tab opening, no can opener to dig out of the drawer.

review/text: I had switched to Cento artichoke hearts a while back when our local store stopped carrying Progresso and found them to be better than most canned artichokes.  Back in March, I purchased a can as usual from my local grocery store, and when I opened them, noticed a fermented smell.  I emptied out the can and found orange, slimy looking things that looked nothing like artichokes.  I suspect that they might have been figs, but I didn't test out the theory.  I returned the can to the store where I purchased it, but they just offered me a replacement can which I refused.  Major disappointment, and I will never trust Cento again.

review/text: My prior two failed traps: the WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets and the Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap both ended without success and both left me red and swollen.  Once I was able to move again I took a trip to the hardware store and purchased the Safer Brand Deluxe Yellow Jacket/Wasp Trap, since it was the only product on the shelf that I had not purchased.<br /><br />Strike three!  This thing didn't work for me either.  I followed the instructions and filled it with grape juice (apple didn't work in previous attempts) and set the bait up.  I gotta say, of the three traps I used, this one has the stinkiest bait.  I hung it on a tree and waited three weeks.<br /><br />After three weeks I checked it and nothing, NOTHING was floating in this little plastic coffin.  I was so mad that I took a baseball bat and knocked the trap right off of my tree, spraying my grill with bait.  If you've read my other reviews, then I'm sure you know what follows next....<br /><br />Yup, raccoon attack.  I know, completely predictable right?  Unfortunately for me, I like to have a midnight burger.  Meat in hand, I sauntered out to the grill at 10 past midnight.  I felt confident that, since it was night time, and wasps are not active at night, that I could use the grill despite not having washed the bait off.  I popped the top of the grill and was confronted by a 20 pound raccoon, no wait, it must have been a 300 pound mutant raccoon... yeah, that's it....  I dropped my meat and turned to run.  As I sprinted right into my reinforced sliding glass door (I bounced off of it) the raccoon reared up and launched itself at me.  Before a passed out I saw its little beady eyes peering down at me.<br /><br />I woke up the next morning completely naked and covered in raw meat.  My wife claims that there was no raccoon, and that I was acting out some strange fantasy... but I know the truth...

Unfortunately, the original description did not include enough information to know that this would not work on my species of "wasp".  But even the yellow jackets were not attracted to it.  Another bad thing if you accidently get some of the solution on your hands you can't get rid of the smell on your hands easily.  Probably took me 8 handwashings and using vinegar to finally get rid of the odor on my hands.

review/text: IT WAS FREE WITH A GREAT MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER SO, WHY COMPLAIN?<br /><br />NOT THE BEST FOR MY HEAD, HOWEVER, I NEED TO ELEVATE ME FEET WHEN LYING DOWN SO IT'S A COMFORT FOR THAT.

review/summary: Fine print inside label
review/text: I can't rate it fairly yet so I'll give it  3 stars. I haven't tried it yet but the inside label on the product says that it does not attract paper wasps which is what I am trying to control.<br />I didn't see this on the description.  I will see what happens.
