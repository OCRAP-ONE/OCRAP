review/text: I prefer raw tahini, but I make a raw cashew hummus and it tastes much better with roasted sesame seeds.  This is a great tasting product and I have ordered it numerous times.  My four star rating is because I prefer the flavor of raw sesame but for toasted, it is very good.

review/text: These pretzels are evil. When my snacking comes to an end, I see flashes of myself laying on the unkempt wooden floor of an abandoned house. Scant beams of light burn between the cracks in the boards on the lone window frame, illuminating my tattered and orange-stained clothes. The sound of my body writhing over a pool of empty yellow aluminum bags, a half foot high up the empty broken walls, is quieted only by the echo of my cries of longing and despair.

review/summary: These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.
review/text: These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack.

review/text: I love buffalo wings; not just the heat, but the flavor! This product, while not offering tongue-burning, sinus-clearing heat, has good bite to it. The flavor--how can I describe it? It's very addictive! I can down a whole 10 ounce package in no time. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a hint of a bleu cheese taste in there as well, which adds to the whole "hot wing" experience of the snack, in my opinion.<br />My kids like these as well. I have to hide the bag from them sometimes just to ensure that I get my fair share.

review/summary: Maybe too delicious?
review/text: Snyder's Honey Mustard & Onion Prezel Pieces might very well hold the title for most delicious non-candy snack item.  A large bag rarely lasts a day in my house, which isn't a good thing when they're pretty caloric.  They're so delicious you just want to stuff a whole handful in your mouth and slowly suck the flavor out of them, crunching on the remains as you look like a mad squirrel.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say that you could eat these every day and not get tired of them.  I would replace every meal of the day with these things if I wasn't afriad of them giving me heart disease.<br /><br />Try them once and you'll be hooked.  I have tried the other flavors since some stores run discounts, none of the other flavors were anywhere near as good as the Honey Mustard & Onion.  Buttermillk Ranch is ok, but you can't top Cool Ranch Doritos.  Cheddar Cheese wasn't good at all, and Buffalo Wing was hard to eat (flavor makes your hands all nasty).

They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.  These have the heat and the vinegar tang of actual buffalo chicken wings.  I love them.  Unfortunately they don't last long at our house.  Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.  But that is a small price to pay for entrance into flavor heaven.

I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2" x 3/4" - 1"  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot.

review/summary: The best!
review/text: As a rule, Snyder's just makes the best pretzels, hands down.  They've been making them for 100 years now and well, there's a reason they're still in business!  These are great - they disappear rather quickly.  My only complaint is that they're small and very hard so they scrape the roof of your mouth.  Other than that, they're the best tasting things out there.  Highly recommend!

Thanks to the other reviews I now have no fear getting the box of 12...

review/text: Very flavorful, jalapeno is a fantastic concept for Pretzels. Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.<br /><br />But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag.

review/summary: Not the best Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels
review/text: Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  "Hot Buffalo Wing" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones.

review/summary: Great Sauce!
review/text: Since Rib-It went out of business, we had a tough time finding another sauce we loved until we found Bone Suckin sauce.  We prefer the flavor of the 'hot' variations even though the flavor isn't really hot...it's kinda sweet with a tang (but not overly sweet like a brown sugar or honey bbq sauce).<br /><br />The thicker style is nice to get a good bbq sear on the grill.  The normal sauce is very thin and is basically great as a dip, marinade or mix-in.  But this thicker style can definitely stand on it's own!

review/text: I tried a different brand of lemon juice and lemon oil from Italy, and liked it. This one is cheaper, but there is a reason for that. I suspect my other brand has a higher dose of the oil, or comes from tastier lemons. My batch expires in December, but can it be that DeLallo uses the European way of writing a date, where JULY 12th, 2012 would read 12/7/2012? Maybe I was sent a batch that is expired.

review/summary: A Very Good Product
review/text: This product is perhaps a half-cut below that of the similar Sicilia Brand product, but way ahead of any other such product (Goya, Realemon, etc.  The taste is close to that of freshly squeezed lemon juice, but just a tad off - there is a slight hint of a taste which I can best describe as that of a very good lemon gumdrop mixed in with the natural lemon flavor.<br /><br />You need to be careful about reading labels on such products. The Sicilia brand uses sulpher dioxide as a preservative. Sulpher dioxide, in small quantities, is harmless to most people, but can trigger a serious allergic reaction in a small percentage of people. I cannot tell from the information here whether that preservative is used. It's never bothered me at all, but people should be careful about such things.<br /><br />What I can vouch for is that this product has a very pleasant taste and is very easy to use.

The design is sleek and I love being able to have a bunch of different flavored coffees right by my Keurig without having a pile of different boxes on the counter.<br /><br />The one tip I would like to pass on is to open and close the holder by using the front bar only.  Otherwise it can go up cockeyed and not close up flat.

The rack efficiently uses what is normally wasted space under the cabinet and frees up valuable counter space.  Once installed and filled only the very bottom of the kcups are visible.  It pulls down and pushes up smoothly, and there are tiny, strong magnets that hold it closed.  If you have limited space, you won't regret this purchase.

review/summary: Almost perfect
review/text: I don't like messy counters or appliances take up all my counter space.  The Kuerig does a good job of consuming space, and most of the storage for K cups appear to do the same.  I was originally going to make wall mountable shelf to store some, but the Coffee Keeper seems to better fit my need.<br /><br />It has double sided tape preapplied for a quick and easy installation (also some alcholol swabs to prepare the surface before applying).  Directions were simple and clear.  It also included optional screws (I thought about using them, but the tape is more than sufficient when given time to bond).<br /><br />It's a clever, useful, and evidently unique solution to K cup storage.<br /><br />There are two small cons I'd like to point out, which hopefully they correct in future versions.<br /><br />The one I received was a bit tight to pull down, obviously they should not be loose enough to drop on their own, but to pull down with a single finger would be nice.<br /><br />In fact a little pull tab in the front to grab on to would be very beneficial, rather than having to find and pull down on the edge/lip (which is hidden by your cabinet). I thought about deducting a star for this, but I've been told they will be adding it in the future and frankly it's still pretty darn convenient.

review/summary: Great Space Saver
review/text: This product works just as described.  It is not too flimsy and appears to be sturdy enough for everyday household use.  One word of caution--if you use the adhesive strips they are VERY sticky and you cannot easily remove it.  Make sure it is exactly where you want to mount it when using the adhesive strips.  We also used the included screws as an added measure.

review/summary: Pleased with it
review/text: I received the under cabinet K-Cup holder promptly.  The packaging was a simple plastic bag, but it included everything need from instructions to alcohol cleaning pads and screws.<br /><br />Install was simple.  Clean the underside of the cabinet with the alcohol wipes and allow to dry.  Peal back the double sided tape already attached to the holder.  Press it up and into the underside of the cabinet.  Hold for 60 seconds.  Screw in the supplied screws.<br /><br />My only complaint was that my item was slightly bent/malformed.  I fixed this with some light taps of a hammer and I squared everything up.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this product and it saves counter space.

review/summary: Best K-Cup dispenser ever!
review/text: I absolutely love this under cabinet K-cup dispenser. It gives me more counter room and is almost hidden. What a great idea! I found it on Amazon.com and am amazed each time I use it. My husband installed it for me quickly and easily. It came with screws and it's wonderful. It iss easy to pull down to choose the K-cup I or my guests want, and just as easily, is pushed up again under my cabinet. I highly recommend this dispenser for anyone who wants more counter space or even just wants to have the most innovative design available.

review/summary: Under Cabinet K-cup holder
review/text: Ordered two of these to rid clutter off my counter.  Fairly easy installation; just remember to check direction of the pulldown and closeness to any contact walls, husband forgot to do this twice and had to change afterwards.  Not easy to do but he managed.  Received lots of compliments from visiting family and friends plus wanting to know where to purchase one too. Enjoy not having clutter on counter and this does the job. Only gave 4 stars as the directions were a little too simplistic.

review/summary: I love this product!!!
review/text: I love this k-cup holder. I don't have a lot of counter space, and I couldn't get one of the ones that sits under the Keurig because my shelves are a bit low. So this was perfect for us. I've had it a few months and it works like a charm. I mounted using the screws because the adhesive didn't hold well enough. I didn't not want the worry of the whole unit coming down everytime I gave it a pull. The screws are under the shelf, so it's not like anyone will ever see under there. I highly recommend this product. The only downfall is you can totally see the bottoms of the cups, but that's to be expected. That's something the maker and the customers can't really get around.

review/text: First- let me tell you these are the ONLY way to store K-Cups!!!<br />Easy to install, well designed and made to last.<br />The company who makes them offers fantastic customer service, too.<br />These were sold out when I originally tried to purchase them. I inquired directly about<br />availability and was told they'd email me as soon as they were in stock. A couple weeks later I got the email,<br />went directly to Amazon- where they were still sold out. Tried again in a half hour and bought two.<br />I'm about to purchase a few more as gifts, don't wait for Christmas when demand will skyrocket!

review/summary: Keeps the K-cups in order
review/text: You gotta love this gadget. Keeps my k-cups in order - - not in my cabinet, not on the counter, not in the pantry . . . r i g h t above and to the left of my keurig coffee maker.  The ONLY reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I wanted it all to be hidden . .  however the space under the upper cabinet is slightly shallow so you can see 1/2 of the k-cups in their slots.  No fault of the gadget, just be aware it will only hide the cups if the depth of the aforementioned cabinet is deeper than the standard.  New kitchen cabinets are in my future . . . and I know that this space needs to be about 1/2" more than standard if it continues to bother me.

review/text: I have to say i bought this item with some apprehension but when it arrived I was happy. The item doesn't come in any packaging except a plastic bag, hmmm, bit odd, but its not made of plastic itself its actually metal, very sturdy. Now my main concern was that I ordered it and my wife said how does it fix to the units, I replied by sticky pads. Oh she said you do know we are replacing our kitchen units soon, oh I said, well have no fear it came with screws as well, thank you. It fits up pretty easy although you do need three hands just because of its shape, design and you need to hold it underneath a kitchen unit. But it works perfectly and does exactly what it says. Very, very pleased. Highly recommend this for your K-cups.

review/text: This product is simply ingenious. It's important to me that my kitchen is uncluttered - and with limited space to start, I have to get creative. After days of searching the available products on the market, I discovered this and HAD TO HAVE IT. Unfortunately, due to its popularity, it was unavailable. When it finally became available, I pounced. And I'm so glad I waited.<br /><br />This product is well made and exactly as described. It mounts under the cabinet with or without screws (I am using the mounting tape only). It holds 20 K cups out of sight - readily available and beautifully presented. It's something that I'm excited to show off when guests want a drink. It's simple and elegant. I couldn't be more pleased.

review/text: The product meets its description and functions well.  The adhesive strips did not hold the unit underneath my cabinet, so we screwed it in.  The storage tray is a bit hard to move and will easily stay at any angle you pull it down to (even crooked). Each arm moves independently.  It's a great product just use common sense when you choose where to mount it.

review/summary: BEST THERE IS. . .hands down!
review/text: Do you remember that old commercial from the 1970's that was later spoofed in the movie "Airplane?" A couple has just finished dinner when their host offers the visiting husband a second cup of coffee. When he happily accepts, his wife gets a concerned look on her face and thinks, "Jim never has a second cup at home," suggesting that the coffee she makes in her own kitchen must taste like swamp water.<br /><br />Well, Jim and I had that in common. I NEVER had a second cup of coffee. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE coffee, but unless I was cramming for a mid-term at 3:00am in college, I'd never found a cup that was good enough to warrant more. But that all changed when I discovered Douwe Egberts.<br /><br />I'm probably the only person here who isn't Dutch and hasn't had this coffee in the Netherlands. In fact, my first experience with Douwe Egberts was in Las Vegas - I just didn't know what it was called.<br /><br />I LOVE Las Vegas and make the trek 3-4 times a year. For the past few years I've stayed at the Paris Hotel and had breakfast/lunch in their buffet (Lunch is served at 11, so if you get there at 10:30, you can have their amazing breakfast AND lunch for the price of breakfast!) The coffee was the best I'd ever had - no kidding. I'd have cup after cup and couldn't get enough! I'd be more hyped-up and jittery than a washer on spin-cyle, but I didn't care - the coffee was THAT good! After several trips and regardless of the hotel, it got to be that I'd HAVE to make it over to the Paris - JUST FOR THEIR COFFEE. But every time I'd ask the server what kind it was, they'd never tell me. Then one trip I found a server who was from my home town. After schmoozing her for a while, I finally got her to give it up. She went in the back and returned with the name scrawled out on a meal ticket. Yes, it was this nectar from the gods, Douwe Egberts! Perfectly blended and roasted, I promise you won't find a better cup of coffee - even in Seattle. It is a bit pricey (I get this same package at a local Dutch store for $6.20), but if you think about what you pay for a "gourmet" cup of coffee at the corner Starbucks, this is a bargain.<br /><br />Take my word for it. Splurge a little and see if you don't agree with me. Or if you want to just try a single cup before you blow the whole $8 on a half pound, you can always fly to Vegas and get some from the Paris buffet which I also highly recommend, but we'll save that for another review.

review/summary: Douwe Egberts coffee available at BK
review/text: My husband and I enjoy an occasional Croisandwich at Burger King.  Recently, we noticed that their coffee was outstanding.  On our way out of the restaurant, I examined the coffee area for a clue as to the brand used.  It was DE, a brand that I had not heard of before.  Now we stop at BK to get some senior coffees and we often skip the Croisandwich.  The price is right and the blend is always perfect.
