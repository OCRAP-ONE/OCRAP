review/summary: I bought this for the noodles...
review/text: The noodles that come with this pack are already cooked and soft and vacuum-sealed. They're like authentic fresh udon noodles. Just don't overcook them, no more than three minutes at a full boil, otherwise they get too soggy/soft. The soup base is rather plain but does have a mild chicken flavor but it isn't meant to taste like spicy oriental-style ramen noodle soup seasoning packets. This really is meant to be garnished with vegetables for a more complete meal, otherwise it doesn't seem very substantial. I add cooked fiddlehead ferns and spinach, sometimes thinly sliced beef also. One serving per package. About 280 cal and 1.5 grams (1500 mg) sodium per pack/serving. OUCH! But that's very common for these types of soup. I generally don't drink the soup anyway so it's not an issue. These noodles are not fried so there's no oil, just a gram of fat per serving/pack.

review/text: As packaged noodles go, these are really good. I've only had the chicken flavor ones, but even the broth is excellent -- it has an almost lemony tang to it, as well as a reasonable fake-chicken flavor. I chop up a bunch of scallions and cook them with the noodles (this only takes about 2-3 minutes), and add the flavor packet and a few drops tamari. MMMMM!

review/summary: Good noodles.  Doesn't have to be soup!
review/text: These are a large firm fully cooked noodle that just needs to be warmed.  I usually throw out the flavor packet and use them in stir fry with chicken or beef and some peanut sauce.  I can eat them several times a week and not get sick of them.  They are very low fat and if you leave out the flavor packet, they are low sodium.  I am able to buy them locally for about 79c each though.

review/summary: Best toffee you'll find in North America
review/text: When I was growing up in Western NY I used to get Mackintosh Toffee (Now known as Mack Toffee). I still remember the commercial about sticking it in the fridge and slapping it on a counter to break it up. Nestle bought the company and changed the formula to make it a pale imitation of what it once was.<br /><br />This toffee is what Mackintosh Toffee used to be, and frankly should be.<br /><br />Extremely chewy and sticky when warm, with a very strong toffee flavor. The bar comes wrapped and in a small plastic tray, making it handy to put what you don't eat back in the fridge for later. While I prefer the thickness of the Mackintosh bars for breaking it apart and chewing, the flavor and consistency of this toffee make it outstanding. There isn't a mass produced toffee bar in North America that compares to the taste and quality of this toffee.<br /><br />If you like real toffee this is your only choice outside of small candy makers. And even then I think this would be a strong competitor

review/summary: The easiest way to make ice cream
review/text: I love my ice cream maker, but tired of the lengthy prep to make the ice cream base.  This stuff solves the problem in a couple of important ways.  For one thing, it couldn't be easier to use.  For my 1-quart ice cream maker, I mix a package of this stuff with 1 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of cream with a stick blender right in my ice cream maker's bucket.  That takes about 1 minute and I'm ready to start up the ice cream maker.  The ice cream is delicious and the results consistent each and every time.<br /><br />Because I use mostly 2% milk, my end product is low-cal compared to most recipes and virtually dietetic compared to store bought, but it is still delicious and has good consistency.  There are no off-putting ingredients in this mix, which I value highly.  I can still get special flavors of ice cream by decreasing the milk and adding, say, fresh peaches, or cherries or strawberries.  I zap them up right in with the mix and milk with the stick blender.  No mess, fast and really good.<br /><br />Because the process is so easy and satisfying, we have ice cream a lot and really get full value from our ice cream maker and since the ice cream is lower calorie and lower fat than other kinds, I don't feel guilty about this pleasure.  Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Junket Vanilla Ice Cream Mix
review/text: This Junket mix is fast, easy and tasty. I've used this for years and it never fails to please. You can even add any flavoring or fruit you like for a change, peaches, cruched pineapple, cherries, mint with chocolate chips, oooh crushed Butterfinger, maple and pecans, banana and walnuts, coffee, whatever you want. If you prefer the extra rich creamier high end brand ice cream just add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream powder (Amazon.com) and an touch more vanilla or other flavoring (a Teisseire Syrup maybe? also at Amazon)to the mix and you have a world class ice cream. If by some strange chance you have some left you can put it in popcycle molds and pop them in the freezer for later - much later - when everyone is gone (or napping) and everything is done and you can sit and relax while the dragonflies fly and the hummingbirds hum and watch your flowers grow.

review/text: Purchased another powdered ice cream product (Sunbeam/Rival) and then searched for a different brand. Found Junket brand through Amazon. I had never heard of Junket and was surprised to see that it has been on the market for a long time. I bought the vanilla flavor and made it with whole milk, no cream added. It was good, although we thought it could be a little more tasty. Maybe next time we'll add some vanilla extract or other flavoring. It was certainly easy to use. We made a gallon, using 4 packs of Junket and a half-gallon of milk.

The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.

review/text: The Mi-Del Royal Vanilla Cookies do not have a "cream center".  The center is a vanilla-flavored hard sugar disc.  The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc.  After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first.  I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard.  Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase.

My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc.

review/text: These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again.

review/summary: Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

review/summary: My Kids Devour These Cookies
review/text: "Oreos" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination. But my kids sure do! They devour these cookies. I have tried them myself, and they are very similar to the gluten-containing version. But the important thing is that my kids love them and don't have to feel like they are missing out on a vital part of American childhood!

review/summary: Delicious Gluten Free Ginger Snaps From Amazon
review/text: I am on a gluten free diet and enjoy the ginger snaps as a snack.  My cookie jar is often empty as my husband loves to eat them too. We have bought them at major grocery and health food stores. It is wonderful to have fresh ones delivered.  The next order is for 2 boxes a month but then one box a month until winter.  I must try them in cooking:  sauerbraten or pie filling.  They are very tasty and great with tea or coffee.  I receive the MI-Del Ginger Snaps from Amazon.

review/text: I received a basket of gluten free items for Christmas and these Midel cookies were included.  These cookies tasted just like Oreo's and, so far, they are the best gluten free cookies that I have found!  I do not understand why anyone would give them a bad review.  I am glad that we received them as a gift---we just love them!

review/text: The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The "chocolate" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as "bite-size," they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.

review/summary: Gluten free, really? They taste AMAZING!!
review/text: Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste "good" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including "regular" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!

review/summary: Sometimes, they will gluten you.
review/text: I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead.

I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the "K" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price.

review/summary: Delicious Cookies I Can Eat!!!
review/text: These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free!  The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much.  2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen)  Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...

They are moderately sweet and crunchy.<br />They also make a wonderful pie crust. 1 1/2 cup cookie crumbs, 5 TBS margerine, 1 TBS surgar. Mix and pat into pie plate. Bake 10 min at 350 degrees.<br />We couldn't live without them. Thanks Mi-Del!!!

review/summary: A Comparison to Nature's Path EnviroKidz Animal Crackers
review/text: Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)<br /><br />Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavor<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6">Nature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.<br /><br />My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire.

review/summary: A favorite of my autistic son
review/text: Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade.

I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.

review/summary: Amazing, so much better than expected
review/text: I must say, I was hesitant to order a "tub" of demi glace base, but I just don't have the time or inclination to make my own these days.<br /><br />I received the product a few days ago, ordered 2 tubs of Demi-Glace Gold and a tub of their Chicken Demi (I know, but I figured why not?)<br /><br />Opened up the Demi-Glace Gold, and could immediately tell this wasn't just some "base".  The aroma is rich, not over powering, and has a very dense gelatinous texture.<br /><br />I made a roasted chicken that evening and decided to do a quick Cabernet and Port wine reduction, just simple to check out the new product.<br /><br />Made the Demi per the instructions (1T to 4T water, heat for 5 mins), then added it to the wine reduction (another 4T of reduced liquid or so), then added another 4T of chicken stock (just good Chicken stock, not the Chicken DemiGlace I mentioned earlier), let this simmer while whisking over a med-low heat for about 3-4 minutes while it all pulled together.<br /><br />A tiny dash of Kosher salt, and time to serve.<br /><br />The end result was absolutely amazing, and the DemiGlace Gold performed every bit as good as a homemade DemiGlace.  The sauce had that wonderful shine to it, that extra richness that you can't get without a Demi, the right texture, it was bright and complex.  Every bit as good as a sauce made with homemade demi.<br /><br />This product is the real deal, or as close as it's going to get.  It is an amazing time saver, and for the price it's worth every penny.<br /><br />If you are like me and hesitated, wondered if it would be worth the money, wondering if it tasted "fake" or was otherwise a waste of money, do yourself a favor and get this product.<br /><br />(Note to those not familiar with Demi Glace, this is not a "base" per se, and while I guess you could use it as one, I recommend using it to create sauces, experiment a bit, and you'll find that soon, using demi glace, you'll be creating sauces that are every bit as good as anything you'll find in an expensive restaurant.  It's a great way to experience what that "special something" in gourmet sauces is, without having to make your own demi, and without having to invest a few days to make it yourself)

review/text: If you are looking for something that will add flavor to your cooking, the Demi Galace is what you are looking for.<br />Some time ago, I purchased 4oz of Demi Glace from a well known merchant, for $30, my family and I found the flavor excellent. This product is also in the $30 range but you get 16oz making this the most economical way to purchase Demi Glace.<br />You could make your own, but it takes 2 days and constant attention.<br />There are other verities of Demi Glace for poultry, vegetable and fish so what ever you are cooking, you can add remarkable flavor with almost no effort.<br />If you can't use the full 16 oz at once (unless you are a restaurant you wont) you can freeze it and it will keep for months.

review/summary: Expensive but worth it
review/text: MTG has the best concentrates in my opinion.  The Demi-glace gold is a combination of veal and beef.  I wouldn't use this on chicken but it's great for any red meat or pork.<br /><br />To my fellow reviewer who prefers W&S stock; I just went to the kithen and tasted W&S Veal Stock concentrate and than MTG Demi-glace gold.  In my side-by-side comparison, the MTG concentrate tasted much better and is less expensive.  The W&S stock has much more sodium.  I can always add salt but I can't take it out.<br /><br />Refrigerated, this concentrate lasts at least 6 months.  It is not necessary to freeze it unless you won't use it that quickly.  If you have any doubts about the quality, get the 1.5 ounce size which can be found at better grocery stores for a few dollars.

review/text: One of the easiest ways to finish that sauce in a truly professional manner. Where I used to make my own demi - lots of time and effort, now I simply use More than Gourmet products for a comparable result. They're also great for soups- check out the other varieties in the smaller sample sizes to see for yourself how good these products really are. Now, the caveat, you MUST start with good ingredients to create a good finished product, this is not a miracle worker for poor preparation or second rate ingredients, but used as intended it's an excellent time saver.

review/summary: For Sauces --The Gold Standard = 7 Stars
review/text: What an absolutely great product made with quality ingredients and does exactly what its supposed to do. You get a better price on AMZ than anywhere. Forget 5 Stars this product deserves 7 Stars for exceeding expectations for 16 ounces of liquid gold. I used to make sauces like this at home and it is a chore usually only fine restaurants take the time and effort to make. Making this Classic French Demi Glace from scratch will take you at least 24 hours with many reduction stages and you start making a veal stock in a 20 quart stock pot and 14 hours simmering on the stove. Then another 8 hours of work skimming, straining and reducing.  I don't mind working but when I can simply buy a great Veal Demi Glace at a reasonable price--forget the veal bones, veges and 20 qt stockpot.<br /><br />I love this Veal Demi Glace Gold which is a very thick reduction, like a concentrate. I mainly use it as a sauce and will cut it with 3-4 parts of water depending on my use so you can see a little of this can go a long way and is not expensive at all. It is a great value. You can use it in many different ways to up the level of you cooking and your dinner guests will be pleased...even the 7 year olds. I've been told I make the best "gravy" in the world.<br /><br />Here ya go the ingredients say it all:  Veal Stock (Veal Bones, Water), Roux (Made of Wheat Flour and Veal Fat), Modified Food Starch, Mirepoix Stock (Made of Carrot, Celery, and Onion Stocks), Red Wine, Beef Stock, Tomato Paste, Salt, Celery Stock, Carrot Stock. Product Contains Soybeans and Wheat.<br /><br />No junk, no fillers, gum sorbates, msg etc.<br /><br />You will usually only use a few tablespoons (max)at a time but no worries because this will store in your fridge for over a year with zero problems. About 1.5 ounces of this will yield about a cup of sauce when cut with 3-4 oz of water. There are alot of options using this and I encourage you to play with it since it is so versitile.  You can use this in many different ways with your cooking and you are only limited by your imagination...so go play.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the Viande Gold Glace Brown Sauce, Poultry Glace and the Mushroom Essence. Great stuff.

review/summary: A Vital Product for Any Kitchen
review/text: Real stock and demi-glace are the foundations for sauces and gravies, not only for French food, but for just about any cuisine.  The problem is that making them is time-consuming, and even getting the bones from which to start the stock can be problematic.  Enter More Than Gourmet.  Their condensed demi-glace is shelf stable and provides an easy-to-use base for your cooking needs.<br /><br />Is it the same as fresh-made demi-glace?  Well, no.  But it is still pretty good, and it doesn't have that artificial-like resonating flavor so common in dry stock and demi-glace products.<br /><br />I use the demi-glace not only for sauces, but I also use it to add body to pastas, stews, soups, and even Asian dishes.  This is a product I always have in my pantry, and I recommend it to all cooks.<br /><br />(I should add that I used to buy this directly from More Than Gourmet at a higher price.  Buying it form Amazon, at the cheaper price, makes it all the better.)

review/text: These bases give the most amazing flavor to quickie after work meals. There is no need to sacrifice flavor when you're bone tired after work but still have to get a meal on the table. They add so much to a quick sauteed steak or chopped steak. A few mushrooms in the pan after the steak is cooked, a bit of shallot, some wine, a spoonful of this demi, and then a bit of water, let it all come to a boil together and reduce a bit and then finish with a bit of butter off the heat and whisk until the butter melts, add some fresh cracked pepper and pour over your meat and you have a dinner fit for a king. I keep this and the chicken on hand all the time now, you won't find higher quality anywhere and you also can't beat Amazons price for them.

review/text: The first time I used the glace I forgot to add water, lol, don't ask . . .at least the wine in the pan cut it somewhat! :)  it was still very good, more like a 'glaze' over the chops!  When I put on my glasses and actually read the box (!) it was divine.  I almost sound ridiculous writing this, but, it has changed how I cook during the week. Not having to wait hours to get a richness to the sauce or gravy has allowed me to prepare more balanced sit down meals at the end of a full day.  Sounds silly, but you'll see what I mean.  The price held me off for awhile, but I did the auto-ship (discount) and it does last . . .when prepared according to the directions!! :)

review/text: I just finished a six week class in cooking essentials at a local restaurant. We went through stock preparation and used a lot of the restaurant prepared stocks for our dishes. It became clear that I wouldn't have the time to prepare all the stocks, wouldn't have the need for large volume of stock at home, had difficulty finding veal bones, but wanted the wonderful flavor for sauces at home. This product was the answer. My first dish using this was one of the recipes from the class, so we had a good comparison and the meal was right on for flavor and texture. I've since passed the information on MTG product to others from the class.
