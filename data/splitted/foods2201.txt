review/summary: nasty!
review/text: I can't say if it worked for me actually it didn't, the taste was soooo nasty and sooo unbearable that I couldn't keep going with it long enough. Thing is I love tea and thought every tea was good with honey. But not this one, i'd like to vomit in my mouth! When I purchased this it came in the 3 packs, good price 4 it to, so now I'm stuck with full boxes of this stuff, tried to pass it on but I guess I'm the only tea drinker in my family. So to the trash it goes!

review/summary: Best ever cheap chips
review/text: Bought a couple of boxes of Boulder Canyon chips [Parmesan Garlic and this one] for the family gathering over the holidays, and every one of us is delighted with them. Best chips I've ever tasted at this price.<br /><br />Delivered in good time, good packaging, all bags fully sealed, like the easy-access 'tear panels' on the box side. We're about halfway thru both boxes and all bags have been first-class flavor and texture. There's an extra 'something' to the Boulder Canyon chips--a tang or zing--which you don't get in other cheap chips.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm not a chip afficianado or anything, most times I don't notice them, just munch a few. I noticed these ones enough to write this review.

review/summary: Hansen's Natural Soda
review/text: Hopefully, everyone is trying their best to avoid anything sweetened with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), as most readily available soda pops are sweetened right now. If you're lucky and can score some Pepsi Throwback or Heritage Dr. Pepper, more power to you, but these are limited-time only products that leave you jonsing for your next sugar-fix when you burn through your stockpile.<br /><br />To fill in the gaps, there are many choices, but the most economical and flavorful offerings come from Hansen's. Sweetened with natural cane sugar, it's definitely not health food and should still be consumed only in moderation, but it's much better for you than its HFCS-sweetened counterparts. Of all the flavors offered, I prefer their Mandarin Lime, but I also like their Creamy Root Beer, Grapefruit, and Cherry Vanilla Creme. Their Ginger Ale is pretty good, too, but I'd avoid their Key Lime, Raspberry, Kiwi Strawberry, and Pomegranate flavors (the Pomegranate has a mediciny taste).

review/summary: So good!
review/text: This is a great tasting soda, and it uses real cane sugar, not high-fructose corn syrup!<br />I first tried it back in high school, expecting to hate it, because I don't like 7-up or Sprite. I found it remarkably delicious, and it's great it's widely available now, not like it used to be hard-to-find.<br />My only complaint is Amazon's price is 6 dollars for a 6-pack!? A dollar a can! It's on sale for 2/5$ in grocery stores, or less than half price of the one here.<br />I recommend the product, but not the buying option!

review/summary: Pretty good soda
review/text: I had never tried nor heard of Hansen's soda before trying it and I love trying new things. It's a pretty good soda. Right off the bat the thing that sticks out as a selling point is that there is no preservatives, no caffeine, and no sodium. It has all natural flavors. It's sweetened with natural cane sugar - so if you're a person that doesn't like or want high fructose corn syrup this may be for you. The taste of this Mandarin Lime variety is pretty good. It has a nice orange taste with a tough of lime. It could have more lime flavor though to make it a little more tart - which I would like. I look forward to trying other Hansen soda flavors.

review/summary: THE BEST EVER
review/text: i have tried every non-hydrogenated peanut butter from homemade and trader joes and MOM to amish markets, skippy natural and every other natural brand sold at every grocery store i've ever been to! as far as taste goes, this is delicious; like eating fresh roasted peanuts. only 3 grams of sugar, even though both sugar and molassas are listed as ingredients. only 75 mg of sodium!!!!  i couldn't believe it. an exceptional choice for anyone watching salt! 190 calories per 2 TBSP serving...fantastic! the only downfall is the palm oil added (though prefaced on the label as "containing 2% or less of the following"), which i assume is to prevent separation--thus no stirring, which is another bonus.  while i wonder about the shelf life, i loved that "no preservatives" is listed as well as "no refrigeration necessary". hands down, this is the best peanut butter i've ever tasted, as well as the only one i'll ever buy again! now if i could just find it in crunchy too...

review/text: Delicious peanut flavor.  Tasts better than Skippy natural, in my opinion.  I recently switched because I think the Jif has more peanut flavor whereas the Skippy has more shell taste to it.  Does require a little bit of stirring tho, but separation is pretty minimal for an all-natural PB.  Excellent work Jif!<br />Ingredients: Peanuts, Sugar, Palm Oil, Salt, Molasses.

review/summary: Great, but a little too sweet for my taste
review/text: I was looking for a natural peanut butter that did not have to be refrigerated and stirred.  The refrigerated type always seems to harden on me no matter what I do.  After some research here on amazon based on customer reviews, this is the one I found to be the best.<br /><br />Pros: It is delicious and really is natural.  The low sodium content is a plus!  Con: My only problem with this is it contains 3 grams of sugar.  Low, but the natural refrigerated one I buy only has 2 grams of sugar.  In fact the only ingredient it contains is peanuts.  I find peanuts to be naturally sweet on their own so I personally don't even need the sugar. I have grown accostomed to my PB less sweet.  Believe it or not a gram of sugar is a noticeable difference.<br /><br />However, I realize I am probably not the norm so I understand why JIF added sugar.<br />Due to my personal preference I took off one star for the sugar factor, but again it is just my personal opinon.  I will continue to purchase unless I find another natural no-stir type with less sugar.<br /><br />All in all it does taste fantastic and I praise JIF and other PB companies for removing the horrible trans fats!

review/summary: Peanut butter without the oily mess
review/text: I love the taste of Jif peanut butter. Compared to regular Jif creamy peanut butter, this natural peanut butter still tasted the same, perhaps slightly better if anything at all. However, I am trying to get our family to use as many organic (or close to organic) products as possible, and products with as few ingredients as possible tend to be better in that case. Jif Natural Peanut Butter only contains peanuts, palm oil, sugar, and possibly traces of salt and molasses. The regular version has these ingredients plus vegetable oil and mono and diglycerides. I actually found the natural peanut butter to cost the same amount as the regular kind, so of course I bought the natural version. And it tastes great, so I'm happy with my purchase.

review/summary: Expert Opinion: My Favorite Peanut Butter Of All Time
review/text: Yes I am an expert at peanut butter taste. It's always been my favorite. But this peanut butter is so good I decided to sit and type a review. We always try to eat organic at our house and mostly we were eating the Smuckers organic. I like it just fine. Stirring it was always a pain. So I tried all the other natural ones. Skippy, okay. And the rest. But this Jif Natural is amazing. Probably the molasses. I just heard peanut butter is going to skyrocket in price because of a shortage so I'm about to buy a bunch of 40oz bottles of this stuff!!!!!!<br /><br />PS- try mixing this with some MRM Vanilla Protein Isolate, a frozen banana, and milk. It will blow your mind and beef up your muscles.

review/summary: No SUGAR, please
review/text: This peanut butter is good--like candy, in fact.  I don't like refined sugar at all in my diet.  And I'm not a health nut.  The diabetes epidemic AND obesity epidemic are leading up to a health care crisis.  Lots of money is spend on these conditions, and lots of doctors get tied up treating them.  What's the cause?  Added sugars in foods.  You can control sugars you can see, but you can't do anything about hidden sugars.  If Jif/Smuckers really wants to do more than marketing, let them cut the sugar.  That could make a real difference.  And I'm not too lazy to stir and I have a refrigerator, so I don't need palm oil either.

review/summary: Wonderful Rose Flavor
review/text: I am a lover of tea, like many. Unlike many, however, I am also a lover of all things rose-flavored. It is very difficult to find a good rose tea, and even more difficult to find a rose tea that is caffeine free. This one is perfect, though. It has a lovely, authentic rose flavor and scent with all the benefits of caffeine free rooibos tea. I taste the rose more than the lavendar in this tea. If you like a floral tea, definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Calming
review/text: My first impression of this tea is really good. Sometimes I get anxious or upset, and it is hard to break out of it. I started today rather agitated, and this seemed to really help. For me, chamomile and passionflower are really useful for calming nerves on occasion, so this tea is a good combo (whereas, valarian root has an opposite effect of calm for me). I like a lot of teas, but for me, the flavor and smell weren't the most appealing. But medicinally, I could tell that it was actually working and I felt quite a bit more pleasant and less stressed by mid-day, which helped me to deal with the day better. Depending upon your body, it may cause a bit of sleepiness as well. With most teas (even the other Republic of Tea blends), I use 2-3 bags during the day (often steeping twice to get the most out of each), but with this tea, I could only use 1 bag. After the first cup, I realized that refreshing my cup with a second tea bag might be a little too calming! The same things don't usually work for everyone, but if you are looking for something calming, hopefully it will help you as well... Republic of Tea seems to be good-quality tea in general, and with the number of bags, though expensive, it tends to last a while.

review/summary: Somewhat calming, very floral-y taste
review/text: I love the be well tea line that Rebublic of Tea has come out with.  Let me preface this review by saying that at first I was skeptical, but all of the teas from this line that I have tried are surprisingly true to their claims; none of them are simply a marketing gimmick.  So far, I have purchased "Get charged", "Get relaxed", and "Get Smart".<br /><br />  But I digress, on to "get relaxed".  This tea is somewhat calming.  If you are prone to panic attacks, then this isn't exactly a miracle tea.  Also, a lot of the relaxation I have found with OTHER calming teas comes partially from sipping on them slowly with a nice book, savoring the flavor.  However, the taste of this tea is absolutely disgusting (the only one that tastes worse is "Get smart").  BUT that is because although I love the scent of florals, I cannot stand floral flavors, and this tea is dominated by notes of rose and lavender.  I have found that I receive the most relaxation if I do take the time to sip this tea slowly (although painstaking). But usually if I have had a somewhat stressful day, I'll just go ahead and plug my nose and down this quickly and it still does calm me down a bit.  That being said, I dislike the flavor so much that I doubt I will repurchase.<br /><br />  In summation/final thoughts: If you like and/or don't mind floral-tasting things, then I would highly recommend this tea.  It is calming to a point, especially if you take the time to sip slowly and smell the aromas.  However, if you really don't like the taste of lavender, roses, etc, I would say this is a miss.  Also, if you have problems with severe anxiety attacks, I would recommend consulting a doctor before trying to use this in combination with or as a replacement for any sort of medication you might be taking.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:  Although this has nothing to do with "get relaxed", if you are interested in trying new types from this tea line, I swear up and down by the "Get charged" tea.  I have difficulty focusing, and I've practically stopped taking my ADD medication because the tea (without caffeine!!!) helps me focus almost as well without any bad side affects (but only drink one serving if you try it--any more caused me some stomach pain/light-headedness).  I find the "get smart" tea does almost just as well, but not quite; I ALWAYS end up going for "get charged" because it tastes a million times better.  Also, with "get charged", it really is great for when you know you should go to the gym but just aren't feeling up to it--it really gives you that energy that makes you ready to get up and go!  :)<br />***I find it important to note that my review of "get relaxed" is based upon when I have NOT had "get charged", caffeine, or ADD medication that day.  I do not like the idea of mixing "uppers" with "downers" and will only drink "get relaxed" if I have not had any stimulants and am solely anxious from environmental stressors.

It also has a very clean crisp taste to it. They aren't too sweet and don't leave a nasty after taste. This particular flavor is really tasty, and one of my favorites. I'm always talking to my brother who's on diet that he should try them. They come in 4 different flavors that I know of...there might be more though... not sure. I simply just love these, enough said.

review/summary: DOGGIES DON'T LIKE THEM
review/text: I don't know why but my dogs are not interested in these treats.  They love chewing on other brands of bully sticks but not this one.  I guess they all have their favorites like people do. They don't compare to bully sticks which are meatier and tastier looking.  But who knows, your dog(s) may like them?

review/summary: Picky eater loves Beefeaters
review/text: My darling dog is a picky eater.  We have given away a lot of snacks because she refused to eat the snack. She paused on it for a little while but she eventually chewed one.  After that, she would eat one every time we put it out for her.  She likes beefy chews and this one meets her criteria.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AQ6EC">Beefeaters Beef Twists, 5-Inch (Pack of 75 Twists)</a> Its so nice to give her a good treat with a good price.  Of course, I would like to see the price cheaper but it is comparable in price to others and this one meets a picky eater and wins.

review/text: I was slightly apprehensive at the price but decided to give it a go. I was amazed at how smooth this balsamic is you could drink it straight from the bottle. I use it regularly over salad and hard cheeses and as a dipping vinegar for a fresh warm baguette. It can almost be a guilty pleasure except there is nothing to feel guilty about less the price; there are many health benefits to adding vinegar to ones diet  You have got to try this!

review/summary: oatmeal...NOT!!!
review/text: This product called "Hot Cereal" came under Instant Oatmeal but I/we saw absolutely nothing that even<br />remotely resembled an oat.  There was no flavor despite the label and if one is supposed to feast with the eyes first, then I/we must say, without exaggeration, that it looked like pulverized cement mix with no aroma.  The taste?  Completely absent, defying any description in words.  To boot, the shipping fee is greater than the cost of what the manufacturer considers a food.

review/summary: Not very good and overpriced
review/text: As a stand alone cereal it is barely edible.  It is not really sweet enough and has a texture too much like malt-o-meal for my tastes.  Plus you can barely taste any fruit flavoring.  I ended up putting it on toast from Julian'a bakery (making a 5 net carb breakfast) and it pleasantly added to the toasts flavor.  I will not buy this again. If it were less than 25 cents per package I might consider it if I keep the bread around.

review/summary: Great Convenience
review/text: This product is very much like heavy cream. It is great to use to add it to things to make them richer, or give them an edge above the usual. The best part is you don't have to keep the cans refridgerated, of course, only after opening. I like to use mine for making soups and in batter mixes. I plan to add some in spaghetti sauce today. It is good to add to foods that might be too hot like some prepackaged Indian foods. I love Indian and Mexican foods, but sometimes they are too spicy hot for me. This item will definitely tone that down for you. Here's the only drawback:  The fat and caloric content is high. Don't use too much of it at once. The stuff will kill you. It's great to have on hand, and it's very tasty, good to add to hot chocolate, too. I used to, sometimes, get cream, or heavy whipping cream, but I would forget about it, and it would sour in the fridge. Anyway, this product is of great convenience and I think, everyone would like having it on hand.

When i received my packages, the boxes were all messed up and when i open the first can of cream it was spoiled.  i looked at the date and i was current, but the product was spoiled. So i opened another can and the same thing, spoiled.  Are the products not check for quailty before the are sent out???  I was very upset about this!  I tried calling, but till now have not received a response.  I will never buy ediable products from here again.  Another thing is that along with the item I also purchase some other product and it was spoiled also.  So So upset!!!

Don't look at the fat content...focus on the taste....tastes richer than regular cream.

review/text: I came across this product by raiding my local Japanese deli.<br /><br />The taste is excellent. Strawberry and chocolate flavors fit in seamlessly and complement each other. Fruit cuts the sweetness, while the chocolate eliminates the (possible) sourness. Overall flavor is creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />I find myself reaching into the box for the next bite size candy... until there are none left. Although less gluttonous people may not experience the same issue.

review/summary: Fantastic grain free treat
review/text: My 2 shelties (20 and 28 lbs) love these biscuits, I've bought them several times now. I open the bag and sometimes I smell the cinnamon... LOVE (I'd previously bought Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish treats and WOW those are FISHY, so the smell of the cinnamon in these Instinct treats is very nice for a change.)  But sometimes I'll get a box that smells more like the duck meal than the cinnamon.  In the box, these Instinct treats are in a resealable bag to keep them fresh after you've opened the bag, but I always transfer treats into a doggie cookie jar.<br /><br />So you know the size, each Instinct biscuit treat is 2 inches long, about 3/8" thick, and 3/4" wide at the narrowest part of the bone shape and 1" wide at the widest part of the bone shape. 25 calories per treat. These Instinct treats are sized so they'll fit into treat puzzle toys - like the medium size Premier Busy Buddy Squirrel Dude toys I have for my shelties. I'll put one or two of these Instinct "cookies" in each of the furry kids' Squirrel Dude toys and they'll be busy for 30 minutes trying to get every last crumb out.  For giving as a reward when they come inside when I call them, I break one of these biscuits in half and give half to each sheltie.  Most the treats were intact in the boxes I received, only a handful of biscuits were broken.<br /><br />To sum it up, they're Made in the USA, they're gluten free and they're priced great! Fantastic for my boy sheltie who can't have gluten because of epilepsy.

review/text: I am not sure where the previous reviewer got their information, but if you do actual research, on actual websites (some you have to subscribe to), Nature's Variety is a 5 star dog food - INCLUDING the Instinct treats.  This is why I feed NV food and treats to my purebread dog and cat.  I would much rather feed my pet human grade food that is made as nature intended animals to eat...it's worth every extra penny I spend.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt from Petsumerreport.com, which is one of the websites that gave this treat 5 stars:  "Plus: The Nature's Variety representative told me the ingredients are human quality/grade. This food contains friendly bacteria (benefits the intestinal system and in turn the immune system of the pet); included in Guaranteed Analysis (company guarantees viable bacteria).  Minus: Contains Garlic - controversial ingredient."<br /><br />While they did mention the use of garlic, the product was still rated 5 stars, and my dog has NEVER gotten sick off these biscuits (I only give him NV biscuits).  They smell like actual food and have a nice consistency - not "cardboard" like some pet treats made of ingredients you don't even recognize.  You can easily break each treat into 3-4 pieces if using for training purposes.<br /><br />I feel the product should actually be used by the reviewer in order to make a credible review of the product.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND ALL NATURE'S VARIETY PRODUCTS, based on ACTUAL use!!!!!  Give them a try, your dog will thank you :-)

review/summary: Great Grain Free Treat!
review/text: We're careful about what we feed our dogs so it was nice to find a grain free treat that they really love.  We've also gotten the lamb and mint version and they loved that too.  It's also great that this is on subscribe and save so we never run out of treats that have our dogs running into their kennels for their "kennel treats"!

review/summary: Always arrived broken
review/text: The biscuits seemed to be of good quality, the dogs loved them. The delivery was timely. I subscribed to this product, receiving it every month until I cancelled. The problem with the biscuits was that many were broken. At least one half of each box was broken or crumbled biscuits. The only boxes that weren't broken were the ones delivered a few days after I cancelled. Had they been delivered in good condition, I would have continued to buy these biscuits, but they were not in the condition they should have been.

review/summary: Great treats for dogs
review/text: My Akita loves the Instinct Grain-Free Duck Meal, Sweet Potato and Cinnamon dog biscuits for what it is.  Tastee, smells good, and solidly made with all the natural incredients as discribed in the package and by other reveiewers.<br />My dog is real finicky about her treats and would not touch the expensive brands I bought before. We tried Natural Balance Duck, sweet potato combintation for 2 years, but those biscuits got smaller and crumble easily. I switched over to Natures Instinct for past year & half, and she loves them, BEGS for them.  I knew I found a winner.  Then, knowing I could get these combo-packs online at a good price, sealed the deal for me(us). I just completed my third 2-2combo order with this seller.  They shipment arrives on time, no problems with the product (sealed fresh and way under the indicated expiration date).<br />If you have a finicky dog, get this product.  If you don't have a finicky dog, get this product anyway.

review/text: These dog biscuits are just the right size for a dog treat and my dogs love them.  I feel good that they have healthy ingredients and are grain free.  My only complaint after ordering several boxes and several orders, is that sometimes the biscuits arrive in the box whole and unbroken, and sometimes they arrive totally broken up into little pieces.  If another shipment arrives in broken up little pieces, then I probably won't order them again.

review/summary: Yummy grain free biscuit that's priced great
review/text: My 2 shelties (25 and 30 lbs) love these biscuits.  I open the bag and smell the cinnamon... LOVE.  (I'd previously bought Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish treats and WOW those are FISHY, so the smell of the cinnamon in these Instinct treats is very nice for a change.)  In the box, these Instinct treats are in a resealable bag to keep them fresh after you've opened the bag.<br /><br />So you know the size, each Instinct biscuit treat is 2 inches long, about 3/8" thick, and 3/4" wide at the narrowest part of the bone shape and 1" wide at the widest part of the bone shape.  25 calories per treat.  These Instinct treats are sized so they'll fit into treat puzzle toys - like the medium size Premier Busy Buddy Squirrel Dude toys I have for my shelties.  I'll put one or two of these Instinct "cookies" in each of the furry kids' Squirrel Dude toys and they'll be busy for 30 minutes trying to get every last crumb out.<br /><br />To sum it up, they're Made in the USA, they're gluten free and they're priced great! Fantastic for my boy sheltie who can't have gluten because of epilepsy.

review/text: The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the treats are smaller than what my seventy-five pound fur baby is used to. She loves them though, and I love the smell! You can tell they are quality just by the scent alone. They smell like cinnamon and sweet potato! I love the fect that they came with three boxes as well. We are going grain free with our baby so these treats are just what we were looking for ingredient wise.

review/summary: Folgers Chocolate Silk Coffee Review
review/text: My husband and I are coffee drinkers from way back. We pride ourselves on having good taste, as well as an eye for price for the pocketbook, We have found a coffee that is wonderful to drink, especially in the evening, and easy on the pocketbook. That coffee is Folgers Chocolate Silk and we purchase it 6 cans at a time, or more if they have it available.<br />I never want to run out of this flavor. It is hearty, bold and sensuous. I have never tasted a coffee so smooth as this one and once you try it you'll be hooked. If you love flavored coffee, and chocolate, this is your coffee, you'll be thrilled.

review/summary: Horrible taste.
review/text: I bought this for something new to try at work, as me and my coworkers usually take turns bringing in coffee and they don't mind trying something new now and then. First, after making it, the whole office smelled of burnt chocolate and coffee. The smell was really nauseating. Most of my coworkers were brave enough to try it out despite the smell, and none of us enjoyed it. To me it tasted like hot water and a hint of burnt chocolate. Pretty much no coffee taste. Out of the 7 or 8 of my coworkers who tried it, I could not find one person who enjoyed it. I could not even give this coffee away, ended up tossing the whole canister. I definitely do not recommend this.

Sorry, we won't be buying this anymore, we'll find some new flavor in the supermarket instead.  What is happening to our food?  We had to dispose of all six cans.......what a waste of precious coffee.

review/text: After my daughter turned one she lost interest in nursing and she refused whole milk.  I saw Gerber Yogurt juice and decided to give it a try.  The first time I gave it to my picky daughter she wasn't sure about it; but then she began to love it.  I soon began diluting a 4 oz bottle with whole milk.  Now, a 4 oz bottle will last us 2 days because I barely add any to her sippy of whole milk, just enough to give it the flavor of the juice.  I am glad that amazon sells this in bulk because we have really gone through the yogurt juice since my daughter turned one.  Now that my stock is about up in the cabinet I am going to try to give her plain whole milk.  I am glad that I found this juice to get her to drink something.

review/text: I'm from Holland and have never gotten used to drinking the watered down, light coffees. So was happy to find the Senseo machine and was used to drinking the Senseo Hazelnut pods until they stopped smelling and tasting like hazelnut. I used to subscribe to get the lower price so either I received several bad batches (several boxes of 6 packages) or the Senseo coffee just isn't what it used to be. So, tried the Baronet and I'm hooked. The aroma that comes from the bag as soon as I open it: wonderfully hazel-nutty and the taste is excellent. Changed my subscription to Baronet.

I buy the hazelnut, the cinnamon, the french vanilla and the only one I did not like was the Almond.<br />The super pods are great! I only need ONE for a full cup of coffee in my Senseo machine! I love this brand and highly recommend it to anyone who likes really strong coffee in their senseo machine!

review/summary: Baronet doesn't take the place of Senseo
review/text: Being addicted to Senseo Vienna Waltz Hazelnut Coffee, I've been desperate to find a replacement since Sara Lee decided not to continue making it.  I was delighted to find Baronet Hazelnut Medium Roast on Amazon and ordered some immediately.  The first cup I made was the most bitter coffee I'd tasted in years.  I made another cup today using the 2-pod holder and the coffee was less bitter, but definitely doesn't taste nearly as good as Senseo.  I'm hoping they'll bring back Senseo Vienna soon so I won't have to give up drinking coffee!
