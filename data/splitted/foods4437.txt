review/summary: Not bad but not good either
review/text: I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening.

review/summary: Way too much oat bran = chewy but dry cookies
review/text: I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these "cookies". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!

review/summary: Good Taste and Flavor But a Little on the Dry Side
review/text: This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!

review/summary: Pretty Good Cookie
review/text: First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for "store-bought." If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too.

review/summary: Soft and chewy but a bit too sweet!
review/text: I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how Quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.<br /><br />For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.<br /><br />It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood.

review/text: I recently received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.  I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two "cookie monsters" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)

review/text: Quaker Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy. I feel good about buying this because the ingredients are simple & I have used Quaker for years. Is a much better alternative than the other regular cookies you see in the store. Packed with raisins & whole grains. Great to pack, on road trips or just in your purse. Kid tested and approved! I received this product complimentary to test through Influenster's VoxBox program.

review/text: My kids and grandkids absolutely love these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies.  I thought maybe they wouldn't like them because of the raisins, but I don't think they even noticed them as they scarfed their way through the cookies.  I was able to get in a bit or two before they got ahold of them, and I agree, very good cookies!

review/text: Soft Cookie, if you didn't unwrap yourself you would swear your grandma baked them...my girls are not oatmeal raisin fans, but they fight over my Quaker soft baked cookies, I keep these in my cubicle, they are my go to snack, if I had a nasty client I'll pop one in my mouth and take a time out. I am a big cookie fan and I like that these are individually wrapped and will stay fresh until I need one. I original received a sample from influenster website but have since purchased them since my girls ate my original influenster provided cookie.

I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins.

review/text: From Influenster I received the Quaker Soft Baked Cookie. With this product, after dinner one night, I divided it up into 3 equal portions. One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our 1 1/2 year old daughter.<br />Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.<br /><br />I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first.

review/summary: Yummy cookies!
review/text: I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail.

review/summary: Make sure you have a drink
review/text: These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more "oatmealy" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it.

review/text: Came as an 8-pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about 1/4 inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!

review/summary: Not bad for mass produced.  Not really great either.
review/text: Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.

review/summary: Yum.
review/text: Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack.

review/summary: Plain
review/text: Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with Quaker Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches.

review/summary: Bland and dry
review/text: I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!

review/summary: Soft, but not very much flavor
review/text: As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again.

review/summary: tasty, but a tad on the dry side
review/text: I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up.

review/summary: A Bit on the Sweet Side
review/text: I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled "oatmeal" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible.

review/summary: okay, but nothing extraordinary
review/text: If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over.

review/text: I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job, Quaker :)<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox.

review/text: I received this cookie to test from Influenster.  I had the raisin cookie and it was really so good!  I like that they use whole grains to make the cookie.  Breakfast really isn't my favorite meal of the day and I like something that is fast and easy.  This cookie is a good breakfast option for me.  I'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  The cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.  I really liked it and will be buying more!

review/text: These new Quaker Oat Soft Baked Cookies are amazing! Soft and chewy. Very fresh and like they were just baked the day you bought them. My kids love them and it's a great way to give them their whole gains with a small serving of fruit. They are also great to pack in for a snack or a low calorie desert at 170 calories per cookie! I love these and will continue to purchase!

review/summary: Can we have this for breakfast?
review/text: I received a sample of this product for free to test from Influenster and Quaker.  The cookie did not last long and I ended up going out to buy a whole new box.<br /><br />My son is three and he said the cookie tasted "kind of like a muffin" and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day.  The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for 10 seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren't individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  They are pretty great!  Oh, and they're not bad nutritionally... so go ahead and eat one for breakfast... I won't tell.
