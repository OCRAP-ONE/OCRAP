review/text: When we placed the order, we had a baby coming and were expecting a lot of sleepless hours.  What better to recharge with than good old fashion chicken soup?  Well, now baby just got here and if the first couple of nights is any indication, we will spend a lot of sleepless nights feeding and calming the baby and recharging ourselves with this delicious soup.  One package isn't enough, but two packages and some rice makes a really good filling meal.  And it's as easy as boiling water.

review/summary: Warm and hearty
review/text: I am so glad that I found Lipton Cup-a-Soup online. I used to search for it at grocery stores. I can't believe they don't have it -- it's so delicious! They have the noodle versions, but not the cream of chicken. Why?<br /><br />It was so precious and hard to find that when I could, I rarely wasted it on the indulgence of a single cup of soup. Instead, I used it in a recipe my mother taught me growing up and then I added my own special addition, here's how to make it:<br /><br />1 can of Canned white potatoes<br />1 can of sweet peas<br />1 packet of Lipton Cream of Chicken Cup-a-Soup<br />1/2 package of smoked sausage (That's my addition)<br /><br />First, heat up the smoked sausage in a 2 quart sauce pan. I like a little brownness and to be healthier drain off the fat when it's done.<br />Next, add the potatoes and cook them until they turn somewhat translucent<br />While they are cooking, open the peas and drain the pea juice into the potato can<br />Add the cup-a-soup to the pea juice and mix until there are no lumps<br />Pour the soup into the cooking sausage and potatoes<br />Continue cooking until the potatoes are done to your liking<br />Now, add the peas to the mix and stir carefully so you don't break the peas<br /><br />Let it cook a little longer until the peas are hot.<br />Serve and enjoy.<br /><br />It's delicious and easy meal. Simple to prepare. Simple to clean up. My grandmother is a pretty traditional cook. She'd never had this dish and now, she asks for it all the time. She even asked me to look online to see if we could get the Cup-o-soup so she could have it more often!

review/summary: Great survivalist stock item!
review/text: After looking for the classic ramen flavor packets on the web along with a million other folks and finding nothing, I got the bright idea to try these Lipton soups for flavoring rice.  I am here to say they are the absolute best rice flavorings there are, bar none, and that includes the $9 small bottles of flavoring all the way from Japan.  They beat the heck out of ramen flavor packets!  I usually cook approx 1/2 a cup of dry rice at a time for a quickie lunch or a dinner side, that makes two eight ounce servings, and one packet of Lipton Cup-A-Soup is perfect to flavor that amount of rice.  You can literally have a different flavor each day of the week.  If you're up to it, put a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet and pan brown the noodles before adding to the flavored rice.  Try them all!  I have yet to find one that isn't terrific!

review/summary: Not like Grandma's but Quite Good.
review/text: Lipton Soup from Canada has another winner in there Veggie Soup. I originally bought the Chicken Noodle with White Meat and thought it was great for a powdered Soup and a quick alternative to coffee. Unfortunately it's unavailable on Amazon right now and I thought the Veggie soup would be a nice alternative.<br /><br />Well it didn't disappoint, it was quite good for a powdered soup. Although my cup of soup did not look like the picture of there cup of soup on the package.<br />However it was tasty but I still prefer the Lipton Chicken Noodle with White Meat Soup over this Spring Vegetable Soup.<br /><br />This soup is fairly healthy, its all natural and low in everything that is bad for you. True it's a bit salty, but if you add a little extra water it will be fine.<br /><br />This soup is consistently good unlike Grandma's. Depending on the holiday or occasion Grandma's soup would not be consistent all the time. It all depended on how much she indulged as to how the soup came out. I thought it might be a good idea to keep a couple of pouches of Lipton handy just in case.

review/summary: Just Add Water!
review/text: I like the Cup-a-Soup line, especially this Cream of Chicken, mostly for it's convenience (portability, ease of preparation, and, yes, the taste/edification factor).  I keep an array of just add water food and beverage products in a waterproof pouch for quick hot meals on the go (travel) and in a watertight box for disaster preparedness.  Things like instant soup, hot and cold beverage powders, and freeze-dried fruits that are compact and store for long periods are a good back-up source of nutrition, and it makes chemically purified water more palatable.  Instant Cream of Chicken Cup-a-Soup is not my only option in an emergency of course, but, when I find myself needing a simple, instant, inexpensive, comforting, hot meal in my Sierra cup while sheltering from the cold up in the mountains, it perfectly suits my needs.<br /><br />For my purposes, I don't much care about the scary amounts of sodium and trans-fats, nor the evil soy (oooo!)...  LOL.  It's not something that I consume everyday (unlike millions of Japanese people who don't seem to be in an estrogen crisis oddly... hmmmm).  In fact, I seek out soy protein products, like instant Miso paste (and Soy Joy bars), for their high nutritional value in compact form.

review/text: I had really low expectations for this soup because come on, it's dry soup. But it's actually really good. I made 2 packets in 1 mug because 1 wasn't enough. Even 2 packets (plus water) didn't fill up my mug completely. It's a very light soup with a good flavor. Good tasting noodles, although small, it's great for sipping. I can imagine this being very easy to eat while ill. It's not salty like other reviews claim, it's perfect. Either way I want to eat this soup while reading a good book. I really like this as an easy snack.

A quick pick me up in the office, right around when the air conditioning kicks in on high and your nose starts to freeze off - perfect!<br /><br />I just ordered another flavor, spring veggies, to give it a try.  And with 60 calories for the chicken and 45 calories for the veggies, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />About nutritional facts - compare this soup to ramen noodle cups - some with 300 calories and more than 10 grams of fat - this is a great alternative.

review/summary: The best soup ever!
review/text: I cannot find this soup locally and remember eating it a few times when I was younger. I was very pleased to find it here in bulk. I am very busy and also do not spend a lot of time on meals, could be because I am single and like to make something fast. First mistake I made when making first cup was just adding mix to water and stirring it a bit and thinking the clumps would even out, not the case. It requires � water so I now add the mix to my cup, get a small whisk out to smooth it, then add the water and use the whisk again, comes out with no clumps now. I usually add a ton of saltines to it and stay full for hours. I love this soup and am amazed at how much I am eating it as a `meal'. It is also very nice to have something warm when it is cold outside. You will not regret this buy. Great value!

What a waste of money... It tastes like Maruchan ramen noodle soup, but much worse, and it's so salty as well! I had to add like two cups of water, not 3/4 cup as told in the directions. I should have ordered instant Nong Shim noodles instead. The rest of the soup boxes will be donated to somewhere...

review/text: In 1865, Thomas Johnstone Lipton went to the United States and held various jobs. After five years, he returned to Britain, and opened grocery store that soon blossomed into a whole chain. Nowadays, Lipton (now owned by Unilever) is known for two products, teas and instant soups. Well, I must say that I love Lipton's Cup-a-Soups, they come in a convenient envelope, only need hot water added, and are relatively low in fat, calories and sodium. (Yes, any packaged product will be higher in sodium than homemade, but at 540 mg per 13g envelope, it's not that bad.)<br /><br />I keep a box of the Chicken Noodle with White Meat Cup-a-Soups in my desk at work, and on particularly cold days, I make up a cup. Also, I must say that when I am rushed, I can make a delicious lunch out of a quick cheese sandwich and a cup of this soup! So, overall let me just say that this is a delicious product, one that is sure quick, delicious and quite satisfying!

review/text: The wife takes cup a soup to work to have with her lunch or for a quick pick me up. The local grocers don't carry this in our neighborhood so it's Amazon to the rescue. Lipton makes awesome chicken noodle soup. I remember my mom making it and you could smell it in the whole house. Great snack!

review/text: It's not too expensive, so not too bad of an investment if you need a quick snack lunch and don't have access to a microwave or such.  It does take 2 packets for a decent mug of soup, and you really do need to let it brew in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.  Adding croutons does help, but overall it's not that great-there are better offerings out there.  I don't think I'll get another order, sorry.

review/text: I've been eating and enjoying Lipton Cup a Soup since I was a little girl. It's a quick, cheap, easy, low calorie snack that is convenient to make.<br /><br />I know a lot of people talk about the salt content, which is high. I'm a salt junkie but it would be nice if they could lower it a bit. I usually add more water to it to dilute it. While that doesn't reduce the salt content, it doesn't taste as salty.<br /><br />The hearty noodle variety is my absolute favorite but it's become hard to find in my area.

review/text: I had high hopes for this product. you really need to use at least 2 packages to get enough flavor in a single cup if you're not adding any additional goodies to it.<br /><br />I like to make it in a coffee cup and add some shredded carrots and veggie crumbles to spruce it up a bit. since there are so many in the package it will last me quite a while and I can keep them in my locker on campus (law student) for when I am unexpectedly stuck there and not able to go home for a meal.<br /><br />It's quick, easy, low in calories and pretty cheap. so all in all it's a good value but I don't think it will be a staple in my pantry.

review/text: I am just finishing up a Spring Veggie Cup-a-Soup (that of which I received today), and feeling a bit nostalgic; I haven't had it in years...not since I was a kid and still living at home (longer ago than I care to admit :). It tastes as good as I remmeber...perhaps even better!<br /><br />Since my younger days, I've become much more aware of what's inside the prepared food I consume, and I am happy to say that this soups gets "two thumbs up"; no MSG, artificial flavors or coloring. The broth doesn't contain any meat, but is made with egg yolk, and the dehydrated peas and carrots might contain milk (as stated on the nutrional panel), so if you are vegan, I'm afraid that this soup wouldn't be for you.<br /><br />I looked in my local supermarket for this flavor, and couldn't find it, so I was pleased to see that it was available at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Spring Veggie Cup-a-Soup could very well be going onto my "subscribe and save" account, as it's something I will alway want to have around for a quick and easy accompliment to a lite meal or late night snack!

review/summary: Not meant to be a meal, but a terrific filler
review/text: This soup is great tasting.  It does contain quite a bit of sodium, but for those who think it is too salty can add more water to adjust the taste to their liking.  Also, as many others have previously stated, there is a severe lack in meat, vegetables, and even the noodles...what do you expect from a soup that came from a box?  A gourmet meal is not very likely.  Overall, this soup is great and quick to make.  Many can use the soup on the go as a snack to hold them over for an actual meal or even a late night snack for those who don't feel like eating a meal.  This product in my opinion, is great for busy bodies who sometimes have to skip or hold off a meal.

review/summary: Hearty chicken flavor, doesn't taste artificial, yummm!
review/text: This soup is amazing! It has that hearty home-cooked chicken flavor without the preservative flavor canned soups can have. It's great for a light snack, after being out in the cold, or when sick. I just half-fill my mug and add a packet, and microwave for a couple of minutes and let it stand for a minute and it's done. Very easy.<br /><br />I'm really picky with my soup and I hate most canned soup. They taste too much like preservatives. Powder soups taste too much like salt to me. But this soup somehow lets all that chicken aroma through.

review/summary: Chicken flavored salt I can enjoy anytime!
review/text: Seriously, I do like this stuff.  I hope the calories I'm saving by eating this soup sometimes in lieu of a full lunch makes up for the salt in this cheap but strangely addicting instant soup.<br /><br />Here's how it works: I arrive at work with my coffee or latte, get a coffee refill, then later rinse out the coffee cup (typically a large disposable paper cup), dump one or two packets of this soup into the cup, add hot water, and it's lunch time!  One thing I've discovered is that there's so much salt in this soup I can make it half strength -- double the water that is -- and it's still enjoyable if a bit on the thin side.<br /><br />And, the chicken heartiness soothes my caffiene wracked nerves and keeps me going and going.  Not only that, but every once in a while I even find what seems to be a little tiny bit of chicken!

review/text: I can't believe I paid a nickle of my hard-earned money for this stuff.<br />I also can't believe all the good reviews it got. You put it in a cup, add 3/4 cup of boiling water and stir it up. A bunch of white stuff that may be dried noodles will be floating on top. After a LOT MORE stirring, and it's been sitting there for a while (long enough to be too cool to eat), the noodles get more-or-less soft.<br />Take a sip. It taste like hot tap water with a hint of chicken broth. On top of that it gave me heartburn. I guess THAT part is MY problem, and YMMV.<br />I won't even give this junk away.<br />Read the label: One CUP of this "soup" has 25% of the daily requirement of SODIUM!

review/summary: Low Calories, but tastes really good
review/text: When I first got the product, I was a bit disappointed to realize that it's quite low calorie (50 calories/packet, 4 packets/box, 2 packets = 1 1/2 cups of soup). To me, that means that it doesn't really suffice as a meal, which I was hoping it would sometimes. However, on the upside, it does taste really good. Sometimes it's just what you need. So I consider it a decent product, even though it's so low-calorie it can't be anything close to a real meal.

The other regular Chicken noodle one is not like this. I know I put enough water so that is not the reason, I guess that's why they call it "hearty". I still love the flavor but next time I will add more water than they suggested and see if the consistency is better.<br /><br />UPDATE: Adding more water fixes this problem, it's delicious and edible now!

review/text: If you are a fan of artisinal honey, you will love this Autumn Forest Honeydew Honey.  It is not overly sweet, but has wonderful pear and melon flavors with a little mineral tingle, and a delicious aroma. It has layers of flavor like a sweet, light wine! It is not at all like Manuka (Wedderspoon's famous honey) - this is an eating honey.  I like it drizzled on walnuts and crumbled gorganzola. Tasty! New Zealand beekeepers are doing something right because their honey is the absolute best!

review/text: My husband Robert started using the Manuka honey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar</a> when he was having digestive problems. We decided to try this honey as well, when we saw it came from the same producer. We also liked the idea that the Beechwood honey is purported to be so rich in minerals. Well, this turns out to be the best tasting honey either of us has ever tried. I don't eat it that often, just now and then as a treat - only because I don't need the extra calories. My husband, on the other hand, has no such concerns holding him back and he has this honey on toast at least once a day. He, like me, loves the full, smooth flavor. Robert's stomach used to rumble all the time before he started using these two honeys (Beechwood and Manuka), now all has been silent for months. He looks a lot healthier too. Knowing that it is organic, raw and chock full of nutrients just adds further to our enjoyment. Highly recommended!

review/text: One of the best tasting honeys I have ever tried. Forget about just eating local honey; if they don't have a local supply of organic produced honey get this instead. Highly recommended for floral, warm, nutty, all around solid taste and clarity.

review/summary: Strong medicinal flavor
review/text: This honey has a very strong medicinal flavor and smell, which I found rather overwhelming.<br /><br />Note to those who buy this to use as a sweetener in hot beverages: Raw honey contains live enzymes, that's what distinguishes it from commercially processed honey. Enzymes denature (their properties are destroyed) at 104 F / 40 C, which means that the minute you add raw honey to your cup of tea or coffee, its wonderful health benefits are lost; one might as well use regular honey for that.

review/summary: Very good honey
review/text: I love this honey. My husband and me drink it every day, so one bottle can last only one week. When you put one spoon in the warm water, stir it, the water will become a little bit brown, and you feel so smooth for your stomach when you drink it. It's a little bit pricy, but after I tried the one I bought from Costco, I know what honey I know now...It's quite expensive for my family since we drink it everyday, but it worth it.

review/summary: Yum! I love this stuff!  And I'm delighted to see it back in stock.
review/text: PLEASE NOTE: The product reviewed here is MUSSINI BALSAMIC GLAZE, two 5.7 oz bottles for $21.54.And it IS available. (also available as two 16.9 oz. bottles for $32.55) A while back, when it became unavailable, Amazon let my review for it remain on my personal review pages, but chopped off the product name and price so nobody reading it would have a clue what it was I was reviewing and what it cost. It's been back in stock for over a year but try as I might, I STILL I can't get Amazon to fix the untitled, not-available version of this review on my personal pages. (Obviously those of you reading it on the Mussini product page know full well what it is and what it costs, so  apologies for the digression.) Now...on to the review for this marvelous product. --SharonIsch 5/27/09<br /><br />This glorious glop is the new absolutely indispensable addition to my pantry. A friend brought me some from Rome recently (different brand, Leonardo, which I'd prefer if only I could get it, but the Mussini's close enough and the price is right). It's rich and thickish, just a tad sweet, comes in a squirt bottle and instantly jazzes up--in both taste and looks--just about anything you choose to drizzle it over. It's my new salad dressing of choice--perfect over mixed greens with some nuts, fruit and feta, wonderful over steamed or grilled veggies like squash. The label suggests you can even use it over ice cream, which I tried once just to see and it actually wasn't bad, but I'll probably not do it again. It lasts longer than you'd think from the size of the bottle, as you'll only use a little at a time. I'm planning to try one of the flavors next. And come December I'll doubtless be giving lots of it as Christmas gifts. When I was running low on the stuff from Italy I went online trying to find a source for more and, wouldn't you know it, the only place outside Italy I could find it was on Amazon. Can't imagine sometimes why I ever bother looking elsewhere for anything (well, the new refrigerator maybe, although Amazon did even have a few of those, believe it or not.) Update, August 2008: Also try the fig flavor. It's especially good on fruit and salads containing fruit.

review/summary: Too sweet for my taste
review/text: This was my second to least favorite of the balsamic creams I tried.<br />I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh).

Chocolate chip cookies made with this flour taste better to me than when we made them with wheat flour!  Made a carrot cake with it and had family over that do not eat gluten free.  They remarked about how good the cake was.  It came out lighter than when I used wheat flour before going gluten free. So glad to have this available to use.

review/summary: Guess I Need to Pay Closer Attention
review/text: I bought this to replace my supply of coconut flour and was excited because I got this so cheap.  I am on a high fat/high protein "Primal" diet and I make waffles and tortilla/crepes with coconut flour.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could tell something was amiss when I opened the product as the consistency of the flour was very....floury.  Real coconut flour is loaded with healthy fat and cannot take on such a consistency.<br /><br />I looked on the bag and saw that the produce is a Coconut Flour >>>BLEND&lt;&lt;&lt; with the #1 ingredient being Rice Flour!  This is why it can be sold for so cheap...because the majority of the product is made from cheap, powdered rice.  Coconut flour is more expensive.<br /><br />You should know that rice is a grain and thus is a carbohydrate.  It might be gluten free, yes, so you don't get those nasty effects, but it's not a "low carb" food which meshes with "Paleo" or "Primal" approaches to eating.<br /><br />I'm eating the stuff slowly, as I'm not going to throw it away and waste money, but I won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Love this gluten free flour blend!
review/text: I discovered this flour first at Gluten Free Joe's which is a specialty gluten free food store located in the Olympia area of Washington state. The owner told me it was their family's favorite flour blend and I can see why after using it to replace flour in some of my favorite recipes with excellent results. (You DO have to add xanthan gum in the amount best for each type recipe as this blend does not contain any since different types of recipes work best with different amounts.) I made the mistake of running out of Mama's right before our family Easter get together but since I had an unopened bag of Namaste flour blend (which is also highly rated) so I did not think it would be a problem. Wow, was I wrong! I made two of my favorite recipes and both had to be tossed because neither turned out right. I was so disappointed to have nothing to bring as well as the fact I had wasted over a pound of butter, many eggs, lemons, etc. Needless to say, I learned NEVER to run out of Mama's Coconut blend again!

review/summary: How sweet it is :)
review/text: I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :). 1000-count and 2000-count boxes are available.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time.

Spry gum is made in China (which is why it's cheaper), along with most every other cheaper Xylitol gum on the market today.  On the other hand, XYLICHEW IS MADE IN FINLAND.  That's why it costs more.  Isn't your health worth it?  Why take chances?  With all the scares of people that died from tainted Chinese toothpaste, improper Chinese pharmaceuticals that led to sickness and death, the tainted pet food scare that killed many animals, lead paint on Chinese toys... on and on... to me Xylichew is worth the extra money.  The peppermint flavor is long lasting and tastes good.

review/text: I am very impressed with this gum.  I have actually tried two other flavors but this by far has been my favorite; it also hold its flavor longer.  I love this product not just for the great flavor but also that it does not contain aspartame.  I am pregnant at the time and have searched for a chewing gum without the aspartame or saccarhin. Even without being pregnant, I try to stay away from those two items but it is more difficult in doing so when it comes to finding gum. - - I am also a dental hygienist so I like the fact that this has xylitol.
