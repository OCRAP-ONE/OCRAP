review/summary: Amazon to the rescue! The real thing is better than the artificial
review/text: Several years back, Hannaford Grocery stores- was bought by Delhaize (a Belgium Co.) and one of the changes they made was to replace Brach's Peppermints with the "Hannaford" peppermint--made with "artificial flavors".  In a moment of final frustration, I checked Google and discovered Brach's Star Brite peppermints, made with natural peppermint oils, were still available.  What a joy!  I will never buy Hannaford "Star Lites" again, even if I run out of Brach's Star Brites temporarily.

review/summary: The Most Incredible "Jerky" Ever!
review/text: I've been sampling jerky products across the US for nearly 40 years now. Many of the products that I've sampled have been of the home-made variety, including jerky that I've made. Most store-bought jerky products are drenched in MSG or its twin brother, "hydrolyzed vegetable protein." After watching the seizure-like symptoms that the MSG in meat snacks has caused in my dogs, I will no longer buy ANY products that contain MSG or hydrolyzed vegetable protein!! However, that made finding a decent jerky product extremely difficult.<br /><br />I purchased the Oberto BBQ Pork Jerky with more than a bit of skepticism. I hadn't liked any of the Oberto beef jerky products that I had tried in the past. The "All Natural" claim on the label of this BBQ Pork Jerky convinced me to give it a try. Once I did sample it this product blew me away!! It is incredibly moist, tender and delicious! Think of all the things that people generally say that they dislike about jerky products (dry, too chewy, too salty, etc.) and this product engenders NONE of those complaints! Plus, it does appear to be the most natural (i.e., no preservatives or artificial flavor enhancers) jerky product that I've found available commercially. Enjoy!

review/summary: Awesome peanuts!
review/text: I never knew there could be such a difference in the quality of peanuts as these. They are large very flavorful and extra crunchy if that's possible. I generally do not like unsalted peanuts however these have such a great flavor I like them without salt. These peanuts are good enough for friends or family to comment on after trying them. I've had a lot of friends try royal oak peanuts and I can basically sum up their expressions in one word WOW! Highly recommend.

review/summary: Dents like road kill
review/text: The cans were so badly dented, when I opened the box, that the lids were off and no longer will fit back on. I am not sure how the peanuts are, but the Amazon packaging is a joke (as it is for most of their items these days). Also, the nuts expire in 3 months! A fresh batch would normally expire in a year. This is the third foodstuff that I have purchased on Amazon that was going to expire in the same month that I bought it or within three months. The last two were on sale (though the soon-to-be-met expiration date should've been noted by Amazon). These nuts aren't even on sale!  Now I am wondering about other foodstuffs that I have purchased here at Amazon. Looking at expiration dates from a reputable source isn't something I thought I should have to do. hmmm

review/summary: Delicious Trail Mix
review/text: I received the Blueberry Pomegranate flavor of Mareblu Naturals.  I have been trying to eat healthier and enjoy snacks that are natural and that I understand every ingredient in the list!<br /><br />The bag that I ate was supposed to have three servings, but like the other reviewers, I couldn't stop at just one serving.  I ate the entire bag!<br /><br />A few specifics.  The sweetening is light enough to really let the flavor of the nuts and berries come through.  All of the nuts are fresh and crunchy.  I love that the clusters are substantial and not just little bits.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying and reviewing the other flavors!

review/text: Found this bread last month. Compared with any other bread (German and otherwise), it's heavy, but much cheaper - this box gives me 84 Slices, meaning 84 full meals, adding GermanDeli.com Liverwurst, Teawurst and Jagdwurst as well as Mayonnaise <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VN59NQ">Kraft Spoonables Extra-Heavy Mayonnaise, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />Have been on an all-protein diet.

review/summary: Enjoyable and Healthy?
review/text: I never before found a can that combines brown rice, per say, and beans. You heat it up and add some tasty choice of Beef, Fowl, Seafood or Veggies and you have a standard meal ready to be consumed. I have come to appreciate Eden Organic. Yes, I admit that I usually add a little more salt, pepper and herbs but in the end they do taste very good. I initially was looking for the beans alone but when I read the label and since I only use brown rice now a days, we gave this combination a shot and for us, it paid off! I can cook all manners of legumes, beans, etc but hey, if a nice organic company wants to do it for a while for an acceptable price, why not? For sure 4 Stars or even higher, they are reliable fare but for a couple of weird reasons we ended up with 6 cases of different kinds so we are still figuring how are we going to consume so much since most of the times we are only 2 people. That is the beauty of canned food, I guess, that it does keep longer and well. 4 Stars!

review/summary: My dogs love this
review/text: This food is considered highly palatable and my dogs love it. I've actually never met a dog that didn't like it (even though the other review says her pets don't like it). My dogs like to eat this any way that it is prepared, but many pets enjoy it broken up into pieces and then hydrated with water.  Tepid water may be used, but very warm water or hot water will degrade (denature) the proteins and enzymes, so it isn't recommended.  It can be used to top dry food or can be fed alone. If you have a medium or large sized dog, this will be an expensive food. However, if you have a little dog, it could be fed alone. I feed this in addition to the Nature's Variety Instinct Dry food that can be found on Amazon as well. The subscribe and save option has saved me a lot of money.

review/text: We're moving towards a vegetarian diet, but don't have a lot of time for food prep, so we've been testing and tasting lots of different mixes and easy to prepare foods. The Delicae Gourmet's Thai Curry Lentil Slow Cooker Soup turned out to be a delicious surprise. I saw that small box and thought, hmmm...eight servings?  Not likely.  But by the time it was done, it filled a six quart crockpot almost to the brim. The box calls for vegetable (or chicken) broth, which I made with some frozen veggies & onions.  This soup has a delicate, light flavor; a mix of many spices. Not too salty or hot spicey. We added the can of coconut milk and some ginger at the end which really brought out the "Thai" flavors. Best of all, everyone was too busy eating to notice that it was low cal and almost no fat. If you wanted to add meat or poultry, it would go well with either, but like I said we're really committed to vegetarian. Great deal on Amazon, which is always welcome!

If you suffer from FM,IBS or really any medical condition it's best to move away from highly processed foods. I highly recommend PureVia.

review/summary: A Matter of (Good) Taste
review/text: Everyone has their own favorite coffee and I always say "Each to his own taste".  However, working in Seattle for about six months ten years ago, I became a fan of Seattle's Best Blend Coffee.  For a while it was easy to find this brand even here in the southern plains.  Over the years it has become more difficult.  My last "supplier" was Target but they stopped carrying it a few months ago.  After doing an Amazon search I found this good offer.  I bought the ground because it's vacuum sealed and saves me the trouble of grinding.  It arrived before the promised delivery date.  I just re-ordered and this time ordered two three-packs to receive free-shipping.  A great deal for this great "bright" coffee.

review/summary: My Most Favorite
review/text: It has been difficult to find this in the midwest and it's a treat for me! The balance is good and color is dark. The grind is fine and works great in drip brewers. For really full flavor, I recommend fine mesh filters rather than paper. I go full throttle and use a french press - the grind works okay and way better than Starbucks House Blend. The flavor is perfect for me - vive Seattle! Other faves are Seattle's Best Henry's Blend and Post Alley Blend.

review/summary: This is good coffee
review/text: Seattle's best numbering system is honest.  I like stronger coffee so I've tried the 3, 4, and 5.  The number 3 is coffee, regular strength normal everyday coffee.  It's a good flavor, not acidic, smooth flavorful, coffee. The number 4 is strong coffee, same basic flavor as the number 3, just stronger.  It's like using a full pot worth of grounds and only brewing three quarters of a pot.  My favorite is the number 5.  Number 5 is different.  Number 5 is extremely strong flavor!  Do not use a normal amount of grounds to brew a pot, unless you're really stubborn, you'll dump the pot.  It is good though, if you use about half the normal amount of grounds you get some very tasty coffee that you can actually drink.  I bought three packs of number 3 and 4 for work.  I brought in a bag of number 5 once, but that was a big mistake.  You see not everyone understands how to brew number 5 and I had some unhappy co-workers including one that spit a mouthful at his computer screen.  Yes, it's funny now, but it wasn't then.

review/summary: A Confirmed Coffee Nut
review/text: Seattle's Best Coffee has a level system that makes it easy to pick the level that is right for you.  You can head to the Seattle's Best Coffee website and read all about each one and be sure that you are going to be pleased.  It couldn't be easier.  I had chosen Level 3 which is described as "Balanced, smooth , full flavored."  The description definitely seemed to suit me, but the test was in the brewing.<br /><br />First of all, even though I said the test was in the brewing...it is a lot more than that my friends.  What happens when you open the bag of coffee.  Does the aroma make you smile?  Does it smell so good you can't wait to try it?  Does it smell so good you can taste it?  I'm serious.  This coffee smelled good.  It had a strong aroma, but not a STRONG aroma.  It was nutty and rich scented.<br /><br />The taste...rich but not overly so.  Bold in a cheeky way (sounds silly but true).  In other words, it didn't slap me in the face, but its smooth nuttiness made just the right impression.  I am in definite like!  My husband tried it with a flavored creamer next and said that the creamer didn't overpower the flavor of the coffee like it can with others.  I don't do soy so I couldn't go in that direction, but I made myself a mocha next by adding a little chocolate syrup, and the flavor balance was fabulous.  Seattle's Best Level 3 is definitely the right mix of strong and smooth.

review/text: Ordered this a few weeks ago to replace Starbucks (original) Breakfast Blend, which they have now taken off the market completely and replaced with "medium", whatever that awful stuff is.  This Level 3 coffee does not taste like Breakfast Blend, but it has good qualities and more body than Breakfast Blend.  The first few sips are average, but the taste seems to grow the more you drink.  It is quite smooth and does not have the burnt taste as the new "medium" BB does.

Every pot of Seattle's Best Level 3 I've made has that familar Starbucks burnt taste, and tastes nothing like the coffee I had at BK. Anyone know what level BK uses?

It's a smooth caffeine coffee with a deep aroma and a milk chocolate-like taste. Interesting to note, I recently tried Seattles Best Decaf and that's so smooth to the point of tasteless; I'm now trying Peet's Decaf House Blend (it tastes as robust as caffeine coffee)  at night and Seattle's Best Bright Blend in the morning. I've purchased both at the A&P in Kenilworth NJ.

Needless to say I won't be buying this "mild" roast again.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/text: I bought these at the grocery and was pretty pumped... organic juice boxes! Sweet. Well, not really. They are pretty watered down. After slurping on one, I flipped the grape over - 10% juice. Water and cane sugar top the list of ingredients. Pretty tasteless and I feel like a bit of a sham. I can flavor my glass of water with a spritz of grape or berry. (Beware the Berry Berry Lemonade flavor is 5% juice). I will go back to Apple and Eve (60% fruit and veggie juice) or Juicy Juice (100%, though possibly from China) until I find a better organic juice box.

review/text: These are perfect to have in your car, purse, bag, etc... for a quick and healthy snack for kids and adults!  When you open big bags of animal crackers, they don't always stay fresh before you get a chance to finish them.  I thought the price was terrific and will be coming back for more!

review/text: I ordered these for our Children's Ministry Wednesday night snack time.  Not only do they come in pre-packaged individual bags, but they are a great allergy free snack.  The Subscribe and Save option was perfect.  Now, I don't even have to think about snack-time, since I get the boxes delivered to the church every month, right on schedule.  Saves me time and money!<br /><br />Check out the blog: Growing Kids Ministry for more Children's Ministry ideas!

review/text: I first purchased these crackers from Sam's. When I started looking for them locally I could not find them. So, of course I went to Amazon and found them. The brand is Austin and the taste and flavor is really good. Better than any others I have tried. So they are really worth the extra effort.

I don't think I paid much more than half this price at SAMS. Yes, it is cheaper than a vending machine. PS - My kids like them too.

They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.

review/summary: Great cat food for a good price!
review/text: I looked for a long time for a healthy cat food that didnt cost a ton of money..with it being gone within a month. This cat food had a good price, 34 for a 15 pound bag..not to mention it lasts a long time, probably 2 months. The food does so well with my cats and no more diarrhea for them either. They like it, and it does very well on their tummies. I would recommend it..previously I used wellness indoor and it caused diarrhea. I dont know why the other reviewer said bad things, maybe it wasnt the food. Definitely buy:)

review/summary: No More Barf!
review/text: I have two cats who were barfing on a daily basis. I thought that was normal until I started talking to other people. My cats had been on Purina which I thought was a decent cat food. I started doing research and found out that was far from the truth. We switched to Natural Balance because it was the most affordable of the good cat foods available in our area. One of the cats loved it right off the bat. The other one took a week to warm up to it, but he eats it now. They've been on Natural Balance for close to 4 months and other than the occasional fur ball, there's been no puke on my carpet! They get a small scoop in the morning, and share a can of wet food in the evenings. So far I have zero complaints about this cat food. It doesn't get 5 stars simply because picky cats might take a while to warm up to it, as our picky boy did. He prefers the smelly bad for him Purina, silly boy.

review/text: Natural Balance Indoor Ultra dry cat food is a product that my cats love.  At least I guess they do because they vote with their eating behavior.  This is one of two products they will choose to eat and that doesn't make them throw up.  Of the two products this is by far the healthiest.  It even makes their poop smell okay and that is saying a lot for a cat.

review/summary: Good food
review/text: edited 7/8/12.  So sorry for the horrible typos.<br /><br />Bought this because it was top consumer choice or something for the not cheap, but not the really expensive dry cat foods ((basically, top rated for the middle of the road priced foods)). Switched them from Purina kitten food to this. Their poop is still "unnaturally stinky" as my husband says. It's been a couple months too so I don't know. Their kitten food was a different brand too, so I'm not blaming food for their stankiness.  I think they're just gasy kitties.<br /><br />Just annoying that I can only find it online.  Amazon is the best price I've found so far.  Wish I could do that thing where you get a discount if you have it automatically ordered every month or so.  That would be awesome since I do buy it every month (for 2 cats. Would probably last 2 months for 1 cat).

review/text: Don't buy this product.  Company would like you to think it is healthy, but it isn't.  Made my cat sick, throwing up.  Now I find out it is made by Diamond Foods and is in the recall list just anounced 5/30/2012.  Diamond Foods makes alot of pet food products and has a very poor rating for safe products.  They had to shut down 3 of their plants because of contamination.  I had to throw this product away, and it cost over $30.00.  Save the money and don't buy this crap!!!

review/summary: My Maltese loves them!
review/text: From the first day my pup tried them, he loved the greenies. He takes it and goes in hiding to enjoy.  He is an 8lb. Maltese and 9 months old.  The treat will last him about 30 minutes if he chews on it until it is gone.  His breath smelled so bad before I gave him these and since then his breath is fresh and does not smell at all.  The green color from the treat does not make his fur around his face green at all. Great product! I will continue to purchase these for him.  43 to a bag and I give him one a day. So the price is right because it lasts well over a month.

review/text: Greenies save me money at the vet. My dogs teeth stay clean so I don't have to have them done and him put under anestetic very often, once now in 5 years and with my last dog twice in 15 years. Not bad.<br /><br />They are also my ultimate bribe. If he won't come in when I want him too all I have to do is say greenie. I know, not good dog training but sometimes I do it anyway.<br /><br />They are made in the USA and my vet approves of them those are 2 very important things to me. I tried another one that I was offered a deal on and my dog got sick and almost choked on it, this doesn't happen if you buy the right size for your dog.

review/summary: Very good -but not quite Nugo's best flavor
review/text: I have many, many different types of protein and energy bars. Typically, they fall into one of two categories candy bars that they try to classify as "Energy Bars" and compressed saw dust that they classify as "Protein bars".<br /><br />  Nugo bars, and especially "Banana Chocolate", are outstanding. The Coffee Break bars contain 13 grams of protein and taste GREAT at 190 calories (2 grams of fat). I can eat one bar in the morning and have my hunger  reasonably satisfied until lunch.<br /><br /> Truth be told I prefer "Banana Chocolate" over the "Coffee Break" but these are still pretty darn good. While "Coffee Break" is my second favorite flavor  they still fully deserve 5 stars.
