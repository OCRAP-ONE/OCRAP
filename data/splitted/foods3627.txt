review/summary: Warning: This is not Juicy Fruit.
review/text: I love Juicy Fruit. In fact, it's one of my favorite kinds of gum. However, I recently bought a pack of this "Juicy Fruit" in this big, 60-piece pack, and all I can say is that I'm thoroughly disappointed. This gum tastes absolutely nothing like classic Juicy Fruit (which I have had as recently as a few weeks ago, so it's not my memory). I ate a couple pieces and spit it out in about 30 seconds of chewing. It has a very bitter, noxious taste and has a "minty" taste in it as well which is not characteristic of regular Juicy Fruit.<br /><br />Do not buy this. I will not be purchasing these "big-e" packs again, but I will be purchasing the sticks in the future.

review/text: This is a very good tasting salt especially on freshly popped popcorn.  I use it in everything. I no longer use the regular table salt becuase this just really enhances food without the metallic taste of table salt or the somtimes to salty taste table salt has.  You will think your food was prepared by a fine dine chef.  Buy a non-corrosive grinder to use this salt and you will never use table salt again.

review/summary: Licorice that isn't too soft and sticky.
review/text: I am one of those people who leave licorice packages open so that it will 'stale' faster. This consistency of this product is exactly what I love.  It's chewy and there is actually an audible sound when you tug the licorice lace to break off a piece.  It has a similar stiffness as a Jujubees candy once it's outer coating is softened.  I've been on the hunt for a specific licorice lace that was sold at a near by Sweet Factory that closed.  This comes really close, but the flavor is off. I think the one I'm looking for is cherry flavored while this is strawberry. The candy came well packaged and fresh with a clearly printed expiration date.

review/text: I'm a happy camper for sure!! I love licorice!!  I've loved it since I was a kid. I'm  at 50 years now and I still LOVE licorice. My favorite it strawberry and I like cherry flavor as well. I've been "jonesin" for some licorice whips for many months, but couldn't find them anywhere in a 60 mile radius. I couldn't believe it!! Where in the hell were they hiding them?  So, while ordering some stuff on Amazon, I stumbled onto a candy ad, which led me to the licorice. I saw the "whips," read the info on them, the one review and the rest is history. My first bite is a memorable one. The taste was so fresh, moist, very strawberry flavor and snapped so cleanly away from my month. Like a light snap of your finger. I will buy from this company again and probably in a larger quantity!! Thanks Amazon and Sweet Gourmet.

review/summary: Love at first bite...
review/text: There is one word that comes to my mind when I think of these, "YUM!"  Not too sweet, but just sweet enough with that light touch of saltiness that makes this snack really stand out as something different.  There is something about the flavor of Bugles corn chips that really stands out as a superior snacking chip.  Just a few chips leaves you feeling satisfied, although I will admit to scarfing down a bag of these all by myself while watching a movie.  Because these are more than likely a test item by the makers of Bugles, I would not wait around to buy a case and stock up for winter.  If you like these, you definitely will want to try their Chocolate & Peanut Butter Bugles!  Just thinking about them is enough to make me take a ten minute break from the computer... starting right now!

review/summary: tastes great, but I'm a little concerned about the saturated fat content
review/text: Bugles are a great snack that have been around a long time. I can remember eating them as a kid as far back as the 1970s, and I still occasionally eat them today. They have a distinctive corny taste which, as far as I know, is unlike anything else currently on the market. On the basis of taste alone, this product would rate 5 stars, however, I am only giving 4 stars out of 5 because of the high staurated fat content, something that is easily evident from a glance at the nutrition label. Bugles have much higher saturated fat content than many other snacks - a result, I suppose, of coconut oil (rather than vegetable or corn oil) being a main ingredient. I wonder, why can't they make Bugles lower in saturated fat and overall fat content, and would it really taste any different?

And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.<br /><br />Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7. Product description still needs correcting, but at least customer service was responsive.

Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds.

The mother recently tried to take them on an excursion far away from the house where we adopted them from. They went missing for 10 days so to be on the safe side when she brought them back the owners at the time seperated them and gave us a call. We adopted them same day. Now i know weening a baby from the mothers milk is a pain. I had ordered this ahead of time so we would have everything in place for the new kitties which we werent supposed to get for about 4 more weeks. Well good thing i did cause without any hesitation they started eating this stuff. Never had solid food before, still nursing. This weened them instantly. no formula mixxed in at all. Im very happy with this stuff. Its a little expensive but for how long your actually gonna need it (up to 4 months) Its not that bad of an investment considering how much the kittens actually eat.

All my vet cousins highly recommend this food.<br />And I recommend all of the Royal Canin line of cat food.<br />You will see the quality and shine of the coat, as well as, the healthy immune system<br />benefits of a healthy and happy cat.

review/text: I've been using this food for nearly 8 years now, it's the best to start weaning young kittens on.  It is a very small kibble unlike other manufacturers dry kitten food.  I recommend this highly to all people with finicky young kittens they are trying to wean.<br /><br />I breed Savannah and do a lot of bottle feeding then weaning, and this food by far is the best to do that with.

review/summary: Good for ailing hedgehogs and tenrecs
review/text: This is a good food to put on weight for an underweight or ailing hedgehog or tenrec.  After surgery, it is a good food to get them back on their feed.  The only problem I encountered-once they get a taste of this food, they WANT it and it is difficult to get them back on their regular diet.  It sure is good to keep on hand for a back up if you have these kinds of small animals.  A bit expensive, but when you have an ill animals that you love, expense is uaually at the bottom of your priorities.  This food has helped many of my little ones over some crisis bumps along the road.

review/summary: Outrageous price increase
review/text: One must be really careful buying some things (like cat food) on the Internet.  All of my past reviews for products on Amazon have been positive, but this one defies logic.  The food is wonderful and we have used it at our animal rescue for over eight years now.  We usually buy 4 to 6 bags at a time.  A month or so ago Amazon raised their price for it from $15.59 a bag to $24.44.  Amazon still sells the same around $17 a bag through other vendors (such as Petco) but then you get socked with high shipping charges and sales taxes.  I realize that, generally, prices for products tend to increase over time, but this price increase seems particularly onerous, especially when one can obtain the product from other providers for aorund $16 with free postage.

review/summary: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dry Cat Food
review/text: I have used the Royal Canin Babycat for several years now to feed kittens newly weaning from mama kitty as one of their first solid foods.The tiny size of the kibble is absolutely purrfect for their tiny mouths!!! It also provides a good immune boost for the youngsters. Never had any digestive issues, they tolerate this dry food well. Yes, maybe the ingredient panel could be a little better,but still very much worth it for your kitten!!! I also use the Babycat to feed my 3 geriatric cats,one of which is missing quite a few teeth, as a dry kibble to supplement their wet food. Again, this product does not disappoint. Because of the tiny kibble these old felines are able to tolerate this food well. Actually my veterinarian recommended this for the elderly cats because of it's great digestability and the immune boost it provides for young and old alike!!! I highly recommend this product for your newly transitioning to food kitten and for geriatric cats with dental issues!!! The price is great here on Amazon and can't beat getting it delivered right to your door!!! Give it a try, your kitten or senior cat will love you for it!!!

review/text: My new kittens didn't like this food and didn't eat it at all for about a full 24 hours. Maybe they were just getting used to the new kind of food from the old owner who was feeding them regular cat food. They still don't eat alot of it considering. I think my girlfriend keeps filling them up on kitten treats. They eat it, but I can tell that they aren't really crazy for it. I guess I just bought this thinking that they would be fighting over it. I will continue buying it though since they both look really healthy. They do have worms currently too, so maybe thats what it is too. I will know more after we deworm them this next weekend.

review/summary: Very Dry, but They Still Taste OK
review/text: I was so excited to get a good deal on raw gogi berries. They are usually $15 a lb or more. I have tried them several times before and they were always quite chewy, like raisins, but less plump. The goji berries I have eaten in the past were also raw with no additives(unlike the mass marketed kind with sugar and oil added), so I expected these to be the same. These actually crack and turn to powder when you crush them with your fingers. I tried soaking them, but they just taste like waterlogged, goji-flavored bark. I wanted to return them, but the return info says food items must be returned unopened. I am pretty disappointed in the texture of these goji berries. The expiration date indicates they are fresh (one full year before expiration). I guess I will just grind them up to make powder to add to smoothies and raw chocolate recipes. In the future, however, I will pay the extra money for the chewy goji berries, which taste great on their own and in recipes. The ones I bought here have OK flavor, but they are just so dry. A friend suggested i soak them and try dehydrating them again. I don't know if i want to bother with that, or if it will even work. the good news is that because they are so dry, the 10 lb bag is pretty big. I imagine that it would take fewer goji berries to make 10 lbs if they were more chewy. Also, this product is much more expensive elsewhere, even when purchased wholesale with a huge minimum order, so if you don't mind dry berries, this is an inexpensive way to get all the benefits of goji berries. Plus, i didn't have to pay shipping with Amazon Prime. That's a huge savings.<br />The raw cacao powder I bought on Amazon, also from Nativas, was quite good.Navitas Naturals Raw Chocolate Powder, Organic, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) I highly recommend it. I also bought raw agave nectar (2x 46 oz raw) here, and it is excellent.Madhava Organic Raw Agave Nectar, 46-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)

review/summary: What a bargain!
review/text: I just recently started 'treating' myself to organic goji berries I found at a local food store and have fallen in love with these yummy soft chewy treasures! But they ain't cheap (here in Vancouver they're usually around $3.99/100g!) So when I stumbled across this 10lb bag of organic goji berries by Navitas at a very reasonable price, I couldn't resist! Having already become a fan of Navitas' Maca powder I figured I couldn't go wrong, right? ;)<br /><br />Well, Navitas did not disappoint! They arrived very securely packaged in thick sealed plastic bags. And the taste? Awesome! Unlike another reviewer, mine were soft and sweet with a nice chew! I'm so thrilled! What a bargain! I'm so glad I splurged on the 10lb bag! I'll be enjoying these gojis for quite some time! Thank you Navitas! ;)

review/text: These are not anywhere as good as Ron Teeguarden's / Bija's sun dried gojis.  I'm not sure what the difference is but I bet it's because the Bija ones are grown elsewhere, maybe a different part of China or possibly Tibet.  In any case, I'll be sourcing my goji's from vitacost anyway... even though I'm non religious I still get a peace of mind buying from Buddhist Tibetans versus Chinese Muslims considering all the turmoil that is not caused in any way by Buddhists in the world.

review/summary: Strange aftertaste
review/text: This is the second time I purchased these.  I was very pleased with the first batch that was ordered maybe a year or so ago.  This time, they had a strange chemical aftertaste. No other way to describe it but the aftertaste of, well, vomit - and not that slight.  I love Goji berries but their cost has me waiting for awhile between orders.  So when these came, I feasted on them even with the aftertaste - but I actually felt queasy after trying some on two different occasions.  I decided to send them back to Amazon.<br /><br />Instead Amazon customer service overnighted another bag and told me I didn't have to worry about sending back the first one (gotta love Amazon).  The had the same aftertaste but fainter and I don't feel queasy afterwards.  I've decided to keep the second batch as its tolerable and otherwise a great deal.  If you purchase them and you can't tolerate the aftertaste, call Amazon even though the item says its unrefundable.  Hopefully this aftertaste won't be an issue in future batches as in the past, but I am wondering about how "organic" these really are.

So instead of 10lb, u probably get 10.5lbs if u add some water...<br /><br />that is a trick btw. You can spray water on them and leave them for a few hours. I take a few, spray them and put them in a small jar. That way they are ready for munching later...

review/summary: No Need to Duck This Treat
review/text: In the four ounce package are fourteen wraps, chunks of dried sweet potato wrapped in what looks like duck jerky. Inside the package is a small package of moisture absorber, a desiccant, not the kind of addition one normally finds in a food product, pet food or otherwise. The wraps aren't visually appealing to a human, but dogs will only be concerned with the scent and the taste. On the top of the pouch is a tear off strip to open it. A resealable plastic zipper seals the pouch tightly to keep the wraps fresh.<br /><br />Our three girls wear their emotions on their paws and their faces. Thus when each was presented with a duck sweet potato wrap their interest and their excitement were unmistakable. There were no sniffy-sniffy hesitations, no circle walkings, no signs of disinterest and definitely no looks of can't youdobetterthan this. Evie immediately grabbed her wrap between her jaws and began chewing, oblivious to the world. Piper and Bella, the two shih tzus, grabbed their wraps eagerly and slunk off to their respective corners for some private feasting. Piper in particular had a primal transformation, guarding her prize with laid-back ears and a low, stay away growl, hovering over her wrap like a miniature wolf guarding its kill. All three dogs were in a state of ravenous "wrapture" with their treats.<br /><br />I like that these wraps are too chewy for the dogs to finish off quickly, though Evie the vac nonterrier finished hers in half the time as her two little sisters. The duck jerky was eaten first, followed by the sweet potato piece with no lessening of interest or enjoyment. Of all the many treats and chews offered to this canine triumvirate, few have elicited such intense enthusiasm and prehistoric passion.<br /><br />We noticed no ill side effects in any of the pooches from these treats. There were no upset tummies, and no bouts of diarrhea. The verdict of this jury was unanimous and definitively pawsitive.

It is made in China, which people worry about, I recommend checking out dogfoodadvisor.com for some information on that; apparently almost all dog food sold in the US still sources some ingredients from China. Poodle is 16 lbs and has had no trouble with them. This is also a much better deal than the package I bought in my local pet store, FYI.

review/summary: DO NOT FEED YOUR DOG THIS PRODUCT !
review/text: The Sweet Potato and Duck Wrap has been specifically named in the latest FDA report as one of the dog treats that is unsafe to give your dog.  Please read the latest report yourself.  I also recommend a Facebook page "Animal Parents Against Pet Treats and Food Made in China" that list the facts on the brands that are considered to be unsafe. The CADET brand is named in the complaint. I have always bought my pet treats from the RAWHIDE DEPOT vendor on AMAZON, and have ordered the CADET brands...unaware that most CADET dog treats were sourced from China.  I will continue to order from RAWHIDE DEPOT.  I have gotten excellent service with them.  However, I will not order the CADET brand of dog treats again.

review/text: I feed sweet potato treats to my little dog, due to his many food allergies.<br />The sweet potato also provides some fiber to his diet. Lucky for him (&  me)<br />that he LOVES sweet potato. I decide to try these with the piece of duck jerky<br />twisted around the piece of sweet potato. Duck has a fairly low reaction level<br />to allergy prone animals, as well.  What a nice little change for him; & he LOVES<br />these so much, he gobbles them right up.

review/summary: My dogs follow me everywhere
review/text: I started buying these treats years ago thinking they looked cute with the little bone and chicken piece wrapped around them.  I did not realize I would be buying them constantly as my two golden's just love these.  I keep them in a ceramic treat jar on the counter and as soon as the lid is lifted and a slight noise made; they are both sitting there waiting looking at me.  I can go thru a jar of these in two weeks if I don't ration them out.  The dogs love them, they are probably healthier for them than grocery store biscuits and every once in awhile they are on sale.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: Despite having just as much sugar as the troika of Kellogg's cereal that Moms hate but kids love (Corn Pops, Apple Jacks and Froot Loops), this escapes the bad press, probably because it doesn't contain the words Loops, Pops or Jacks which Moms seem to identify with artificial flavors (another Mom banned substance).<br /><br />So this is one of my favorite cereals that my Mom did not ban. (Kelloggs should learn from this and relabel the banned troika as Mennonite Corn Cereal, Delicious Apple Cereal and Old Fashioned Fruit Cereal.) But the sugar isn't that bad, this 2.1oz cup contains 23g of sugar vs. 39g in a 12oz can of Coke, plus it contains a decent amount of vitamins and supplements. And anyway, no one can eat plain cereal without the sugar, even with the basic Kellogg's cereal, I have to add some sugar to it to make it palatable.<br /><br />I love this individual pack. It's very handy. You can carry it anywhere with you and all you need is a small carton of milk to make it a meal or a snack. And this individual pack prevents you from overeating it (unless you decide to eat 2-3 of them at once.) To get rid of the excess sugar, just peel back the lid a little and shake out the excess sugar of which there always is some.<br /><br />And who doesn't remember Tony the Tiger saying "They're Greeaaat!" Now that's some inspired advertising.<br /><br />So:<br />Pros: Tastes great. Handy size. Convenient on the go. Name does not contain the words Pops, Jacks, or Loops, which Moms don't identify with real food.<br />Cons: None.

review/summary: So much easier on my babies tummy.
review/text: When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.  Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.  She continued to eat without distress after we made the switch.  We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.
