review/summary: Bar NONE! The best baked....
review/text: Tortilla chip in existence. If you like popcorn and tortilla chips but are interested in eating healthy,this chip gives you all three! The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy.

review/summary: Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.
review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

review/text: A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/summary: A rare low-salt chip
review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

review/text: I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

The "Used By" date is March 2011, but I had to cut this bag open as it was sealed up so tightly (this is the first bag of chips I've had to cut open..if I really reeked on it I could have got it, but I didn't want it to explode in my face).  No worries, you will be happy you got these.

review/text: It's great for what it is...a 15oz bowl of soup for only 100 calories.<br />I guess the other reviewers don't understand the purpose of a low calorie meal:<br />"90% water 10% vegetables"? Yes, the broth keeps the calorie content down. Would you rather buy it if it were 10oz (minus 5oz of broth)??<br />"Tastes horrible"? "Ick"? IT'S 100 CALORIES FOR 15OZ OF SOUP. You know what tastes good to humans? Fat, Sugar, Salt. If you want that, go elsewhere and stop complaining.<br /><br />Healthy Choice has a better tasting Country Vegetable Soup also sold here, but it's DOUBLE THE CALORIES.

review/summary: Misnomer
review/text: Yes, it's a poor excuse for a soup; yes, it has only 100 calories. It's pretty vile; the calories do nothing to redeem it. Squeeze a small tomato into a glass of water and it would have even fewer calories and taste about as good, maybe better.<br /><br />But why did they call it 'southwestern-style'? The only indication I see of the southwest is that they threw in a few beans--maybe nine or ten; there's certainly no seasoning that would warrant the name. The dominant vegetable, and the overwhelmiingly dominant flavor, is celery--not exactly what I'd call southwestern cooking's signature ingredient.<br /><br />As for the amazing 100 calories, a serving of Campbell's Condensed Tomato Soup (1/2 can, diluted) contains roughly 120 calories, tastes much better, and is more substantial, even if it is 4.5 ounces less by volume.

review/summary: The Blessed Lid
review/text: Campbells Select soups in the microwave ready packaging are a convenient way to get a light meal on the go. The Harvest Light Southwestern Style is my favorite. The ingredients list is not a science project, and the taste is just spicy enough but not too much. My only complaint is the lid on these things. Campbells, if you could please either not put the broth all the way to the rim, or design a tighter lid, I'd be grateful. It's just, just when you think you've made it to your desk without incident, that is precisely when scalding hot broth flows out from under the rim of that *(^^&*&^* lid onto your fingers. Bottom line: great soup, packaging needs some work.<br /><br />Edit: I am removing a star because of that consarned lid. I still love the soup, but that lid is just too loose. If you fumble it in your hands (and when that scalding hot broth lands on your fingers, it's a test of will not to) the lid is inclined to just flop right off, sending a large portion of your soup to the floor. Just, no. I will not be buying anything in this packaging again anytime soon. The soup is great, but I recommend buying it by the can.

review/summary: Tasty, not filling enough on its own
review/text: This soup has a nice zesty flavor, very tasty for a (slightly) lower sodium soup.  It just doesn't have enough of the vegetables pictured on the label.  There might be two or three spoonfuls in the entire package.  This might be a good soup to have with something else (sandwich or salad) or as a snack, but it's not enough food to be a meal on its own.<br /><br />I also have a problem with this being labeled as having two servings.  Really??  Who is going to eat half of this container?  Campbell's: label it as one serving.  The entire package is only 100 calories - why do you need to play labeling games?  I'm guessing it's to try to hide the true sodium number (which is better than some soups, but still high when you consider most people WILL eat the entire package contents)  You're not fooling us.  We *can* multiply by 2.

review/text: Valentina Salsa Picante, a Mexican hot sauce, suddenly appeared on the shelves in my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and I just had to try it. Well, it's quite good. The sauce has a quite nice, zesty taste without overwhelming heat. It reminds me of some of the better Cajun hot sauces and somewhat like Frank's Hot Sauce, but has it's own distinct flavor. It's imported from Mexico and is made in Guadalajara. Nice sauce. I initially tried it out on some California rolls and it went quite well. This stuff will be versatile. Trust me. I'll be using it on all sorts of things.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This seasoning blend used to be carried in our local store, and then suddenly we couldn't find it ANYWHERE.  I'm so happy to be able to order it!  It's so much more than your regular, grocery-store mix of oregano, parsley, and other greenery.<br /><br />We use it in so many things.  Of course, it's great in our Italian dishes.  It's also livened up things such as sausage balls, spinach dip (SO GOOD), and even just oven-baked chicken.  I never thought I'd order spices online, and I never thought I'd be so happy to see a package arrive.  :)

review/summary: Quality herbs
review/text: I've been purchasing Morton & Bassett for years and I've never been disappointed.  I love that this is salt free with no preservatives, just unadulterated tasty herbs.  I've tried many other Italian Seasoning but I always come back to this one, it has the perfect blend.  When I make my spaghetti sauce I start with fresh tomatoes or if off season then cans of crushed tomatoes.  Some seasoning leave the sauce seem blah or one note.  Sometimes the problem may be the tomatoes or other aromatics I use but these spices help even out any blandness from the fresh produce and just make the sauce taste complete.  I love that I can add as little as a teaspoon to a whole jar and I don't have to worry about salt or anything else mucking up the flavor of the herbs.  I always make sure I have this on hand and when I get down to one jar I order more.

review/text: This spice mix is great.  McCormicks doesn't even compare to Morton and Basset as far as flavor goes.  This Italian seasoning has a deep, strong, almost smoky flavor.  It is overpowering for light tomato sauces or summer dishes using fresh basil or other fresh herbs, but for a marinara sauce in the winter nothing beats this.  It is also my go to spice for pizza sauce.  The sum of the ingredients is greater than their parts.  After trying this, you'll never go back to McCormicks, or even worse, the irradiated spices from China.

review/summary: High Priced Fillers And Preservatives
review/text: I try not to purchase unhealthy food--for the family or our dogs.  This product has a big circular emblem on the package touting "100% Real--Wholesome and Delicious."  It was on sale, and I had a coupon.  Not reading the back of the package, I foolishly bought them.  Imagine my surprise to find only ten small slices inside.  With two dogs and a neighbor's pet who frequently visits, these lasted about two days.  I figured it out--not on sale, these cost over $1 an ounce.  Put another way, $16 a pound.  That's way more than hamburger or steak!  Who is Milo's Kitchen trying to fool?<br /><br />Worse yet, the ingredients are anything but wholesome.  Yes, the first ingredient listed is beef, but it goes downhill from there.  Fifteen listed ingredients--#3 on the list is sugar, #4 on the list is salt.  Do these sound natural to you--propylene glycol, monoglyceride, potassium sorbate, citric acid, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite and butylated hydroxyanisole?  Real?...yes.  Wholesome?...no way.  To be fair, the dogs did enjoy eating them.<br /><br />I was fooled once, but it won't happen again.  Beware of skillful marketing tactics at your pet's expense.

review/text: First I should say that I'm a popcorn-aholic.  I love popcorn - mostly just the plain white stuff.  I'm not much of a fan of carmel corn and for the most part I only like cheese corn when it's mixed with plain popcorn.  This popcorn was okay.  The carmel corn was light and crispy but to me it tasted like there was way too much vanilla in the carmel coating.  The cheese corn was much softer than the carmel and I thought that was the better of the two flavors because it wasn't overpowering (remember, I don't like super cheesy popcorn).  Oh, and for some reason, it seems that the tufts of cheese popcorn were much smaller than the carmel corn; I like big fluffy pieces of popcorn, not little ones.<br /><br />This certainly doesn't compare to any candy store popcorn (I occasionally treat myself to popcorn from [...] - it's the BEST popcorn ever!)and I didn't expect it to.  I did hope it might be close to Earl's Popcorn, which is also prepackaged but sadly, it comes in well behind them.  All in all, it was fresh and tasty, just not quite what I was looking for.

review/summary: Great for Veggie tacos!!!
review/text: I have looked EVERYWHERE for this salsa mix! Whole Foods in my town no longer carries it and every other store that has Simply Organic products has everything but this one. My fiance and I have been using this mix to make vegetarian tacos using the crumbles from Morningstar and they come out amazing! PLUS, this salsa mix doesn't have the high sodium that the Simply Organic southwestern taco mix does. This stuff is great! I would highly recommend it!

review/text: While there was nothing wrong with this salsa packet, it wasn't anything I'll re-order.  I'll keep looking for the "perfect" salsa mix.  If you've tried others and still haven't found yours, then give this one a try.  However, if you found something that's pretty good...you could probably skip this one.

review/text: Okay, so I haven't tasted this yet, but I guess I would have a hard time rating it based on taste, since I have never eaten sorghum flour (not to my knowledge, anyway#. However, I was really impressed that they included a packet of their gluten free flour mix with a recipe booklet. I have never reviewed a product on amazon before #and I shop on here at least once a week), but this excellent perk inspired me to do so.

review/text: I wanted quality sorghum flour that wasn't Bobs Red Mill (my son is corn allergic/reacts to Bobs Red Mill) and despite the hefty shipping price, decided to give this a try. I made brownies, pancakes, muffins...anything you'd normally use wheat flour for and mixed with tapioca starch/potato starch. Excellent taste and my son didn't have a reaction! Certainly worth the expense.

review/summary: Yummo !!!
review/text: I was introduced to the Chefs Warehouse Smoked Pepper about 5 years ago, and it has brought a gourmet level of seasoning and pleasure to so many dishes I make.<br /><br />How?<br /><br />First: The complex aroma of the smoked pepper creates the image of smokey BBQ ribs, bacon, and chicken in my mind, strong enough to make my mouth water, each and every time I open the plastic cap. It's pure yummo!<br /><br />Second: the grated pepper colors themselves - so pretty and potent.<br /><br />Third: The rich, smoky, mouth watering flavor it gives to beef, pork, chicken, vegetables, potatoes, eggs, rice, and fish, that I have used it on....... so far.<br /><br />Whats next? Perhaps - Chocolate covered Strawberries and Smoked Pepper, Ice Creme and Smoked Pepper, Ice Pops and Smoked pepper.<br /><br />Wait a minute! Time to make dinner - Curried Chicken salad with .... you guessed it - Smoked pepper.<br /><br />In short, the Chefs Warehouse Smoked Pepper is a must buy, use, and share with others too.

review/summary: Great tasting cappucino in a convenience can
review/text: This is cappuccino in an 8.45 oz can, just a bit more than a regular 12 oz soda can. You won't get the, "You got milk mustache" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark.

review/summary: illy issimo cappuccino
review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: Bunnies Trounce Goldfish
review/text: I have enjoyed "Goldfish" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.<br /><br />From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as "health food," of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun!

review/summary: Natural Cheese Crackers - Great for Snack Mixes
review/text: "...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box<br /><br />These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy.<br /><br />Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.<br /><br />I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories.<br /><br />These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Finally...natural snacks that actually taste good!
review/text: Ever since having my little girl five years ago, I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome, nutritious and natural foods. This can be a difficult task in today's world, with so many processed, nutritionless foods, filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat. I didn't want to deny my daughter "snacks", but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils. So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie's Homegrown products. Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt. All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize (and pronounce!). No partially hydrogenated oils, no preservatives, no ungodly amounts of sodium. And they are delicious to boot! My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies! They are  perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones. This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself. And that is a company I am happy to support.

review/text: Ok, I understand that this is not as good a buy as the boxes of Cheddar Bunnies that Amazon sells. That's okay for me, as I am truly buying this item as a convenience food and I am okay with paying a little more for that.<br />What is even better is that this snack is far more natural than most snacks you will find in the grocery store - including those pesky goldfish! These are the perfect size for a lunch or afternoon snack and they are pretty crush resistant, if you know what I mean. My son actually prefers these to goldfish, although I am sure it has to do with the packaging - but the real kicker is that my husband said that these were "really good". So, a snack that covers two picky eaters and is not bad for you? A win-win in this house.

review/text: but they aren't. Not really. Oh, the ingredients are good. I like the use of organic wheat flour, and I generally trust the Annie's brand name. But there's little else about these little crackers to rave about. Why? Because they are almost flavorless. I'm not someone who uses much salt.  You won't catch me even touching the salt shaker during a meal, and I probably go through less than 2 ounces of the stuff in an average year of cooking at my house. But I found myself wanting to pull out a salt shaker and sprinkle some of the stuff in the bag, then shaking it so the crackers might at least have a chance of acquiring some taste. I don't know if I got a bad case of these or what (certainly all the other posted raves make me wonder), but I won't be buying them again.
