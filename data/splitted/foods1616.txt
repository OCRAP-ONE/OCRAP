review/text: GREAT choice for those of us who are limiting our carbohydrates and/or processed foods, but still need a little crunch in our food.  These are great either by themselves, or on salads, in casseroles, or vegetables, or in soups.  PERFECT size for those of us who can't stop putting our hands back into a larger bag of chips!!

review/summary: Tasty, but not a typical cheese cracker
review/text: One of my children is allergic to wheat, so I've been looking for an alternative to goldfish crackers for her.  She was so frustrated when her sister got crackers for a snack and she did not.<br /><br />About the taste:  They are made with Gouda cheese, not cheddar, so don't expect typical American cheese-flavored snack.  My older daughter, who can eat goldfish and is used to their flavor, disliked the Wellaby's.  My toddler, though, loves them.  She will also eat "stinky cheese" with me, so she is not a picky eater.  My husband liked them, as well, but said the taste was disconcerting at first  because he was expecting the typical "orange" flavor of most snack crackers.<br /><br />About the company:  They are super nice and responsive when you contact them.  Amazon did not list the ingredients when I was looking at purchasing the crackers.  I emailed the manufacturer for the ingredient information.  They emailed me back quickly with a complete listing of ingredients:<br /><br />Potato starch<br />Gouda cheese<br />Milk cream (cow's milk)<br />Corn flour<br />Rice flour<br />Corn starch<br />Potato fibers<br />Sodium caseinate (listed as Milk protein)<br />Salt<br />Yeast extract (from barley)<br />Paprika<br />Xanthan gum<br />Ammonium carbonate<br />Glucono-delta- lactone<br />Sodium carbonate<br />Mono-and diglycerides (as a processing aid)<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who was allergic to wheat or had gluten sensitivities.

review/summary: Delicious Earl Grey!
review/text: I am not much for Earl Greys; to me, they tend to be average. This one is not. It has a great, but not at all overpowering, bergamot flavor. The bergamot flavor is smoothed out by the slight hint of vanilla and cream that is barely noticeable, but effective). I normally drink tea with milk but prefer this one on its own because it is so tasty, smooth, and absolutely well balanced. It avoids the bitterness often gotten from black tea and from lesser Earl Greys. Because of its flavor and its (relatively) decent price, I think this tea will become a mainstay in my house.

review/summary: My Latest Addiction...
review/text: First let me say that as a general rule, I HATE anything flavored with aniseed.  But these little treats have caused me to change my tune.  They're just delicious; I can sit down and eat a package at a time, they're THAT GOOD.  These are modest looking little things, sometimes a little burnt around the edges, no two the same exact shape, but for some reason when you put them in your mouth, the combined richness of the frying oil, the density of the aniseed and the sweetness of the sugar really transports you on a culinary level.<br /><br />These can be served in a variety of ways.  I actually like to eat them with jammy red wines, or syrupy whites, but they're just as good with tea (particularly Lapsang Souchong).  A dessert made by layering vanilla custard between a small stack of the Matiz Tortas also makes an elegant and unique presentation.  Purchase and enjoy, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: Other reviewers compared these to goldfish or cheezits.  No way!  First, they have that sandy, powdery feel that so many gluten free baked goods have. Plus they are really lacking in cheese flavor.  I'll probably use them with chili or in crab cakes. But as something to snack on, I'd have to be really desperate.

review/summary: Don't Compare These to Goldfish/Cheese Its/Cheese Nips
review/text: I bought these in hopes that they would be a substitute for any crunchy baked fluorescent orange "cheese" cracker.  Instead, I got its more mature and sexier cousin.  These actually taste like cheese, not just any cheese but like good sharp and pungent cheese.  This could be off putting to those wanting that nostalgic synthetic cheddar flavor.  That being said I didn't like these at first, but once I realized that they are not in the same category as Goldfish, I snacked on with content.<br /><br />The texture of these are like those of any of Shar's cracker products.  It has a similar grittiness(?) of other gluten free foods.  On the gluten-free gritty scale of 1-10, 10 representing the ultimate grittiness, this stuff gets a 4.  It's texture is obviously gluten-free, but it's not offensive.<br /><br />Overall, I found this okay.  It's not a staple of my cabinet, but it's not condemned from it either.

review/text: I have only been gluten free for a year or two and have had to give up a lot of treats, as I am also white potato intolerant.  I was craving the old salty stand-by of chex (or in our house, snack) mix.  I have been able to find good cereals and finally found pretzels that were good but never could find the cheese crackers....nothing passed muster...until THESE....OMG!  That is about all I can say, it took all my will (or won't) power not to just sit down and eat an entire bag while I await my Chex mix to cook.  I will definitely be back to buy more of these crackers, and those who compared them to the Goldfish....RIGHT ON!  Anyone thinking about getting these, I promise you won't regret it...even at the price they are, well worth it!

The nutrition panel indicates 140 calories for 33 crackers.  I find I only need to eat 12 or so of these tiny crackers to feel satisfied.  That can be good if you need to count calories.  They're great with an apple for a satisfying snack or with soup.  They also travel well when ordered online from Amazon.com.  I pack them in a small plastic container for lunch at work or on the trail.

review/summary: What happened?
review/text: I used to love hot fries. I'd grab 2-3 packs in my school lunch and then buy one and eat it during my next class. It was my favorite snack. However, about three years ago, I had a couple stale bags of hot fries. Its easy to tell when they're stale, because they don't melt in your mouth and they are way too crunchy.<br /><br />Not a big deal, I didn't mind. I waited a few weeks and bought them again. It was off and on for a while, some bags would be delicious and others crunchy and stale. I don't know what happened; but SOMETHING did. Maybe the supplier changed or they just ship bags after they sit around in the warehouse for a few months.<br /><br />Now its been a few years, and I literally have not had a non-stale bag of hot fries since high school. I buy them in all sorts of different locations, although it could all be from the same distributor if its got a wide range.<br /><br />I can't even find the website to complain even though it clearly says on the bag [...]. How old do these bags have to be that they say the company website is a website that doesn't exist? Did they predict to go out of business so they just made 5 years worth of hot fries in a single week and put em in a warehouse somewhere?<br /><br />I am EXTREMELY disappointed with what they've done to these hot fries. And, if by chance someone from their company does see this message, I hope you stop making stale ass hot fries. I've bought my last bag of hot fries tonight. I can't stand eating this crap. At least rename them to something like "Hot Fries version -2.0" or something like that so you don't ruin the name of Hot Fries.<br /><br />**note I have not purchased hot fries from amazon - this review does not reflect on them in any way

review/text: I've suffered from acid reflux and have postprandial hypotension.  I drink Evamore because of it's ph level. Evamore tastes great - I crave this water and can easily drink 32 oz. Drinking any other water I feel bloated and full after 8 oz. Not with Evamore. I physically felt better after drinking it. Don' have to make as many pit-stops with Evamore - seems like my body is absorbing more of it instead of just flushing it like other water. I'm glad to drink Evamore & know there are no prescription medicines in it. Go to Evamore website for good info on them. I order it from my health food store by the case & they give me a 10% discount.

review/summary: I love this water, but the price...
review/text: The price is too expensive on this, and it's bottled in the U.S.  There are 128 oz in a gallon.  So this purchase amts to a gallon and a half.  Can you actually pay $35 for a 1.5 gallons of water when you can get a gallon at your grocers for .99 cent?  Though this is alkaline and has more minerals in it, it doesn't justify the price esp. if you are going to continue eating acidic foods you're better off putting baking soda in your water or just taking Tums.

review/text: I buy this product for my two cats. I know there are dogs on the cover, but they sure go ape $#!^ for these chicken bits. These are great treats to reward any animal, they are healthy and don't have any invasive odors like a lot of other pet treats. I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well. Aside from being a little bland, they are pretty good, put a little hot sauce on them and it could pass along with most of the frozen snacks that kids eat. If you are looking for a premium treat to give to your pets I suggest Pure Bites.

review/summary: 2 bags rancid! calling company today!
review/text: UPDATED APRIL 2012: I'm returning 6 more pouches of PureBites Chicken today, after first calling the company for instructions. The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said "someone else likely helped you". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's "acceptable" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.

review/text: I had purchased something similar to these at a cat show.  But when I tried to find them in stores it was nearly impossible.  I was so happy when I found these.  My loves them and gobbles them up.  It is the only cat treat she will eat and I have tried them all.  she hates all other treats and just walks away.  But these she begs for literally.  If you have a finicky cat like mine, these will be a hit.  I even sprinkle it on her food so she will eat it, and the dust at the bottom is great for that.  I highly recommend these treats for cats.<br /><br />Update:  I have continued to purchase these and they are still the only treat either one of my cats will eat.  The older cat has apparently taught the kitten these are the only treats worth eating.  Still a great product and I have never had problems like other reviewers had.

review/summary: The cat and the dog love this stuff
review/text: I rate this a 4 star because of how it tends to have a great quantity of powdery crumbs in the bottom of the bag. The dog will lick it up, but with a powder, he tends to inhale and cough so I end up with unusable powdery crumbs that I can't give to the dog straight from the bag. Overall, this is a great product because it is just chicken and both the dog and the cat love this stuff. I frequently buy the biggest bag and will continue to do so. The good pieces are cubes of chicken, and are dehydrated and crunchy. Since its dry, its easy to handle and give to the dog or cat as a treat.  The bag has a zip closure to keep it fresh.

review/summary: Wonderful natural treat Made in USA
review/text: We got these as a x-mas gift and this is the BEST treat! I am very careful about what I give my Shih Tzu who is a puppymill rescue and has health issues. This treat is a 100% natural made with 100% chicken and also VERY IMPORTANT is that it is NOT MADE IN CHINA. I never give my dog anything that is made in China (I have relatives in China and trust me you do not want to feed your dog anything that is made there) so there have been very few options out there for my dog. The added plus is that both my dog and cat LOVE these treats. My dog is more finicky than my cat and they both go crazy over these and b/c I know they are 100% natural chicken I feel confident giving them the treats. There are, however, two drawbacks and that is why I can't give it 5 stars. 1) A lot of the treats are wasted b/c they crumble and at least 1/4 of the bag looks like it is filled with sawdust (crumbs from the broken treats). Many of the pieces also crumble into pea-size pieces which are too small for a dog. Fortunately my cat does not mind the tiny pieces so I give these to him. These treats are also very expensive which I don't mind b/c the quality is so good but for this price, I wish so much would not go to waste. 2) Like another reviewer said, you do need to be careful b/c I have found a bone in them as well. I found a bone about an inch long embedded in one of the treats so now I am careful to inspect the treat before giving it to my dog. Even with these drawbacks, I still feel these are the best treats out there if you are looking for 1) healthy, 2)natural, 3) tasty treats that are 4) MADE IN USA. In my experience, it is nearly impossible to meet all 4 criteria. This is the only treat that does (at least for my pets where taste is concerned. My pets refuse to eat Newman's treats even though they are healthy).

I used to give him smelly wet food, but I just couldn't handle gagging 2 times a day...<br /><br />Since I ground it into a fine powder, I did notice some pea-sized bits of hard something, most likely bone. This might not be an issue for a big dog, but for my small, old cat, I have to be sure to pick these pieces out. Just be observant when feeding your pet.<br /><br />I used to buy this product locally, but I found they were selling it for over twice the price per ounce, so this is a GREAT value!

review/text: I just discarded 20% of the bag.  Some of the pieces had chicken veins (dark purple spots), others had fatty parts to them. A few pieces weren't completely 'dry.' This is the first time I've tried this brand and it looks like they use thigh meat in their mix, whereas the other companies I've purchased in the past seem to use only breast meat? It just looks much more yellow -- I don't know exactly what it means -- I guess I'm just used to seeing bright, white, crispy pieces when I buy the other brands that Amazon offers.

review/summary: my cats love it!
review/text: Following the reviews of this product, I purchased this as a treat for my cats. It was love at first sight! I need to break it into smaller pieces before feeding them to the cats and they go crazy for it. I'm surprised because the food itself doesn't have a very strong odor (like some of the other cat treats) but it was enough for the cats to know it's "treats time". Will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Great for ferrets to!
review/text: All 4 of my ferrets go nuts for this stuff. Even though theres a picture of a dog or cat, it isnt specific to just one species, its great for all of them! The ONLY ingrediant is 100% chicken breast which is perfect for ferrets an is the most healthy "treat" out there, better then the other junk like N-bones, bandits etc. They say the best treat is meat, so this stuff is PERFECT! It takes time for them to get used to it but once they did, they started doing tricks the 2nd they see the bag.<br /><br />There has been a huge increase in there coat and there energy levels. And since i started putting it in there food they even eat alot less because there getting filled more with meat as well. I support this treat for dogs, cats and ferrets :D!

review/summary: PureBites freeze dried chicken treats
review/text: I bought a small package of this some time ago as I was having trouble finding something to hide their meds in (both cats and dogs). They love this stuff!<br /><br />They haven't gotten bored with it, or learned that I sometimes bury their meds in it.  Works way better than pill pockets, pieces of cheese, peanut butter, or even a bit of roast chicken. When using it to hide meds, it's easier to soak a piece in a little broth. The pill doesn't have to be completely hidden, just kind of indent it in a bit, let the dog smell that treat and he'll gobble it right down.<br /><br />Also, there are always crumbs and bits at the bottom of the package that I sprinkle on their dog/cat food and they seem to enjoy that a lot - one of my dogs won't eat anymore unless he's got the chicken crumbles on his food.<br /><br />I'm completely sold on this product.

There is some "crushed" product, but I sprinkle it over her food and she loves it.  I don't mind.  If you don't like that, try Prime Taste Treats - they are more expensive, but not as much "crushed" product.  I'm a fan and more importantly, so is my doggie!!

review/summary: My Cat Loves This Stuff
review/text: My cat loves this stuff.  She has diabetes and these are the best treats for her because they are all protein and no carbs.  I test her blood for glucose and have to prick her ears.  This is her reward and she knows that if she puts up with me she gets a nice, fat free, carb free delicious treat.  Take care of your pets and give them nutritious freeze dried meat/chicken rather than the junk food treats that are loaded with uneeded carbs.<br /><br />Also, this is a great price and a large bag lasts for a long time.  Cat and dog Pure Bites are exactly the same with larger pieces in the bag for dogs.  Just break them up and kitties love them too.  I also use the crushed treats to top off a meal and make it tastier.<br /><br />When my friend's bring their dogs by, they always get some too.  All of the pets love this product!!!

review/summary: Great product, Great Price
review/text: My 13 year old Lhasa makes the title Prima Dona seem tame.  She is so finicky, we're at wits end.  I got tired of making her treats and needed something to bribe her with. What makes it harder is that she can't have salt due to her severely enlarged heart. We went to a doggy boutique and the lady "knew" that she had something she would like.  She tried EVERY treat she had and Michi just turned her nose up at everything!  The lady finally said, I'll bring out the big guns, and indeed, Michi loved the freeze dried chicken breast treats.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $12.95 for 2 oz. We were desperate so I paid it.  PureBites are a God-send!  Not only is the price more than reasonable, but Michi will do just about anything for them.  I recommend these highly for anyone with a finicky dog, especially one with heart problems, such as Michi.

I have a timed treat feeder that is in use when we are away from home, and this is a big favorite with the group.  Short of fixing them some freshly cooked chicken breast (tough to do when we're not home!), this is one of the healthiest and tastiest treats around.

Of all of the treats I have bought them, they like these the best. The only problem with them is that some of the package has more crumbs than large pieces. I put the crumbs on top of their regular dog food which they also love. Maybe Amazon could protect the packages better for shipping. I recommend this product.

review/text: My three month old yorkie mix, Gizmo absolutely loves these treats. Every time he hears the bag crinkle he would run up and sit patiently waiting for his treat. They sell Purebites at my local petshop along with various hollistic brand dog food, so I know it's good. When Gizmo became picky about eating his kibble a pet shop worker suggested I sprinkle pieces of this onto the kibble, and it worked wonders for his appetite. The chicken is easiest on his stomach, I've noticed with too much liver Purebites he begins to have diarhia. Otherwise, I higly recommend this.

review/text: These oat cakes are really more like super-crumbly crackers... and they are quite good, even if they are heinously overpriced.  I enjoy eating them by themselves, they have a variety of textures and layers of flavor; a great substitute for other, less healthy, mindless eating, and one small packet can be stretched out for a while.  Interestingly enough, the organic version tastes saltier (pleasant surprise) but both their plain oat varieties are quite good.<br /><br />I also like that each box contains more than one sealed packet, so you can eat a few at one sitting and save the others without worrying about them going stale.  A nice touch; very considerate of the consumer.

Maria crackers have a lightly sweet taste  with a hint of caramel ( not like caramel sauce or candy but like the caramel you would get on top of creme brulee). they are crunchy but not hard and are great for dipping since they do not break up when moist.

review/text: I recently discovered these cookies in my large area supermarket. For 79 cents, I thought I couldn't go wrong. I love them! They are not too sweet and have a nice crunch to them without being too hard. They remind me a lot of Social Teas. For a treat, allow some ice cream to soften. Put a tablespoon of ice cream on one cracker and put another cracker over the top to make a "sandwich". Freeze in foil or wax paper. Yum! And not very high in calories or fat, depending on which ice cream you use. I think Goya could give Nabisco a run for its money, based on taste and price of these lovely crackers.

Since this product was seldom on the shelves in my hometown supermarkets,I decided to buy direct from Goya and ordered a carton of 24 packages. Each one I opened was overbaked and brittle. I eventually threw them all out because there was no way to reach the factory. I did buy a package recently when it was available in the supermarket. I feel somehow that the factory was happy to unload some unacceptable batches on an unwary customer.

It has no milk, no cream, and no non-dairy creamer.  When most people think of "hot chocolate," they think of a drink that's made with milk, no? Just like a latte or a cappucino requires the addition of milk.  Yet for some reason the same people who think nothing of adding milk to make a cappucino can't figure out that they need to do the same to make hot chocolate.  Baffling.<br /><br />Use of the Suchard disc without the addition of milk or cream (either the Tassimo milk discs or regular milk) will have the same result as diluting Hershey's syrup with water.  Expecting it to taste anything like Swiss Miss or similar packaged cocoas containing powdered milk is unrealistic and unfair.  This product is even better used with powdered milk or non-dairy creamer, as it has a richer flavor due to less dilution that way.
