review/summary: Great Taste for Peanut Lovers
review/text: For those who love peanuts this bar has a great nutty taste since it combines both peanuts and peanut butter.  It's 220 calories with 20% of calories from fat and has 7 grams of protein.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had was that my bars arrived with the peanut butter melted making it very messy to eat.  Therefore, if you decide to purchase these bars, keep them out of extremely high heat or just accept that the top peanut butter layer melts in hot weather as a chocolate bar would.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great bar for peanut lovers and a much better choice than candy for when you are craving a non-fruit snack.

review/summary: Expensive and messy.
review/text: You only get 5 bars in a box so the price comes out to almost .60 cents a bar, that's expensive.  Especially when it's just a glorified PayDay candy bar.  It does have 7g. of protein but also 22g. of carbs. so it's not a diet bar and it's not a low-carb bar.  It also doesn't compare to a nut and granola bar, the granola in this bar looked like oats covered in a sugar glaze.<br /><br />It tasted good on the start but by the finish it had a fake, burnt peanut taste, almost like rancid oil.  Apparently my box had gotten too hot because the coating of peanut butter that is on the bottom of the bar had melted and it was a mess inside the wrapper.  This would not be kid friendly in the car.  It would be a great big mess.<br /><br />I would pass on these for the cost and nutritional information alone.  But then combined with the peanut butter coating on the bottom (!) it's definitely a no-go.

review/summary: Good but Messy Candy Bar
review/text: The Double Peanut flavor of Planter's "Big Nut Bars" Is a large size bar that tastes good and is also quite filling. At 220-calories per bar it can't really be considered a lite snack. The bars have a layer of peanut butter on the bottom that coats the wrapper and eventually your fingers. If your are looking for a salty/sweet snack, like peanuts and don't mind the calorie count or mess, these might just be what you're looking for.

review/summary: Good tasting, high protein snack!
review/text: These bars taste great!  If anything, they may be a little on the salty side, but that's what you would expect if you've ever had salted Planters peanuts.<br /><br />Upon opening the wrapper for these bars, the first thing you notice is the peanut butter on the bottom.  So these bars are not for youngsters unless you don't mind a little cleanup.  They are also a very substantial size (1.62 oz each) and much larger than say a Quaker granola bar.  For those considering this product as part of a lunch for your kids, these bars are on the high side in calories and fat (220 & 13g) so this may not be a good idea to stick in a child's lunch every day.<br /><br />For anyone who is not too concerned about eating healthy and enjoys both salty and sweet snacks I say give this product a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Just average...too chewy and sweet
review/text: I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCKIBY">Planters Big Nut Bars, Roasted Triple Nut, 8.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, so I was thinking these would be similar, only with all peanuts.<br /><br />That wasn't the case...<br /><br />These are more difficult to chew and more chewy than I like.  They also have lots of sweetners included (in order): corn syrup, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, brown sugar (in granola), fructose to add up to 12g per bar.  This is actually 1g less than the triple nut, so I'm not sure why I notice it more with these...<br /><br />Overall, they are ok, but I wouldn't put them on my shopping list.

review/text: My son and I really love these bars.  If we had it our way, we would have eaten the whole box in one sitting.  My wife on the other hand prevented us from doing just that. So we had to settle for 1.5 bars each.  The flavor is just the right amount of sweet and salty and gooey at the same time.  Would really recommend these if you like chunky peanut butter.

review/summary: A GREAT SNACK
review/text: I really liked this snack bar combination of peanuts and peanut butter.  It is made up of a thin bottom layer of peanut butter topped with just peanuts that does not become too gooey or sweet. There are 5 bars to a box and it comes out to around $14/box which is a bit expensive (I deducted a star for value) but peanuts are the first ingredient.  I would rather pay more money for these then have my kids (and myself) eat a peanut bar where peanuts are listed as the third or fourth ingredient.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the health snack bars and this one is a good substitute for me.  It's not exactly a diet snack but it's better then the other options I usually go to when I am feeling peckish.  Here are some of the key nutrional facts:<br /><br />calories - 220<br />daily value saturated fat - 20%<br />daily value protein - 7%<br />daily value fiber - 12%

review/summary: A great snack
review/text: I am not really a "peanut" fan. I prefer pistachios and other more expensive nuts in general. But these peanut bars are fantastic in flavor. The (I guess you'd call it) nougat around the peanuts is very tasty and creamy and the bar is pretty filling even if you only eat one.<br /><br />It's a higher calorie bar. It actually has 220 calories in only one bar and also has some saturated fat so it's not for people who are looking for a diet snack. Also, half its calories come from fat (110 out of 220). The second ingredient says corn syrup so that kind of gives you an idea of this bar's target audience.<br /><br />They come in a box so if Amazon is selling these as a set of 10 boxes. Doing the math, that's only about 56 cents per bar, which is definitely a good deal for a general snack. I highly recommend them even though I usually go for a lesser fat snack.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I love planters peanuts & I'd never had a nut bar before these but I can clearly see that I've been missing out.  These are quite yummy.  I wasn't expecting the peanut butter layer that's on the bottom.  Not sure why but I always assumed that it was just the nuts all stuck together & that was all.  I was really excited to see that peanut butter layer.  It was quite yummy.<br /><br />My kids really liked these as well.  My daughter said that they were a little tough which I may agree with but I think it's my problematic jaw saying that more than anything else.  My jaw wasn't happy with me eating this but it's too good to pass up so my jaw will have to deal.  :)<br /><br />If you like peanuts then I would highly recommend these Big Nut Bars.

review/text: My Vizsla is an EXTREMELY picky eater (won't even eat canned food by itself!) and I was hoping a "raw" food might please her picky palate.  She is on a grain-free diet and doesn't tolerate chicken, lamb or beef so this was perfect for her!  I also love that it is a nutritionally complete dog food.  It doesn't have a strong smell at all (unlike most canned foods) and I was worried she wouldn't like it but she scarfed it right down, even mixed with dry food.  I also like that you mix it with warm water, she seems to like warm food better.  Great dogfood, well worth the price!

review/summary: flavorful and healthy without being "nutty" or chewy
review/text: This is the BEST whole wheat pasta we've had, and trust me- we've tried most of them. Not only does it taste really great, it stands up to just about anything you subject it to- overcooking, baking with sauces, being sauteed in oil, refrigeration, etc.<br /><br />The bionaturae pastas all cook up lovely. And unlike other whole wheat pastas, there's no weird aftertaste or bitterness no matter how long you cook it for. No matter how al dente (or how tender) you like your pasta cooked, this pasta holds up to whatever you subject it to. We tend to like pasta more on the tender side, and the pasta retains its shape, doesn't disintegrate or get glue-y even after 12 minutes in boiling water. Holds on to sauces very nicely. Also refrigerates well after being mixed with sauces.<br /><br />This particular pasta (the Chiocciole) is perfect for ziti and other baked pasta dishes (macaroni and cheese!)<br /><br />My daughter, who is four years old and a SUPER picky eater, prefer this over her regular semolina pasta.<br /><br />The best part about this? The Chiocciole boils up LARGE and fluffy and really fills your plate, so you can have a nice large bowl of pasta for not a lot of calories.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: Although this pasta is super expensive it's totally worth it. This pasta comes out consistently al dente. Sometimes I'll end up buying other pasta at the store, but I always come back to this because the texture is always perfect. I'm very happy to find this on amazon because it's still much cheaper than at whole foods ($4 a bag). Both the wheat and the white versions of this pasta are delicious. The wheat isn't too wheaty, although you will notice the difference in taste.

review/text: As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found.  The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4"), dry, and brittle.  That's rather surprising given their fat content:  a whopping 9g per serving.<br /><br />If you're a baker, you're better off making your own.  But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley.

Definitely a recommend buy for any gluten-intolerant person.  They have a great aftertaste too.<br /><br />One complaint: They are VERY addictive.  :D

Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.<br />They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient.

They seem to be for the discriminating palate as they are dark chocolate. To me they seem to have a sophistication other cookies do not. I find them more convenient and delicious than others. Especially since I rarely bake. I hope amazon keeps these cookies on forever. Yes, it is true they are crumbly but it is easy enough to clean the mess. 170 calories per 2 cookies which is good if you're on a diet. Organic is a plus in my book. I'm using these to keep calories in me cause I ain't on no diet and need to gain weight due to health issues that have caused a major downfall. So, yes please, keep the cookies coming. - Smiles -

They are somewhat tender to begin with, and I don't know how Amazon can package them in a special way to prevent such destruction. We all know how packages are treated by the carriers who deliver them....not delicately, that's for sure. So, will never order these by mail again and must pay the exorbitent price the go for at Martin's. Pooh!

review/text: These cookies would be better if the base dough recipe was the same as the Extreme Chocolate Mini Cookies with the addition of dark chocolate chunks.  As they are, they are more sweet than chocolate, and shouldn't in any way be considered a "dark" chocolate.  They aren't bad, they just aren't what is expected by the product description.  They also arrived more crumbled than intact, a problem classic in gluten-free baked goods that can be easily corrected by tweaking the recipe.  This is not one of this line's best offerings.

review/summary: Tiny, sugary,  overpriced but taste good....
review/text: Ultra tiny to be paying about $1 for a pack of 2.  Really not worth the price.  Sugary, somewhat crispy and very chocolaty but I was hoping for more melty chocolate pieces...disappointed in finding one or two per cookie.  Every cookie had part melted onto the wrapper or had one broken.  It was fun trying but way overpriced.  I won't repurchase.

review/summary: Pam's Choc. Chunk Cookies SCRUMPTIOUS!
review/text: Although I can't make myself eat Pam's chocolate chip cookies (tasteless), these dark chocolate, chocolate chunk cookies are so delicious that I prefer them to other ready-made cookies on the market. And I'm no longer on a gluten-free diet, but still buy them whenever I can and gifted these to my sister and niece who were wowed by them, big time. If you're a chocolate lover at all, these cookies are super chocolatey and satisfying to that great craving. And they're healthy - a big plus for me. And the price at Amazon is terrific. Enjoy!

review/text: Wow! I thought when I went gluten-free, I wouldn't be able to find any good chocolate cookies, but boy, was I wrong!<br />These cookies have the richest chocolate flavor I've ever tasted in my life. They fix my chocolate cravings within one bite, and one cookie is enough for me at a time because they are so rich and yummy! I would highly recommend these cookies to anyone, gluten-free or not!<br /><br />Btw, I bought these at Wal-Mart for 3.30/box.

review/text: I love dark chocolate so that was one reason I chose these.  These cookies had a good taste as others had testified to, but all 6 boxes came as crumbs.  They were a little dry.  Probably would taste fantastic fresh.  My kids ate them anyway and I used one box as crumbs for a dessert. Not what I was expecting as these were my pick to buy from a birthday gift certificate.

I think these are delicious, filling, and satisfy even the strongest chocolate craving or sweet tooth. When they arrive in crumbs it kinda stinks but I just eat the crumbs with a spoon or dump them in a baggie and use to sprinkle over my tofutti or fruit. I must admit the shortbread cookies are my fav but these are great when I need chocolate.

review/text: I adore dark chocolate and found these cookies to be ultra-satisfying.  Their flavor was superb, as was the texture -- crisp without being hard, and the yummy chocolate chunks...of course, it was nice to at least pretend to be virtuous by purchasing and consuming them ("I'm supporting organic foods!")!  Let's face it, some cookies (and other foods) that purport to be healthier for you than others taste like cardboard.  These aren't like that.  In fact, my only complaint is that it's hard to stop eating them once I've opened a box!  But then, we all know that dark chocolate is a good source of antioxidants, so...

I'm hoping this was just a bad batch.  I hope Pamela's doesn't ruin a great product by inconsistent preparation processes.

It has a lot of chocolate chips its soo yummy, but it isnt sickeningly sweet. Its good to have with a nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />The only thing is I would suggest is they should give 2 cookies instead of 3 by making the cookies a tiny bit thinner. Somehow 2 was a little unsatisfying, and the cookies were like too thick for my taste.

These cookies made by Pamela top the O*** cookie by miles.I have tried a few others also but always come back for more dark chocolate.

review/text: These cookies are ridiculous. I don't know what kind of chocolate is in these chunks, but it's got to be the richest, most decadent dark chocolate I've ever tasted. I thought it was just me, so I asked my sister if she'd like a cookie. She said, "Wow! These are SO good!" I didn't realize that they were gluten free until I read the label. I've never had a gluten free anything before. Maybe it's the organic chocolate. These are crispy little cookies that are so delicious that I think I may have addicted not only myself, but my sister too. Like other people with reviews here, I  ordered them to round out an order to qualify for free shipping. This is a "re-order" item now for sure.

Amazon has them at a great price to sell too as my local Jimbo's sells them for $3.85 for the 5.29 oz box.  They keep fresh a long time.  I have ordered them several times from Amazon and it has been hit-or-miss for fresh unbroken cookies or something suitably to make a pie crust or so stale they are garbage, but Amazon stands behind the order and either replaces or refunds!  Way to go, Amazon!  Thank you!

review/summary: rich flavored chocolate cookies
review/text: These cookies are rich and creamy with a wholesome taste. They don't have a bitter taste like most dark chocolate does, so if you're looking for a traditional bitter taste this is not it. They aren't as soft as bakery cookies, but not crisp as crackers either-they are a medium softness.There are 9 cookies about 1 3/4" in diameter.<br /><br />The cookies are placed in a plastic container wrapped in a plastic bag within a heavy paper box. I opened a few boxes and looked in the window of the other boxes and none were cracked. I had bought them as Christmas gifts mostly because the current picture shows a red and green box, but I was disappointed that the box was actually orange and pale green. Nevertheless, one of my relatives liked them a lot and so did I.

review/summary: I like them, my 11-year old loves them and my husband dislikes them
review/text: When I got home from work, my cookies were waiting for me at the front door; baking in the sun on a 113�F day, probably for 2 or 3 hours.  Inside each pack, the two cookies melded together and would not separate.  They are about 2 inches in diameter and break/crumble easily.  They can actually be quite messy to eat, so beware giving them to a child or while wearing white.  ;)  They are not soft, moist or chewy at all, but not brittle either.  The center of the cookie has a small pool of dark chocolate that kind of oozes out when you partially bit into it.  The expiration date on the cookie wrappers were about 2 weeks from the date of arrival, so I store them in the freezer to keep longer.<br /><br />My 11-year old son, my husband and I tried them while they were still hot.  My husband (a junk-food-junkie) only ate half a cookie and threw away the rest.  He prefers soft cookies, so these were just too hard and bland to him.  He'd give these 2 stars.  My son, on the other hand, loves them and would give them 5 stars!  In fact, he chooses these over fudge popsicles and other favored deserts, which kind of surprises me.  He prefers the typical American child's diet, like pizza and hamburgers, so I was expecting him to throw his away too.<br /><br />I think the cookies have a rich DARK-chocolate taste (fringing on being too rich) and almost tastes like there is a hint of alcohol in them (like rum or something like that).  I don't know why I taste that, but I do every time.  I'm not a milk drinker; however, I usually need to drink it with these cookies.  It's easy only eating 1 package because they are too rich to want more.  I think these are good cookies, not great, and would personally give them 4 stars.<br /><br />I suspect that the unusual circumstances of waiting in 113�F weather tampered with the cookies texture and perhaps taste too.  I have never tried this brand of cookies before, so keep in mind I don't have any reference to compare these to.

They're perfect for the on the go actvities.  They taste like brownies to us.  My 12 year old daughter with celiac loves to take one to a friends house so she always has a snack if she needs one.  Her friends like the taste too.

review/summary: Insanely Good !
review/text: Like others have said - these are really decadent and GOOD.  They are very small and most of mine were crumbled up in the package - but if you can overlook that part you won't believe what a decadent delicious chocolate morsel these are!  I don't know how they do it but these are actually better than any chocolate cookie I've ever had and you would NEVER know these are gluten and everything else free!

review/text: I decided to try these cookies because of a warehouse special and the excellent review. A TRULY DECADENT DELIGHT! Besides being organic and gluten free, these cookies are some of the best I have eaten and I plan on buying some for the Holidays!  If I ordered them all the time, I would just eat them all up and then----well, you see the problem, I think!

review/summary: For the chocolate lover...sized well
review/text: These are good tasting cookies if you enjoy chocolate. Have a nice gooey chocolate center. They also have nice texture. I ususally enjoy best chewie chocolate chip type cookies, these are harder but not too hard.<br /><br />But that also does lead to their one drawback, they do tend to crumble and with the chocolate in the middle that can get a bit messy. One last positive point though. At least for the 2-count pack of 50, 2 is a great snack size. Enough to feel full but not too much. Recommended.

review/summary: The best cookie for dark chocolate lovers
review/text: These are simply the best dark chocolate cookies I've ever tasted.  This is one product where the hype equals the reality.  Extremely intense dark chocolate flavor with high quality dark chocolate chunks.  Every month I buy Ghirardelli double chocolate cocoa and these cookies to satisfy my chocolate craving and both are so much better than the waxy, overly sweet, bland chocolate you find at a grocery store.  I discovered these when buying Christmas gifts for my mom who switched to gluten free, and I've been hooked ever since.  If you love intense dark chocolate, these are your cookies. Keep them in the fridge in the summer since they are so packed with chocolate that they'll melt otherwise.

review/summary: A 2-inch circle of chocolate perfection
review/text: I recently discovered I am gluten and dairy intolerant. Even before that, though, we were already buying these cookies at our local health food store. I have never been a cookie fan (yeah, crazy, right?) but these are perfect - there's no other way to put it. They are amazing either by themselves or dipped in coffee or dark red wine. The only difficulty is trying not to eat a whole box in a sitting, especially when my chocaholic husband is at home. We try to stick to the portion size listed in the box (2 cookies, 170 calories) just right enough to take care of the occasional sweet tooth.

I will warn that you will think of these cookies all the time once you try them, so be careful when buying them in large quantities.  I have to hide these from my hubby and dole them out one package at a time every few days/day or so.  The two cookies per package makes these the perfect serving size to share, or not...

review/text: These babies are MUCH too good for my own good.  The chocolate chunks are large & made of very good chocolate, and the texture is chewy & firm.  To me, they actually taste just like a really good brownie mix-- as if somebody took unbaked brownie mix & turned it into a cookie.  I told myself I was going to try just one for dessert, & ended up eating the whole frigging box, only very reluctantly giving one to my friend.

review/text: If you like sweet and like chocolate, then you should like the taste of these. The main ingredient is sugar, so these are very sweet. They are also very crumbly, and only 9 cookies in each box, so they are expensive (and a box is only 5.29 oz). But because they are so tasty and 89% organic I'm giving them an overall 4 star rating.

review/summary: How can dark chocolate disappoint?
review/text: I was really disappointed with these cookies. I love anything dark chocolate, and the fact that they're organic was a big plus when I was contemplating the purchase.  However, some of the previous reviewers were right - they are over the top sweet (and I've never felt this way about any other cookies, especially dark chocolate ones). I've never tried gluten free cookies before, so maybe that's why they don't taste as good as I expected. Usually chocolate cookies go very fast at our house, but I still have most of the box sitting around.

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/summary: Came highly recommended by our dogs breeder
review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this
review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/summary: Less meat in new formula
review/text: I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

review/summary: My PICKY dogs will eat it!!! no higher praise....
review/text: Super picky poodle... doesn't eat dog food (folks say if you don't give them anything else they will eat what you give them, not true in this case, tried...) &lt;shrug> he loves this food... He eats it on a daily basis - which is great as he was a rescue who previously had human food and I battled the food issue for years before finding this.  Great product!

review/summary: Holistic Select and Amazon Prime = A+
review/text: We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online.
