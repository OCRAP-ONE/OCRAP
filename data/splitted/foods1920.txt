review/text: These might be the best chips I have ever had.  The "Used By" date is March 2011, but I had to cut this bag open as it was sealed up so tightly (this is the first bag of chips I've had to cut open..if I really reeked on it I could have got it, but I didn't want it to explode in my face).  No worries, you will be happy you got these.

review/text: For those of you who cannot drink caffeine or choose not to, this decaf version is an excellent option. The Chai is a spicy black tea, with hints of  cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black epper, and star anize. I know most people drink it warm and add milk and or honey but I am in a small percent who drink it cold w/o accoutrements. I find it to be an exciting change from the normal iced tea...<br /><br />I know Tazo makes great teas and Starbucks carries a lot of them but I could not find this decaf Chai anywhere! I was so happy to find it at Amazon and for a great price.<br /><br />I also rec'd Tazo's decaf passion iced tea. It is lighter, has a pleasant purple color and very flavorful.  Herbal Infusion Tea-Passion (Decaf) - 20 - Bag<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/summary: exactly what is needed for a cook who cares about quality
review/text: This is exactly the product I've been looking for. Individually wrapped spices that will stay fresh longer, are easy to use because they are pre-measured, are organic and most of all, useful for cooking what I cook.<br />  This is such a great idea! I have lots of spices (too many, really) but I can see that they sit on the shelf for years and get stale. They are so expensive to begin with, what a shame!<br />  Do what I did: put a little sticker on each spice in your spice cabinet and label it with this year (2009). Then forget about it. The next time you have to use a spice, use it, but someday, when you are cooking something special and want to have the spices be of the best quality, look at the date on that spice - you'll be amazed how old it is!

review/summary: I got the 2-lb Bellagio Chocolate Truffle!
review/text: Hey, every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine---every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.<br /><br />Ive also tried Neuhaus, Chirardelli and other store brands, but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.<br /><br />Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys brand. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.<br /><br />Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this brand because of high caloric content -- 700 calories for the venti)<br /><br />So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me, Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.

review/text: I keep trying to find a hot chocolate I like better, but I haven't found one yet.  Traditionally, I am dark chocolate fan but this is an excellent, rich chocolate drink.  It is also my mother's favorite and she is very direct with her hints that it's time for me to send her some when her stock gets low.<br /><br />I read a review that someone thought the Bellagio brand had a chemical taste.  The reviewer might have been referring to other flavors.  There is a different taste that seems perhaps spicey, but not chemical.  I also like the fact that it contains non-dairy creamer because I do not drink milk.

review/text: I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again.

However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY brand he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm/hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!

review/summary: Food or a chemistry lab?
review/text: What offends me most about this product isn't just the ingredient list that sounds like it comes straight from a mad scientist and takes a lot of reading to even reach anything that sounds remotely like food: I've come to expect that from today's mass market food. What offends me is the blatant misleading marketing. Not only does the package look fancy and have a fancy name, and not only does it say "A European Classic" (this is an American product), and not only does it say "Gourmet Hot Cocoa" (because at an expensive restaurant I always ask the chef for "corn syrup solids"), but worst of all "Savor the flavor of old world style chocolate": because I'm sure in the old world they mixed a nice helping of partially hydrogenated soybean oil and silicon dioxide into their hot chocolate.<br /><br />Someone gave me a package of this stuff and I'm debating whether or not to eat it, so I can't comment on the taste. But the misleading advertising alone, combined with this chemistry lab of ingredients, deserves one star no matter how it tastes.

review/summary: Mild and Pleasant
review/text: I have been purchasing different mono-floral honeys, and was looking for one with a very mild flavor to use in my yogurt. I didn't want a flowery taste. I had tried Alfalfa. It was indeed mild, but still had that traditional honey taste of flowers. So I tried this Acacia honey, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's very good (in a mild sort of way). There are no floral tones (at least to my uneducated palate). It's simple, sweet, mild, with a slight kick towards the end with a somewhat earthy tone (when licked straight off the spoon). I've decided I prefer this over Wild Raspberry honey in my yogurt. Raspberry adds an enjoyable distinctive bright, clean flavor that isn't too overpowering, while it seems the Acacia sweetens the yogurt without flavoring or overpowering it at all, although I seem to sense a pleasing vanilla note. It lets the flavor of the yogurt come through, and that slight "kick" disappeared completely. It's so good. (It makes me think of Christmas for some reason!?!?!?) I think it's my new favorite. I'm finally enjoying my homemade yogurt again! Yea! And it tastes good with peanut butter, too...I never thought I'd say that about any honey. I haven't tried any other brands of Acacia, so I can't say this is the "best" Acacia honey out there, but I did enjoy it and will probably be buying more. Breitsammer is a very popular brand in Germany. Honeys that haven't worked for me for sweetening yougurt: Costco's (blech); Mild Buckwheat (better in coffee); MeadowFoam (too distinctive a flavor, but great for meringue cookies); Star Thistle (nice, but too floral in my yogurt); Alfalfa (too floral); Wild Raspberry (good; great with chocolate).  I don't think you'll regret buying this honey, unless you're looking for a very strong, assertive "honey" flavor.<br />Many people rhapsodize over Acacia honey. Please don't let my lack of phrases like "Oh my, this is like a taste of HEAVEN", stop you from enjoying this honey. I am not a honey-lover, myself. In fact, I don't like it, but am forced to limit my sweeteners to only honey. But I consider this to be very enjoyable, which is A LOT from a former avowed honey-hater. (And now I'm enjoying my yogurt for dessert it tastes so good.)

I haven't yet tried it in a large amount in something like egg salad but I think it should be fine because we both like the taste of olive oil. Good thing he likes it since there are 3 bottles! The posting could have been a little more clear that this was a reduced fat product. It's interesting that the olive oil seems to have made the mayo lower fat since mayonnaise made from scratch is made from olive oil (very labor intensive if you've ever done it yourself, which I have).

review/summary: Updated re: (Good but doubled price since last two orders)
review/text: UPDATE:  2 DAYS AFTER ORIGINAL REVIEW, THE PRICE WENT BACK DOWN TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE.  Great, because Walmart has 3 packs for $5, and I wasn't about to pay the $24 that was showing the other day.  Well, I guess my review is correct - still watch your subscriptions people!  Don't get caught when it's $24 for a week.  :)<br /><br />I like this MAYO because I think Hellmann's is the best, and I love Olive Oil (plus its good for you) - not that you can taste it really.  I find it to be high quality, and has the Hellmann's taste I prefer.  I put this on subscription 6 months ago, and have received 2 shipments at $11.99 each (for all 3 bottles).  NOW, it's more than doubled!!!!!<br /><br />Be sure to check your subscriptions on things people - when they go up, I don't see a notice or email (maybe missed it getting so much email these days), which I think they should do ESPECIALLY if a price DOUBLES.  Most of my can-goods did the same thing.<br /><br />One other note, packaging on my first order could have been better.  One bottle was dented enough that it opened, and I didn't notice until I finished one bottle - and then found it was rotten.  As for the bottles, they have a nice shape, with a wide mouth you can get to if you take off the lid so that you can still get knife/spoon inside if you need or want to.<br /><br />Off to check all my subscriptions!!!

review/summary: Broken Bottle
review/text: This product came in a pack of 3.  One bottle broke open and made a disgusting mess of the other items in the shipment.  One of the other bottles was severely dented in on top but luckily did not bust open.<br /><br />Overall, the product was as expected - this is our favorite mayonnaise.  However, I paid this price for three bottles and only two are useable due to poor packaging.  Luckily, the other items in my shipment were packaged well enough that they weren't ruined.

review/summary: Best Kona Coffee
review/text: I sampled just about every type of Kona coffee when I was in Hawaii with my sister 3 years ago.  This was a favorite for both of us.  Since I've been home, I have purchased directly from Jean Fike and she ships very quickly.  I am very happy that Fike Farms is now featured on the Amazon site. I couldn't resist getting some for my sister for Christmas.

review/summary: Fabulous Find From Fike Farms!
review/text: While vacationing on the Big Island of Hawai'i we picked up some whole bean coffee produced by Fike Farms and brought it back home to enjoy.  After searching for a really good, memorable 100% Kona coffee for several years, we found it in Fike Farms. Smooth, flavorful, with no after-taste.  We enjoy both the Estate Grade Medium Roast (sold here on Amazon, as well as from the Fike Farms web site) as well as their oh-so-wonderful "Extra Fancy Medium Roast" (available from them directly via their web site).  My communication with them from afar (via telephone & email) has been an excellent, pleasurable experience. Excellent order-processing and shipping and handling.  I selfishly hope that not TOO many people jump on the Fike Farms Bandwagon that they won't be able to produce enough of my favorite coffee for ME - LOL!  Happy Sipping!

review/summary: The Heat Is On, and it's great!
review/text: I picked up this peanut butter on a whim one day, and it quickly became my favorite. The heat comes from chilis and cayenne, but it's not overdone... just a mild glow. I first tried it on crackers, and that was great. Next I tried it in a sandwich with cherry preserves--wow. Cherries and chilis complement each other nicely. I've used it to make spicy peanut noodles and it was a hit. It's even terrific on a spoon out of the jar. Peanut Butter and Co. peanut butters are quality spreads, with a fresh peanut-y taste and a nice consistency. The Heat is On is my favorite variety.

review/summary: Just the right spice.
review/text: I wondered how this would taste before ordering.  I enjoy spicy foods, and peanut butter why not?  I really didn't want to get stuck with 6 jars of a peanut butter I did not like!  I gambled and went for it just based on the possibility of how good it could taste.  I actually made a good gamble for once.  This peanut butter is awesome!  It tastes good on crackers, in PB&J sandwiches, and PB & Cheese sandwiches. (I would have never tried the cheese part if a friend didn't make one when I let him use my PB and he had a pleasant look of delight on his face after his first bite) I'm sure the possibilities of what to eat this on, or cook it in are endless.<br />The heat to it is just right.  The oil tends to separate if it sits for a few days without being stirred.  However, this is not a problem, it stirs up very easy and your ready to go.  If you like it hotter you can stir it less and leave more of the oil on top.

review/text: Holy cow. I read a review here and saw that this peanut butter came with actual peppers. So I had to give it a shot. What an absolute surprise to find out that it freaking works. It is spicy, very much so. Yet the taste is so satisfying that it keeps you wanting more. The best part? It's all natural, and healthy peanut butter. Say goodbye to those salty salsa chips. Say goodbye to needing to go fast food for a spicy snack. And say hello to the best spicy snack you have never tried. Do yourself a huge favor and try this. I'm glad I did.

review/summary: New Taste Sensation In Peanut Butter
review/text: *****<br />This is a peanut butter you can feel truly good about eating, but BE FOREWARNED--it is very, very spicy. I personally love it, but if you don't like extremely spicy foods, you can always buy plain peanut butter and dilute it to get it to the heat level you enjoy. The blend of different peppers is a taste sensation that is really hard to describe--not just hot, but "tasty hot"!<br /><br />This peanut butter is made with "palm fruit oil"...google it...it is extremely healthy.. There is no added sugar in this peanut butter.<br /><br />No matter if you are a commercial peanut butter consumer or a purist who loves unsweetened raw nut butters--you will find much to love here--especially after you research all of the benefits of palm fruit oil. My husband is a junk food and fast food man and he also loves this...My two favorites are this and the same company's "Cinnamon Raisin Swirl". This ("The Heat Is On") is more versatile since it is less sweet and can be used in cooking, mixed with other peanut butters or almond butter for a hint of spiciness, or many other uses.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

My daughter loves to cook and the whole family benefits when she does, so we gave her this to try and it worked out very well. The spice heat is on upper side of what most casual spice eaters will like, but it is well within the tolerance level of my spice loving family.<br /><br />It can also be used as a dip and is great spread on celery. We also have some spicy jelly and a sandwich made with both is truly an experience.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

If it's too spicy, just dilute it with regular peanut butter.  Enjoy!!

I can't rate it perfect - would take a half star off if I could - because my personal preference would be sweeter; it is much less sweet than most "natural" and certainly any Jif-type PB. That is 100% my personal preference, however, and I just make my standard PB and honey sandwich and it's perfect.<br />I'd love to see them try a spicy chocolate PB!

review/summary: Overkill on the Spicy
review/text: I love all of the Peanut Butter & Co peanut butters except this one. I expected a far more subtle hint of heat not the overpowering spiciness you'll find here. The texture, because of the dried pepper skins and seed bits,  really bothers me. It was very disappointing. This is not to say you won't like it, IF you know what to expect and find those characteristics appealing. I just can't imagine it tasting good on anything, it's way too hot and the flavor and texture are just not good. I may try to use it for Thai peanut sauce but I'd put it in the blender to smooth out all the skins and seeds. I have 6 jars, that's a lot of peanut sauce...

Amazon cancelled my order due to availability too.  I will not pay ten bucks for one box of cereal so it is too good for me.<br />Good news it is made in the United States too and distributed through Barbara's the Puffin Cereal people.

I have plans of trying more but i do have this on auto ship for once every two months to rotate with a different blend they have. This is a bright coffee. It is smooth and a great way to start the day. This is more of a medium blend so for all you rich deep roast fans you  might want to try something else. But for those who would like to have an everyday blend give this a try.

review/summary: Yummy - I mean Yummy Caramel Covered Popcorn
review/text: My title - pretty much says it all. Yummy though is simply not enough of a description. Its crazy fresh too. And creamy. Yes creamy. The caramel is wrapped in a buttery flavor - just below the flavor of the caramel. And then - there's more - because you get to the popcorn yum. And then there is even more -  the crunch of the caramel - all which provide a fully yummy mouth experience.<br /><br />I bought a 3.5 gallon bag the first time and did think it would go stale before the two of us - plus the occasional guest - would be able to finish it. It was after all the first time ordering and I was doubtful it was going to be that good, in spite of the other reviewers who gave it very high ratings. It took me no time at all to realize that we would not be sorry to have purchased it, or even that if we liked it - we would probably get sick of snacking on it. But neither occurred. We were not sorry and we did not "get sick of it".<br /><br />This is just the best caramel covered popcorn I /we have ever consumed.<br /><br />So buy your yummy here today! Oh - and we got it very quickly. A huge plus when ordering a "snack" that sounds delicious that you know you are going to have to wait for.<br /><br />There is only one real downside, which is the cost of shipping, which appears to be the same for all of the sizes of popcorn. I would like/love them to see what they can do to change that, at the very least for the smaller "bags" of their product, so that people who might be interested in trying their goods, could do that and get to know what they like - without a huge shipping cost investment.

review/summary: Quick and apparently yummy toy
review/text: If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

review/text: I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.

review/summary: I Love These Say My Dogs
review/text: I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.
review/text: I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.

review/text: Since I have been seeing so many recalls not only on dog food but treats, I decided to look for something that is made in this country and found these.  My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.  They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).

review/text: My dog loves these.  A little pricey, but can be broken into 2 or 3 smaller treats.  My boxer boy has a sensitive stomach, and these have never given him any "digestive" (read "gas" or "the runs") problems, although I limit him to just a third of a bone a day.  May not be the healthiest, as one reviewer said, but seems to make my dogs limited life happier.  Not to mention, most real bacon is loaded with salt, chemicals, and saturated fat...not too healthy either!

review/summary: Read the fine print
review/text: We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this "edible" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically "edible", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these "healthy" edible Nylabones.

review/text: My 60-lb lab mix loved this bone (the large size)! I like that it doesn't leave a nasty mess all over the floor and didn't give Hobbes any gas or stool problems. But I bought it thinking that it would last awhile, since its large and feels hard, but he finished it in 5 minutes flat. Not very cost effective, since they are pretty expensive and don't last long, but I will reiterate that my dog absolutely loved it.

review/summary: Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

It's sweeter (so you need less) and has a vanilla frosting flavor, which reminds me of a bakery. I love adding this to coffee, espresso, drizzled over whipped cream and berries, a little extra added to sweet recipes as well. Be sure to get this one, FRENCH VANILLA vs. any other vanilla syrup out there.

I just use this and either almond milk (my favorite since it is thicker) or soy milk.  My grand-daughter insists on putting it on her ice cream which I don't mind since it doesn't add any calories.  It is so good I could literally drink it from the bottle, but I will show restraint and not do such a thing.  By the by, I bought a case.

review/text: The Seller: All Star Health is great to deal with.  My Brother-in-law and I have used them many times.  They ship relatively quick (3-5 days).  They always have competitive prices.  Until they recently bumped their price on the 10lb container it was the cheapest buy on the net.  Now 2 5lb containers are the cheapest way to go.<br /><br />The Product: I have tried Vanilla and Cocoa.  Per serving Vanilla has 18 grams to Cocoa's 16 grams of protein.  Both Mix INCREDIBLY well. I have a shaker cup and do not use it with this stuff.  I use a spoon. Thats it. Vanilla tastes really good.  Compared to other brands this is the best vanilla I have had that is not loaded with fat and other junk.  The Cocoa is my favorite.  It was not at first, It is not Chocolate.  It is Cocoa.  There is a distinct difference.  It came to be my favorite, however, when I warmed up the water in the microwave for about a minute and a half and then added the protein. It tastes just like hot chocolate and mixes even better in the hot water.  So now every protein shake is like a large glass of hot cocoa, and when you live in Minnesota, thats a really great thing :).  There are a bunch of good amino acids in all of these flavors. I really honestly have nothing bad to say about this product. The only annoyance is that it appears like everyone is steadily raising the price on this stuff.  I purchased 10 lbs from one place online for $47 within the last year.  The next time I went to the website it was $67.  I went to all star with my last purchase and the 10lb tub was $51.  Now it is in the 60's. Even at the price it is now, the product is all I buy as far as protein supplements go.<br /><br />Summary: You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: One of the better products out there...
review/text: I have used Complete Whey for over 10 years now... I am an avid cyclist and it's great for rebuilding/recovery after a hard training day or during a multi-stage race. I specifically prefer the Vanilla Bean flavor over the others.  I mix it with 12 oz skim milk, a banana (potassium) and a 1/2 cup frozen blueberries (anti-oxidants), throw in a few ice cubes too.  I also throw in a Centrum vitamin and a Joint Matrix supplement as needed. I've tried the majority of recovery supplements out there and this is the one that works best for me.
