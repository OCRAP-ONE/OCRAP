review/summary: A Cure for the Hack Attack
review/text: One night, I awakened with a terrible, can't-stop-coughing attack. Ginger is well-known to stop the coughing. I rummaged around for the little pack of my dwindling supply of Ginger Altoids until I found it. I had to chew only one to stop the hack attack. What a lifesaver! Imagine my surprise when I discovered amazon.com carries the product. Thank you so much! I bought my first tin at a bookstore in Austin, Texas, and I haven't been able to find them since. To keep the supply strong, I'll have to buy a 12-pack every time I order.

review/summary: Best mints on the market!
review/text: I gave up looking for these in the stores, as Target seemed to be the only ones who USED to carry them.  Haven't seen them in the longest time, which is sad because these Ginger Altoids are the cat's meow!  They're very strong tasting, which is what makes them such a delectable treat.  If you've yet to try these, you're truly missing out on something a little bit more than wonderful

review/text: So happy to find Ginger Altoids even though I would not normally buy twelve boxes at once! I have searched stores to no avail. I used to buy them at a couple of retail stores but no more. They are the best for breath and digestion. If I feel a little nauseated, I can put one or two in my mouth and they really help.

I was absolutely delighted to find them in Amazon's grocery department--- at the same or lower price as I was paying locally.  Please, Amazon, never stop selling them!

review/text: Not your ordinary candy, either.<br /><br />This is going to seem like an unusual selling point for a candy, but I have a prescription which gives me nausea, and Ginger Altoids actually ease the nausea quite a bit.  The hard part is saving them for when I feel ill and not just nibbling on them because they taste good.<br /><br />They are quite strong, but then if you've had other Altoids, you already know what to expect.

review/summary: Ginger Altoids are the BEST!
review/text: I discovered Ginger Altoids 2 years ago at Target stores in Texas.  I fell in love with them!  They are absolutely the BEST for indigestion.  I just enjoy eating them everyday because I love the taste.  They are a strong, spicy ginger.  When I share one with someone they comment on just how strong they are, but they always want to know where to purchase them.  They are addictive!  Target stopped carrying them and I e-mailed Altoids.  I was afraid they had stopped making them!  However, I found them on AMAZON!  I'm so happy they sell them, and please don't ever stop!

review/summary: Going by my dog's reaction--these are GREAT
review/text: Now, granted my dog will eat just about anything (only thing so far she won't eat has been mushrooms), HOWEVER there is a definite level of excitement she shows depending on the treat.  She is fed a Merrick diet and really enjoys the regular kibble,  (I happen to like how she poos and doesn't gas me out as long as we stay away from the TurDucken) but  I'd never tried the treats for her until now.<br /><br />The first time I unwrapped one of these it was as though the prey drive had kicked in and there was a salmon encrusted kitty cat in front of her.  Okay, maybe not quite that excited, but pretty darn excited.  She LOVES these (all flavors so far).  And NO GAS.  They are small enough to be a full treat, but big enough they can be divided, and I suppose with a knife could even be good for many small nibbles.<br /><br />In any case, the dog and I both love the Merrick products and the sausage treats are no exception.  Of course she loves the flavor and I love the end result (or lack thereof).<br /><br />Recommended and greyhound approved!<br /><br />JTG

review/text: As demerara sugar cubes, these are basically identical to any other product of their type. So there's no point in describing subjective attributes. The notable thing here is the price. The most well-known and widely distributed brand, La Perruche, typically costs $8+ per box (both here on Amazon and elsewhere). Whereas these cost roughly half that for the same quantity of product. So if you're in the market for demerara sugar cubes, get these. It's a no-brainer.

review/text: I have been savoring Tony Packo's since 1968.  The Hungarian Hot Dog they serve is phenomenal! And the Chicken Paprikash (Csirke Paprikas) is excellent!  Unfortunately, this 7.5 ounce canned sauce is thin and contains a whopping  56 grams of fat (2 tablespoons is the serving size)!  I used a strainer spoon to separate out some beef. Only buy the canned stuff if you're desperate.  I had to scoop out a thick layer of fat before heating. Unfortunately, the frozen sauce is no longer available.<br /><br />The dogs served at the restaurant (2 per order with a side of Pickles & Peppers) are easily edible without a fork and have the perfect combination of  mustard, thick rich sauce and onion. The place is a well maintained institution since 1932 with friendly staff and should be on your list of places to go while in the Toledo Ohio area. See their website for details.<br />http://www.tonypackos.com

review/text: I was really concerned that I would not be able to make a gluten-free gravy. Concerned no more! I have found what I was looking for. I like the consistency of the gravy produced with this flour; it definitely thickens. I have used this flour to coat my meat before sauteeing it. After removing the meat from the pan, I add my liquids (broth, wine,...) and seasonings; the end result is great. I didn't even have to add rice flour directly to the pan since I had lightly breaded my meat before adding it to the skillet. I will definitely make this a must-have staple in my pantry.

review/summary: Best Popcorn I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I have recently purchased a popcorn machine with intentions of getting that movie theatre style popcorn in the comfort of my home. As luck would have it my machine came with a case(12) of the Funtime 4 Oz Popcorn 3 in 1 Kernel Oil Seasoning Kits. My first batch and I thought to myself this is the best popcorn I've ever had but I had also been reading about the GNP popcorn and how they talked about believing they had the best popcorn in the USA. I thought, I can't imagine it getting any better than the Funtime popcorn but decided to give it a shot anyway and ordered some. Once it came in I proceeded to pop up a batch of both the GNP and the Funtime and do a side by side taste test. I have to say they are both very similar in taste but GNP is a little bit too salty for my taste so Funtime won out for me. I popped up several more batches and brought equal amounts to work the next day to give out and get opinions. The majority of people shared the same thoughts as me, Funtime was slightly better and GNP was a little too salty. I think this will be the only popcorn I will buy for my machine from this point on, it's really good popcorn and the fact it comes in the premeasured amounts is a big deal for me as I'm not into all the measuring and stuff.

review/summary: Awesome pasta!!
review/text: I have a hard time finding this pasta in the regular store so I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon.  This is a very hearty pasta.  One bag has fed; my family of 6, two adult guest and their 3 kids, with some leftover....no kidding.  The noodles are large and are able to hold a myriad of sauces.  I like this pasta cold or hot and as I hit summer here in Texas, pasta salads are always high on the menu.

review/summary: Great if you like treats for home decorations rather than food
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

Standing there for 30 minutes staring at a jar of capers. You should be glad no one called the cops.<br /><br />As my German friend once translated for me, Nonpareilles is called a quality class of the Caper, it concerns the smallest ones (and best ones). These are in the taste without resembling. Likewise very small dear beads for instance on Schokoladenpl&auml;tzchen are called Nonpareille.<br /><br />mmmmmm,Schokoladenpl&auml;tzche

review/summary: Greatest marinade!
review/text: So happy to find this available on Amazon!  Was introduced to this sauce years ago and now it is a staple in my pantry.  Super great for slow cooking a brisket, just trim meat, pour sauce over & seal in foil package in a low oven for about 4 hours - greatest treat ever!  And leftover sauce is great to use in veggie/noodle dishes, etc.  I love this stuff, and there is no sugar or chemicals in it.  It's a soy-based marinade and it is spicy (I only use the "original" recipe) and there are probably a million other uses for it that I have yet to discover.  I was pleased that this seller had different options so that I didn't have to order a whole case, I could order 1/4 case - great!  And promt shipping made this a great purchase.

review/text: We have used Chaka's MMM Sauce for years and was happy to see it on Amazon.com. This sauce is very versatile and is not your typical store bought sauce. It has a unique flavor that enhances your food. We have BBQ'd chicken, ribs, tri-tip, pork chops with it and it comes out moist and delicious every time. We have also used it on hamburgers and we've made meat loaf too. The best part is you don't have to use a lot of it to bring out the flavors of the meat. I recommend you try it and read the directions for measurements.

review/text: My favorite flavored coffee is French Vanilla.  I ordered this on a lark to try a new brand.  The price was right and 12 oz packaging works for me as I brew in a Toddy's cold water system and use 12 ounces at a time.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered it's not Vanilla but some kind of berry flavor with a chocolate aftertaste.  It's not bad, but not what I ordered.  Now, Amazon says I can't return it.  Very dissappointing.

review/text: I've used this for both pancakes and waffles and it's horrible. I followed the directions on the package and the waffles come out extremely dense; it's like eating bread from world war 2. Maybe if you add baking powder and dilute the mix a bit it will come out better. But then why not just make it all from scratch. The pancakes are a bit better, but not by much (using powdered sugar in the dry mix instead of honey made it taste a better). The only positive is that it is all natural and doesn't have any artificial or questionable ingredients. So at least it won't contribute to my premature death and preclude me from finding a better mix.

review/summary: Best GF pasta I've tried
review/text: As someone who has always loved pasta, living gluten free for the past year has been extremely frustrating.  I've tried countless types of pasta, including corn pasta, rice pasta and an interesting corn/navy bean blend pasta and the Tikyada Brown Rice pastas (NOTE:  I particularly like the ones with rice bran - it's noted on the label) have been the best that I've had.  I actually served it to someone the other day who doesn't live GF and he didn't notice a difference between that and regular pasta.  I do, however, find that I don't need to cook it as long as it says on the package.  I shorten the cooking time by about 2-4 minutes usually and just keep checking to see when it is done.  They go very well with GF vodka sauce.  Enjoy!

review/text: I LOVE Tinkyada's products.  I am sensitive to wheat/gluten, but not allergic.  If you follow the cooking directions, it will come out fine.  You can let it sit in it's sauce indefinitely, and it it won't overcook, like regular pasta.  It's great for date night, when you might be busy...having a glass of wine...while you wait for dinner.<br /><br />The other night, I tried cooking it the alternate way (it's on the package) because I am temporarily using a kitchen with only one small gas burner, and several electric appliances.  I really wanted pasta, so I boiled the water, added the spirals, let boil for a couple of minutes (stirred a few times) then took it off the heat and let it sit COVERED for about 20 mins while I sauteed veggies and made a sauce.  It worked!  YAY!  energy-efficient food!  I love it!<br /><br />When the sauce was ready, we drained the pasta...yup...cooked thru...and dumped it in the saucepan.  We let it sit while we did some other things, and it's texture was still great!

One thing to know about the cooking time for the pasta, don't use the directions on the package.  The pasta will be very over-cooked.

review/summary: Best GF pasta brand
review/text: I have been using Tinkyada pasta exclusively for a few years.  I have used this pasta in dishes I made to share at work, at parties, and at family functions.  No one knows the difference until they see me eating it (then they know it has to be GF).<br /><br />It isn't just the taste, but the texture that will fool anyone.  Tinkyada pastas hold their texture very well.  In my experience, they are as hard to cook to a mush as durham wheat pasta, and maintain their quality through refrigeration and reheating.  Every other brand of rice pasta, quinoa pasta, and corn pasta I have tried have a horrible mushy texture and over-cook way too easy.<br /><br />Makes great cooked pasta dishes and cold pasta salads, too.<br /><br />I have never had any problem with the quality of this product, whether buying it at a store or online.  I have never had any problems with shipping, and never a need to contact customer service.

review/summary: Closest match for a wheat pasta alternative
review/text: I've tried many types of brown rice pasta along with quinoa pasta.  Tinkyada is by far the closest and doesn't glop together like other substitute pastas.  This is the only brand that I'll buy now as it can be made al dente and the pastas don't stick together.  I've made several of the types, ziti, spirals, etc... and they mix well with either a pasta salad using oil or with a nice homemade red sauce.

review/summary: It should have six stars
review/text: I like this rice pasta better than wheat.  It has a nice chewy quality, it feels substantial against any sauce.  I don't care for rice, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that Tinkyada Brown Rice Spirals go really well with Indian and Chinese cuisines.  And it's made with Brown Rice, could it be better?  It's surprised me totally how good this rice pasta tastes!  And for the gluten sensitive it's really wonderful.

review/summary: Okay pasta
review/text: I know we are in the minority on this one!  We have not tried a large variety of gluten free pasta brands so I do not have a huge reference point.  Our first pasta brand was Sam's Mills corn pasta and it is still our favorite.  I find no matter which method I use to cook the Tinkyada pasta it comes out mushy, and it does not present very nicely as leftovers or in a baked dish.  It breaks up and falls apart.  However, the taste is fine and due to price and availability we continue using it.

review/summary: Love this pasta with a red or white sauce
review/text: Tinkyada brown rice spirals are so tasty with both red and white sauces.  It is a more substantial noodle and sauce gets trapped in the spiral making dinner even better.  I love having so many gluten free pasta options.  Cook the pasta by a timer and you are not likely to over-cook as some others have done.  Truly an affordable substitution for "regular" pasta.  Thank you to amazon.com for carrying this brand at reasonable prices!

review/summary: Excellent gluten-free pasta
review/text: I've tried several brands of gluten-free pasta, and Tinkyada is my favorite. Good flavor and texture, keeps well in the refrigerator, and heats up well in the microwave. Just follow the directions on the package, and get great results every time. They also include "Easy and Energy-Saving Cooking" instructions (boil for 2 minutes, cover and let sit for 20), which I use during hot weather - the pasta still comes out great, and my kitchen stays cooler. One note about the spirals - if you overcook them, they're still tasty, but they tend to break into smaller chunks. Keep an eye on your cooking time for best results. This is the pasta I use for casseroles and hot dishes - works great!

review/summary: Pleasant and Mild
review/text: These spirals cook much more quickly than other rice pastas I've prepared in the past, making this a handy choice when you have to prepare a late-night meal.  The spiral form gives it a firm body that doesn't vanish between the teeth, and the mild flavor makes it a good choice if you prefer pasta as a vehicle for the sauce.  This pleasant pasta is a regular on my table.

review/summary: Too Delicate for shipping?
review/text: I ordered a box of this spiral pasta, as well as a box of regular spaghetti noodles, and though it is VERY tasty for a gluten free pasta, my bags of spiral pasta each came with a quarter to half cup of JUST of broken shards of pasta, and the spirals that did stay in shape were "fractured" and many pieces break during cooking. The spaghetti noodles seemed to come in OK. Would buy this brand again, but maybe stick with less delicate shaped pasta that withstand shipping a little better.... Or recommend better packaging to prevent breakage. Anyone else have this problem with the spirals?

review/summary: Way Better Than Whole Wheat Pasta - Taste like Regular
review/text: I have tried to make myself eat the whole wheat pasta in an effort to eat healthier but I have always hated the texture and didn't care much for the flavor.  This pasta is amazing.  It tastes so good and the texture is about the same as white pasta. Since I found this I don't eat any other pasta.  It is worth every penny.  Last week I made macaroni for my neighbor and she was telling me how delicious it was.  I told her it was the brown rice pasta and she said she had no idea, and she's a gourmet cook.  I see that some in here say they have noticed they don't have to cook it as long.  I have noticed on my new stove that I actually have to cook it about 2 minutes longer.  So, it probably is just relative to how your stove heats.  Definite must buy though.

review/summary: Best noodles ever!
review/text: I love these noodles. Everyone I've fed them to has loved them, even if they don't have celiac disease. They are the best in taste and texture of all gluten-free noodles. I won't touch the other brands of noodles, which are too mushy or grainy. These have a nutty flavor and hold up well. The only drawback is they can be a little stiff when cold so they're not great for pasta salads.

review/summary: Excellent alternative for Gluten Free dining
review/text: These are excellent. We went Gluten & Casein free for my daughter. We thought it was only fair for the entire family to join in. It was pretty difficult, at first, to find good GFCF foods that we all loved. Tinkyada brand noodles have been excellent. They taste just like "regular" noodles. We eat these a few times a week. They taste just like the real thing with GFCF pasta sauces. They are great for guests, too. I served these with GFCF sausage, chicken and pasta sauce. People were asking for more. They go well in soups, too. Use as you would any noodle.<br /><br />They do take a little longer to cook than wheat noodles. That is the only "complaint". :)

review/summary: fun salads - and healthy too
review/text: I ordered these quail eggs to make the Japanese "bird's nest salad" that is one of our favorites.  Then I found if you use the ginger dressing from that salad to marinate the drained eggs with diced or julienned beets you wind up with something that's even BETTER!<br /><br />These canned quail eggs are just a bit rubbery/chewy on the outside which you expect from an egg which has been cooked twice.  The centers are so creamy they remind you of a really great deviled egg.<br /><br />I'm glad I found these eggs on Amazon because they sure aren't available in any grocery store within reasonable distance of where we live!  Thanks, Amazon!

Although I wouldn't make an egg salad with them (too pricey), they are perfect for about any other salad. I just cut them in half and add to pasta or green salad.<br /><br />They also work very well in a hot bowl of ramen or udon.<br /><br />Rinse and repeat. :)

review/text: These eggs come in a watery solution, not in brine or pickled if that's what you want.  That being said, you can easily pickle them yourself.  The eggs have a great creamy center and are perfect for many different occasions.  My only gripe is they shipped without anything but a cardboard box and many of them were bent.  There is no return on these for some reason, but Amazon made it right so I'm not worried.<br /><br />These rarely come available, but when they do I'll be making a purchase, and hopefully they will throw some bubble wrap around the cans.
