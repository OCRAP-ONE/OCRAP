review/summary: Like Espresso/Strong Coffee - Look no further
review/text: As a lover of strong coffee and a far-too-frequent Starbuks visitor, I was pleased to find a coffee of this quality for home use. The K-cups cannot be beat, and, for me, the taste is just amazing! If you like your coffee strong and dark, this is the k-cup for you. Better that Nantucket double diamond, on a par with many espresso's, but not too strong as a "daily drink". Also check out "Black tiger" from Coffee People - not quite as bold or bright, but good none-the-less.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious
review/text: I have been a loyal user of Emeril's Big Easy Bold since I purchased my Keurig.  I like a strong, bold (but smooth) coffee and Big Easy Bold has been by far my favorite.  Until I purchased Jet Fuel.  I absolutely love it.  Is has a slightly sweet (another review mentioned notes of chocolate and honey and I agree).  It has a rich taste and is full bodied.  It has a nice clean finish (I feel like I am reviewing a wine).  No bitterness and while it is full bodied it does not have an over-roasted burnt taste.  Sorry Emeril but Jet Fuel has now repalced Big Easy Bold as my subscribe and save monthly shipment (but I still love you too).

review/summary: Worthy of my morning cup
review/text: The Keurig machine is unbelievably convenient, but I find the majority of K-cups are simply weak and unpalatable. I always buy the coffees labeled "bold" as nothing else cuts it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is a decent cup of coffee. It's not quite the body of a drip brewer, but comes pretty close. Close enough that I'm not inclined to schlep out the drip brewer and spill coffee grounds on the counter and wait 10 minutes before I can have my wake up beverage.<br /><br />One other thing - the cups are just loose in a big box, so you will want to have a basket or other container to put them in.

review/text: My husband and I just canceled our save and subscribe for parisian nights and have switched over to jet fuel. It makes a strong cup of coffee with more caffeine and less bitterness than parisian. To me it doesn't make sense to use mild blend kcups since you'll end up with a watery cup of coffee. jet fuel is great with half and half and sugar or splenda and also makes a really nice cup of iced coffee.

review/summary: Jet Fuel Autopsy
review/text: Let me start by saying what this K-cup isn't.  It isn't extremely strong, unless maybe you are a Folger's drinker.  In that case, I suggest you pick a milder K-cup and then wash it clean with the 9.25 oz "water" setting.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I sacrificed one not-yet-brewed K-cup by removing the foil to measure the amount of coffee inside.  I found just slightly over 2 tbsp of fine ground very dark roasted coffee inside.  There is basically no "headroom" at this fill amount, so it would be a fair assessment that the roaster packed as much coffee in this K-cup as will fit.  This amount, 2 tbsp, is by common coffee brewing standards enough coffee to brew a 6 oz cup.  I only use the 5.25 oz brew setting with the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Now let me explain my coffee tastes.  My wife and I both normally drink french roast coffee brewed with the prescribed amount of coffee and cut with creamer and Splenda.  We like strong coffee that leaves an opaque splash stain in the cup while being poured.<br /><br />I still brew a pot of coffee every morning in a conical filter coffee maker.  The Keurig machine was purchased for brewing an occasional cup of coffee later in the day.<br /><br />I believe there are inherent flaws in the Keurig machine.  The brew cycle seems to be too quick to get ideal extraction and have yet to see a K-cup that doesn't pump out near-water after around 4 oz of coffee has been dispensed.  That being said, the K-cup convenience is great.<br /><br />As far as this K-cup is concerned, I think the flavor is medium/strong. It starts as something like a cup of Starbucks coffee (at the 5.25 oz  setting) and finishes with a bit more bite, similar to a "red-eye" (added shot of espresso), says my wife.  The amount of caffeine becomes quite apparent if you drink two cups back-to-back!<br /><br />In summary, this coffee does well at making the best out of a less than ideal system.  I recommend.

review/text: We have had the breville single serve coffee maker for several years now and have tried many different varieties of k cups.  My husband and I like our coffee strong enough for cream and sugar but dont like bitterness.  Jet Fuel is strong enough to use the larger cup size and still have great flavor.  It has no bitterness for such a strong cup of coffee.  I recently purchased and sent several boxes as gifts for family and friends who recently purchased kcup systems--my brother in law had been using the make your own k-cup with his "fancy" coffee beans but said the day he received these he ended up having 2 cups by 7:30 in the morning because it was so good--he had to stop himself from making more that day! I also love parisien nights by timothy's which has a slightly smoky/dark chocolate flavor and midnight magic which is slightly sweeter.  Jet Fuel is definitely one that we keep around all the time

review/text: As a former St*rbucks drinker, I find I'm always looking for coffee that's "just a little stronger". Jet Fuel fills that need nicely. I can finally drink a good strong cup of coffee without going broke.<br />EDIT 5/6/10<br />I have returned to edit this review after trying Green Mountain's REVV. I am dropping this review to 3 stars because REVV is just so much better.<br />I found jet fuel to be a little bitter. The first time I drank it I went a little heavy on the half & half and didn't notice it. Over time the bitterness becomes quite distinct.<br />I have found that I much prefer REVV for the caffeine kick it provides while still being incredibly smooth.

review/summary: Flying High!
review/text: I just recieved my Jet Fuel this morning and here are my first impressions after just a couple of cups:<br />Flavor is smooth, not bitter (maybe just a hint of aftertaste), deep and satisfying. That being said, I'll probably go back to my Keurig "Green Mountain" coffee next time anyway. I do like the Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging (about 36 cents per cup on the auto re-order program!). I cut the box open like a giant dispenser and put it in the cupboard above the coffee maker. Convenience is what it's all about, baby! (I expect at least a $10K reward for the idea, Keurig.)

review/summary: Not my favorite CP extra bold
review/text: I have tried Black Tiger and Wake Up Call so I thought I would give Jet Fuel a try. It's definitely strong enough, but both Black Tiger and Wake up Call have more interesting flavors.  Jet Fuel is like a one note band and the others are like combos or symphonies. It's a great note, but honestly I am now 1/3 the way through the 50 pack and I<br />pretty much blend it with another k cup just for the kick. It's not a great stand alone coffee, for me. Lacks complexity is they way coffee geeks would say it. It's like a<br />really strong cup of diner coffee. Hot, bold, but lacking sophistication.  Black Tiger is probably the most interesting cup to me; Wake up Call comes in second. With so<br />many really good strong extra bold k cups out there (Emeril's, GM Sumatra, Van Houtte Eclipse, etc.) Jet Fuel is just average.  Just lacks the depth and flavors to make it<br />a top choice. I drink it black with 6 ounces of water for the brew.  I'll be reordering one of the others when I need more.

review/summary: One of my top 2 favorites for my Keurig brewer!
review/text: After sampling a few brews, I narrowed down a couple that I would by 50 at a time.  This is one of them as well as Timothys Midnight Magic.  Flavor is nice and bold and I can brew a larger cup without sacrificing too much.  I have the B70 and brew this at the 10-oz setting.  12-oz is just a bit too much water.  I know the packaging is nice and "green" now but is a little bulky so that I can't store it in my cabinets.  Not a huge issue.  If you are a fan of flavorful, bold coffee, give this one a try!

Love Coffee People coffees.  Use Donut shop for a single cup of coffee.  Since I do not like really bold coffee (I drink it black), I run 3 of the largest size water through a single Jet Fuel K-cup to stretch the value even further.  Coffee People coffee is very smooth.  If you like really bold coffee, you will like Jet Fuel as a single cup serving.  Happy Java!

review/summary: BEST K-CUP!!!!
review/text: Fair warning: if you are not looking for strong coffee, this isn't for you! This blend is much strong than my previous favorite "black tiger". While it is strong, it doesn't have the bitterness that you get with coffee from other k-cups or Starbucks. It has a nice sweet taste that is perfect for those who take their coffee black (tastes great with milk, cream and/or sugar too!!!). I have recommended this blend to a few friends who bought it after I gave them one to try. Try and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good Coffee That Packs a Little Punch
review/text: This is a good-tasting coffee that does pack a punch or jolt.  I'd recommend NOT drinking this as your second or third cup, as after I (and three other people) had one in the afternoon, we were wired for a while - that's what you're looking for with something named "jet fuel," and it lives up to its name.  Combining this trait with a good taste - as well as the good pricing here on Amazon vs. CostCo - is a pretty good deal.

review/summary: Try a sample first if you can
review/text: I like strong coffee/espresso and was excited to try Jet Fuel after reading the reviews here.  After a week of drinking this coffee however, maybe I have a different definition of strong coffee.  Every day I drink this very average coffee on the way to work and say to myself, write a review so others don't do what I did, and buy 50 cups of the stuff.<br /><br />It has a bitter taste with not a lot of anything else going on, and maybe that is what some people consider strong.  Maxwell House crowd perhaps.  I prefer coffee with more depth and complexity, i.e. Starbucks, and Jet Fuel misses that mark by a wide margin.<br /><br />My favorite K Cups so far have been Donut Shop, Kona, and Caribou Blend.  Caribou is a great choice if you like bold and rich coffee, but now I am stuck with 50 cups of Jet Fuel.  Don't believe the hype.

review/text: Not your gourmet cup of coffee, but a decent, strong, satisfying cup.  My last purchase was the Coffee People Donut Shop- if you like that one, this is similar, but a little stronger.  The reason I switched from Donut Shop was bc the flavor was very weak. This one is definitely a step up, however there is definitely more bitterness to it so it's not as tasty as some others. I am still looking for that strong, flavorful cup... haven't found it yet, but at least Jet Fuel will buy me some time to find it!

review/summary: A good strong cup of coffee, not quite as smooth as donut shop
review/text: Overall I've enjoyed the Jet Fuel coffee, those of you who use your Keurig's regularly will know that just by the nature of the k-cup, if you want a larger cup of coffee (by k-cup standards, not even approaching the size of Venti from Starbucks) you have to go with a lot stronger k-cup just to get a reasonably medium-boldness cup of coffee.  With this need comes the Jet Fuel, it produces a strong cup of coffee even at the larger settings on the Keurig, and it's pretty good, it does have a touch of bitterness to it and doesn't go down as smoothly as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] which is my favorite k-cup.  The Jet Fuel coffee definitely lives up to it's name and will wake you up in the morning perhaps better than any other k-cup, I've gotten into the habit of having a Jet Fuel cup in the morning and a Donut Shop in the afternoon after lunch.  I will caution you to avoid the Jet Fuel too late in the afternoon or evening or (unless you have a really high caffeine tolerance) you're going to have a very hard time falling asleep.

review/summary: BEST FOR THE KEURIG BUT KEURIG NOT THE BEST FOR COFFEE TASTE
review/text: I tried many, many coffee beans for my new Keurig and settled for Jet Fuel as "best" tasting using the Keurig.  However, I still have my cheaper Cuisinart burr grinder coffee maker.  My wife and I decided to do a side by side taste test.  We used the Keurig with Jet Fuel and the Cuisinart with Starbucks French Roast.  The results?  I say the Cuisinart slightly beat out the Keurig, it just tasted better.  My wife says the Cuisinart is definitely better.  Not a strict test since we didn't use the same coffee bean.  But it's interesting to note that the initial Consumer Reports ratings for the Keurig are not favorable.  Looks like our household agrees with the folks at CR.<br /><br />The Keurig is less messy but it generates all those plastic cups as waste.  The Cuisinart just leaves behind a non bleached paper filter.  And the $99 Costco version comes with a gold filter.<br /><br />One other thing about the Keurig.  Google Keurig to find other owners who have complained about it failing after a few months or year and the poor customer support from Keurig.  Mine has not failed so I can't attest to those other owners but they are out there with an opinion.

review/text: I've got a Keurig for my dorm room and I usually just buy a sampler box because I don't really have a preference for any one of the coffees. However it's not the most money wise way to buy the k-cups, so I thought when I saw these on sale I thought I would give them a shot. I have to say I'm absolutely infatuated with Jet Fuel. I definitely like my coffee strong, as a previous Starbucks Barista, and the undertones of chocolate are wonderful for my sweet tooth. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes bold coffee, people who prefer something like a breakfast blend would probably find Jet Fuel to be too bitter. I also like that there's no excess packaging. I ordered the same size box of breakfast blend for my mother and I swear I could have fit in the box it came in!

review/summary: Tangy and Strong
review/text: The first sip I had of jet fuel coffee was from a local coffee shop and I was not sure I liked it as it has a very strong sharp flavor at first.  This is then quickly followed by a deep richness that I find myself craving regularly.  The K-cups produce the same flavor I was used to at the coffee bar and can give me my jet fuel fix at home.  So although it may not be for the Sanka crowd and has a very striking intitial flavor, I find it rich, well balanced adn interesting.  Definately my favorite K-Cup to date.

review/summary: Wakes you up, maybe a bit too much
review/text: I drink a strong black cup most mornings, thought I'd give Jet Fuel a try.  One thing is this is a strong cup of coffee.  It may be too much for me since I drink it black.  The first thing I noticed when I pulled one of the K cups off the brewer is that there wasn't an aroma like I was used to with other K cups, which translated to little smell in the cup.  The flavor is strong and bitter, like I say it wakes you up.  Not one to sit and enjoy in my mind.  I prefer the other bold coffees available in K cups to this one.  They at least have an aroma and taste of coffe vs. this one that has bitterness to offer.

review/summary: Jet Fuel K-Cups, just OK
review/text: I have found the quality control of my recent purchases of K-Cups to be marginal, at best.  I look for cups whose foil covers bulge at the top.  Unfortunately, many of the cups seem to have their seals breached, and the cover is flat and sometimes concave.  The performance of these cups is often terrible, with grounds escaping both within the coffee maker and into the cup of coffee and coffee even spilling out of the maker beyond the bounds of the rim of the cup.  Worse yet, the taste of the coffee is lifeless and insipid.  In a word, it is stale.  When the packaging seems intact the coffee tastes fine, and there is no mess or clean up necessary.  I'll keep searching for a more reliable provider.

review/text: Jet Fuel is an extremely bitter blend. I normally drink my coffee with a little bit of milk and a teaspoon of sugar. In order to even choke this down I would probably need a half cup of sugar. Ridiculous. I haven't had the trouble with grounds in my coffee and don't really care about the price point, but hate the taste of this k-cup. Will not be buying again.

review/text: This is one of our very favorite K Cup selections -- bold and deep flavor.  It HAS been a staple in our household, but no longer.  I'm not sure what Amazon's reasoning is for the huge and sudden price hike.  I read that they claimed it's an increased price from the manufacturer, but all other retailers that I count on for K Cups have kept the same price, so that seems like an excuse.  At $27 a 50-ct. case, I can walk into any number of retailers with a basic sale or easily accessible coupon and get a MUCH better deal.  Sorry Amazon!  I love you, but I won't be buying any more K Cups from you unless you bring back the reasonable pricing.

review/text: I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.  If you are looking for a smooth, full bodied coffee, this is NOT it.  If, on the other hand, you want something that is bound to curl your toes in an attempt to wake you up, this will do it.  Not what I look for in coffee though.  I like to be awakened with ease, not a jolt.

review/summary: Passable, but muddy
review/text: NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People "Extra Bold" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Jet Fuel:<br />Dark, almost burned coffee flavor (think bad Sumatran roast).  Heavy bitterness that overwhelms the flavor, harsh on the back of the tongue and a fully bitter aftertaste, but probably drinkable if you are a fan of Sumatran or French Roast coffees.  Medium acidity, a little tangy but not really sour, with an earthy flavor that tends toward muddy.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but generally overwhelms the palate.  Heavy body, but not sludgy, though your mouth may be convinced otherwise from the flavor.  While I can and sometimes do drink other coffees black (mostly full-bodied medium roasts), I can't imagine anyone drinking this black even if they take their espresso that way.  Requires sweetener and cream/half-and-half or a heavy addition of milk.  Personally, I had to use a small splash of vanilla syrup to hide the bitterness.  Drinkable, but just barely with better choices available. Hard to find the good qualities in the disappointing profile.  Certainly not the WORST dark roast I have had, however.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars for one reason.  If you were using this coffee as an ingredient where you wanted the coffee and perhaps the bitterness to not be hidden too much, then this would be an excellent choice over many harsh Sumatran and French Roast coffees.

review/summary: Coffee taste alright
review/text: This is my first shipment for this coffee.  I'm on a subscription basis.  Each K-Cup is flushed with nitrogen and then sealed in an air-tight, moisture-tight cup.  This lid is adhered to the top of the cartridge as soon as it is filled with fresh coffee or tea grounds, and the K-Cup remains air-tight and moisture-free until the needle of your Keurig brewer punctures the foil.  However in this shipment 35 of the 50 k-cups were deflated and lost there seal.  Not sure how fresh this coffee is since the seal was broken prior to shipment.  If the next shipment returns the same result I'll go back to paying more for a fresher product.

review/summary: Love Coffee People, but Not Jet Fuel
review/text: Let me begin by saying I am a huge Coffee People fan.  My wife is from Oregon and anytime we visited her family my first priority was visiting one of their shops.  I was deeply disappointed to see their stores absorbed by Starbuck's (nothing against Starbuck's, they make a good cup of coffee and are a very responsible company).  Having tried Jet Fuel, I find it tastes like it sounds, with a bitter and chemical finish.  I'm no connoisseur, but I know what I like, generally bold coffees, and this may be bold, but also harsh with an unpleasant finish.  I'd recommend passing on this one and explore their other excellent coffees.

review/text: I'd like to give the manuafacturers the benefit of the doubt, but this stuff is hard to swallow (no pun intended).  I love strong coffee, from the Sumatras to the other dark roasts.  That's why I purchased the Jet Fuel.  I also purchased the Kona coffee from the same coffee co. - that is a great roast and I would recommend to anyone.  But this coffee actually has the aroma of old cigarettes...not too appetizing.  I could have just received a bad batch and I'll look to return what I have left (I did give it a few tries).

I hate to say this but neither of these brews are stronger than any other "extra bold" brews I have tried. If you get this just know that you still need to use a smaller amount of water to make a strong cup of bold tasting coffee. I think the new Starbucks bold brews actually make a stronger cup of coffee.
