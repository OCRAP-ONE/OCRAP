review/summary: Taste better than it sounds!!!
review/text: I was expecting this tea to have somewhat of a bitter taste to it just because of its name.  Boy was I WRONG!!!  This tea can easily be consumed with or without sugar.  I prefer it without sugar, but when I want a sweet taste to it, I'll just add one packet of Sweet & Low.  My energy picks up in about 30 minutes (after drinking the cup of tea) and lasts for approximately 2 hours!!!  You can't beat that at all!!!  Doesn't give me the caffiene jitters that my coffee does.  Now I just substitute one cup of coffee for one cup of Oolong Tea!!!

review/summary: amber, not golden
review/text: Tea is ok. I expected it to be nasty (earthy) but it was fine. I usually pair it with other teas (rose hips/hibiscus blend, chamomile, mullein leaf, etc, not all at once). Even alone, it's an amber color, not golden imo. I would purchase again, received 100 bags for just over $4.

review/summary: Good oolong for the price
review/text: This review is for PoP Oolong tea bags. My tea background was first drinking Indian milk tea using black loose tea, milk, spices, and sugar. I added far-Eastern teas (non-milk varieties) in my search for a quicker tea to brew (milk tea needs more time to prepare). I am on my 3rd box of PoP Oolong tea. The tea is not like black or green teas. Be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste. Like black teas, this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue, almost similar to eating an unripened banana. It is somewhat woody in taste and smell (maybe a bit flowery. It may also be slightly sour, but less than some green teas. I have tried whole leaf oolong from a Chinese shop and that was more like green tea. If you can afford more expensive oolong teas, then you might get better quality. For the price, you're getting a good deal. I also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger, bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing, you might get your desired flavor.<br /><br />To brew this PoP Oolong tea, realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster. My solution is to boil some filtered water. After bringing to a boil, I turn off the stove and add 1 cup (237 mL) hot water to the tea bag. Then wait ~30 seconds (or golden brown color appears)and remove the bag. The first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste. Now I can brew with another cup of the hot water. I can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown, golden, light green, and very light green. It is best to brew by the color and not the time. If you leave the bag in too long, it will be terribly bitter.<br /><br />Tea brewing is an art and science, as many other things in life are. Please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea. Basically, you are extracting the tea's aromatic compounds into the water. The flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality, extraction time (the time in water), and water temperature. You have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor. Sugar is absolutely not necessary, if prepared correctly.

review/summary: Interesting Tea
review/text: For someone who generally finds green and white tea mostly uninspiring this provides and interesting change of pace.  I drink green and white tea for the antioxidants and not the taste.  I think I would still pretty much put this Oolong in that category but admittedly I simply am a coffee and black tea drinker.  It is a good, interesting product and I may have under rated it because of personal preference.

review/summary: Chinese restaurant tea
review/text: I have tasted both Green and Oolong Prince of Peace teas.Both are clean,non-dusty , teas that our Asian restaurants in the Montgomery area favor.The oolong is a very light Black tea. I often blend it with another Black tea to give it more of a traditional souther tea flavor because I drink it cold . Oolong is supposed to have more anti-oxidants, however I prefer the stronger flavor of Black teas like Ahmad Engligh #1, Tazo Awake, and Twinnings Breakfast teas. These all blend nicely with the Oolong , and I get the best of each ...ch

review/text: If you are looking for a cup of tea with no real flavor, please buy this. I am an avid tea drinker; Oolong tea has a pleasant aroma of oriental spices and good flavor that dosent require added sweeteners. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, this is not the product. This tea seems like a combination of cheap teas, none with a hint of oolong. The tea even gave me a headache! The price of Oolong tea usually ranges between $5.00 to $7.00 for 20 tea bags depending on geographical area of the country. I should have known that $4.95 was too good to be true. They wont go to waste; tea bags are great for soaking tired aching feet after a run or treating foot fungus.  Certainly not organic!

review/summary: Simply heavenly!
review/text: I discovered these way back in the late 1960s at a fancy candy shop in Manhattan NYC.  I loved them instantly. The delicate smooth candy coating is infused with the taste of violets and a slight sweetness. They freshen the breath without a clawing strong peppermint taste and there's the surprise of a tiny anise seed at the center.  They also seem to take the edge off a sweet craving.  I highly recommend them.

review/text: I bought this product because of appreciation of a tin heather tea (loose leaves).  I couldn't find a same one around but found this tea bag package. Because of my trust to the company I just bought it.  Unfortunately, the product is not as good as I expected.  Most importantly, the tea bags are in paper bags, which are in a soft cardboard box, not sealed so that the tea has lost its favor.  Secondly, I don't see as much heather flowers as they were in the tin heather tea I use to have.  Too bad the package include 4 boxes I can never consume them.

review/summary: Top of the heap
review/text: Forget all those briney jars sporting "NONPAREIL" on their labels.  This is the real deal.  From that hot volcanic rock off the coast of Sicily, Pantalleria, these are capers to provoke a caper of your own.  I found them in Italy. Five stars for Pantalleria capers which go with caviar.<br /><br />These are the most intensely flavored buds in the business. I use these salted capers in sauces including a lemon caper butter sauce for my veal.  Using only the salt that clings to them, the sauce is stunning and different from sauce using other caper brands that are not Pantalleria or are stored in oil. Brine is the enemy and additives other than salt distort the flavor. For most dishes, you will rinse away the salt, or save it, because whatever you made is already salted. But beware, you kill capers if you cook them. Just add the capers after you turn the heat off. The heat from a warm pan is plenty.<br /><br />I'll admit, these are more expensive.  You can get good capers in salt from elsewhere including some nice Spanish ones.  I will use those more often.  But for special service, I reach for these.  Nice to have them available here.

I don't like when they do 80% cocoa and its just no fun any more, all bitter.<br /><br />This is now my all time favorite dark chocolate bar. There are complexities in this Blanxart bar, a little smokiness, a little bitter but in great balance with a little sweetness. I highly recommend it I you like dark but not crazy bitter chocolate. Dips nicely with a little peanut butter :) good for rationing out in small but satisfying doses.

review/text: I added the coffee to my book order to get free shipping. The rating would be higher but I was very careful and am 99% sure I ordered Whole Bean coffee, not ground. The coffee itself is fine but stays fresher as beans. I would have ordered Dunkin' Donuts brand but couldn't get it in whole bean. Usually, items I order from Amazon are correct and as expected. It was a surprise to receive something that was not what I thought I'd asked for but it wasn't worth the trouble to return for exchange. Besides, I was nearly out of coffee by the time it arrived. The flavor is good anyway.

So, I search out an employee to open it for me, which is a major inconvenience.  I had hoped the new packaging would be easier to open, but instead it is more difficult!  Last week, I found a young, strong-looking young Ingles employee and he struggled to open the package, too!  I may start taking scissors to the store with me along with a plastic bag to hold it after I grind it.  While I would give it 5 stars for taste, I give it 3 stars for convenience.

There is nothing that can beat this for strength, flavor, after-taste, and convenience.<br /><br />And you can't beat the price if you have Amazon ship 4 bags a month, automatically.<br /><br />There is really no other choice than 8'oclock.<br /><br />Dan

review/text: The red bag of Eight O'Clock Coffee with its mild to medium strength, smoothness, and low acidity has been a favorite of mine dating back to the time when it was known as Red Circle; in its previous incarnation, the red bag was the middle of the line of the coffees of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, which some will remember as the A & P food market -- long before it was purchased and led into bankruptcy by a foreign purchaser.  The full line up of A & P coffees was: yellow bag: Eight O'Clock; red bag: Red Circle; black bag: Bokar.  That order represented the relative strength of the respective blends.  Fortunately for coffee lovers, after A & P spun off their coffee line into a company called Compass Foods, the coffee operation was purchased by Tata Tea (a subsidiary of the larger Tata Group).  Sometime earlier, the yellow bag blend was dropped, and Eight O'Clock name was appended to the mid-level blend.  The black bag now represents the varietal offering of Columbian beans.  Another hallmark of Eight O'Clock is its consistency from bag to bag, month to month, and year to year: A true testament to the blending and roasting skills of the manufacturer.  Add the convenience of Amazon, and the price advantage over local grocery chains, and you truly have a winning combination.

review/summary: Usually good but inconsistent
review/text: Eight O'Clock red bag coffee was for years a staple in our household and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a nice coffee best when brewed a little more slowly than most auto drip coffee makers allow.<br />We stopped buying it for several years because it became unreliable and more often than not we were getting bags that tasted "off".<br />Lately we have been buying several types of coffee looking for one that brews a good, consistent cup of coffee every time. Because we did enjoy Eight O'Clock red bag for all those years we decided to give it another try. First bag was fresh and lovely tasting. We were tickled to have an old favorite back in our cupboard.<br />One of the things we noticed first was that most times the bags available in stores were no longer vacuum sealed and were more puffy than usual with air - not sure how long it takes to get that way, so maybe those were old. Dunno.<br />Anyway, once more we were getting inconsistency in the taste. One bag good and the next not. Disappointing.<br />As the ditty goes: When it was good, it was very, very good and when it was bad it was horrid.

review/text: I like Dunkin Donuts, Starbux, peets, and pure Kona coffee (for weekends, when I can enjoy the cup). 8 O'clock Coffee is horrible. It tastes like office coffee, even when freshly brewed. It has a rough texture, unsatisfying aroma, and very light beans in general. I'm giving away the coffee for free becuase it's horrible.

review/text: I love coffee, until I had Eight O'clock Brand I never knew what excellent coffee was.  I only drink perked coffee, because it has the full flavor I'm looking for in a cup of coffee.  I buy my eight o'clock at Sam's club and grind it from whole beans in their grinder.  The aroma from the fresh opened bag makes me hurry home to make me a great cup of coffee.  I have a 12 cup pot and I use 5 heaping tablespoons of grounds per pot and it comes out very good.  Thanks Eight O'Clock for a great product.

review/summary: It's not the same as it used to be
review/text: I've been purchasing 8 O'Clock for many years and had been very happy with the quality. It had a deep, rich flavor with nuances of a quality dark chocolate thrown into the mix. Smooth, never bitter and never disappointing. My guests' compliments ensured my loyalty to this company.<br /><br />However, for about the last year I've noticed that the taste has changed for the worse. Whether that's due to the company's change in suppliers, weather in the coffee-growing region or formula change, I am in search of a replacement.<br /><br />Every so often I  purchase a 12-ounce bag, hoping for the best and unfortunately, I'm always disappointed. It still has that tinny, forgettable flavor that I've come to expect in cheaper store brands. I'm sorry to say I've lost an old friend.<br /><br />As an aside, surprisingly, I've noticed that the price of 8 O'Clock coffee has actually gone down in price (by $2 a bag) at a local retail store. You may draw your own conclusions as to why.

review/text: My perspective: I usually prefer light roasts, because I hate bitterness. I always add cream and sugar -- usually flavored creamers and Torani syrups. Mostly, I like coffee that is very very easy to drink. But, light roasts were getting a little weak and boring.<br /><br />This coffee: Much more flavorful and rich than most light roasts, but just as drinkable. It's hearty but smooth. One of my favorite coffees, and you really can't beat 4 packages for $10. Definitely glad I tried this!

review/summary: Great price for unpicky coffee drinkers
review/text: I noticed there were some very negative reviews for this coffee, but we were looking for something inexpensive that we could get delivered through Amazon Prime, so we gave it a shot. What I've concluded is that this is a great coffee at a great price for coffee drinkers who aren't particularly discriminating in their coffee tastes (especially if you doctor it up with plenty of cream and sugar, as we tend to do). Honestly, we thought this coffee was perfect until we traveled to Panama and tasted real fresh-roasted, mountain grown coffee. After that, coming home to Eight O'Clock wasn't so great. But if you are already drinking pre-ground coffee, and don't have a particular brand preference, I'm guessing you'll be totally happy with this product. And because we're cheap, we're still drinking it too. :)

review/summary: Too close to the "Sell By" date
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer that the coffee was shipped too close to its "Sell By" date. When it arrived, the coffee was only six weeks away from expiring. In stores, usually 8 O'Clock Coffee is seven to nine months from expiration. The coffee has the typical stale smell and taste you'd expect in a product this old. Unless something changes and they can guarantee in the product description that the coffee will be much fresher, I'd pass on this if I were you. I'm slogging through all four bags because I'm trying to learn my lesson, but I bought a fresh bag at a local grocery store to give myself a break in between.

review/summary: Stale Coffee
review/text: I am not a big coffee drinker. But my wife is. She has bought this in the store and really liked the coffee. I discussed with her and we thought it would be a good idea to put it on subscription. It came. She made her morning coffee and boy I heard about it. You would think someone died. And that someone could have been me! Well to make a point, it was stale. And since we opened a bag it could not be returned so now we have 4 bags of stale coffee. Do yourself a favor a pass this one by. Seriously. Thing is I am disabled. I am not crying about that, but that means a limited income. Amazon helps me to order in any items I can. Recently I have had to depend on a cane because the pain is too great. The problem in a nutshell is I think there is not enough "stock rotation" in the warehouse. I had the same problem with the Duracell batteries. Half the package was dead. Now all the other thing are fine. I love amazon. I have sold on Amazon for years. Good customers good people. (Personally, I tried the coffee and it was not the best but I have tasted worse.) That's all. Thank you.

So I was also curious about how coffee tasted back then.  I was very pleasantly surprised! It is very smooth and it has a full body. The aroma is very uplifting.

review/summary: Great tasting, value priced coffee
review/text: I have experimented with many types and brands of coffee and for the money this brand is the best. It's consistent in quality and is not oily or acidy like some of the so called gourmet brands. I original bought the 42oz.bag to test and when I found that I really liked it I ordered this four 12oz. bag package. As it turned out the four 12oz. bag package is a better deal price wise and it's the same good coffee. One more thing, if you use CO2 filters in your coffee vault like I do, the Eight O'clock brand has one in each bag. When I open a new bag to put in my coffee vault I take the CO2 filter out of the bag and replace the CO2 filter in the vault. Doing this not only keeps the coffee fresh it saves money because you don't have to keep buying replacement CO2 filters... They're not exactly cheap.  There are better coffees out there but they ARE expensive. For the price and quality this coffee tastes just fine......... Try it out, you won't be disappointed.
