review/summary: Best-tasting energy drink out there.
review/text: Love me some Sobe No Fear! Unfortunately it's getting harder and harder to find. The taste is what sold me on it way back when I started drinking energy drinks at work. Sort of a sour fruit punch taste that isn't ridiculously sweet. Put it on ice and it's not bad with a meal either.

review/summary: No Fear here , go for it !
review/text: No fear of funky chemical taste here.I find this is a great tasteing product, more juice like than any of the others I have tried.It doesn't get me too wired out and I can enjoy it with lunch as a boost for the afternoon.I used to be able to get it at alot of stores , but it seems Pepsi bought them and are more interested in pushing the "popular" drinks. I found it on Amazon and have been ordering it here since. If you do the 3-5 day shipping it's free, it's the most cost effective way to go.

review/summary: Not bad for a big can energy drink
review/text: I am a bit of an energy drink addict.  I got hooked on them when I lived in Japan, where "genki drinks" are ubiquitous and sold in little bottles containing a shot of vitamins to get you through the day.  Because of that, I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029ZAOW8">5-Hour Energy</a> brand that gives you the energy shot without all the fluff and soda water.<br /><br />I have tried a few of these big can styles, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBHVU">Monster</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NGP8TY">Rockstar</a>. They usually taste foul and I find it difficult to finish off a whole can.  But, I am always up something new, so I gave this "No Fear Super Energy Supplement" a try.<br /><br /> I was surprised that not only did it not taste bad, it actually tasted good!  This is the first of the big can style energy drinks that I would actually drink for the taste.  It tastes somewhat like a Cherry Cola, with a hint of that vitamin after taste.<br /><br />As far as the energy boost goes, I can't say that I really felt it.  Usually, after I drink a "5-Hour" drink I can feel the tiredness wiped away from my eyes and an actual physical effect.  With this "No Fear" drink, it was refreshing like any cold drink but I didn't get that sense of waking up.<br /><br />This one can contains two servings, so it is a lot of calories to pack in just to get a small energy boost.  That is one of the things I dislike about the big can energy drinks.  In the future, I will stick with the "5-Hour" energy boosters which give you all the goodness and vitamins without the excess of soda water.

review/summary: Remember When a Skull on the Label Meant DON'T Drink the Contents?
review/text: Not anymore, apparently.  Offhand, the only other place I can remember seeing skulls on the labels of beverages is in the Rotgut Industry.  But this is hardly the first case of counter intuitive marketing in energy drinks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBHVU">Monster Energy Drink cans</a> have claw marks slashed through their label, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039BXTCI">Venom Energy Drink cans</a> have a poisonous snake on their label, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RI8GI8">Cocaine Energy Drink - As Strong As 3 Red Bulls</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MRQ4J4">Zombie Blood Energy Potion Pack</a> pretty much speak for themselves.<br /><br />(What next?  This Will Kill You brand energy drinks?)<br /><br />Which is a bit ironic since No Fear brand energy drinks could argue that they are a little bit more healthy (or a little bit less UNhealthy) than the average energy drink because they contain grape juice concentrate.  How much is unclear, but from the label we can know that there is less grape juice concentrate than the taurine (1000mg) but more than the inositol (100mg).  Oh, it is hardly what I would call genuine "Soda Juice": <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDDHPQ">essn Sparkling Juice</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Carbonated Juice</a>, but this probably explains the different and IMHO surprisingly good taste.<br /><br />Note: Also available in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW">No Fear, Sugar Free, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Buy it for taste above performance
review/text: It's always a bit of a gamble with an unfamiliar energy drink - generally I worry that it taste bad and/or give me the shakes. Thankfully the hefty-sized "No Fear" 16-ounce can that I was sent through Amazon Vine had neither. In fact the taste was remarkably nice; kind of like a sweeter redbull and I had no searing chemical after-taste at all. I actually enjoyed the drink from the first opening to the last drop and felt great afterwards.<br /><br />I then went onto to do my very simple workout routine consisting of a couple of miles on the treadmill and some free weights and had no issues, but in all honesty I didn't feel anymore energized or hydrated than normal. One can (which was all that was supplied) and a single workout may not be a sufficient amount of data to be able to say for sure how radical this energy drink could impact my daily exercise regimen though. The ingredients listed consists of the normal fair for this kind of product with taurine being the usual suspect. At 260 cals a can I thought that acceptable given the size of the can too.<br /><br />I felt fine and enjoyed the workout for what it was and felt the drink was nice enough to purchase a full pack of 12 cans. At around fifty cents a can this is very good value for money too, especially given the giant size of the cans.

review/summary: Fear the NO FEAR?
review/text: I will admit to some slight apprehension the first time I popped open a can of NO FEAR and cautiously took my first sip. Perhaps it was the intimidating black finish and winged skull trimmed in red and silver. Anyway, it was good! Not as sweet as I had worried it would b. It has a mild Apple-Pear, fruit punch flavor followed by slight bite at the back of the throat. No real off flavors or hints of the supplemental ingredients within. No tingly rush followed by heart palpitations either, thank goodness.<br /><br />NO FEAR does contain sugar -- 33g in each of its two 8 oz. servings. By comparison Coca-Cola Classic has about 26 per 8 oz. serving, Mountain Dew has 31. So this is not an energy drink for those looking to avoid sugar, try 5-hour Energy for that. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the most abundant ingredient after carbonated water. NO FEAR contains a number of vitamins and minerals in addition to its proprietary blend of energy promoting ingredients, but I suspect that they are so over-processed that their health value is questionable.<br /><br />I do like the flavor though, and it did give me an energy boost and kept me alert and clear while working at my desk for a few hours. Perhaps if I had chugged both servings at once the effects would be more noticeable. On a side note, it also makes a decent mixer in adult beverages, a la Red Bull. I don't think I'll be getting it again though. The ingredient soup is just a little too scary. Its not for me, but I can see others enjoying it. 4 stars for flavor and energy enhancement, 2 stars for health value. I've yet to try the sugar-free version so cannot comment about that.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/text: I work long hours. Coffee and soda don't agree with me, so I'm always on the lookout for alternative sources of energy. No Fear Energy Drink may work very well--if you can stomach the flavor. It tastes like cherry medicine. If this is what I have to drink to keep up the pace after 10-12 hours, I'd rather stay sluggish. Better to stick with Red Bull or another variety carbonated energy drink.

No Fear definitely delivers on the energy portion of the program, but not in such a huge burst I felt as if I was going to have a heart-attack if I stood up too fast. The taste? Well, it has one. It's sort of citrus between lemon and grapefruit. While I likely am not the target audience, I could see reaching for a cold one of these on a day when I need a boost instead of coffee.

review/text: This is my favorite energy drink. I was sad when they stopped making Adrenaline Rush, but happy to see it was basically just renamed and repackaged in No Fear.<br />It doesn't have that sour/tart taste that I think other energy drinks have. For me, they taste like cough syrup- especially if you don't finish the can before it's no longer cold. This drink stays sweet without coating your mouth.<br />They don't sell it anywhere in the area I recently moved to and I was bummed. I purchased pretty much every energy drink the stores carried, hoping to find something similar or that would work and there just wasn't anything like No Fear. Thankfully, Amazon has saved my mornings.

review/summary: Tropical flavored energy drink ~ fun!
review/text: No Fear Super Energy Supplement 16 ounce cans are 260 calories, with a great tropical taste with no bad aftertaste.  It's low in carbonation, not over-carbonated like some sodas...it didn't cause jitters or provide the `instant up' energy drink feeling, but it did seem to make focus a little easier and accomplishing daily tasks.  Not a big fan of the tropical taste personally, but at a reasonable price and with the need for an energy drink, this one would do the trick - would recommend to others to try, especially if they like tropical flavors and want a good energy drink!

review/text: The actual product is flavorful and goes down "easy"; on a like-for-like basis, I would probably rate this as the best energy drink I have tried (versus the usual suspects ... Monster, etc).  However, I am basing this assumption on my experience of drinking a flat product.  The can was damaged and bloated on top; the shipping box was completely undamaged.  So I wouldn't hesistate recommending trying out the drink from your local convenience store, but I would be wary of online orders based on my experience (who knows, probably is an isolated incident, but could be a packaging issue related to the new product).  Give it a shot!

review/text: When energy drinks first hit the market, Red Bull dominated. I tried it then and occasionally try it again. As a Kid I had better tasting cough medicine, which was foul! My son said he'd found a better drink and handed me a can of No Fear. Well, I didn't spit it out, as I have the panther p*** called Red Bull.<br /><br />Later I tried it over ice. Not only was it better, it was good! I still don't fully enjoy it out of the can, but over ice, it is a superior flavor. If I can get it, I prefer it to Pepsi or Coke and NO other energy drink is worth drinking, in my book. It has gotten VERY difficult to find in CA. But, here on Amazon, I can order it at a price, including shipping, that equals the price in the store (when I can find a store that still carries it).

review/summary: Nice energy boost, but tons of the sweet stuff.
review/text: No Fear has never been my favorite energy drink, but I'd go to it from time to time because it delivered the energy, thanks largely to the over 180mg of caffeine per can (2 servings...yeah...right). No Fear disappeared and is harder to find now, but here it is, brought by a different bottler and with a different can design, but tasting very much like No Fear always has (despite the claim that it's brand new). I was never a fan of the taste (kind of a tropical fruit, mango taste), as it just seemed cloying and syrupy (not surprising with the amount of sugar in this), but there's no denying the energy boost it gives. Since there's no accounting for taste, take that with a grain of salt (most people seem to prefer the taste over Red Bull). If you're looking for an energy drink that delivers, you can do worse.

review/summary: Not the best taste and left me jittery
review/text: Over the years I've probably tried almost every energy drink (and energy shot) out there at least once, from Monster to Venom to Rockstar to the ubiquitous Red Bull along with a bevy of "natural" energy drinks (FRS, Genesis Pure, etc.). This No Fear drink looks a lot more "hardcore" than the other ones, with a mostly black can dominated by a winged skull. On the inside, though the ingredients are mostly the same. The flavor is also similar - slightly fruity with a hint of carbonation and an aftertaste of vitamins. But I have to say this one falls pretty low on the taste scale for me. It also has a pretty powerful smell that I didn't care for. But taste alone doesn't kill an energy drink as long as it works. Unfortunately this one didn't give me energy as much as it just made me feel jittery and a little antsy. And 30 minutes after drinking it I got a headache. It's not the worst energy drink I've tried but it's definitely not one I look forward to trying again.

review/summary: Great taste, good energy
review/text: This energy drink is very different from the norm. It actually tastes like something you can identify, in my opinion a cross between orange and grapefruit juices. As with all energy drinks it has the requisite amount of caffeine and taurine for the energy boost we all enjoy. With the Amazon price at about the same as a case of Monsters from my local supermarket, I'll be ordering a case or two of this from Amazon.

review/summary: What Flavor is this supposed to be?
review/text: After my first few gulps I thought it tasted decent.  However, after half a can it started to take on a strange and somewhat unpleasant taste.  I still couldn't tell you what the flavor was.  Some sort of "fruit punch".  It does do what it says it is supposed to do which is give you an energy pick up.  I have tried a bunch of different energy drinks from various companies and they are all pretty similar.  Lots of caffeine, Vit B, guarana, and similar ingredients.  There effectiveness depends on individuals' resistance to these stimulants.  I drink several cups of coffee and/or energy drinks a day so the effects are there but minimal compared to my wife who is smaller and will only have an occasional cup of tea or coffee.  She drinks one of these and is bouncing off the walls.  For me it comes down to taste and I am not a fan of this flavor.  I would also choose a no- or low-calories version.

review/summary: Not the biggest boost, but tastes great
review/text: I have to get to work pretty early, so I need something to get me started. I'm not crazy about coffee, so I've been trying to find an energy drink that agrees with me. This brand is the first I've found that both wakes me up and doesn't have that off-putting chemical aftertaste. It doesn't give me as much energy as some of the other brands I've tried, but it tastes better. It's a nice compromise between flavor and kick. However, if you're looking for a more powerful boost, look at some other brands -- but they'll probably taste worse than this.

review/summary: At just over two bucks per can of tasty energy boost, this is a good buy if you're an energy drink fan!
review/text: I'm not one that, honestly, drinks a slew of energy drinks on a regular basis. I've had a few Five Hour Energy shots during my six hour drives up the East Coast, and now I've tried No Fear's Super Energy Supplement on the same long drive... Outside of that, I am a fan of Red Bull, but only when it's been paired with a favorite 56 herb and spice alcoholic digestif... Outside of those few uses, I typically stick to coffee for my energy jolt, but if I was in the market for something similar to, but not as cloyingly sweet as, fruit punch with a kick, I'd go with this product.<br /><br />The No Fear Super Energy Supplement has a sweet, fruity flavor to it with a bit of a tart and tangy bite. The fruit flavor is also not overpowering, and is different from most of the other standard fruit punch flavored drinks you're likely to come across. It has a hint of passionfruit taste to it, with a little bit of a citrus undertone. The energy boost that I felt while sipping it on my drive also didn't particularly surge, but was more of a subtle feeling of waking up, without any caffeine overload or shakiness that I could detect. And, with a can this large, you can sip on this throughout your day, as long as you have a way of keeping the can cold enough to suit your tastes.<br /><br />Red Bull might do a great job of giving you a much-needed energy boost, but I have to say that I always felt it tasted like medicine. No Fear's energy supplement drink has a pleasant taste that isn't too sweet, and it's more cost-effective for the quantity you're getting than Red Bull is. As for Five Hour Energy, that stuff was NOT pleasant to drink, so I just shot it, and gulped it all at once, trying to avoid as much contact with my taste buds as possible. Given a choice, No Fear's energy drink wins my vote, for price-point, flavor, and effectiveness.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: Surprisingly Pleasant
review/text: The vast majority of my rating for this one comes down to taste. It's a carbonated drink that tastes a bit like a fruity soda, but the sweetness is a little smoother and nicer than soda typically is.<br /><br />The big drawback here is that a 16-ounce can contains 260 calories of sugar. After some thought about how I wanted to consume this once I realized how much sugar was involved, I saved it for a day when I knew I'd be walking for several hours so that I could just drink it when I knew my body had plenty of use for the sugar. I wouldn't recommend it as a drink to have sitting down at a desk or something like that, because that's a lot of sugar to be consuming if you're not doing anything at that moment to burn through it. The company does make a sugar free version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW">No Fear, Sugar Free, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, though I haven't tasted that, so that's an option to try for those times when you want an energy drink but you won't be moving around much.

review/text: As far as energy drinks go, this one has a flavor I enjoyed. Most energy drinks taste awful but this one has a nice flavor without the chemical, vitamin taste that some energy drinks have. I usually avoid energy drinks for this very reason but this one I would drink again.<br /><br />The drink also gave me a boost to get my day going. I was very tired the day I drank this and it helped me to get the day going. It kept me going for quite awhile until the early afternoon. I would say it did it's job!<br /><br />The two drawbacks to the energy drink are the price and also the amount of calories in the can. The can contains two servings but I don't know many people who drink half of a can. That brings the calories in the can to a total of 260, 130 if you drink half of a can or one serving. That is quite a bit if you count calories. The price is a bit much for my budget. I would be more inclined to keep this on hand if the price were lower.<br /><br />The bottom line-the flavor is good, the drink gives you energy at a high cost of calories and cash.

Had monster, rock star ect but those are a lot more sugar.<br /><br />If you don't mind the 260 calories per can and the super dose of caffeine, it's pretty much the same as the others but the taste is more of a refreshing grape.  It's definitely more drinkable than the others but as the name implies, it takes all of it to an extreme, sugar, caffeine ect.  My gf and I split the can and liked it and will most likely buy it if we feel the need like a road trip or whatnot.

review/summary: Great taste, okay energy booster
review/text: I really like the concept of energy drinks--chug some ounces and get a boost of stamina to continue the day (or night). Most of them offend my taste buds! Absolutely cannot stand the taste of a few of the better known energy drinks.  The taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8">No Fear,Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> was great, not even sure how to describe it. More of a juice taste than a fake alcohol taste like a few I've tried.<br /><br />While the drink has a great taste and there is more of it than many energy boosters, I can't say I saw a huge difference in my energy levels. I spent last week looking after three kids under six and could really have used a shot of energy, but didn't see any difference (unless my levels were so depleted that only a good night's sleep would have sufficed to raise them again) in energy, stamina, or being less tired.<br /><br />The can has two servings at 130 calories per serving or 260 per can so unless you stay active, you'll probably pack the pounds on if you guzzle this in place of something else!<br /><br />So to sum it up--great taste, not so great on the energy levels!

This does give a slight lift ... as good as other energy drinks I have tried, without any noticed drawbacks. Just watch the calories, as you should do with any similar drink.

review/summary: Unusual flavor with a pretty good boost!
review/text: I've tried a few of the energy drinks. Some are pretty good, some are Yuk! Some worked while a lot didn't. Now this one, it works. It gave me a good kick in the backside to get me going and tasted pretty good too. It did have an unusual flavor that I can't really describe, other than to say it was something different and I liked it. I only had one can of it to try and its kinda hard to be more specific from just that. I've looked for it in the stores around here where I live in Colorado but haven't found any yet. At $28 for a 12 pack, that's really high for me and way out of my price range. There's several energy drinks out on the market now and a lot of them are priced far below these. If they bring the price down then I'd think about buying some more to try out.<br />  Over all, this one gave me a good lift to get me going. It did give me a small dose of the jitters and my hands a minor case of the shakes for a little while at first. Or as some people would say, a slight case of the tremors. But that calmed down after a little while and I got a lot more done around here than I usually do. I suppose that jittery feeling and shaking hands, or tremors, would go away if you used this regularly and got used to it.<br /> I don't have any problem with recommending this No Fear, Super Energy Supplement. Except for people that have High Blood Pressure. This could cause your Blood Pressure to go up from a little to a lot. So be sure to check it a few times when you first use this or any other stimulant.

review/text: I'm a good ol' fashioned Red Bull or Monster type with my energy drinks, so I decided to give this one a try through Amazon's Vine Voice program.<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />It took me a few sips to get used to the taste - it tasted like grapefruit, but it wasn't overpoweringly bitter...there was just enough of the additional ingredients to take off the edge. There was also no metallic aftertaste, which I've come to expect from energy drinks.<br /><br />SUPPLEMENT FACTS:<br /><br />This is a 2-serving 16 ounce can, so by drinking the whole can, we're getting 260 calories, 200mg of sodium and 66g of sugars.<br /><br />For comparison, a 2-serving 16 ounce Monster Energy drink is 200 calories, 360 mg of sodium and 54g of sugars.<br /><br />ANY EXTRA ENERGY?<br /><br />I passed on my morning coffee to try out this drink and it did make me more alert for about 2 hours, about the same as 2 cups of coffee usually do for me. I didn't feel any kind of crash later on from drinking this.<br /><br />WEBSITE INFORMATION?<br /><br />The address on the No Fear can took me to the No Fear website which offered information on their clothing line, but nothing about the drink itself.<br /><br />To compare, the website listed on the Monster Energy can provided ingredient listings for each of their energy drinks.<br /><br />WHAT'S MY VERDICT?<br /><br />While I did enjoy this drink because of its unique taste, the high calories and high sugar count will probably keep me from buying more.<br />When I crave an energy drink, I usually go for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK">Monster Lo-carb Energy</a> because it gives me the pep I want, but only has 20 calories per can.

We only received one can to sample and review so I took the first sip and passed it on to my man who promptly drained the rest of it.  I didn't care for the taste, but that is what has always been an energy drink turnoff to me - I can't even choke down a red bull.  My man, however, thought it was quite good.  The unfortunate part was that he chugged it about 8pm and was up until about 3am.  At about that time he was out cold until about 5pm the next day.<br /><br />So if you like energy drinks - this is apparently a high power drink with low calories so those of you who are attempting to lose weight - this won't break the caloric bank. It can't hurt to give it a try, though availability may be an issue as they haven't shown up on the market shelves around here yet.

Their gruesome typical taste, along with the shakes or sugar crash they normally give me, are just two of the reasons I avoid energy drinks. I do have a teenage son who loves them, however. When I had the opportunity to try the No Fear product, I thought he and I could both see how we liked it.<br /><br />When it arrived I chilled it first, and then tentatively took a sip of it. Usually I get an immediate reaction of distaste to energy drinks, but I have to admit that I liked this one. I took half the can and put it over ice and it was good enough that I would buy this and drink it as a refreshing beverage.  The teen liked it too. We were both pretty surprised that this didn't have the usual shudderific energy drink taste!<br /><br />The only thing neither of us noticed however, was any increase in energy. No thermogenic effect, or increased heart rate or anything of the sort. As a drink though, we enjoyed it.

You cannot really compare this with Red Bull or 5-Hour as it is more like in the same league as "Monster".<br /><br />I don't find a lot of difference with other products.  Because of the volume, this caters to those who want to also quench their thirst and not only for the energy boost.  In terms of energy boost, I find a bottle of Gatorade just as good.

review/summary: Not Pumpkin 'AND' Spice
review/text: I think what is missing is the "pumpkin" flavor.  With this in mind, if I read the flavor name again, it is "Pumpkin Spice" not "Pumpkin AND Spice".  This is a lot of money to just pour down the drain.  I intend to do some experiments using pumpkin to see what I can yield.  Someone who has used this before MUST have a good recipe to share....  If I find anything, I will post it.<br /><br />As for the starbucks pumpkin spice latte, they use a "Sauce".  The ingredients of which are unknown.<br /><br />The closest recipe I have found (per the claim of the recipe, anyways), is this: [...]<br /><br />It appears that there is much effort to duplicate this seasonal Starbucks favorite, as any modest internet search will reveal.  Each recipe seems to be wildly different, several claim to be the exact copy of the Starbucks version of this seasonal favorite.  The recipe above actually calls for this Torani pumpkin spice syrup.  However, I am not sure that the author of the recipe actually tried the syrup themselves.  My first attempt was to follow the recipe exactly, using 2 shots of espresso.  WAYYYYYY too sweet. Several reviewers of this recipe do point out the fact that following the recipe would cost nearly as much as the starbucks version with questionable results.<br /><br />I have experimented with several different variations of the recipe and achieved something that is at least drinkable by using:<br /><br />2 Shots espresso (I use Lavazza Crema e Aroma, found on Amazon in 2.2lb bags)<br />2 pumps vanilla (I substituted vanilla syrup for vanilla extract as called for in the recipe)<br />3 pumps pumpkin spice syrup<br />copious amounts of powdered pumpkin pie spice (To taste)<br />Frothed milk (heated to ~180deg F)<br /><br />Combine all ingredients to fill a 20 oz cup.  Used frothed milk as a topping or whipped cream.<br />This is the "Drinkable" combination I have found.  The "pumpkin" flavor still seems to be missing, and it certainly isn't close to Starbucks.<br /><br />I hope to find the time to create my own "sauce" using the torani syrup, vanilla syrup (from starbucks), pumpkin pie spice (powdered), canned pumpkin puree.  The recipe posted above also states to use canned pumpkin.  My fear is that I will end up gulping down chunks of pumpkin puree :p - I don't see how the pumpkin puree will dissolve gracefully into the coffee.  Also, I have an espresso maker.  The recipe calls for "strong coffee" as most people don't have access to their own Super Automatic espresso maker.  I would rather find a recipe that stays true to a real latte, and which does not attempt to "hack" day old coffee in a stove top pot.<br /><br />As for my rating, I will give it a "neutral" 3 stars for now, as I do not believe the poor result is necessarily the fault of the syrup itself.  I believe the syrup is intended to be 1 part of a recipe, not a complete solution to a specific drink.  If I find a good recipe the uses the syrup, I will adjust my rating accordingly.<br /><br />As for me, I took this on more as an "adventure" to see what I could come up with.  I am not using Starbucks espresso, so I know my result will never be the same.  I do like the Starbucks version.  If you are trying to save money, you will likely be disappointed.  Enjoy the occasional Starbucks Pumpkin Latte while it is in season, in moderation, as a seasonal "pick me up".  It's not intended to be an every day thing.  Realize that there is no discernable pumpkin flavor in this, and maybe you will look at how you can use it differently.

I was hoping for a flavor similar to Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, but this isn't even close and I've honestly produced better flavor just using sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in my latte. I appreciate other coffee shops' pumpkin lattes, so if this had tasted good, I could have gotten over the fact that it was different from Starbucks', but I just plain don't like it. I think the spice is too heavy--I'm not sure exactly what spices were used in creating this, but based on pumpkin dessert recipes I've made it seems like maybe there is too much allspice? I have a feeling this is going to wind up down the kitchen sink drain :/

review/summary: Crazy price fluctuations?
review/text: I bought this set of six cans for about $25--total!  I had no idea I got such a good buy until seeing it sell now for about $100.  I was first annoyed when I got my shipment to see the expiration date was this December, giving me only six months to use up my supply; but now I won't complain!  There are better Amazon deals on this in packs of three and so on. I use this for making mango ice cream.  I use one cup of hvy cream, 1 cup of half and half, 2 cups of Mango pulp...a little vanilla extract.  This is sweetened already, so I added only about another 1/4 cup of sugar.  For the price I got it, it's a good deal.  One other downside for me personally--it is made in a facility that processes peanuts, and I cannot share this with my 5-yr-old granddaughter who is allergic.  For those of you with similar allergy concerns, now you know.

review/summary: Perfect fix for a chocolate craving
review/text: I am a big fan of Japanese candies, and Choco Baby is one of my favorites. Choco Babies are basically milk chocolate chips but in a small cylinder shape (think along the line of tic tacs in terms of size and shape) and smoother in texture than your average chocolate chip. It's the perfect size for the burst of chocolate flavor you need when you're craving chocolate. There's no interference from candy shells or nuts inside. It's just pure, simple, good-tasting chocolate. The size of the bits is excellent for portion control, and comes with a cute container with recloseable lid. I think the chocolate tastes better than other commercial brands such as Hershey's. Despite not having a visible shell around the chocolate, these hold up pretty well not melting in your hand for quite a while. I don't think chocolate fans would be disappointed in giving this a try.

review/summary: SmokeHouse USA?!?  Don't Think So...
review/text: I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk.  That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name.  I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a "Product of China."<br /><br />You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :(<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again.  I can't imagine telling my children that the lively little pup they love was made sick (or died!) because of some cheap-*** short-cut.<br /><br />I'd rather pay more money and have it manufactured here in the States.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/dog lover

review/summary: Terrible product
review/text: I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.

review/text: I bought these because they are made in America and my dogs are worth it.  What I don't like about them is that there is a thick string, or maybe just a thick vain of some kind, going through each piece. A much smaller issues is that these are very hard, even hard to break by hand.  We have been using a pliers to break the pieces up before serving and then a scissors to cut the string part!  A dog could choke to death with these.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I am looking for an alternative USA raised chicken solution for treats.

review/summary: Made in USA or not?
review/text: Have been buying this product for some time now - saw complaints about made in USA or not so I called the company. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a woman there who was weary of this complaint but very nice. I told her we love our pets, have learned to trust almost no one anymore and they were hurting themselves by selling products from China.<br /><br />As she explained,the confusion comes from the following: the "Made in USA" labeled chicken breast strips - what I have been using for my golden retriever puppy (who ABSOLUTELY loves them - really a healthy nutritious chew toy that lasts about 3 minutes - maybe 10 minutes for a little dog - when he sees it, he goes nuts - has never choked on them or had any negative effects I can see) is, as it says on the bag, Made in USA - they are processed in the USA and come from chicken raised in the USA.<br /><br />Smokehouse DOES sell another chicken product that does NOT say made in the USA on the package and this product DOES come from China.<br /><br />Buy whichever one you want.<br /><br />As to the complaints about not being able to cut them up easily - this IS absolutely true - so, if you want tiny bits of treat to use for reward based training, this is definitely NOT the product you want. I use other natural treats for this purpose (Merricks lamb lung is terrific for this use and my dog loves this product just as well - a one pound bag goes a long way - very easy to break up in whatever sizes you want in seconds)<br /><br />Finally, this product (chicken breast strips) has ONE ingredient: chicken. It is made in the USA from chicken grown in the USA. Because it is dried, it lasts forever, does not need refrigeration, makes no mess when fed to your dog, dogs love it - what else do you want for a treat?

review/text: If your dog is the kind with a cast iron gut who chows down on road kill with nary a problem and you have an extremely limited budget, this may not be the treat for your dog. For my own case, I have a Border Collie with a sensitive stomach and my budget for dog treats is modest. These are a great treat made here in the USA as the previous reviewer noted, avoiding the potential problems of Chinese made goods making the news recently. Feeding one of these 2-3 times per week gets that excited, eyes bugging out, reaction one would expect from a treat while providing an all natural, high protein component to your dogs diet, while remaining very affordable. As with any treat, overindulgence can upset the proper balance of your dogs diet, but even 2-3 in one day have not upset my dogs gut. In my opinion, this is almost as good as cooking for your dog yourself.

review/summary: Treat caused ulcers in my dog's GI tract
review/text: I should have known when I touched these strips.<br />They are rock solid hard.<br />Anyways I gave it to my dog for the first time, and it caused minor tearing and ulcers in her GI tract. I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-

review/text: I bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the U.S.A. They are so hard, my dog cannot chew them, and if I break them (which is hard to do), I am afraid she will choke on them. There are not very many "strips", mostly pieces.  It is a wasted $22.99, as I will not give them to her. How can you sell something so dangerous.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite
review/text: Apparently my yorkie is addicted to these dog treats. She's a very picky little dog. If one of these treats was near she would literally turn her head when offered anything else. If offered again, she would back away and wait until this treat was offered instead. We've worked through that, but she is still controlled by these treats. She will do anything and perform any command as if her life depended on it if she can only have these treats!<br /><br />The positives: She really loves them, above all other treats. They're made in the USA.<br /><br />The negative: I think they're too pricey for dog treats.<br /><br />I'm thinking of using the food dehydrator to whip up some chicken jerky instead. Perhaps she will like that as much. Until then, this is the treat of choice.

review/summary: Very unhappy!!!!
review/text: I love ordering from Amazon...my orders arrive fast and well packed.<br /><br />However, the Smokehouse 100% Natural Chicken Breast strips were supposed to be made in the USA.  I paid more for them because I was afraid to buy any more that were made in China.  My dog has been so sick on them.  I even gave him a small piece and everyday he would throw it up.  He never did that with the Milo's Kitchen or Wagon Train which ARE made in China. Also, they are supposed to be lean, but have fat pieces on them that I scrape off.  I don't know what's wrong!!!!

review/text: My Yorkie seems to like these, but they are much harder and drier than other chicken treats that I have purchased. When you go to break them into smaller pieces they crumble.

review/summary: Best cereal
review/text: Great cereal.  Eat it with milk or yogurt or by itself.  Very crunchy (may be too crunchy if you have dentures).  Very nice taste.  Has a natural strawberry taste that is nicely blended with the granola.  Only slightly sweet (a plus for me).  I started ordering from Amazon since my local grocery was not reliable in regularly stocking this.

review/summary: Incredibly tasting, healthy snack
review/text: I had heard of Yogi tea before, but when I walked by these bags of pure addictive amazingness at the store one day, I decided to pick it up on a whim. Of course I picked up the strawberry, because when it comes to health food I make sure to pick a flavor I enjoy such as strawberry. I took one whiff of the inside of the bag, and I was intoxicated, but when I took a bite of the actual granola crisp itself, I was in heaven! These little flakes have an intriguing flavor unlike any other snack, and it is truly bliss in your mouth! Made with sun-ripened strawberries, Indian Gooseberry, and whole grains that are actually true whole grains and not a concocted "food" made in a laboratory, it's no wonder I am now addicted to these things.<br /><br />All in all, if you are someone looking for a snack that will taste good, curb cravings, and still give you 20g of whole grains per serving (which is completely easy to get into your diet with how good these taste!), then try this. If you don't want to pick up the pack of 6 here on Amazon, I suggest going to Walmart and getting one of the single bags for around $3. It's big, but not too much of a loss if you wind up not liking them (which I doubt will happen).

review/summary: The best snack ever!!
review/text: I am one of the pickiest eaters on the planet and when I found these I could not put them down.  I bought them on a a trip down south at Super Target and when I returned I seriously went to every store looking for them with no success. I wish it was available because I would buy them every week. I think they are worth the hassle to order online even. They are sweet with whole grains and will fill you up when you are on the go. I can satisfy my sweet tooth without eating garbage.  I would not mush them up eating as cereal. The best way is right out of the bag.  I am partial to the strawberry, but the blueberry is worth the try too.

review/text: My 2yo son and I love these and buy them by the case. My 4yo son didn't like them at first but now he has been trying them too. I love that they are sweetened without sugar and are healthier grains. When we finish a package I pour the crumbs over yogurt.

review/text: I picked up a bag of the Blueberry crips in the grocery store one day, and these are so amazingly good and addicting. My husband and I are so addicted to them. They are healthy and taste so good, you forget you're eating healthy! I've tried these as a cereal with milk, but keep a bag in my car for snacking during the day.<br /><br />If you haven't tried them, you need to. You will not be disappointed if you like this kind of stuff.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: These are so good, when I first bought them I thought they would be more like granola clusters but they are actually little round flat 'chips' that are very good for you. Packed with all kinds of healthy stuff, my kids have no idea they are eating healthy and getting some of their daily fiber! I eat mine with yogurt in the morning and it helps keep me full until lunch. I am telling you these are the best tasting healthy snack that I have ever had. The strawberry flavor is really robust and everyone who tries them has loved them! Don't hesitate just try them and you will be hooked! I just requested an extra shipment because we cannot wait for the next scheduled one! 20 g of whole grain in each serving, not including barley, spelt, and amaranth for vitamin E

review/text: As an energy drink junkie, I find myself hopping from energy drink to energy drink looking for something to keep me going at a low cost and good taste. With Golazo and it's variety of flavors I can mix it up so I don't get bored with the same taste and purchasing by the case makes it cost effective. I am a fan of the sugar free Golazo even though the Mandarina is freaking delicious. Hands down Golazo has the best tasting energy drinks on the market.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: I had the regular Golazo and liked it but I thought I'd try the sugar free version. This is a good choice for those looking to cut out sugar. It still has lots of flavor and delivers a great taste. I've always found other energy drinks tend to smell bad and they would upset my stomach but this is not the case with Golazo, light and refreshing with a mango scent.

review/text: After shipping, you will pay a little over $3 a bag.  This snack is only $2 a bag in the store, but if you can't find it locally, it's way worth it!  I used to be hooked on the Flamin' Hot cheetos, but these are ten times better, and tens times harder to find.  I was excited to see you can get 9 bags at a time since I love to stock up on things.  It's hard to stay out of them, and I wish it came with a gym membership, LOL.  This item was shipped on time, and came fresh.
