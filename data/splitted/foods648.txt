review/summary: Not the best of the k-cup flavors
review/text: I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others.

review/summary: Where's the vanilla and the coffee?
review/text: I love French vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this. It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.<br /><br />In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product. I actually like light roasts but this is the first time I've had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was.

review/text: The product arrived on time and was the correct flavor type.  There was a problem though; when I opened the brown shipping box, it looked like whoever shipped it opened up my product and took out one of the pouches (it was a 12-pouch pack, the kind you would set up in a grocery store).  I also ordered a different flavor at the same time from the same company, and that box was also missing a pouch.  So in total, I was screwed out of 2 pouches of gum.  I didn't bother sending the product back or complaining because let's face it, the trouble wasn't worth the $2 that the gum was worth.  But still, kind of disappointing that someone would steal from their customer.

I've tried a few other varieties of chai, including Twinnings Apple-Chai, Dunkin Donuts bad rendition of chai, etc. This tea has so much depth, and so much spice in it that the bag is a little greasy. The smell that wafts from this Chai is absolutely heavenly.<br /><br />I love making Bangalore/Bombay Fogs with this tea. (That is: make a chai concentrate using the tea and one shot/two tbsp of hot water, and then adding 16 oz of hot milk. I finish my fogs with vanilla creamer, for an extra rich taste that vanilla syrup just doesn't have.)<br /><br />Have fun~!

Even other "organic" cream of mushroom soups contain yeast extract.

I can enjoy all my favorite recipes again!  This soup is great tasting and adds wonderful flavor to my recipes.  I even love how it comes in a carton rather than a can.  The quality of the soup is great and the ingredients are all natrual.

review/text: The taste and quality of this soup is far superior to the stuff in the famous red can and white can but without all the unpronouncable ingredients.  We originally bought this because it was the only cream of mushroom soup without soy.  Not only am I allergic to soy but it is so unhealthy it should be avoided by everyone if at all possible.  One thing to be aware of is that this is a 12 ounce box whereas the name brand cans are only 8 ounces so when comparing prices remember that these are 50% larger than the other guys and you'll need to adjust your receipes accordingly.

review/text: If you're looking for a Campbell's cream of mushroom soup substitute, this isn't it. It doesn't have the milky-creamy consistency of Campbell's. It has a sour taste, from the cultured cream and whey. The broth is transparent. The pieces of mushroom are bigger. It's really nothing like Campbell's in taste or appearance. It's definitely much, much healthier, but I don't like the taste or texture and won't be buying it again. I'll be making my own cream of mushroom soup from now on.

review/summary: Thank you Pacific, for the return of the hotdish!
review/text: This product allows individuals who are restricted from having gluten and msg in their food, to have traditional dishes using Cream of Mushroom soup.<br />This product is in condensed form and is perfect for cooking.  Never mind the pale color...the taste is all there and your recipes will be delicious.<br /><br />Thanks for the return of the hotdish, Pacific!<br /><br />Equally enjoyable is their Cream of Chicken....yum.

review/summary: Good, except for sodium count
review/text: High marks for PN's quality of ingredients. Except for too much salt, the Pacific Natural ingredient list reads pretty close to how I'd make a homemade batch if I had the time. (FWIW, the red & white canned brand is even higher sodium).<br /><br />As for the salt, one package of the PN packs 2220 mg of sodium - pretty much 100% of the RDA. I find it ironic that Pacific Natural would make this mistake, given that presumably most people buying an organic soup are probably more health conscious than those who do not. As others have noted, this soup is also more garlicky than one might expect a mushroom soup to be. I've found adding some onion powder (unsalted!) and fresh ground pepper offsets the garlic. I wish PN would do this - cut waaay back on the salt and add a bit of onion powder and black pepper to replace some of the garlic. And more mushrooms would be nice.<br /><br />Despite the cons, I prefer the healthier PN brand to the red & white canned stuff. I had given up on having condensed cream of mushroom on hand so was thrilled when I found this brand. It works well in recipes calling for condensed soup, serves as a good gravy base, and makes a nice traditional cup of soup as well.

review/summary: Not your typical can of cream of mushroom.
review/text: I feel like this soup is an 'upscale' version of your grocery canned cream of mushroom. We subscribe to this product, so it tells you we really like it!<br /><br />1. I like that the container is environmentally friendly and no concern over BPA.<br />2. It's gluten free.<br />3. It's thick and creamy, works well as a substitute for other cream of mushroom soup recipes.<br />4. Organic! This was a big thing for us as well.<br /><br />This product does have a strong flavor. It may take you a while to get used to it if you are used to the typical can of COM. The first time I used it for green bean casserole I was appalled. After getting used to the difference and not comparing it - it's a great option. This also is delicious in tuna noodle casserole. I haven't tried it as a soup alone, so I don't have a review for that.

review/summary: Fromm Gold is the best food for our dogs!
review/text: We have a boxer (skin allergies, etc.) and a boxer/beagle mix (thicker coat than the boxer) that both love Fromm Gold Large Breed food! We tried every top brand of grain-free food (Orijen, Instinct, Wellness, etc) and experienced horrible gas in both of our dogs...so bad that  we kept cans of febreeze in every main room of our home. We started going to a new groomer at a pet supply store near us and they recommended Fromm. The store said Fromm is a family owned company with NO food recalls since opening their business in 1904. We buy our food locally, not from Amazon(we are avid Amazon shoppers in other departments), but I felt compelled to write a review to potentially help other consumers find this amazing dog food. We are on our 6th bag of Fromm and both of our dogs have beautiful coats, are maintaining healthy weights and are totally gas free! There are not enough positive words to say about this food!!

review/summary: Who knew milk chocolate could be this good?
review/text: I'm a big fan of dark chocolate.  Given the choice, I'll always buy the dark semi-sweet chocolate version of anything.<br /><br />We don't buy brownies all that often - they're kind of a once-a-month thing.  But when my local supermarket had a super-sale on the Duncan Hines brownies for 77 cents a box (!!!!), we stocked up a little.  We got the Chewy Fudge style, the Chocolate Lovers style, and what the heck, since they're only 77 cents, let's get a box of the Milk Chocolate.  We left that for last because I assumed it would be pretty tame.<br /><br />O.M.G.<br /><br />When my wife and I ate them, we both just looked at each other in surprise.  How could these be so much better than the other flavors?  I mean, it's just milk chocolate, for cryin' out loud!  Milk chocolate is like "toy chocolate", made for people without the fortitude for real chocolate.<br /><br />So now we've got a $2.50/box substance abuse problem, hoping and praying for another 77 cent sale.

review/summary: My dog's favorite rawhide
review/text: My dog (A silken windhound) loves any and all rawhide, any and all bones to be truthful. But she injured a tooth once cracking through a beef knuckle bone, and I have since stopped providing her with hard bones. My dog has no interest at all in toys, unless there is a treat in it, then she pulls out the treat in 5 minutes and ignores the toy from then on. So I sought out rawhides as something to engage her off and on during the day. Though she'll chew eagerly on any rawhide I give her, I worry about her choking or gagging on a large hunk of it stuck in her throat, or a large piece getting stuck in her gut. This piggy twist, because it has such tight skinny strands, does not have that risk. On top of that,she'll take nearly two weeks of picking at it to finally finish it off, in spite of her persistance. I am so glad that she can have the rawhide she enjoys, that it doesn't get devoured in a day, and which allows me to feel safe giving it to her. I do wish I could get the 9 inch in a 3-5 pack.

review/summary: Hard!
review/text: These were really quite hard for my teeth!  I was hoping they were the texture of the fruit snacks which are also real fruit, but super soft and chewy, but not sticking to my teeth.  These were chewy alright, but hard--think old licorice or JuJuBees that have sat out for a week.  Were they tasty?  Ok, but I couldn't really tell one flavor from another.  Did I eat them when I was sitting at work and wanted chips or chocolate?  Yes, they gave me something to chew.  And chew.  And chew.  My kids ate them too, but they eat anything and are not very picky at all.  I thought it was misleading when I saw the top three ingredients were corn syrup, sugar, and high fructose corn syrup.  Then fruit purees and finally caranauba wax.  Will not buy again.

review/summary: Great Energy Mix but price is too high!
review/text: I have a similar product that I purchased at Wal-Mart for less than $5 for 19.25 oz., so this price is way too high.  The product currently comes with 20% free, so it probably is usually available in a 16 oz. size.  The product that I purchased is called Ann's House "Good Health Energy", but it appears to be a similar mix of soynuts, cranberries, almonds and pumpkin kernels.  A 1/4 serving provides 8 grams of fat, 6 grams of sugar, 3 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein.  There are other mixes available including Macadamia Perfection, Cranberry Nut Antioxidant, Chocolate Nut Antioxidant, Creamy Strawberry Almond and Pistachio Perfection.  I did not see all of these at the store.  The product is very high quality and Ann's House has been in business since 1973.

review/summary: Love the protein-packed snack, but Amazon's price is a rip-off!
review/text: I stumbled on Ann's Soy Energy Blend at Costco about two months ago.  I've been buying two tubs every two weeks since.  My husband & teenage son won't touch it, but my toddler & I eat some every day.  I have to have protein to keep from shaking during the day & often I'm not even hungry enough to eat anything, so the Soy Energy Blend makes a perfect snack that gives me the boost I need without making me feel like I overate.  It's also a great movie night guilt-free snack.  I know the soy nuts can seem bland, but they've honestly grown on me.  Whereas I used to pick out the cranberries & almonds first, now I only eat about half of those, letting my toddler pick them out for herself instead.  Now, the reason I'm here.  I ran out yesterday & made a special trip to Costco today for more.  They're all sold out!  I did an online search to see if I could find them anywhere else in my area & found them here.  But $22.00?!  Seriously? I pay just under $7 for the 36oz tub at Costco!  If they don't start carrying them again I'll have to start buying the items in bulk & making my own mix.  Cause this price is simply outrageous.  UPDATE:  February 2012 - Costco has them back in stock!  $6.99 a tub.  It's the first aisle I check every trip and today I bought 4 tubs.  :)

review/summary: Get over to Ann's House...
review/text: Ann's House Soy Energy Blend is fantastic. First, a word about price: Costco carries Ann's at the moment, but you know Costco- that could change, however, at Costco, I think it's cheaper by about half over some of the sites I've seen. Secondly- this stuff is dynamite! I bought Ann's for work precisely because I didn't want something that tastes "too good", i.e. trail mixes or candy that are full of fat, sugars, salts, and chocolate. Ann's is not sweet, but the cranberries, pumpkin seeds and occasional almond adds ample taste-appeal to the protein-packed soy. When in a captive environment like work, nibbling Ann's Energy Mix is good for you and super satisfying for the deep hunger that usually only meats, or peanut butter can fix. And, you will not even be aware of the benefit until 5 minutes after eating a handful or two. The satisfaction overcomes hunger and there is no guilt. Men may trip about soy and phytoestrogens, but the amount you're likely to eat will not affect any man. Hey- do they have a problem making babies in Asian countries where soy is their staple? Right! Get on with it then!

review/summary: Great snack on the go or at the office
review/text: I bought this at the local Costco, where, as others have mentioned, it is much cheaper there than here on Amazon.  At first, I was hesitant to purchase, as I had bought a giant canister of soy nuts once and found that they were completely bland and left me with cottonmouth and a bad aftertaste.  I had a hard time even giving them away in the office.  So after comparing the label on the Energy Mix with several other nut & trail mixes, I found this mix to be the healthiest by far.  Per 1/4 cup serving, there are 8g fat, 3g fiber, 6g sugar(!), 0g sodium(!), and 7g protein.  As you can see, there is plenty of fiber and protein, no added salt, and the only sugar comes from the dried cranberries.  This is a big difference from other nut/trail mixes which might have a good amount of salt and/or sugar added.  That is what makes this Energy Mix a great, guilt-free snack for when you're stuck at your desk at work and feel bad about quaffing down M&M-laden trail mix to stave off your hunger.  I usually go for a run or surf after work, so I toss back a couple handfuls of the energy mix before leaving the office, and find that it gives me just the right energy fix to make it through a hard workout, and all the way to dinner.<br /><br />And the taste: well like I said, I'm not a huge fan of soy nuts, but just the right amount of dried cranberries are added to balance out the dry blandness of the soy nuts.  Throw in the almonds and pumpkin seeds and you've got a good, nutty taste to round things out.  I will say that if you are looking for bold flavor or to satisfy your sweet tooth/salt craving, then you will be let down.  But if you are looking for a good tasting, satisfying snack that you can nibble on all day without feeling guilty, then this is a perfect choice.

If that were true it would not be allowed to be sold in the stores. It is available in COSTCO all the time. I just purchased four 36 oz containers today at costco for $7.79 per container. I also contacted the FDA and was informed that there is no truth to your posting as to the safety. Not all COSTCO's purchase the same products. It is available everyday here in California and at $7.79 per 36oz container it is very reasonably priced. The 22.00 per container price is high but the vendors on AMAZON can ask any price they want we just don't have to buy from them.

review/summary: Might be a bit bland for some folks...
review/text: But with zero sodium in it I consider that a fair trade-off. Being one of those not-so-lucky folks who have blood sugar issues, I've been told that soy is a good way of getting one's protein, and when I saw this at the big warehouse store I decided to give it a try. I like the almonds and cranberries the best (although those do have sugar so I take it easy), and yes the soy nuts are not so flavorful and might not appeal to all. I see mention in another review about the pumpkin seeds coming from China, a valid concern, but I've been snacking on these for a few weeks and haven't seen any ill effects yet :)<br /><br />In the end, it is all about choice - and there are plenty of trail mixes and nut mixes out there packed with sodium. Your call, but as long as the big warehouse store carries this I'll keep on buying and snacking. I also took some into work and gave a sample to two healthier choice minded co-workers and they both liked it as well.

review/text: Recently, I picked up a 30-ounce plastic jar of "Ann's House Soy Energy Blend" which I discovered in the snack isles of my local Costco warehouse store. It's a mixture of soy nuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. I'm a sucker for things like this. I can use them as a healthy snack. I can pack them in little sandwich bags and include them in my lunch package. I can bag them up for snacks in hiking walks. My wife likes them too. We snack now and then but we try to avoid salty and sweet snacks and stick to things that are nutritionally sound. These things fit the bill. They're a little bland tasting and you might wish that they were salted at least a little bit, but the protein and fiber content will make up for any taste deficits, at least in my book. It's a good snack. I love discovering things like this!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: This is my new favorite energy snack
review/text: I found a 9oz version of Ann's House Healthy Energy Blend. I really liked it and wanted to purchase more, but wasn't sure what store I found it in. I checked Ann's House web site and found that Walmart supposedly carried it.  I did not find it at Walmart, so I decided to order some online.  I couldn't find the 9oz version online, so I ordered Ann's House Soy Energy Blend 36oz value container.  I was hoping it was the same blend, just with a different name.  Since I saved the 9oz packaging, I could compare the ingredients and it seems to be exactly the same.  Boy was I happy to have 36oz of this good snack.  All the ingredients are really fresh (soy nuts usually seems to get stale quickly).  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this snack.  Thank you Ann's House!

I apologize and hope I don't offend but I refuse to give my children untested food imported from China given the current manufacturing problems they have had over there with toxins and chemicals placed in food products (I.E.  baby formula)  These must be extremely cheap pumpkin seeds to warrant this which makes me nervous, why else import them from China and not use USA pumkin seeds?  Sorry, will take a closer look at all ingredients from "Anna"s House" in the future.

review/summary: WHERE........Did this Product GO? ? ?
review/text: I fell in LOVE with this product while visiting my Son in Honolulu, he purchases this at Cosco. As soon as I arrived back to the midwest I called EVERY Costco and requested and researched as to why this Cost's SO much on line and is unavailable in the Midwest or any Markets.<br /><br />It would apear this product is NOT safe under the USDA guidelines and this to be the reason for a HUGE cost Increase on line and the reason it is Unavailable in the stores normally found in.<br /><br />WHAT a SHAME ! ! ! I found a greater Energy prior to my daily Yoga and after my daily hygiene regimine for the day while eating this Mix. I would think this company; "Anne's House" would find a substitute to replace the requests for thier product. If this product is not safe under the guidelines of the FDA it should have been found before ever allowed to be placed on the shelves in the USA.<br /><br />I WISH I could find A Substiture Product as good Anne's House Soy Energy Blend that is Safe and is Reasonably priced on the shelves in the USA once again.

They ate the almonds and cranberries but left the soy nuts. Even my dog won't eat them and he eats horse manure! Out of the 36oz in the package there's probably 25oz of soynuts that I can't even give away. Waste of money.

review/summary: best healthy rice beverage
review/text: This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is really great tasting, too.

review/text: First, I have to confess that I expected this Kona blend to knock my socks off.  It didn't do that, or even come close to it, but it is a perfectly adequate coffee even if it is not what I would call a great coffee.  It is very mild, not bitter, and can be made in various strengths according to individual preference with no bitter after-taste.  I don't feel that I wasted my money but I am not sure I shall buy Jeremiah's Kona Blend again.

review/text: Jeremiah's Kona Blend is a good tasting, middle of the road coffee bean.  While not as flavorful as J's Fogbuster, the Kona is light and mellow, offering a nice change of pace for dark roast drinkers.  I brew in a french press most mornings, but when I ran it through a drip machine for company the flavor became too slight.  Be prepared to grind a lot of beans if you brew drip.  Overall a good pick and a good value.

review/text: We really liked Jeremiah's Pick Fogbusters coffee in the five pound whole bean package, so I ordered this one for a bit of variety.  We're SO pleased!<br /><br />Yes, it's a blend (what did you expect for the price?), but the mellow smoothness of the Kona really comes through and makes for an outstanding pot of coffee.  Without the almost-bitter notes of the Fogbuster, this Kona blend is complex, rich and delicious.<br /><br />For a 12 cup drip coffeemaker, I use two and a quarter coffee scoops of the beans and grind for 15 seconds.  It's perfect, and way better than Maxwell House or Folgers.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Makes an excellent, smooth, flavorful espresso shot
review/text: The true test of a coffee's flavor for me is to drink it as espresso.  I've been roasting my own coffee for years, but mix it up sometimes by buying already roasted coffee.  This coffee has a great flavor with no bitter after taste when I drink a shot from my espresso machine.  When I drink it as regular coffee, I'll blend several of my favorite beans to get more complex flavors.  If you really want to find your favorite coffee, do a blind taste test.  It's fun and you might be surprised at which coffee you choose when your preconceived notions are taken out of the equation.

review/summary: Not what expected
review/text: We usually drink french roast coffee (San Francisco Bay) that we grind daily and we've been enjoying that kind of coffee for a while.  We were visiting friends and we were served coffee which tasted very good and it was a bit milder than what we drink, so I asked about the brand and was told it was Jermiah's Kona mixed with some french roast.  I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged.  As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry.  I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee.  I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success.  I don't know if I got a stale bag or what, but my experience left me with a bad taste. Amazon was great and they offered a refund.  Thank you Amazon!

I don't know I didn't do this years ago.<br />I honestly can not tell the difference between the 100% kona and this blend and its priced at a little more than folgers?<br />I hate to put this reveiw out there for fear that the price of this and availablity will be affected.<br />SO HERE IT IS FOLKS. AS CLOSE TO 100% KONA AS YOU CAN GET AND CHEAPER THAN MOST A++++.

review/text: This is great coffee.  I make 8 cups every day and we use extra when we have company.  I have a bag sent to me every month.  It is the best coffee.  I have had many compliments on it. I got a rubbermaid container that has a handle and pours and it holds the whole thing.  I grind the beans every night when I set up my machine and it is very fresh.  We like strong, but not bitter coffee and we drink it black no sugar.  This is rich full bodied but never bitter or acidic tasting.  I have been using it for over a year and I will continue to use it until they no longer sell it.  My in-laws like it so much I am planning to get them a subscription for Christmas.  We used to use Gevalia, but this is far superior and less than half the price. When I first ordered it I was afraid we would not like it because it was so cheap.  It is the cheapest stuff I have ever bought.  I only bought it because a reviewer that was reviewing a different coffee I planned to get recommended this instead.
