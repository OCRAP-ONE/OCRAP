review/summary: Expensive but worth it
review/text: My favorite breakfast.  By the pound it's not cheap but uses first rate organic ingredients like almonds, cashews, apricots and dates.  With many an American weighing, well, more then they should, I find that at least one meal a day totally satisfies the taste buds and is completely balanced as well.  Never, ever reach for the doughnuts, bacon, or other garbage for breakfast when I have this.  Mix it up with different yogurt, fruits, or even a bit of OJ, always fabulous.

review/text: From a quality point of view this is a very good cereal. The fresh Almonds, tasty Cashews and proper balance of sunflower seeds and raisins makes this cereal high quality. Unfortunately the quantity is extremely limited, the cost per ounce is extremely high. As a result one can purchase equally high quality cereal from ones local supermarket at an affordable price. I will not be ordering this product again.

review/summary: The quintessence of mushroom
review/text: I adore Watkins Mushroom Ketchup so much that I now buy it by the case.  I discovered it in London perhaps a decade ago, when it was 99 pence at a Sainsbury's food store.  Now I have to pay $7.95 a bottle plus shipping, but it's worth it.  I give a bottle to very grateful friends once in a while when I feel very generous.  My favorite use for it is as a light sauce on grilled meat or chops.  It is salty and intense, like Worchestershire.  A weak equivalent is mushroom soy sauce in an Asian market.  But get this one if you can.

The only suggestion I've got for the company who sent them is to ship them in a smaller box--there's no need to waste all that packaging for a few packages that could fit in an envelope.  Thanks!

review/summary: Tasty, low carb treat
review/text: These are good!  Especially since being on a low carb/cal diet, my options are limited especially when it comes to food like 'granola'.  The Russel Stover  Cinnamon roll is better, but these are a nice change and treat for when I have my 'afternoon munchies'.<br /><br />I was almost ready to give a 5 star review to offset the  one star review, but decided not to since it wasn't a 5 star product for me.  The one star review is certainly not fair since it wasn't even talking about the quality of the product, but rather what was perceived as false advertising--to me it was perfectly clear. And no where does it state "list price for "30 boxes of 5 bars each or 150 bars total" is 30 x 3.99 = $119.70. and 80 percent off of the list price is $23.94. However amazon ships only 6 boxes of 5 bars. So they are over charging customers by 80 percent".  What is this person talking about??  This is a good price for these bars-especially with free shipping. Remember review the product NOT the seller!

This is the best brand I've ever found in the U.S.  I like the taste and the texture of this one, and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients.  I found it somewhere locally, then when I went to buy more I couldn't find it again.  Krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets, and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!

review/summary: kids and grown ups love it so:)
review/text: these are the most delicious of all gummy candies in my opinion.  They are not gummi like haribo goldi-bears, or other gummy bears, because rather than gelatin, I think they are made with pectin or something, and so they have the texture of swedish fish.  I personally love this texture, my husband says they stick to his teeth too much.  The price is a little much, but it's hard to find them at all in the US, and I got hooked on them at a Duld in Nuernberg, where they were sold in a big paper cone bulk.  They taste like blueberries and other berries, and are really the yummiest.  The ingredients include: Orange, Holunder-berry (elderberry) , lemon, black currant, aronia berry and grape extracts, which is probably why they taste so good.  They are adorable, delicious and make me happy that they are the real deal from the german haribo company.

Along with canned food, I feed shop cats this dry food, and despite the lower quality ingredients, they seem to do fine on it.

A friend suggested these things after being around them a couple of days. Also that I should  try a couple of  different foods.  If their problem persists even after changes  I will let u know and update this review.  I will be relieved to find out what is causing their problems.  Siamese sensitivities !  I don't recall any digestive  issues with my other cats.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

Our supermarket carries it, sort of, but is unreliable about keeping it in stock.  This is not a dipping sauce, nor is it at all sweet.  It's just a perfect sauce for barbecuing or broiling a piece of meat.

review/summary: Best Crunchy Peanut Butter Out There
review/text: I've tried a lot of natural peanut butters, and I've tried a few commercial peanut butters as well, but Krema beats all of them for both taste and texture.  When I can't find it locally, I buy it on Amazon, and when it's not available on Amazon, I buy it from Krema directly.<br /><br />Commercial peanut butters are jam-packed with sugar, salt, and hydrogenated oil; but the peanut butters you find at most health-food stores tell you exactly why these additions seem necessary.  They're thick, dull, and tasteless, as though somone had tossed a pound of peanuts into a food processor and stuffed the result into a jar.  Krema peanut butter is the vibrant exception.  It always tastes fresh, and it stays spreadable whether you refrigerate it or keep it on a kitchen shelf.<br /><br />When you first open the jar, the oil has worked its way to the top, and it takes a few minutes to stir it in, but you only have to do that once.  And it's worth every second of the time and effort.  I prefer the crunchy variety, but the smooth version is just as good, and, with the addition of soy sauce, cayenne, lemon, and brown sugar, makes the best sauce for Anglo-Indian dishes I've ever found.<br /><br />Be careful, however.  Another company named Krema also makes peanut butter, and their product isn't nearly as good.  The Krema company you want has its plant in Ohio and has been operating since 1898; their peanut butter is also sold under the name Crazy Richard's, which is exactly the same product, but was branded differently for markets on the west coast.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: I bought this partially based on another reviewer's statement that this had a strong taste of lime. Maybe I got a bad batch?<br /><br />The one I tried, before I gave it all to my roommate, was unbelieveably bland. I could taste no lime flavor in it at all and definitely no shrimp. I haven't tried any other flavors of Maruchan Ramen in years, though, so this could be typical of this brand, I don't know. I can tell the difference with Top Ramen.<br /><br />Now, I really like Maruchan noodle cups. I prefer their shrimp and lime shrimp flavors above all the others, which is the main reason why I decided to try this flavor of ramen.<br /><br />I am a really good cook, but on a very, very limited fixed income and I try to help out one of my roommates, who has a son and gets even less money than I, so part of my diet has to come from ramen and noodle cups.<br /><br />This flavor is bland, at least to my palate, it was. I greatly prefer the taste of chicken and beef flavor Top Ramen.<br /><br />Not much else to say about it. The price wasn't bad, about the same as Walmart and my roommate isn't picky, he says all ramens taste the same to him and he was glad to get any kind of food, since it's getting near to the end of the month.<br /><br />I definitely won't buy this flavor again, though.

Ramen is a quick easy, cheap lunch for me and is very delicious. This flavor is my favorite ever, lots of lime flavor. There arent many flavors in stores now, manily only Chicken, Beef, Pork, Oriental and Shrimp, thats about it.

Meanwhile I was playing Black Ops zoombies and Kennedy said "I've been in the navy for years and have never taste something that fishy.." and that makes me think he's talking about this LOL...this noodle smells really fishy. So after the first pack.. for the rest of the 23 packs, I just throw the seasonings into the trash can and cook the noodle with my own seasoning.

review/text: I love Rice Krispies Treats and always eat far more of them than I should, they're just that good. They make a great snack for around the house and in kids school lunches. Individually wrapped in easy to open foil wrappers, these original version Krispies Treats are a bit softer than the lower calorie version. These also are the small version, about the size of the palm of your hand. Rice Krispies makes a very large/long king sized version as well, but these smaller ones work a bit better for fitting into kids lunch bags.

Besides, by the time I buy Rice Krispies, butter and marshmallows it is more than buying these pre-made. They are also fun for chocolate fondue, I quarter these bars, so they are versatile too.

I'm looking at over $9 for this 8 oz. can at the time of this review, and that is way overpriced.  If you can find it for half that price though, I would definitely give it a try ... you won't regret it.

review/summary: Still Tastes Good and is Easy to Make
review/text: This was a cake mix that we always had around the house when I was growing up.  I liked eating it for breakfast, dessert, snack, whatever.  My family was very familiar with it and we loved it.  Over the years, it became harder to find in stores.  I think the last time we had it was about 7 years ago.  I felt like having coffee cake recently, so we tried another brand.  It was pretty awful.  I came on to Amazon, found this old favorite, and ordered.<br /><br />It arrived quickly and I made a box that night for my family.  It brought back a flood of memories for me as I mixed it up in the familiar plastic bag, poured it into the cardboard tray and added the crumb topping.  I liked to mix the batter in that bag when I was a child.  Now, it seemed a little difficult to get all the lumps out.  I had to use a fork to break some up before adding the topping.  Other than that, the cake is as easy to make as before.  It turned out well.  The cake had the same flavor and texture as years ago.<br /><br />We all agreed that it still tastes the same as we remembered, however, it is a little saltier than it used to be.  But, it is hands-down still the best coffee cake mix.

review/text: Progresso certainly has my loyalty for quality and flavors.  I haven't tried all of them, but I'm working on it.  I've had this one many times.  It's always been thick and flavorful, and full of clam chunks.  Not huge, mind you, but enough to  know you are eating clams.  I have never gone to the "light" stuff in anything.  They also have a "lite" version of this. Wussy stuff.  This one is a very hearty meal but lacks a kick.  So I add habanero dust.  Give it a try anyway, if you haven't.  It is (almost) one of my favorites.

review/summary: This product was great!
review/text: As a daily user of Agave Nectar I was going through the smaller bottles very quickly. Since I was not ready to opt up to the gallon size this was great second step. The larger bottles are great for cooking/recipes and can be used to refill a smaller bottle for table use.  The agave nectr itself was DELICIOUS! I would highly recommend this product and will be buying it again in the future.

review/summary: Pretty sweet...both in price and taste
review/text: For starters, the taste is sweeter than table sugar and I'll take a stab and say it's something like a caramel candy taste. I've tried other manufacturers brands and they are similar to this one in taste, but can't beat the price however. Larrrge bottles, but easy to use squeeze bottle (plastic is just thin enough to squeeze easy). Doesn't fit any of my shelves, but tends to get used often so I'm ok with it just sitting on my counter. I love it in coffee/tea/on pancakes/in oatmeal and in cornbread (very nice btw). I won't give this 5 stars just due to the fact that I got 2 bottles, but only 1 cap. I know...I sound a little cheap here, but maybe it's a one time thing too. Anyway, I ordered this so I could use one for home, and one for work so I had to make a top for one. I have another order that should arrive next month so we'll see if it was an oversight.<br /><br />For the homebrewers out there...I used half of one bottle to make a honey/agave wine (about same amount buckwheat honey)...technically a mead, but it's about half of each so call it what you will...might be the harshest thing I've ever made but why not experiment, right?

review/summary: The Darker Agave nectar such as this product tastes best.
review/text: This product is a dark, natural product. The taste reflects the color as well. It does have sort of a caramely taste, almost that of burnt caramel. I do not particularly like it. I believe I like the Madhava product a little more, but am now convinced that the "RAW" untreated, Agave nectar is the best tasting from whoever the manufacturer may be. I have tried the lighter versions from two or three companies, and I prefer the darker "RAW" taste. It is also healthier for you.

review/summary: Sogave RAW Blue Agaive Nectar
review/text: The Sohgave RAW Blue Agave Nectar is fantastic! The taste is very much like honey only more light and clean. It works fantastic in any recipe one wishes or needs a sweetener for. It is sweeter than sugar so I use 3/4 cup of the nectar for any recipe which calls for a cup of sugar. I use an online calculator to find the proper amounts I need when working with tsp and tbsp requirements. That makes it pretty simple. I have totally stopped using sugar or any other sweeteners. Agave Nectar is the best. The taste it gives to the food is a clean sweetness that is great while it has a much lower Glycemic Index and is therefore more healthy. I would suggest this product to anyone.

review/text: Have used a few other agave syrups before and this is by far the best -- and a great value as well. Love the slightly caramel flavor. Some folks have complained about the bottle dripping, but here's the trick - when you're finished pouring in the amount of syrup you want BEFORE YOU TIP THE BOTTLE BACK UP be sure to release the pressure on the bottle. If you do this, the syrup sucks back in the nozzle and you get no drips!

review/text: I switched to agave in January 2010 because I was unable to find local honey and have never gone back.  My first brand was Ohgave which I purchased at Whole Foods in ABQ NM in a 23 oz size.  I have tried several brands and I would buy them all again.  When I was in ABQ in July I purchased this 46 oz size for $10.65.  When I found it on Amazon for $.65 less and free super saver shipping I bought the 2 pack.  It's a fantastic buy and a fantastic product.  I use it everyday on my morning toast with pb and at lunch in my plain greek yogurt.  I have turned several friends on to agave and this product.

review/summary: Good but please new bottles
review/text: As a long-time devotee of Wholesome Sweeteners raw agave, I happened to run out in October when this brand was on sale.  I got a really good deal and stocked up.  The taste might be a little more pronounced (I think wholesome sweeteners agave is slightly more neutral) but it's good.  The little pointed tops are annoying and you really have to squeeze hard, especially when you need more than a drizzle (like when baking).  You can screw the whole top off but it gets messy fast and the outside of my bottle feels perpetually sticky.  It's a good product but I'll probably buy whichever is cheaper when I run out.

review/summary: Good Brand, Poor Blend
review/text: So last christmas I was given a stovetop (moka) pot for making coffee (I will refrain from using the term espresso because some people will tell you that you have to use a certain pressure to make true espresso). Anyway, the gift came with this 4 pack of coffee cans. I truly wanted to love this coffee but it has been very hard to do so. By using a moka pot you can control almost every aspect of the brewing process. I have tried literally a hundred tweaks and changes in brewing technique but none of them can mask the terrible taste this coffee will leave in your mouth. I can only describe it experience as unpleasant as drinking coffee after using mouthwash except thats the experience after every sip. It isn't a mint taste its more like a bitter licorice that is extracted in the essence (the first stuff to come out tof the spout and yes I even tried separating the first part from the rest of the cup and the horrid taste is in the first part). I tried opening other cans but the experience was the same. I would give this stuff 0 stars except the company produces a very nice grind that minimizes any sediment (mud) in my cup, so for that I give it 1 star.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the brand so I went to my local supermarket and picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> and all I can say is wow. Such a superior coffee AND FOR LESS MONEY FOR MORE (0.8 oz) COFEE!!!! Please don't waste your time with this can of junk.

review/summary: It's a poor substitute for fresh ground
review/text: I really wanted to like this coffee. I wanted something that I could take to the office and use with my AeroPress coffee maker or use when I wanted a quick shot of espresso without grinding the beans. However, I guess once you start drinking fresh ground you cannot go back to buying ground coffee. The date on the bottom of the can is over a year away, but the coffee still smelled stale to me when I pealed the metal top off the can. I tried it a couple times in my Saeco made espresso machine. The crema was weak and the flavor was thin and slightly bitter. I poured it down the drain rather than finish it. I prefer Illy's dark roast espresso, but my local grocer no longer carries it, probably because it did cost more than any other brand.<br /><br />I guess I should have heeded another reviewer. My favorite coffee is Peet's and I think French Roast is the peak of perfection. I like the beans dark and shiny. This coffee was a medium brown color, not the dark brown that I'm used to. There's a reason why espresso shops freshly grind the coffee, it really makes a difference and is worth the extra time, expense and effort. The Baratza Maestro Plus is an excellent cone burr grinder (...).  It will give you years of service. I've tried cheaper ones and they just eventually die.

I had high hopes based upon reviews here and looked forward to receiving my first shipment.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for a great price and quick shipping.  However!  That does not make up for the very poor quality coffee inside!<br /><br />What a major disappointment.  The coffee is pale brown, not a deep rich color.  It is a little coarsely ground for an espresso machine.  The back of the can states this is espresso coffee, but yet describes itself as a "medium roast" with "medium body."  Where is the strong, dark, flavorful, aromatic, rich blend needed for a true espresso?<br /><br />I think I'll pass this right on over to my husband for use in his drip coffee maker.

review/summary: With Lavazza it's all about the blend
review/text: Lavazza coffee is wonderful but the different blends are, well, different. I really like the Caffe Espresso because of the heavier slightly bitter/strong but also slightly chocolaty-sweet taste and the aroma. I use a Mocha/stovetop espresso pot so that makes a different kind of brew too.<br /><br />Caffe espresso is 100% Arabica beans as is Oro. I find the latter a bit rougher/stronger. Then, the wise folks at Lavazza start blending in Robusto beans and for those of you that like super smooth, less bitter you need to try these...  Crema e Gusto is at the farthest end of the spectrum - 70% Robusto 30% Arabica and dark roasted (usually they make a medium roast I think), super creamy, nice as Americano or a straight, milder espresso, me I don't think it stands up as a cappuccino. Next in line is Crema e Aroma - 60% Robusto. I haven't had this in years. Middle ground? That's Rossa with its 30% Robusto and 70 Arabica...this might be my favorite as espresso.<br /><br />There's a few other blends but they are newer and I haven't tried them...<br /><br />Amazon should offer a taster pack!<br /><br />Happy espresso drinking!

review/text: If you are used to Peet's Coffee & Starbucks...don't bother with this coffee. By now you are going to be used to overly-roasted (burnt is not synonym of flavorful) coffee and anything mildly roasted is going to seem flavorless to you.<br /><br />If you, on the other hand, haven't compromised your taste buds with horrible coffees like Peet's & Starbucks- feel welcomed to enjoy this jewel of a coffee.<br /><br />It's chocolate-y, not fruity like Kona or Blue Mountain, without a hint of bitterness (even if you brew it ristretto-style), it produces a rich, caramel-colored crema, and it's actually lower in caffeine than it's burnt-roast counterparts. That's the beauty of the medium roast.<br /><br />I learned about this coffee while living in Sicily and got hooked ever since. It's the best of Lavazza's line of coffee (Blue has a deeper taste, Rossa is even milder) and it's my favorite.

review/summary: New and Improved?
review/text: I've been using this in my Gaggia espresso maker for the last couple years and it has always been good, but not quite as good as Illy.  The last batch of four cans I got, however, seems to have a slightly finer grind than previous batches. In my machine it now produces an incredible crema layer on top of a truly first rate shot. I no longer lust after Illy; Lavazza is my espresso of choice.

review/summary: Wonderful value for espresso
review/text: I bought this to try in our Saeco espresso machine, and for occasional use in the Keurig My-Cup drip coffee machine. It was a great deal at the time (still is, really). For drip coffee, it comes out full bodied, but maybe a little watery-more like a traditional Americano style espresso, with light crema. In the Saeco (which we have an "entry level" Saeco), it creates a wonderful medium-full bodied espresso, thick crema, and wonderful for mixing into any cappuccino or latte of your choice. It tastes like it came out of a much more expensive machine. We usually use Illy, which we're pleased with; but I'll certainly choose Lavazza in future, especially for the price.

review/summary: LavAzza Espresso delicious
review/text: I make this coffee in a moka pot.  It is so smooth and delicious.  I highly recommend it as it is just as good as what you would get at a high priced java joint, and only takes 6 minutes to brew.  I warm up about 1/4 cup 2% milk in the microwave and it makes just the right amount to fill an average sized insulated cup.  Out the door I go and loving the smooth rich taste - gets my morning off to a perfect start.
