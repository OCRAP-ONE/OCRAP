review/summary: Fantasric Foods Taco Filling
review/text: The product is great and a healthier alternative to ground beef, inexpensive, easy to prepare in tacos, taco salad, burritos, and nachos, easy to store for long periods and a crowd pleaser.  No worry about cholesterol or BSE either.<br /><br />My only problem was with the distribution center that has on four occasions sent only one box instead of the 12 boxes (case lot) that I ordered.

review/text: I originally found this taco filling at the local health food store.  They no longer sell it, and I was estatic on finding it on Amazon!  I absolutely love it!  It tastes great!  I even have made it for my meat eating family, and they all liked it!!  The expiration dates on the boxes are early summer of next year, so I will have plenty of time to eat them before they expire!  Looks like I will be having tacos tonight!  YUM!!

review/text: Anyone who has gone vegan or vegetarian knows how much you miss tacos. I tried this and I just can't believe how good it is! I made hard shell tacos with this today and soy cheese and I just can't believe how fabulous it tastes. The falafel this company makes is pretty good too!<br /><br />Please don't ever stop making this stuff! None of my carnivore family can even tell this is soy....If you are on the fence about this, don't hesitate-try it! The people who are saying it's too salty are entitled to their opinion, but this has no more salt in it than any other taco I've had in my life.

review/text: I find it kind of funny how some people found this too salty.  I had to add more salt because to be it wasn't salty enough!  I made some nachos with this and they turned out great.  Most likely someone who didn't know this wasn't real meat wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  I made some enhancements for my tastes, by adding some extra salt, garlic powder, onion bits, and substituting some of the oil it calls for with sharp cheddar, which melts right into at and gives it a little tang and richness.  I bought 3 of these on special at the local grocery store, hoping I wasn't making a mistake, and I'm happy I made the purchase.

review/summary: Vegetarian Approved... Omnivores still withholding decision
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for almost 15 years, and I LOVE this taco filling. I've used it to make straight up traditional tacos, enchiladas as well as "taco pie. I love that the texture somewhat resembles meat, so you can easily substitute it in recipes that call for ground beef.  However, my omnivorous family members are quite skeptical about this product and prefer that I leave it out of dishes. Ultimately, I look at this as a vegetarian's meat substitute, and not a universal meal substitute.

review/summary: too much salt? read this
review/text: To everyone crying about the salt content:<br /><br />If you look at the nutrition facts and do the math you'll find the salt content of pappy's seasoning is only about 24% (290 mg of salt per 1.2 g serving size). one of the most common dry rub methods called the 8-3-1-1 formula uses 3 parts salt. that is equivalent to about 23% salt in the rub mix. Based on those numbers it is apparent that pappy's is right in line with traditional dry seasoning recipes.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite seasonings for chicken and beef and I suggest that the lower scoring reviews be disregarded when considering purchasing this product.

I have used it on beef, chicken, salad and soup and it worked on all. Last night, the SO wanted a rub for some shrimp dish and I let her pick from several, all but one of which were my own formulas. She was delighted with the Pappy's Choice. I suspect that I'll be glad to have the full two pounds because it's going to get a lot of use. About the only thing that I cannot see using it for is on desserts.

review/text: My favorite has been the Tazo Organic, which is a little spicier I believe than the Tazo Original Chai.  My understanding is that Starbuck's uses the Tazo Organic.<br /><br />I tried the Extra Spicy Oregon Chai because the price of Tazo Organic concentrate went very high, from $24 to $40 for a 6 pack, well above retail.  I cannot get it locally.<br /><br />This stuff is super concentrated.  I use 2 ounces to make 14 ounces.  The package recommends 3 ounces for 16, and that is fine, though perhaps a little spicy.  I am pleased that I get a great cup of Chai for a relatively low price.  It is costing $0.76 for the concentrate per cup plus the cost of the milk.  I took the every 6 month automatic shipping option to save 15% ($15).<br /><br />To me, at this concentration, it is very similar to the Tazo Organic Chai.  In fact, I recently had a Starbuck's Chai, and I actually preferred my home made stuff to theirs.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: This exact product is used at all of the high end coffee houses around here. The taste is very authentic and filled with flavor. The extra spicy has more of a ginger and cardamon taste than the regular chai in this brand. Personally, I grew up on home brewed chai so, for me, this is as close to that as I have tasted and I have tried all of the concentrates available to the public. A 64 ounce jug of concentrate will make 32, ten ounce chais. Of course you can add more or less concentrate to taste. But the recommended ratio is 5:1. As you can see, you can save lots of $$$$. At the prices that you pay around here for chais, I have paid for the jug after 5 chais!

review/text: When I traveled to Boston late last summer, the ex and I planned to serve margaritas as a prelude to several dinners for family and friends.  We bought the tequila and the triple sec, and I brought along a large bag of coarse sea salt.  For the limes, I suggested that she buy two 16-ounce bottles of Realime, rather than us doing all that washing, cutting, and juicing of dozens of the real things.<br /><br />That was a major mistake.  On the first night, the cocktails were bitter and insipid.  We raced out the next day to buy some real limes for the other dinners.<br /><br />This product is probably fine if a recipe calls for a quarter teaspoon of lime juice, or if you want a splash of lime on your broiled or pan-fried fish.  But don't use it when lime juice is a principal ingredient.  Bite the bullet and juice the real thing.

review/text: If you love this candy, then go ahead and buy this package. If you have no idea what this tastes like, don't bother. I bought a case because the price of the case versus each pack of candy worked out to much less than what I would pay at the store. The product was fresh and tasted even better than the ones that sit in vending machines for weeks.<br /><br />My only complaint/concern is that I ordered for this product in the middle of a heat wave, and consequently the little jelly candies had melted or burst a little in the bag, so they stuck together. Other than that, it just gave me a reason to eat them sooner.<br /><br />This is a good idea to buy if you want some Halloween candy or something to pack with your lunch as a little dessert.

I think this candy (Starburst gummi-chews) may go the way of the lifesaver-hole. First, they don't taste anything like Starburst. Second, the liquid candy filling is too sweet. Basically these taste like gummi savers with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMK48W">Fruit Gushers Variety, 12-Count Value Pack (Pack of 6)</a>gushers filling.

review/summary: First Order, Last Order from these guys
review/text: I ordered several boxes of Starburst candies from this business because their website site said "free shipping" for orders over $80. Soon thereafter, I received an email from them saying my order has been cancelled(no explanation why). I go back to their website afterwards and noticed that the price for these candies had risen by $4 per box. Guess they thought they weren't making enough money off of me. I won't be ordering from them again because I don't trust them. Who knows if you will get your order or not. Sorry fellows, but you won't stay in business doing stuff like this.

review/summary: EXCELLENT!  The Spicy Hot Flavor Never Overpowers The Flavor
review/text: I too have been a devoted fan of The Pepper Plant Hot Pepper Sauce for years.  True, it has a spicy hot flavor - but the hotness never overpowers the wonderful flavor this sauce emparts.  Terrifically versatile, I've used it on beef and chicken - even in soups! So if you're looking for a hearty, rich-flavored sauce with a hotness that won't melt your molars, give this one a taste. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Truly exceptional.

review/text: I first tried this sauce at Nepenthe in Big Sur and absolutely loved it.  I bought a small bottle there, and that was quickly gone once I got home.  I was thrilled to find that I could order it online!  I bought 6 large bottles and went through them in a few months.  Luckily, I was back in CA again a few weeks ago and brought home more large bottles.  But, I know I'll be done with those soon and will order online again!  Also, I'm not the only one that thinks so highly of this sauce.  Everyone that tries it in my house loves it!  Note that I like the other sauces, but don't love them as I do this original one.

review/text: I have been using this stuff for over 14 years. Yes that's right over 14 years. I try others but nothing and I mean nothing even comes close to Pepper Plant. I moved from Ca to FL and was really bummed when I could not find this here. I had my mom send me 6 bottles every 3 months till I found it online. Now I buy it by the case. It's got some kick but wont burn your tongue out of your head and has tons of taste( will make your tongue lick your lips looking for more). I have yet to find anything that this does not taste good on. If you want a pepper sauce then look at nothing else cause this is what you have been looking for. Every person I have let try this has swapped over and this is the sauce they all use now. I don't even want to think about them ever stopping making this stuff. Life would just not taste the same.

I live in Ft Worth Texas, and I always have my father ship me this hot sauce whenever I need it(he lives in San Jose) Now that I can buy it online, I never run out!!! Its a bit expensive here on amazon, but if you look around, you can buy it directly from the manufacturer. You will have to buy it by the case though (12- 10oz bottles) but its well worth it if you use it as much as I do.

review/text: I first had this wonderful concoction on a breakfast table in Carmel California.  It is a wonderful addition to any egg dish and particularly on omelete's.  Mildly spicy hot with underlying taste of roasted peppers.  I've been buying it in Gilroy California for years until the store closed. This is the perfect online source, and the price is exactly the same.  You won't be dissapointed.  Their Chipotle is milder but also a beautiful sauce for steaks with a slight garlic flavor along with mild peppers.

review/text: There is a reason this pepper sauce has garnered nothing but 5-star ratings. It can't be beat. We first encountered this product at the Wagon Wheel in Carmel Valley. It is terrific on eggs and fried potatoes. Fortunately, they were also selling it, so we purchased a bottle to try at home and we have never stopped buying it.<br /><br />Living in Southern Cal, we have not found a source in this area, but it is plentiful in the Central Coast and Northern Cal areas. We buy it by the case directly from the producer at a great price.<br /><br />We recommend sticking with the Original California Style. Have tried the other variations, but the Original is the best. It has plenty of zip, but does not overwhelm your taste buds with heat. The focus is on flavor.

review/text: i first tried this hot sauce at a wonderful restaurant on a trip to San Luis Obispo and was immediately hooked!  I desperately asked the waitress where i can find it, contemplated stealing the bottle but thought better of it, and she told me they sell it at Vons!!!  So i picked up a couple bottles of different flavors, and they were spent in just over a months time!  It has that nice peppery flavor that often gets masked with too much spice, when compared to other hot sauces.  The flavor comes out, not just the heat, making this my favorite hot sauce!!!  I like to have it on hard boiled eggs mixed with mustard, i use with any marinade as well to add some heat.

This the best hot sauce because of it's flavor and consistancy. It has a thick consistancy, so it doesn't run all over everything, stays were you put it on your food. Eggs, Stews, Bloody Mary's and on meats is all good.

Brought a bottle home and now it's history. Glad to see we can buy more and enjoy our little taste of California again and again.<br /><br />This sauce isn't like other hot sauces where you get an intense burn, it has a nice heat tingle and great taste. We have never tasted a sauce similar to this so we have nothing to compare it too. Try this sauce and we are sure that it will be one of your favorites too.

For the best nachos - lay out a bunch of Mission Tortilla strips in a toaster (about an inch high), with a "healthy" amount of shreaded cheese on top - toast one cycle, then sprinkle the sauce over the top. The best.

review/text: This hot sauce is most unlike any other sauce I have ever had. It is chunky and thick and really a cross between a hot sauce and a salsa. The flavor is phenomenal. It is to "too hot" but has enough kick and flavor to make just about anything taste better. There is just enough garlic in the sauce that you can taste it, without garlic dominating the taste. I use it more like most people would use ketchup. It's great on eggs, omlets, pizza, or even pasta.  I just wish they had a slightly larger bottle. I go through about a bottle every 1-2 weeks!

review/text: I love me my hot sauces, but I am often disappointed by sauces that go for pure spicy kick at the expense of flavor. This sauce, however, has the most amazing balance of spice and flavor of any sauce I have ever tried. A little tart, but not too vinegary. A little smoky, but doesn't taste like it had artificial smoke flavor added. Good amount of spice warms the tongue but doesn't kill the taste of the rest of the sauce, or the food. Although I've lived in California my whole life, I only discovered this stuff recently, but I am committed to keeping it around my kitchen from here on out.

review/text: We first tried this sauce in July when we stopped for lunch at Big Sur, as we drove down the coast road. I was amazed at the unique taste. It is rich, a little bit spicy, and unlike any other pepper sauce I've tried (I love salsas). We bought a couple bottles for home, but they didn't last long. This stuff goes great with eggs, chicken, vegetables, etc. I've never seen it in a local store in southern California, and wasn't planning another central Cal drive, so I was very happy to find it available online. I ordered it with a couple other items from Taylor's market. On my first order, they made a mistake on one of the items, but told me to just keep the mistake and then quickly sent the correct item.

The amount of grease coming off of it astounded me. I did let it rest on a rack after cooking it so I could eliminate a lot of the grease but there was a whole lot more on the meat itself.  I chaulked it up to a really nasty, fatty, horrendous meal that I allow myself to eat once a year because it really does taste great but is just so unhealthly to ingest. Usually I reserve this once a year deadly treat for eating fried clams .... but......not this year.  I will not ever be buying nor recommending this lamb product!

I wouldnt call it bitter. Maybe call it a dull taste. I have found that the dull taste disappears if used with other strong flavors ( not nessesarily hot ones) Those additional flavors mask that kind of dull taste of the Ghost Chile flakes. Curry or Cumon are great spices to use with the flakes. Good luck.... check your will before your try this!!!!

review/summary: My dog's absolute favorite treat
review/text: I have an extremely picky yorkshire terrier, and he goes nuts over these treats. I have his full attention during training if I use these.<br /><br />One comment: the treats are too big for my dog (he is four pounds). I broke them up with a hammer to make them small enough. On the positive side, that means that one bag lasts forever.

review/summary: Inconsistent Product with Terrible Customer Service
review/text: We have purchased this product before from the same seller (AWORLDOFPUPS) and received a wonderful dog treat that was soft enough to break into multiple treat size pieces. My puppies absolutely loved them. We ordered another batch when we quickly ran out and this time we received very hard, dry sticks that would snap in half with a great deal of pressure but did not appear to be safe enough for my 20lb puppies to eat. We did give them one half of a treat each and were amazed at how LONG it took them to chew threw this small piece of treat. These are dogs that usually can chew through anything quite quickly. I held off writing a negative review until I heard back from the company. However their policy is that I must pay for the shipping on the return and I can not return anything opened. After numerous emails back and forth they appear to be unconcerned (at least they have not commented on) the fact that this particular bag appears to be defective and unsafe for consumption. The lamination on the bag itself arrived peeling. Upon closer inspection the product is made in China so the lack of quality control is not surprising, however the lack of concern and willingness to take responsibility by the seller is. We will be looking for new treats elsewhere. We are very disappointed; the first batch we received was great. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the first bag was fantastic as were the other treats in the same collection.

review/summary: Good for the price
review/text: I had a craving for a reuben and am too poor to go to a restaurant. I've never bought this before because sauerkraut in a can seemed gross and perhaps too cheap to be any good. The jarred and bagged brands at my local grocery were too big and too expensive, so I took a chance on this. It turned out just fine for my purposes and I will surely buy it again. It seemed a little more sour than other brands I've tried (but I could be wrong - I only buy it every few years). It seemed maybe a little less crispy, but it wasn't too soggy or anything. I was pleasantly surprised by this product.

review/summary: 1800flowers DOES NOT DELIVER ONTIME
review/text: 1-800-flowers.com RUINED A 90TH BIRTHDAY gift!! I ordered flowers on Tuesday for a Friday delivery for Mom's 90th birthday party.  Due to health issues my husband and I were unable to travel so we ordered a flower arrangement that was made to look like a birthday cake with candles.  The ad listed the flowers as available for next day delivery so I assumed that meant something like this was kept on hand.  I ordered the arrangement 3 days in advance just to make sure (or so I thought) they would be there!  I looked at several flower sites and we liked the colors and flowers of this arrangement the best.  My brothers and sisters were giving Mom a party at the apartment complex where she lives so since we couldn't be there I thought this would at least let them know we were there in spirit.  I got a call Friday afternoon from customer service telling me the flowers could not be delivered.  They said they could delivery some flowers Saturday, but not the flowers I had originally ordered.  I ordered 3 days ahead of time!!  You would think if they weren't available they would call prior to the day they were supposed to be delivered?  That way I could have made other arrangements.  I would have even considered picking out something different if that meant getting them there ontime.  The site says "100% satisfaction guaranteed".  I am not at all satisfied because what good is it to have flowered delivered the day after you need them???  They are supposedly crediting my credit card but they didn't know how long that would take.  I will definitely be writing more if that doesn't happen.  I have bought many many flowers online and never had a problem until now.  I am very dissatisfied with 1-800-flowers.com and will make sure everyone I come in contact with will know they are not reliable to get flowers there ontime!
