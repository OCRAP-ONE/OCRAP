review/summary: This is very good!
review/text: I've purchased this product multiple times and have never been disappointed.  I don't use it for cooking or baking, only for eating just as it is.  (LADIES ONLY:  I had heard that ginger helps reduce hot flashes.  I can't recommend it for others, but it does work for me.)  When I open a new package I put it into a colander and shake vigorously to remove excess sugar, then put the ginger in a covered Tupperware to keep it handy on the counter-top.  A few pieces twice a day, and I'm a happy lady!

review/summary: Hot! Hot! Hot!
review/text: Did I mention this is HOT? I eat some ginger almost every day, tried many brands of crystallized ginger. The downfall of most brands is that they are too sugary, but this is the hottest I think I've ever had. The hot/sweet balance is WAY off, and it has a sting that lingers. If you're a spicy hot fanatic (that is, cayenne-type hot) you may like this. Too hot for me!

review/summary: good price, good flavor, great for baking
review/text: This ginger is dried perfectly - not too moist, not too dry.  It isn't stringy either in that gross cud-like way that some dried ginger/fruit can be.  If chopped/minced, it is a great addition to baked goods.  Tasty eaten on it's own too.<br /><br />Yes, it is covered in "decorative sugar", but I didn't find this to be a problem at all.  Not too sweet.  If you don't like the sugar though, you can just give the bag a good shake before take out the ginger.

review/summary: Crystallized ginger is first rate
review/text: Local retail sources for crystallized ginger have disappeared in my area.  Compared to dried fruit and nuts, it seems not to have much of a following.  Perhaps its sharp, pungent, spicy flavor, which is moderated by the sugar crystals, is a bit too sophisticated for the average snacker.  There are those who claim small amounts are not only satisfying as a snack but seem to calm the stomach.  This supplier sells a good product at a fair price. And it arrived promptly.

review/summary: Decent, Gummy, Sugary
review/text: These are okay for the price.  They lack the real quality and favor of Australian Ginger.  This is definitely not baby ginger, but made from tough adult ginger which was boiled in sugar and then coated with more sugar.  The best way to describe the taste is a ginger-flavored gummy bear except more fiberous.

review/text: Hi,<br />Well this is a really good tasting product. I was so happy with it until I opened the bag for the 3rd time and out ran a pretty good sized spider, sort of brown and red I think it was so fast it came at me I threw everything up in the air and it hit the end of my kitchen counter and dropped down so fast I couldn't get my composure and kill it. So I hope it isn't dangerous for us. I will still finish the bag after I have my husband dump it all, look inside for any other stow-aways. But really it tastes really good and I will continue to order it unless I have this same experience again then I will seek out a different supplier.

There are not a lot of apricots (I'd estimate maybe 10-15% apricots) but I wondered why they were there at all.  I recommend the product and use it because of nausea and it helps.

review/summary: Irish smoked salmon
review/text: This was not our favorite smoked salmon through amazon. It's overly fishy tasting and the skin is on one side so it's not a net 3 pounds. The one we prefer through amazon is the 2 pound Atlantic smoked salmon (vendor is J.R Mushroom) and is fairly close to the Scottish smoked salmon which is the gold standard. If you can splurge for the St. James Reserve Scottish smoked salmon (can't remember the vendor), you'll be very pleased as we don't think it can be beat anywhere and is a very special indulgence over the holidays or any time you have a hankering for top notch smoked salmon.

I waited anxiously for the tawny bottle to arrive... I waited weeks... I contacted the seller, the seller told me that they sent the bottle and that it was not their problem! To my dismay, Amazon was unwilling to assist me! After several emails back and forth... I simply gave up and re-purchased a more expensive bottle of Peychaud's Aromatic Bitters from my local liquor store... Needless to say, the bitters are sensational. But do yourself a favor... look at your seller's rating before you purchase anything from amazon. Don't learn this lesson the hard way like I did.

review/text: Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.

review/summary: Expected More...
review/text: I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.

review/summary: Happy Dog
review/text: I received a free sample of Science Diet for our Papillon as  part of a Bzz Agent.  I was a little hesitant to try it because I had heard some stories from others who used it and were too happy. We tried it out and our dog is very happy. With her old dog food we would feed her in the morning and she wouldn't never want to eat until later in the day. Now since we have  switched she is real excited when we are getting the food out, she eats it right away.

review/summary: Vet recommended diet food
review/text: My dog is sick and on prednisone.  The vet recommended this food because of weight gain from the prednisone.  My Yorkie Loved it! I was really surprised.  He eats every bite.  It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.

review/summary: Excellent Blend of Seasonings
review/text: I grew up on the Chesapeake bay and have eaten my share(as well as a few other shares) of crabcakes. This packet makes an excellent crabcake. There is just enough breadcrumbs to help bind the crabcake together and just enough seasonings to not overpower the flavor of the crabmeat. Use Jumbo Lump Crabmeat and you will get a crabcake that will rival anything you can get at a restaurant. If you are using the crabcake recipe on the back of the package, just remember to refrigerate the crabmeat mixture for at least 30 minutes before you mold your crabcakes.

review/summary: I S.....T H E.....C R A B......H I D I N G ??????
review/text: The PICTURE for this item, (and even the wording below it), proudly proclaim, (in BIG letters), 'BLUE CRAB BAY CO., CHESAPEAKE CRAB CAKE MIX, 2--OUNCE PACKAGE, (PACK OF 6).  Well, they did get the last part right: it IS a six pack, and each pack DOES have 2 ounces.  And there IS actually some crabmeat listed in the ingredients: the second ingredient is "crabmeat", (presumably dehydrated), and down the ingredient list, is listed "crab-roe".  All well and good -- but I CAN'T TASTE IT!  (IS the crab hiding??????)  The ONLY ingredient I taste in this product is: S A L T.<br /><br />'Salt' is the SIXTH ingredient!  But also listed is something called "spices"....which can be anything, because it is not specified they are NATURAL spices, just "spices"...which can be chemical reprodutions of natural spices and/or newly-created chemical spices.  Who knows?  Not me, that's for sure.<br /><br />I should have known better....<br /><br />Each 2-ounce serving of this product comes in three separate containers.  The first is the outer, cardboard container -- which contains the other two, clear-plastic-wrap containers.  One of these holds a small amount of freeze-dried vegetables.  The other, (MUCH larger), holds the other ingredients.  HEY -- I NOTICE NOW THAT THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ON THE PACKET ARE N O T THE SAME AS LISTED ON AMAZON, NOR DOES THE PACKAGE LOOK THE SAME!  The item NAME IS the same same, however....and I HAVE been informed by a notation, when I first came to this product, that I HAD ordered it before.  But MY package has "Shore Seasonings" in BIG leetters on it, and a COLOURED BACKGROUND MAP!  Same company?  Maybe they changed hands between the time I ordered and the time the product arrived?  At any rate, the package I have contains NO crabmeat, dehydrated or otherwise.  What it DOES contain is this: Seasoned Cracker Crumbs, (bleached WHEAT flour, salt, paprika, cayenne, celery, mustards, herbs and "spices", (presumably all in the larger inner packet), and air-dried vegetables, (red bell peppers, tomatoes, leeks -- all presumably in the smaller inner plastic packet.)  THERE IS EVEN A RECIPE ON THE BACK, TO MAKE CHESAPEAKE CRAB CAKES, WHICH STATES THAT TO MAKE THEM, Y O U MUST SUPPLY THE CRABMEAT!  But Amazon says I bought this product.  Which product?????<br /><br />Well, I've opened one package....don't think I can return the others.  If Blue Crab Bay Company has been taken over by "Shore Seasonings", this should have been noted on the item's page, and the ingredients changed.  I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THT FROM IT -- AND IT ALONE -- I COULD MAKE CRABCAKES.  BUT THERE IS NO CRABMEAT IN IT!  Only mainly wheat -- and SALT!!!!  Having no crabmeat in the house, I tried to use this mixture with the tunafish I DO have on hand.  Tuna in water.  With no salt.  The mixture was still unbelievably salty.<br /><br />Something is incredibly "fishy" here.  And I don't like it!  I doubt whether I will buy this product again -- as long as it has SO much salt.  And I am SERIOUSLY thinking, (right now, at least), in investing some money in...........SALT MINES!  (Which, if conditions there are as bad as they used to be, is somewhere where I'd like to send executives from..........  Oh, forget that.  All I want is an apology and my money back, from Amazon and from the Blue Crab Bay Company / Shore Seasonings!

review/summary: NOT trimmed as pictured
review/text: These hooves are not trimmed as shown in the picture. I even talked with a local customer service rep (of the manufacturing company) before purchasing. They have long, thin edges that break off in pieces in my dogs mouth. (I have an aussie sheep dog with a little border collie mixed in.) I don't consider this a safe or quality product and would not buy it again. You are paying for a whole lot of material that should have been trimmed off and smoothed down as indicated in the picture. I would like to find the brand that (apparently) has been discontinued. It had a red and blue label,was made in the US, and was properly trimmed. They were about 10 in a bag for under ten in the local pet store.

review/summary: 3 very happy babies!!!!
review/text: I had bought hoofies in the past, and had always been happy with them. I had two dogs a mixed dog of sorts, a Shiba Inu, and had adopted a Border Collie recently. Well she came with a hyper stick, basicly a rubber tube that smelled like an old tire. YUCK, and didn't quite care for her chewing on this either. I went out and bought her what must have been her first hoofie. OH my gosh, drooling up a storm, she had finished it in a matter of days. Border Collies are WORKING dogs, they LOVE to stay busy. Let me just tell you, she keeps busy alright, and no chewing anything she shouldn't. She would chew the former owners shoes up, not here, nothing but hoofies for my baby. Bartender hoofies all around!!! THE PRICE IS AWESOME!!!! the shipping was $10.50, but for an order placed on Fri. the day after New Years, it got here on Tue. of the next week. Well worth it, even the size and thickness of the hoofies are great,95% large with a few sm put in (for travel, or crates)!!!!!!  P.s. that smell, reminds me of a muskete bar-b-q smell. duh cow!!!LOL

review/text: I ordered a big box of hooves, I got a big box of hooves. My dogs love them. I've seen some other reviews whose authors were offended by the presence or lack of a shiny "polished" look, but who cares?? Not the dogs. These hooves DO have a little bit of a barnyard smell (especially when they're wet and chewed on), which is why I've only given them 4 stars instead of 5. I'll keep buying them, though -- this is a terrific price. They might be a little smellier than the ones I can buy in the store locally, but the price makes it worth it.

review/text: This was my first order of these cow hooves.  Our local supply (different brand) got tied up in some kind of a salmonella recall.<br /><br />So I checked online with Amazon and this product came to our attention.  We placed an order and our two dogs, an Australian Shepherd and a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, both love them.  I doubt we will ever buy the product from the pet store we formerly did.<br />For one thing these thru Amazon are much cheaper; and two, it is nice to have a large supply of them on hand rather than having to go to the store every couple weeks for them.

review/text: This review is a generalization of all hoof treats, not an indication that this particular brand is different than others I have tried.<br /><br />Many dogs seem to have little problem with hooves. When I tried these, they seemed to be on par with other good quality manufacturers. My problems with them is three-fold. First, they have a tendency to splinter; and since most dogs tend to swallow faster than they taste, I became quite concerned my dog might sustain internal injury from those shards. Second, the aftermath was a bout of diarrhea. However, my dog has a sensitive gut, so take that for what it is worth. Lastly, and of least concern, is that they stink horribly. I know dogs tend to like things that stink, but holy moly. When my dog plopped down next to me in the office after eating her first one, I thought she had eaten a rancid Yak!

review/text: At first bite, I wasn't too sure, but when I tasted my first raisin, my eyebrows went up and I paid more attention.  By the time I finished, I was really liking this new offering from Dr. McDougall's.  I must say, after a slow start Dr. McDougall's is winning me over, as I have now had several of their products I really like.<br /><br />This is a tasty, very easy to prepare dish that is a bit more filling and satisfying than many similar products.  I had one of these with some mandarin oranges on the side and was pleasantly satisfied (I'm a big guy, so that's a good thing!).  This would make a great side dish as well and, in my opinion, would be great with pork.<br /><br />One serving has 280 calories (20 from fat) and 460mg (19%) of sodium, 6g fiber, 56g carbs, and 8g of protein.  The meal consists of brown and white rice, lentils, raisins(!), and other vegetables, marsala spices and so on.  It's the raisins that make this thing work (for me) as they add a great flavor accent to this dish.<br /><br />Very convenient and a great addition to your microwavable pantry stock (can also make using boiling water).

review/summary: Very filling quick lunch!
review/text: I have a short, intense 25 minute lunch each day. When I eat one of these, it keeps me full for about 5 hours. I think it must also keep my blood sugar at an even keel, because I don't seem to need a shot of something sweet a few hours later, the way I do if  I eat other rice-bowl type instant lunches. I am gluten-free now, and this is very digestible. So, now to answer the question, Does it taste good? Yes, it is good, but not delicious. It has a mildly cinnamon component to it and is not salty. It is not exactly bland, but I have found myself rummaging around in the staff kitchen, searching for something to add to this. Successful additions have included chopped apple; curry; chopped up ham;  a handful of cashews. It is a good item to keep stashed in your desk drawer, work locker or emergency food stash for a time when you have to eat and need it to keep you satisfied for awhile.

review/summary: pretty tasty
review/text: As instant meals go this one is surprisingly flavorful and has a nice whole grain taste to it. Many such entrees seem just like empty carbs but this actually tastes pretty good and seems somewhat healthy. When I need a quick snack at home before running errands I'll add some frozen peas to it and it'll keep me satisfied and from buying a bunch of impulse items at the grocery store.

review/summary: Directions?
review/text: The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt.  It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste.  Thin slices also help.  I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham.  I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas.  It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps.

review/text: We purchased one of these at Justice for Girls store.  The stamp is tiny, impossible to read on gum, and hard to use. We could barely get one letter - certainly not a word or sentence.  My 9 year old tried it for 5 minutes and then just gave up.  In effect, we paid a lot for some gun and threw away the plastic case.  What a waste.  Very gimmicky.

review/summary: It's an average beef, potato and carrot stew. Women love it.
review/text: I personally do not care for this beef stew. My mother and niece absolutely love it. I find the gravy a bit greasy. The meat is not whole pieces, but rather compressed ground hamburger. The potatoes and carrots are what you would expect from canned food. I have been stocking up on Bulk Canned food with an expiration date of at least 1.5 years from date of purchase. You would be surprised at how fast some canned food expires! Yes, the economy is collapsing under Obama and his Communist Marxist agenda. Stock up now. The current price and vendor for Dinty Moore Beef Stew is ridiculously overpriced. Do NOT buy your bulk from this vendor "Huggy's Haven". Looks like they pulled the price out from their #$$. They are double the price compared to any grocery store.

review/summary: Great flavor, disappointing packaging
review/text: I was choosing between the Planters Spanish Peanuts and Azar - I ultimately went with Azar because it was less peanuts overall, and I wasn't sure how I would like them. The Planters peanuts seem to have better packaging (canisters with plastic lids). Azar peanuts are very tasty - the peanuts are roasted to be very crunchy, have flaky red skins, and are nice and salty. Unfortunately, the "resealable" bags are not air-tight - the ziploc seal isn't properly afixed to the bag, so it pulled away from the bag. Overall I'm happy with the peanuts, but disappointed by the packaging. I would definitely buy Spanish Peanuts again, and certainly from Amazon, but I might try the Planters version because their packaging looks better.

I drink them ICE cold.....I put the bottles in the freezer for a little while until they are almost like a slushy.  It stays colder longer, lasts longer and I'm satisfied for a long while.  I have been craving something really good to drink lately and haven't had any of these in the house.....time to go shopping.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about these, try them.  I like that they aren't really sweet but there is enough flavor in them that you aren't wondering after you've taken a sip, if that flavor was what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />Kimberly

review/text: According to my doctor, I'm supposed to do more walking to strengthen my bones. Okay, I can do that. I've even gotten to the point where I enjoy it. I have a little route worked out that is about 1 1/2 miles and I try to do it on a daily basis, if possible. There's a drinking fountain along the way for these hot summer days. However, I prefer to carry my own cold beverage and I've tried a variety of different drinks. Today, I brought SoBe Lifewater O Calories (black and blueberry variety) in a 20-ounce bottle. That worked well. The taste was good and I like the no added artificial sweeteners. I like all the added vitamins and antioxidants. The size of the drink was just about ideal. I'll be doing this again and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great for potty training!!
review/text: I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!

review/text: Our dog loves these.  We started her on it when she was 7 weeks old (and had about 4 teeth), and she loved it.  She was still too young to eat milk bones or even beggin' strips, but she could eat these.  I also don't feel bad about giving these to her because they are only 3.5 calories each. There is a rapid change in behavior when she hears me open up the treat bag... she sits, stops chewing, and starts randomly performing tricks, hoping to get one... it's pretty funny. We have repurchased these and will continue to do so.

In fact, he grazes.  But when I unseal the package of Zuke's, he bounds at me bouncing in the air.  I taught him "sit" in two minutes using Zuke's (Chicken).  My 19 month old Catahoula Leopard Dog-girl loves them, too.<br /><br />I like the small size of these treats (it's easy to carry them in a snack size ziploc) -- perfect for training/rewards.  I pretty exclusively purchase natural, high quality food/treats for my animals companions.  Zuke's is our household's favorite canine treat!

review/summary: Good size for training
review/text: My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small.  They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail.  Each piece has 3 calories.  For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy.  If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.<br /><br />The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed.  If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical.

review/text: We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work. She loves these treats and has proved a quick study.  Happy treating!

review/text: My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training. These moist mini peanut butter flavor treats are perfect! They don't gross us out and both our dogs (the puppy and our 2 year old dog) LOVE them and are highly motivated during training sessions.
