review/summary: Absolutely the best tasting, strongest, freshest, highest quality Organic Decaf Coffee!
review/text: I love this coffee and have ordered it many times, and plan to continue to make this my only brand of coffee. It is that good! It is very, VERY fresh. In fact, you can even see a moisture level on the beans. It smells great! I use much less of it than I use of other organic, decaf coffees.<br /><br />I just hope that it remains available through Amazon.com, so I can continue to enjoy it. Every time I fall in love with a product, it tends to disappear! I hope that it can remain my coffee for many years to come.<br /><br />Update: Dec 22, 2010<br /><br />I've been drinking this hearty coffee for well over a year, and I still LOVE it! The quality of the coffee, the packaging, the shipping, the freshness of the beans, the flavor, the smell, the price just can't be beat. I think what really impresses me is the freshness of the coffee beans. They are moist and full flavored. What's not to like! :)<br /><br />Update: April 18, 2012<br /><br />This is still my favorite coffee. Every order has been the same, high quality, super fresh, hearty coffee beans.

review/summary: Smells great and is organic, but not favorite organic decaf
review/text: When I received this product, it smelled so good and fresh! For me personally, however, I prefer the Marques de Paiva organic decaf taste. While I definitely will still finish this coffee, it is not as smooth as Marques and sort of smoky tasting (I am not a coffee expert so I am not sure of the correct description words). However, just to have organic is great! And it definitely comes recently roasted which is a plus.

review/summary: WARNING:  These are WHOLE beans, and dark roasted.
review/text: When I purchased this, there was no notation that they were whole beans--call me lazy but I prefer to buy already ground coffee.  Amazon was gracious and refunded my purchase, and I gave the coffee to a friend.  When she opened the bag, I noticed that they were definitely dark roasted beans.  The description said medium bodied, but I guess I was expecting a somewhat lighter roast.  Would not purchase again.

review/text: The product arrived on time and in undamaged condition.  However, one problem that I have noticed is that while they sprout just fine in starter trays, once you transfer them into the regular pots and move them outdoors, they just stop growing.  In fact, only 1 out of our 5 plants produced any cucumbers.  They don't dry out or something, just stop growing, that's it.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, since this is my first cucumber of this variety.

Most of the food recalls I can remember in recent years were from U.S. products, so what does that tell you?<br /><br />I take a star off only because Woodstock seems to be trying to pass these off as a U.S. grown product for those who dont read the fine print.

review/summary: AMAZINGLY GOOD!
review/text: This is the best honey ever...yummy AND healthy!The Airborne version even comes in a very handy-sized and lovely container. I have bought this from Amazon for several years now over and over because it's just terrific. I order 10 or more jars at a time to get the quantity price break on shipping. I don't think I've ever found a New Zealand product that wasn't good, and I wish Amazon would offer more of these. Some people might not like the taste of the manuka, but it is rather diluted in this particular flavor...still extra healthy, though. Read about manuka benefits if you are unfamiliar with them. If you want something really yummy and healthy, try a couple of heaping spoonfuls of this honey mixed well with the organic almond butter in the individual pouches that Amazon also offers on a whole-grain bread. I like this with OatNut bread...don't know if you can get that everywhere, but it's great stuff. I've been lucky to have spent time in New Zealand and learned about the benefits of manuka firsthand. If that poor soul who wrote the crappy review didn't like the mild taste of this honey, he should try what New Zealanders consider to be the 'medicinal' variety! But, then, one must remember that these are sturdy folk who also eat things like marmite. I can't even bear to describe that stuff! They are also really lovely, friendly people who entertain hobbits and elves.<br />  Don't be afraid to try this...I will bet that you will like it. And, try to go to New Zealand, too...you'll love it. It's just like in "The Lord of the Rings."

I love that the icing comes in a separate container so you can control the amount of icing that goes on your cake. The icing has a nice, softly sweet flavor that is unlike any other icing I have ever tried! The best part, it is good for 2 weeks, even left out on the counter! This cake is great for parties, meetings, or even as just breakfast for the family. It's just perfect!

It was close to an Alfredo...filling (I ate one container myself) and was good.  Noodles weren't mushy, no bad off taste - as one reviewer said: add broccoli and chicken and you have a whole meal.  The noodles are like a thin linguine, not round ramen-like.  I like this about it.<br /><br />Can't wait to try the other flavors I ordered along with this one.  This would make a good pantry stock item for those times you don't know what to make.

I got started on these 8 packs when they were &lt;$8 a pack. Now they want about $20. At the local store you are paying per box, not per 8, and it still comes out like 3 times less. Not good marketing choices here.<br /><br />I like the 8 packs as they fit well in our cupboards and it's easy to see what you have and how many are left. My son likes this flavor, 4 cheese. I prefer the Spicy Veg, Shrimp or plain Chicken boxes myself.<br /><br />The quality of the Maruchan noodle boxes seems very good, but for these prices we'll do without.

review/text: So my wife gets the biggest laugh when I order food from Amazon. However then she trys it and understands why I don't want the .25 cup o noodles. I like fast easy stuff like this for grab and goes at work. It also nice to keep a couple in my drawer at work for that random long day when I can't get out for food or have eaten the little food I brought with me. I do the subscribe and save and that makes these just a bit over a dollar. But hey .90 gets me a cup o noodles out of the vending machine and this is twice as much food. Think of this one as Ramen Alfredo. Interesting blend of cuisines with Italian and Oriental. However its a winner. As others have said there is even room to throw a can of tuna or something in it after it is done cooking. So go ahead and splurge on a good ramen noodle meal. Pick up some of these.

review/text: I like it! When purchased I was skeptical regarding the taste, but so far this is the only flavor that I like in this brand. I have to end up adding milk to help stir in the cheese powder when its done, because some water overflows out in the microwave. No one can't complain about the value for the money... because after all, we are aware that we are paying for the "convenience" of the product.<br /><br />This flavor is great to make 1-2 servings for a quick and convenient meal, when used as a base. I made chicken carbonara by adding peas, diced tomatoes, and bacon to alfredo sauce and topping the noodles with the sauce and a grilled chicken breast. A great base to top with bruschetta chicken and topped with warmed queso blanco sauce! You can add steamed broccoli also, or add the noodles to a broth to make a vegetable or cream soup! The noodles do NOT get all mushy like those Lipton noodles sold in small foil-lined paper packages do!!  Just sayin'.....

review/text: After experiencing "soapy" tasting flower-enhanced teas before, I was apprehensive. I usually prefer loose-leaf teas, but I tried this because I received a sample (and loose-leaf can be difficult to manage at work). I absolutely loved the scent as the tea steeped. The taste is very mild and I can see it pairing quite well with good Asian food, or just as an anytime treat. The scent stays fairly strong and it seems as though you're sitting amongst jasmine in full bloom with every sip. I usually have a teaspoon of sugar or honey in my tea but, while you could give it a hint of sweetness, you really don't need it. Great job, Twinings!

review/text: I bought this tea hoping to find a good, economical sencha green tea. Unfortunately, this is very low quality.  Whereas other sencha teas I have tried have a sweet, grassy smell and taste, this tea has a musty smell and almost no flavor. This is the only sencha I have seen where the leaves are not rolled. Instead, the leaves are dried flat. This also contains a fairly larger percentage of stems (more like a kukicha). The smell and quality remind me of sweepings from an old barn floor. I recommend avoiding this product.

review/summary: Much Love for Memphis Mocha Java
review/text: I received the Memphis Mocha Java coffee as part of a gift from a friend of mine. Figuring the coffee was going to taste like cheap swill being a novelty item I tucked it away forgotten till the morning I found my self completely out of coffee. What a pleasant surprise it was when the nutty chocolate laced aroma hit my sences upon opening the bag. I was not disapointed in the least when the brewing was done. I have found a new favorite in Memphis Mocha Java. Easy on the stomach, it's good as a morning coffee, but a rich wonderful taste of chocolate with a hint of hazelnut also makes it perfect for a dessert blend.

review/summary: City Steam Cinnamon Roll Single Cup Coffee Pods
review/text: I love City Steam coffees that I have tried before this Cinnamon Roll coffee.  I just can't drink this flavor.  The cinnamon has a chemical taste to it.  I will definitely go back to my tried and true flavors and avoid this one.  I have given the remainder of the package to a couple of friends and they didn't care for the flavor in this pod.  Sorry.

review/text: I got the Mystic Morning flavor, and if this is what a medium roast from this brand tastes like, I wonder how deep their dark roasts go. It's a bracing flavor profile in the morning, the kind of coffee that'll put hair on your chest. If you want your coffee strong enough to get up and walk away on its own, this is for you. Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.

review/summary: Coffee is ...
review/text: ...one of my favorite pleasures in life and I decided to try this brand once it was on sale for under $6. A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!

review/summary: More beans than I know what to do with.
review/text: I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.

I finished with some cute black and white small paper flowers spaced  around the bottom. simple and pretty easy! Black and white is dramatic no matter how simple the design!

review/summary: Terrible!
review/text: Wilton Patterned Sugar Sheets Edible Decorating Paper -<br />Absolutely infuriated by this product. I was so excited to find the Damask pattern that exactly matched the decorations we chose for my daughter's Sweet 16 Masquerade Ball. Plus I knew I was going to have so much to do, that the sheets seemed the the perfect thing to make a beautiful cake with not much effort. I decided to simply wrap the outside of each tier and pipe a border, place a few fondant masques, and call it a day. Buying that many sheets was expensive, but I thought it would be worth it. The plan seemed to have worked perfectly UNTIL I opened the cake carriers at the banquet hall the next day to do the final stack and pipe the bottom borders. The sheets had evidently absorbed moisture from the buttercream and were all bubbled up and buckled over the entire cake. Any attempt to press them back into place resulted in the sheets sticking to my fingers and shredding away from the cake. Thankfully, the hall was dim and I had made extra fondant masques, so I was able to cover most of the damage. BUT, this was supposed to be the centerpiece of the banquet table! It ended up being relegated to a corner table, so that the worst damage was blocked from view by the wall. I don't make my living making cakes, but I have been doing it for over 30 years, so to have to present such disappointment at my own daughter's Sweet 16 party made me sick! Shame on you Wilton for producing such a shabby product!

It never occurred to me to check Amazon.com for my son's favorite sunflower seeds.  On a whim, I decided to do a search.  Low and behold, Amazon had his seeds, and at a better price!

review/summary: Addicting!!!!
review/text: I'm in Iraq right now, and since these aren't available at the local BX/PX, I have to order them online.  They arrived quickly, and every bag was perfectly flavorful!<br /><br />I have to warn you though-they are seriously addicting!  Once you start on them, you can't stop!  I have them at home all the time for road trips, and even while I'm watching a movie.  I'm constantly buying bags at convenience stores to pass the time while in traffic, and they really help if you want to quit smoking!<br /><br />Back home I work in a prison, so there is literally no tobacco allowed in there.  Since almost everyone that works there is prior service military-a TON of them smoke as well.  Anyway, we aren't allowed to take smoke breaks, or even smoke on the grounds.  So in order for most people not to have a "nic-fit" they use these as well.  I got to the point  I could go through two bags in one eight hour shift.  Okay, probably not the healthiest thing ever-but it definitely did pass the time.  On a few occasions I even had inmates steal them.  But then again-they sort of steal anything and everything they can.  Otherwise they wouldn't be there...and I wouldn't have had a job : ) lol<br /><br />Seeds are great-and I don't know what that other reviewer was talking about-they arrived in great condition-tasted perfect and lasted for quite awhile out here.  Everyone always wants to know where I get them because they aren't readily available out here.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Seriously addicting.  Great taste.  No drawbacks whatsoever!<br /><br />-Hannah

review/summary: Best Flavored Seeds from the David Brand
review/text: So far I have tried regular, BBQ, Ranch and Chili Lime sunflower seeds made by the David brand, and the Ranch flavor is by far the best one. The taste is very addictive and it is hard to stop eating them. If you are curious about Chili Lime flavor then stay away from it because it is nasty. I bought all 4 flavors at K-Mart for $1.49 per 5.25-ounce bag in NYC, which was a good deal. I will probably buy the Nacho 12-pack here on Amazon soon because I like it so much.

review/summary: TRANS FAT!! Beware, nothing against Amazon though
review/text: I used to LOVE David Ranch sunflower seeds and honestly could and would eat a bag a day. I have always been a fan of David over all the other brands well recently I was in my nutrition 1020 class and learned that the FDA doesn't require the manufacture to show trans fat if it is less than 0.50g PER SERVING. The only way to tell is in the ingredients list. If it has any partially hydrogenated oil than it has trans fat and you are supposed to avoid ALL trans fat if possible. So when eating a whole bag a day I was getting a lot of trans fat. So I have now switched over to Spitz which has none.

review/text: I am a GF Newbie.  There I said it. ;-)  In the beginning, I tried to buy all the flours and mix all the ingredients to get a general all purpose gluten free flour.  What a mess, what an expense!  I then started trying the GF Flour blends like Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's etc.  Eh.. didn't care for them.  I stumbled upon Better Batter and gave it a try.  This stuff was made for GF newbies!  Substitution is close to cup for cup for wheat with the addition of a little extra liquid.  I am now making breads, cakes, cookies once again and having them turn out instead of flop or turn into bricks.  Wish I had known about Better Batter when we first started on the gluten free diet.  That would have saved me time and money.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Flour mix I've tried
review/text: Since my daughter was diagnosed with celiac disease 8 months ago I have tried so many different flour blends - both the kind I purchase pre-made and many I have made myself following various recipe blends. There is NO COMPARISON.  This flour is by far the best I have used.  I have recreated my old gluten containing recipes using the flour as the substitute and recipes come out perfectly.  I thought I would never be able to do that again!  Importantly, I find the my recipes using this flour are moist whereas with everything else I've tried, the recipes didn't have the same moistness, they were often very dry.  I have had friends and family who eat gluten eat recipes I've made with this flour comment that they would have had no idea that the recipe was gluten free if I hadn't told them.  It is so nice to not have to try to mix flours to come up with the right combo.  I use this flour exclusively for any recipe that I'm converting from gluten containing to gluten free.

I used it cup for cup in my family recipes and so far everything has turned out great and taste. The only thing I fine is that the cook time is a bit longer than what it is with gluten flours, but this has been the trend with most gf products that I have cooked such as pasta. Besides using old family recipes I have also done the recipe that was on the box for Italian bread rolls and they were taste and not dry. My family uses them for buns, they work great

review/summary: Fantastic GF Flour!
review/text: I've tried a few flours (Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's, etc) and been ok with most of the results but it was never a first time success like the cookies we just made with Better Batter. They taste identical even though we changed the fat (from butter to palm shortening), milk (dairy to soy) and chocolate chips (diary free and 1/3 the size) as well as the flour.<br /><br />What I love even more than this flour is the company...seriously promise I don't work for them.  I called last week to find out more about purchasing at a discount (they have bulk discounts and greatly discounted auto ship options) and when I hung up the phone I had an entire page of notes.  They didn't just share options and help compare prices but they helped me better understand what changed were needed to recipes, come up with substitutions for going diary free (even explaining the controversy about palm shortening when offering it as a possibility), and really just help me know what to do to make it work best for me.  Later I got on their website to look at their recipes and discovered they not only post recipes but actively post within the comments to help others and answer questions.<br /><br />It is a crazy pricy flour when you're buying it a small bag at a time but they recently dropped their prices at their site and when you buy in a 25 pound bag it is much more affordable.<br /><br />CALL Better Batter if you have questions and I'd bet they'll really help!

review/text: I had to play around a little with the amounts as I had read you can substitute cup for cup in regular recipes to make it gluten free.  But I found that with my favorite muffins I needed to decrease the amount of flour by 1/4 cup and increase sugar by 1/4 cup and they are delicious.  Very light and fluffy!  I have made cookies and they tasted great.  You just have to let them cool completely on the pan or they fall apart.  I think that is par for the course though with GF cookies.  I am new to GF cooking so I'm still working on it but as a whole I think this is a great product as you don't have to stock 3-4 different types of flour and xantham gum in your pantry because it's all in Better Batter Flour!

Bobs Red Mill tastes bitter and leaves the aftertaste of the beans used in their mixture.  Pamelas brand for some strange reason always gives everyone horrible gas and bloating.  Just using finely ground white rice flour tastes the best, BUT is never the right texture and always falls apart - Better Batter is by far the Best Batter - HANDS DOWN!  Get it here and save - my local grocery stores carry it but for $3-$5 more for the 5lb box.

review/summary: Love this Product
review/text: I really like this product. It makes baking Gluten Free foods from regular recipes so much easier. I have used it for corn bread, puff pastries, cakes, custard, and breads. The only thing I can suggest is don't be afaraid to spice up your doughs and batters more to increase flavor. They can have a bland flavor without extra spice. Visit the manufactures website for tested recipes as well. I will continue to order this product.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Flour Mix out there!
review/text: My son & husband have Celiac Disease and I have tried nearly every premade flour mix out there. This is by far the best and easiest to use! While it does not work for every flour recipe, it definitely has worked for every gluten free recipe I've tried.<br /><br />The biggest thing I've learned about gluten free baking is that what one person may rave about another will hate. I would assume it is because of people like me, who does not have to eat gluten free. I may not like the taste of something where as my husband who has to eat gluten free may love it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend that you buy this flour if you must eat or bake gluten free. My biggest suggestion is that you try it out using gluten free recipes (they are all over the internet) and use it in replace of the "flour mix" and xantham gum that the recipe calls for. Their website has a bunch of good recipes, but I for sure have found better options out there. (mainly because a lot of their recipes on the website are made for multiple allergies, or vegan)

review/summary: Passable, in a pinch
review/text: I was really excited to try this flour after so many great reviews.  I've been baking gluten-free for over 2 years now and am at the point where I can make most things taste exactly like gluten items, but find that many recipes take quite a bit of adjustment and almost all get dry quickly.  I've gotten a bit tired of mixing flours and wanted to try a quick solution.  Anyway, as soon as my sample came in I made vegan cinnamon rolls from the recipe on the Better Batter website.  I immediately noticed a funky smell to the flour, which I think is from all the tapioca.  Now, the recipe came together beautifully, the consistency of the dough was perfect and I've never before gotten quite such perfect texture and rise in gluten-free breads.  That said, the tapioca taste is overwhelming!  Even my husband, who is not picky at all, had to force the first few bites.  After that the cinnamon does cover up the funky flour taste, but I could never feel confident serving something I made with this product to guests.  It has what I consider to be the distinctive "gluten-free taste" that you find in most processed gluten free foods.  This taste has always bothered me way more than texture issues.  I guess it's back to mixing my own mixes using Authentic Foods superfine flours.

review/summary: Not a 100% substitute
review/text: I ordered this because of the positive reviews here, and the description touting it as an almost 100% substitute for wheat flour.  It is not.  It is great for breading chicken breasts before sauteing, but has utterly failed in other applications.  I tried making crepe batter, which with wheat flour is very liquidy.  With this, I got a goopy mix resembling bread dough.  Even after doubling the liquid in the recipe the batter remained thick and doughy.  I also tried using this to make the dough for samosas, and again ended up with a thick goop, even after adding more water.<br /><br />It's possible this is a good batter for baking, as I haven't used the oven with it, but it definitely not a 100% substitute.

As soon as I felt the flour with my fingers (smooth and light), I knew it would be a good product.  I have made Carrot Cake Muffins, Molasses Cake, pancakes, peanut butter cookies, coffee cake.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: The first reason I tried this flour mix was because the cookbook Gluten Free On A Shoestring recommended it. The second reason was because it is very hard to find all the separate flours (like rice, potato, tapioca, etc) needed to make my own mix especially in the small town I live in. I also didn't want to spend $12 on a bag of xanthum gum. I have tried Bob's Red Mill mix which still requires the addition of xanthum gum and the results were ok. Everything I have made from Batter Batter is yummy and my family loved it! So far I've made french bread, pancakes, cookies, a cake, and noodles all with great texture and taste. I highly recommend this flour mix because of it's convenience and taste.

review/summary: Frustrating
review/text: I used this flour for a cobbler topping and it worked well with no alterations to the recipe (which was not gf).  So I was excited to try making pancakes with it this morning.  I used a recipe specific for gluten free pancakes and the mixture turned out like concrete.  I added more milk...and more milk...and then I ran out of regular milk and started adding almond milk...and more almond milk.  The recipe called for 1 cup of milk, I ended up using 3-4 cups and the consistency was still like a very thick pudding.<br /><br />That's the point at which I gave up.  I only narrowly avoided throwing the entire bowl of batter at the wall I was so frustrated (I'm so sick of the hit or miss nature of gf baking!!!!)<br /><br />I may buy the flour again but try figuring out weights instead of measurements.  I just wish it was possible to find a mix you could really use like wheat flour.

It is a great idea to make something gluten free...just needs more directions or recipes to go with it.

Lion's Blue Sky (my BF service dog) loves them.  Definitely recommend this seller; quick order turnaround & awesome quality, not to mention a huge savings over the retail pet shoppes.  We paid nearly twice as much at the local pet shoppe for cow ears half the size. That was when I check Amazon & was surprised to find them on line.  This will be our new best supplier! Since Sky is a big German Shepherd, you know she prefers the large cow ears for her evening snack.

My daughter started to get this rash around her mouth like she had eaten something with wheat in it. She had the rash for months and would complain about her stomache hurting. Everyone else in my family said it made their belly hurt, even the ones who arent gluten free and yes the bitter taste is bad.

review/summary: pretty hot
review/text: I bought this mainly to burn myself and it does the job. It's not really hot at first, but then the pain builds to the back of the throat and thats where it really feels like your mouth is suffering 3rd degree burns. I tasted it with the tiny spoon included first to be safe, and it was extremely hot considering the tiny amount. Then I licked about a half teaspoon off my hand and it burned for a good 10 minutes. The one problem is the taste, its not bad, but it has a strong chili powder flavor that can mask other flavors in food. Bottom line: This is a extremely spicy sauce that will last a year or two and is well worth the money.<br /><br />Oh... and MAKE SURE YOU WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER USING! I made the mistake of rubbing my eye and I thought I wad gonna go blind for a couple minutes... Also make sure you wash BEFORE the bathroom, I went per and it burned that area for 15 minutes..

review/summary: Liquid Magma in a Bottle!
review/text: After seeing a few youtube clips of people consuming this sauce, and being a pepperhead myself, I decided I had to order this stuff.  I was so thrilled to buy it and get it rushed to my door.  I eagerly awaited for the package to arrive.  Then the day came when it was mine.  I tore open the package and there it was, the evil little bottle itself, complete with silver bullet keychain attached.  I quickly noticed that inside the bullet is a tiny taste testing spoon.  I kind of giggled and figured what the hell, I gotta give this sauce a go.  I put a nice big dab on my finger, enough to cover the tip of my index finger and I licked the sauce off my finger.  Within seconds, I felt the heat coming.  It was insane, it was like someone lit a fire inside my mouth and some maniac was holding a blowtorch on my tongue and on the back of my throat.  I was sweating like crazy, I was panting like a dog on a 100 degree day that was locked inside a car with the windows rolled up.  Never could I ever have imagined how hot this sauce was.  The hottest I had recently tried was Quaker Steak and Lube's Atomic Sauce, and let me tell you, that stuff is mere steak sauce compared to this!  My stomach was killing me, I was on the ground holding my stomach and groaning!  Its beyond hot, its PAINFUL to eat.  Will I do it again?  YES!  Have I since?  Oh yeah.  Many times, just not that same amount.  Any insane hardcore pepperhead will appreciate this stuff, no matter how high your tolerance is.  And it makes a great gift for your hardcore pepperhead friends!

review/summary: Unique Flavor.  Brutal Burn
review/text: This is the real deal folks.  I had half a teaspoon full of this sauce on an empty stomach (big mistake) and for about 10 minutes I thought I was going to die.  Now I now what chili heads mean when they talk about an endorphin rush.  I've tried other sauces such as the regular Mad Dog 357 and Blair's Mega Death and never got this effect.<br /><br />Also the the flavor is a really unique tangy flavor that somewhat reminiscent of steak sauce or BBQ sauce.  Some people don't like it so much, I think it's because they're looking for a traditional hot sauce taste, but I think it's great.<br /><br />In the future I'll work up to this sauce a bit more gradually and only try it on a full stomach, but it's the first sauce I've tried that really delivers on the pain and suffering.<br /><br />Good stuff.

review/text: I bought this as a gag gift for a relative who claims to like spicy sauces but kept it fearing she might actually try it.  This stuff is HOT.  So hot that it will burn your skin if you get a drop on you.  (Be sure to wash your hands!)  HOT as hell.  It has a good burning taste to it but please try it out first.<br /><br />As an indicator, I like my Bloody Mary's spicy...very spicy.  I'll put 10 or more shakes of Tabasco "hot" habanero in a glass. If a drop spills on my hand I don't think twice about licking it off.  Don't do that with Mad Dog 357.<br />With 357, a tear-drop is enough for me. I'll put about four, maybe five, tear-drops in a pot of chili.<br /><br />It's good stuff but just be careful with it until you find your tolerance and preference.

review/summary: Nice but loses heat quickly
review/text: This is a very hot hot-sauce with a nice allspice presence.  In my opinion, there is so much vinegar that it detracts from the chili taste and the background spices.  When initially opened, this sauce was incredibly hot.  A table spoon of this sauce in a bowl of chili when first opened was over powering.  However, it appeared to lose this level of heat in just a few weeks in the fridge.  Now I put a dollop on a cracker with a slice of cheese and can eat those non-stop.  The heat level dropped below El Yucatan and way below 100% Pain, Melinda's XXX, etc.  One star off for too much vinegar and one star off for losing heat over time.

review/summary: Hot and tasty
review/text: There was a feeling of the unknown when venturing into tasting my first extreme hot sauce. The hottest chili I have yet to experience is known to be the Thai chili which has a 150k scoville rating. Bearable when eaten with food but the Thai chili still is pretty spicy on its own.  If you find hot sauces from Taco Bell (fire sauce) or Del Taco (del scorcho) hot, then don't even try this stuff.<br />This hot sauce is 4x the spiciness of a thai chili. Upon my first taste, I was expecting a burning sensation without anything else. The sauce is somewhat thick, so I tried to apply a drop to my delicious Mexican themed meal, specifically the burrito(not native to Mexico) and mix it around. Surprisingly, it had a distinct taste which was pleasurable followed by some heat. The heat was indeed intense, but not an unpleasing experience. My mouth burned in almost a masochistic way, painful yet pleasurable. Perhaps it was my own personal test of manhood. Never to a point where I felt it was too much. Soon after, there was a almost euphoric feeling of accomplishment. Your mind will challenge you to take another bite and experience it all over again. Alas, the cycle will start all over. Great stuff.<br /><br />WARNING:<br />While consuming Mad Dog 357 hot sauce, its not recommended to accompany it with beer unless you intend on getting drunk really fast. I found myself downing quite a lot of beer to cool my mouth.

review/summary: So Awesome!!
review/text: CAUTION: THIS IS SERIOUSLY HOT!!! NOT FOR NOOBS!! NOT FOR PRANKS!!<br /><br />If you want a quick endorphin rush, all you need is a drop or two of this. If you're going to do a tablespoon of it like on some YouTube videos, you will be brough to your knees within the customary 5 minutes just like them. I was afraid of it when I first opened the bottle. I dipped the very tip of a regular wooden toothpick in the cap and put it on my tongue - WHEW!! It just seems unreal how much heat you get off of that small of an amount. The second time I tried it I shook the bottle up and the sauce got all over the inside of the cap, so I rinsed it out at the kitchen faucet and the splattered sauce was making me caugh, similar to how onions make your eyes tear up.<br /><br />This is potent stuff! I love the BBQ flavor. Great single-squirt for a big pot of HOT chili. I would never want to run out of this.

review/text: I have been eating 10+ hot sauce for several years and decided I wanted to go hotter.  This is one hot sauce with a very distintive flavor.  It startes with a kind of sour citris flavor then slowly starts turning hot and it keeps getting hotter and hotter.  It's very thick so hard to get a small drop.  I can eat it but be careful the first time you try it just to make sure.  There are some hot sauces with a better flavor but this one isn't to bad compared to some others.  I am not looking for the next hotter sauce but my old 500,000 scovell unit sause isn't all that hot anymore but does taste a little better.

review/summary: Extremely hot!
review/text: If all you're looking for is a sauce that will burn your mouth off, this is the one. If you're looking for something to pour on your food, look somewhere else. The flavor isn't really awful, although there is a bit of a faint metallic taste to it. The real problem with putting a sauce like this on food is that it's just too hot. It will absolutely overpower anything you put it on.<br /><br />The little bullet/spoon keychain that comes with it is cool, but the links are pretty weak. I used it for a little while before they got a bit bent out of shape.<br /><br />There is one really great thing about extremely hot sauces, though (other than watching a friend run around while his eyes well up with tears after you talk him into eating a tablespoon of it). It's the feeling of euphoria you get once the initial rush of pain begins to fade. There's really nothing quite like it, and it's one of the main reasons people eat it even if they're not trying to show off their machismo.

review/summary: Hot and Brutal
review/text: This sauce is the hottest I've had so far.  Be very careful when pouring this, especially if you are coming from a sauce that is half the heat.<br /><br />Also, be careful of gut-rot.  The mouth can handle the heat, but when eating something very hot with the sauce, or when drinking a hot drink, or even on an empty stomach can bring the pain for hours and hours!

review/summary: It Stings!
review/text: I didnt purchase this on Amazon. However, i thought i would share my story as a survivor of the Mad Dog bite. Here is my account as posted on a blog site i use.<br /><br />So, a new store opened in the Gateway shopping district in downtown Salt Lake City recently called Hot Sauce & Things (at least, i think that's what it was called...my memory is a little shaky after....). Shelly and i wandered in there last Sunday out of curiosity and boredom. There were only three other people in the store....the employee, a nice Korean girl (comes into play later) and a young couple who had name tags from another store in the Gateway. Anyway, they were sitting at the bar which also functions as a checkout stand trying hot sauces. After a minute of browsing, i here the guy exclaim, "Ooh, that's HOT!". The employee was like "Yeah, I'm Korean, and i cant even eat more than a toothpick's (dipped in) worth. Ahhh....now my interest and curiosity were piqued.<br />The couple left without buying anything. Shelly and i had already grabbed a few promising sauces to try out at home. I walked up and asked the girl if we could try the last one the dude before us had tried. She said it was the hottest one sold. However, before you can try it, you have to build up to it. Thus began my journey through five continents and twenty four different hot sauces, ranging from the jalapeno based sauces, through the habanero based ones, and past the ghost pepper based sauces, to be greeted by my twenty fifth and final opponent, the Mad Dog 357 (complete with bullet holes and a whole list of caveats printed on the bottle. Let me just say, prior to that one, my mouth was already on fire and my insides were feeling a bit shaky. Afterwards.....well, lets just say i abhor even the thought of consuming milk, but quickly drank deeply of the chocolate milk they also sold there. I felt buzzed out and disoriented, like i had just left a bar in the new light of the morning sun after having sat in the dark and dank establishment all night. My heart was racing and my body felt like a balsa wood building try to stand against hurricane winds.<br />Needless to say, i bought a bottle, took it to work, and made every single person i work with try it (in many cases i tried it again with them). Word got out and for the next three days (including today), doctors, nurses and administrators all came down to try this now legendary hot sauce (i work in a hospital). Best dollars i ever spent!

review/summary: Hotter than regular Mad-dog
review/text: I have been using the regular mad-dog 357 sauce for a while and decided to start building my way to the really extreme hot sauces, like the "Da Bomb" or "The Source" sauces. I was a little skeptical on how much hotter this silver edition would be, comparing to the regular mad-dog.<br />I can tell you, it is really hotter. I used a single drop of this thing, as I usually did with the regular maddog on a bowl of chilly (about 2 cups of chilly) and I had to drink some milk aftwards to get the burning away. :-) hahahaha<br />Holly cow, really good sauce, burns like hell. Be aware and go slow so you don't get hurt.<br />I will have to dig on it and build my tolerance a bit before I even think on moving to the next level, "DA BOMB" hot sauce.

review/summary: They give you the bullet for a reason
review/text: This sauce is hot. Tip of a needle is enough to do it for 10-20 minutes.<br />I find its nice to spread it a bit on steak or any kind of meat or to mix it with A1, spicy chili sauce, or any sauce.<br />Just a little, gives the food some life. It has some taste, but given how hot it is and how little you need, it doesn't matter.<br /><br />The product description is wrong though, it is not 600,000. It is 750,000, which I think is better.<br /><br />If you like extremely spicy, but not lethal food, this is good for you.

review/summary: Blew my head off!!
review/text: This silver collectors edition is really cool. You get a bullet which actually twists open to reveal a tiny little spoon to eat the sauce with. And good thing it's micro sized because anymore than that well your basically screwed. Being the chilli head I am I took one of those little egg spoons and filled that up. That would be a fairly good finger tip amount, way more than the spoon they give you. I ate it, licked the spoon clean and whoa great balls of fire! After a few min it got even hotter and I felt dizzy and my ears hurt a little. What a rush that was, my stomach killed me later so I will never do anything like that amount ever again, well maybe, lol.<br /><br />This sauce is worth the money. The taste ain't too bad either for a powerful extract sauce. But what's to really taste, it just one big burn.

review/text: This stuff does not mess around.  I just had some at Firehouse Subs and I'm pretty sure it's the hottest sauce I've ever had.  But, it was good.

review/summary: One of the hottest and best tasting
review/text: One of the hottest extract sauces I have tried, not as hot as Da' Bomb Ground Zero, similar to Blair's Zakk Wylde (Berserker Shot to Hell).  Hotter than Dave's. A size of a pea is all you need on a chip.  A VERY sweet sauce, wish I could use more of it for more flavor.  A small drop in your food and you will be able to taste it, the flavor does not get drowned out easily.  1 bottle will probably last you your entire life.
