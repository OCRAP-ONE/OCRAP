review/summary: My daughter loves it
review/text: My 16 month old hates milk.  She did very well on Enfamil Gentleease, so once she turned one, I tried weaning her off of that by mixing it with whole milk, adding more milk and less formula gradually.  Well, she was miserable.  So, I saw this at Target and gave it a try.  She actually claps her hands when I give her this in a sippy cup! I wonder why it is so much cheaper than regular Enfamil, which is at least $26 for the same sized container.  The ingredients are almost identical with the exception of more calcium in this toddler formula.  I will give it to her for a while longer as it contains tons of vitamins, etc. I am glad to find it here with two day free shipping so I don't have to go to Target and risk spending an additonal $150 impulsively!

review/summary: Finally! Milk he will drink!
review/text: We were having problem switching our son from his Enfamil Gentlelease to whole milk. When Emfamil sent us samples of the Enfagrow regular, we gave that a tried and our son totally refuse to drink any of it. That got us worried, so we tried different brands of whole milk, different favors, add juice in the milk, still getting nowhere. Finally, we threw our hands up and decided to take the $5 Emfamil coupon (came along with the enfagrow samples) to get the Enfagrow Gentlelease. We were still afraid it may be a waste of money to get it, but after throwing so much money down the drain with the other whole milks, we were desperate to give anything a try.<br /><br />Here are the details I noticed when I compared the two.<br /><br />Calories per 5 fl oz are the same for both Enfamil Gentlelease and Enfagrow Gentlelease: 100 Calories.<br /><br />Nutrients:<br />Both Enfamil Gentlelease and Enfagrow Gentlelease has the same nutrients in grams, with very negligible different in carbohydrate and water.<br /><br />Vitamins:<br />They are the same.<br /><br />Minerals:<br />Here is where I see the changes from Enfamil Gentlelease to Enfagrow Gentlelease.<br />Most notable are,<br />Calcium - From 82mg to 195mg<br />Phosphorus - From 46mg to 130mg<br />There are only slight increases in Sodium, Potassium and Chloride.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />-Enfagrow Gentlelease has extra two ingredients of Calcium Phosphate and Potassium Iodide,<br />-Instead of Calcium Carbonate and Calcium Phosphate in Enfamil Gentlelease, it is replaced with Calcium Chloride in Enfagrow Gentlelease.<br /><br />Taste test(?!):<br />Me: I figured since most of the ingredients are the same, there shouldn't be much difference in the taste. Sure enough, there wasn't except there is a slight drier after taste in the Enfagrow Gentlelease.<br />Son: He drank the whole thing! So relieved.<br /><br />Overall, we are extremely happy he would drink the Enfagrow Gentlelease. We would have prefered the Enfagrow over regular whole milk anyway, because of all the vitamins and DHA in it.

review/summary: Excellent option for milk sensitive toddlers
review/text: I am a little amused by the reviews citing the bad taste. If your toddler is used to milk, there are other options out these for milk based toddler formula that you should probably try first.<br />The Gentlease line is for sensitive babies and contains partially broken down proteins to aid with digestion of milk. It does taste different, but for babies that had milk allergies and are used to the disgusting taste of Nutramigen/ Alimentum and similar hypo-allergic baby formula this is really a big step up. My baby was on very expensive formula because of her allergy and even though she is better now at 20 months will still react to normal formula. She cannot drink cows milk, and we've tried goats milk, soy milk, rice milk, almond milk .... she refused them all. I was in despair till I came across the Gentlease toddler - She loves it, does not react to it, and gets more nutrition than she would with any of the other options. It is also so much cheaper than what we've been spending to date.<br /><br />This may not be for every toddler, but was the perfect option for us.

review/summary: Worst tasting stuff!
review/text: I bought this formula for my daughter. She has never been picky, and has been on Enfamil formula since she was 6 months old. I tried this toddler formula because she was having some gas pain issues. I made her a bottle and she took one sip and spit it out on the floor. I thought that maybe I had made it wrong so I made another bottle, and she took a sip and threw up. I then tried a sip myself to see what the problem was, and I gagged and had to spit it in the sink. This stuff is so bitter and gross. I can not believe that a company like Enfamil would make such a horrible product. I am really upset I spent the extra money on this stuff and should have stuck to her regular formula. Do not buy this until you try it with your baby first!

review/summary: Gag! So nasty!
review/text: I bought this since it was on sale. Prior to this I've used regular Enfamil Powder and tried Enfagrow Regular. I offered my baby a bottle of Gentlease and she would not take it. I tried again the next day and realized she had refused it 2 days in a row. It remembered that this was new formula. I tasted the formula that was in her bottle and immediately spit it out. This stuff tastes simply horrid! It tasted bitter and very strange! No wonder she didn't want it! I had to go out at 9PM and buy her some regular Enfamil so she could have a bottle. Is this a fluke? I mean, I can't imagine any poor baby eating this stuff. It tasted just awful! So now I have a full container of $20 formula that I won't dare use or give away. Avoid it. My oldest daughter had issues with regular formula so I used Alimentum by Similac and she was fine with it.

review/summary: Enfagrow Gentlease Toddler
review/text: I'm very happy with this formula.  My son had slow weight gain and had not been on the growth chart since he was 4 months old.  I breastfed him, but at 1 year the pediatrician said to supplement with formula.  We tried various types of formula, but they all immediately soured in my son's stomach and were spit up within minutes.  I'm so thankful that we discovered this formula because not only does he love it, he also keeps it down and has gained 3 pounds in 2 months.  It's gentle enough for his stomach but contains the extra calcium and nutrients that a toddler needs in a formula.  I'm taking away one star because it smells a bit unpleasant.  The baby loves it, however.

review/summary: If your child has milk allergies, this is for you!!
review/text: My son was on Similac Alimentum due to milk protein allergies, now that he's 1 yr old he is still allergic to milk(including goat milk) and other dairy products.  This worked perfectly!  He didn't seem to notice the switch from the alimentum(which also smells/tastes weird) so we were very grateful that this worked out on the first try!  Thank goodness for this otherwise we don't know what we would do.  Hopefully he outgrowns his milk allergy by the time he's 3 years old.  I highly recommend this for children/babies with allergies.

review/summary: Long history short: Taste ugly
review/text: I have to confess that I buy products base on reviews and I don't do my own homework to return the favor. This time I think I should warn other people about this product. My baby grew up to toddler drinking formula since he was 6 months old. We tried several brands until we landed in one that it is not Enfamil and I will not mention for the sake of the credibiliy of this review.<br />We wanted to keep with the nutrition supplements that baby formulas provide to my toddler and Enfagrow provided a good option. The issue, the major issue, is that it simple taste ugly. Adults may tell you that any baby food will taste ugly anyway, but me and my toddler agreed that bitterness, and awful taste is the best describer for this product. It has been such a "shock" that he does not drink anything that looks like milk anymore. So, save your time and money, if your toddler already knows the taste of real milk, he/she will just pull this one away. Now, I have to mix milk with other things to try to make him like it again. About the nutrients..well I am still searching for a better alternative or at least with better taste, what is the point of having all those nutrients in this powder milk when the baby will not drink it...just a thought

review/summary: did not sit well with my baby
review/text: after the 12 mo mark I decided to change from Enfamil Gentlease 0-12 mo formula to Enfagrow Gentlease, but this did not sit well with my baby. He seemed to get an upset stomach much easier, so I acutally discontinued using it and started giving him whole milk, which he has accepted MUCH better (amazing but so!).  Not worth it to use this stage 2 formula, or any in my opinion.  After a baby turns one, he/she is able to tolerate more than we give them credit for!

review/summary: Is it Rapadura?
review/text: This review is some research about whether or not this product is actually rapadura.  Although this product is indexed under "rapadura," which is a Portuguese name for dried sugar cane juice, this company (Rapunzel) used to sell a product that is specifically labeled "Rapadura" (see below; also Google "rapadura" for more info).  In researching whole cane sugar, brown sugar, and sugarcane, etc., on Wikipedia, "rapadura" is the name used in Brazil, Argentina, some other South and Latin American countries and the Caribbean, whereas "panela" is used in Columbia, "piloncillo" is used in Mexico, and "jaggery" is used in India for what appears to be identical products--unrefined, dried, natural sugar from sugar cane, minimally processed, with all the natural vitamins and minerals still intact.  From the pictures I've seen on Wikipedia and other websites, "organic cane sugar" is quite a bit lighter in color than rapadura, panela, jaggery, etc., suggesting that is has be refined to some degree, like adding calcium carbonate to remove some so-called impurities.<br /><br />From Wikipedia entry for "Rapadura:" "Despite the fact that rapadura is a very old foodstuff, predating even the colonization of Brazil, a German company called Rapunzel has registered the name as a German trade mark DE 1143537, an event that has greatly angered Brazilians, as they see the name as a generic all-purpose word, like 'lemonade' or 'sandwich'....  As of February 2009, Rapunzel has removed the Rapadura name from their unrefined and unbleached whole cane sugar product sold in health food stores, though their website has not yet been updated to reflect this."

review/summary: Great raw sugar!
review/text: This sugar has been a great replacement for white sugar, and overall I like it better than any other "natural" sugar that I've tried.  I have used it for baking and in my coffee.<br /><br />The sugar has the texture of soft round sand, the grains differ in size from fine powder to large grains similar to "Sugar in the Raw" brand, but are opaque.  I first tried it plain, and it had a slightly chalky/dry and faint molassas flavor but much more sweet than bitter.  So yes it is different than cane sugar.  However, when I use it in my coffee and in baking, it has a smooth flavor similar to brown sugar but not ever cringingly sweet like white sugar. I try to stay away from refined sugar, but of course whenever I have too much of the white stuff, I get that sugar high and then a sugar hangover - fidgity, slight headache, etc.  With Rapadura sugar, I never get that feeling, it only gives me a nice perk while taking the bitterness out of my morning coffee and lending a mellow earthy sweetness to cookies and cakes.<br /><br />All in all, I love it!  Hope this review helps.

review/summary: Trio is my favorite snack/energy bar
review/text: Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.  I love them.  They come in four flavors.  Strawberry is second only to blueberry for my favorite of those flavors; the strawberry ones, like the blueberry ones seem a little sweeter but the sugars content is the same so it may just be my imagination.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the "glue" that holds all the other ingredients together.  Dried strawberries are the third fruit in the strawberry flavor.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is "good" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: Taste/Texture: Like a Payday for grownups was my first thought eating this bar.  The nuts certainly take center stage and everything else is there to support it and transform it into a magical snack.  The cane juice and sea salt provides that fantastic salty/sweet combination.  I love the texture of this bar, it's crunchy without being too hard (it's also good that it forces you to chew instead of just inhale your food).  If you're curious about the fruit, I got the strawberry and it's more of a subtle flavor, definitely not in your face (yummy taste though), and I did taste a raisin, but only when I broke it apart and ate it slowly, have not noticed a date, so the other reviewer may be correct about it being part of the glue.<br /><br />Nutrition: This has a higher fat content than most bars, but that is because I'm really not kidding when I say this bar is wonderfully made up of nuts, so it's the kind of fat doctors tell you to eat.  I'm not kidding when I say this bar is sooo good and half easily fills me up when I'm just looking for something to tide me over.<br /><br />Bottom line, I bought this bar because it had a great price (subscribe and save plus an extra 25% off?  amazing), but I will keep buying because it has a FANTASTIC taste, which is so rare in these items.

At the auto-deliver price, they work out to around $.80 per bar or so, which I think is very reasonable. I'm happy to have a "good fat" snack in the house for us to eat, instead of resorting to chips, candy bars, etc. I did counsel my family that they can only have one per day, as while they're good fat, they should still be eaten in moderation. :) Anyways - they're delicious!

The box says: vegan/no trans fat/no additives/no preservatives/no cholesterol/gluten free/diary free/wheat free/non-GMO/kosher and product of China (that worries me more than a little).

Yummy flavor, can taste the nuts and strawberries, not too sweet for most people, certainly a lot less sweet than any other granola/snack/breakfast/protein type bar we've tried. Wish they were bigger, pretty small. Otherwise, very good bars.

Everyone in my family thought they were too sticky and a little messy but they're perfect for me as part of breakfast or an afternoon snack.  A little easier than trying to portion out my own cashews or pistachios.  Their simple ingredient list was what drew me to purchasing them and I recommend them to everyone I know!

review/text: I have 5 cats and one is especially spoiled, even for a housecat. This is what he actually cries for when I'm out. Only K-Mart here in town carries it anymore, and I hate K-Mart. The fact that I order it online here says something. One of my cats is very fat but she always has been. The others are average weight and don't throw up from this like they do some other brands. Maybe it's not as supposedly healthy, I don't know, but they refuse to eat Iams or ONE.

review/summary: Garbage - this will make your cat sick!
review/text: This cat food is terrible for cats.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the nice handled pail it comes in.  I throw out the food and reuse the pail for for a paint bucket.  Seriously look at the ingredients.  If the food coloring and preservatives dont stop you in your tracks look at how much quality meat goes into this....none.  I fed this to my 2 cats over a year.  The female got extremely fat and fur came out in clumps.  The male which was only 2 years old got sent to the animal hospital with urinary tract blockage.  The hospital bill was $1500 to save the cat.  Moral of the story... spend a little more for quality food like EVO or CORE and save way more by having healthy cats.  There is no doubt that this food and others like it is inappropriate to feed cats and will cause all sorts of maladies over time.

review/summary: Not the Same if You Purchased this Brand in Mexico
review/text: I was on a cruise a few years back and bought a bottle of the Mexican Vanilla Totonacs in Cozumel. I have to admit that it was the best vanilla I have ever had. Used it for baking mostly. Finally running low and had been looking to replace it for about a year. Contacted the company directly and was told their export agent would contact me. Never heard anything. Decided to search web again and was surprised to see Amazon was now selling it.<br />For those that have bought this brand in Mexico and are looking to buy more, this is not the same vanilla!! Might be same company but not nearly as good as the product I got in Cozumel. Much thinner and not as much flavor. I am sure the FDA has a lot to do with it. My rating above reflects this. For those that haven't tried the original, you might love this product. But if you have, you will disappointed in this product as I was.

I was upset when I found myself getting low.  I couldn't believe it when I found it on Amazon!  I was hesitant to buy it since the last reviewer said it was not the same as what was purchased in Mexico.  That statement is simply false.  My husband and I did a side-by-side comparison with taste, smell and colour.  They are exactly the same.<br /><br />To sum it up.  Simply the best vanilla that we've found to date!

review/text: Most markets in my area sell vanilla in 2oz or 4oz and the most popular cost almost $4 for the 2oz. I bake a lot and found a good extract sold in 8oz bottles for $11 when on sale. It was time for a new bottle and I decided to see if there was a better bargin. I saw this Mexican Totonacs offered in 1 litre and, to add shipping, cost about 72 cents an ounce. I decided to try it considering there were so many positive reviews and was nervous about the purchase until I made my first batch of chocolate chip cookies. The aroma was like 50 years ago for me and the flavor left me wanting nothing.

I don't know why, I don't know how.<br /><br />I'm just elated you don't have to travel all the way to Mexico any more to get ya' some, but even if you did, it'd be well worth the trip, even if that was the only reason you went there  ;-)<br /><br />For real, get some of dat yummy, delicious vanilla juice.<br /><br />Ok I know this sounds a bit colloquial, but the point is it doesn't have to be "gourmet" to be gourmet!!!  So don't miss out by turning up your nose to it's origin, simple packaging, plastic pottle or reasonable price, although if you do go to Mexico you can practically get it for song on the corner, I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />I think you get my point, so now you're just going to get some vanilla right?

I bake two to three times a week for my baking business.  When I was all out, I went to Amazon.com and found that I could purchase it on line.  I was excited and bought the 32oz bottle, at a resonable price also. It is by far the best vanilla I have ever used for baking.  You can immediately smell the vanilla every time you open the jar.  It has made a difference in my baking and I would not use another kind.  I am hooked on this Mexican Vanilla Totanacs for ever!

review/summary: Excellent Pure Mexican Vanilla - takes your recipes to a higher level!
review/text: I've been using Totonacs Pure Mexican Vanilla for about two years. I now exclusively use Totonacs vanilla. The vanilla has a smooth, "real", rich vanilla taste. My frostings, cookies, ice cream, cakes, whipped cream, and custards taste excellent with this vanilla. I receive many compliments on the taste of my desserts when using Totonacs vanilla. I used imitation vanilla in a few of my recipes when I ran out of the Totonacs - my cookies, frosting, and whipped cream tasted "yucky" to me and my family. So, fair warning - once you use Totonacs, you won't want to go back to using imitation or inferior quality vanillas again. This vanilla definitely improves the flavor of your recipes and gives your recipes a gourmet, smooth, wonderful vanilla flavor. Oh, it also keeps its flavor/integrity for a long time. Totancs vanilla is worth every penny.

Since I have used this Vanilla extract before, I was delighted to find  and ordered it immediately.

review/text: The price was right; a bulk order is convenient rather than purchasing small portions. Accomodations to flavor must be made. It is not like any other vanilla I have used. It did not have an essence that I am accustomed to. Has an odd 'after taste' and baking results are different. This may well be due to my limited culinary experience. I would like to offer an A+ to the vendor as I let them know and they very graciously and promptly made ammendments for this persnickety buyer.

review/text: We purchased this on-line because we were trying to find 100% pure vanilla (bought it in Mexico). The label says 100% pure vanilla but it is not. It does contain some alcohol which their claim to be 100% pure is a lie. The 100% pure vanilla we purchased in Mexico was exactly that 100% pure. The vanilla is good but not the same and I am still bothered by the fact that they can claim 100% pure legally when it is not. For this reason I probably will not buy vanilla again on-line.

review/text: I am not pleased with this seller at all. I have done business at Amazon on multiple occasions, and have always been pleased, if not down-right delighted with the whole process, but this most recent transaction, the purchase of the Mexican Vanilla Totonacs has me extemely, shall we say wary, therefor I must make people aware, as well as Amazon.com.<br />I made my purchase last night (Tues. 27th) and today, at 1:29p.m. I received a call from my financial institution for possible fraudulent charges on my account. Less than 18 hours from my transaction, to the time my CU had to put a fraud notice on that account. In the 25 minutes it took me to drive into town to get to my CU, another charge had been attempted on it.<br />My recommendation is to not do any business with this company until it's sorted out, since I've never had problems with Amazon before this experience. Amazon, you may want to verify this group with whom you're doing business, and warn your other customers.

review/text: I am torn on this product because my dog LOVES it and it keeps her occupied for hours, but it is really smelly. Worse then any bully sticks I have bought. It makes her smell but it also makes the whole room smell and it doesn't go away. I let her have this one I bought until she finished but I am not sure I want to buy another one.

review/summary: Smells and doesn't last
review/text: Lasted exactly 56 minutes with my EM puppy and smelled like manure the entire time. It was "odor free" as advertised until she started chewing, then it smelled like we were sitting  next to a dairy farm. My puppy loved it, but I'll stick to pork femurs.

review/summary: I like the taste
review/text: This A. Jones is so wrong on just about everything they have said and does not seam to have a very good command of the English language. First This product does not require refrigeration nor does the Labeling call for it to be refrigerated. Furthermore coconut oil does not need to be kept in the refrigerator. In the Philippines and other tropical climates, where the ambient air temperature is much higher than North America, people traditionally have not refrigerated coconut oil. Virgin Coconut oil is very stable since it is unrefined and mostly saturated. The expiration dates on my Virgin Coconut Oil is in two years.<br />alot of great answers about coconut oil can be found here http://www.tropicaltraditions.com/faq.htm#4

review/summary: Great product, over priced
review/text: Just purchased this product, for half this price at the local Walmart. It melts in hand to a thin oil consistency which is great for moisturizing. It had a light coconut smell, but nothing too overpowering. I came on to Amazon to see if I could get a better price for buying in bulk and was shocked to see the price almost doubled on here for the 12oz container. Do yourself a favor, pay half the price and no shipping and get it local.

review/text: I do not know what A. Jones is talking about. I have been using coconut oil for over three years and have never stored it in the frig. Coconut oil is not milk it does not need to be stored there. Coconut oil is solid below 75 degrees. I buy my coconut oil at from Vitacost 54 oz for $21.00. Everything I have read is it will last 2-3 years. I use it everyday for cooking, a 54 oz bottle lasts me about 2 months so, I use it up way before it could ever go bad. LOL.

review/summary: I saw it in Walmart
review/text: I was told it is not really good for you, yea there is a lot different cocount oils you can shopping and you have to be carefully . Ask the owner there if it is really extra virgin that didn't sit all thru days. YOU ARE EATING COCOUNT OIL AND YOU DON't want NOTHING THAT IS SPOILED OR SITTING ALL TIMES? I saw it in walmart I was going buy it for a lot different purposes but someone told me it been sitting on shelf meaning if store is closed at 12pm , they will not get new cocount oil replacing it or refridge it. It just sitting there all day , it was supposed to be refridged so you can eat. It is just like a milk that is supposed be in refridge! You see some stores having milk on shelf, it is likely to spoil faster than ones in refridge?<br /><br />I did a researching and I found out I was not supposed buy milk that store keep on shelf, it spoils faster no matter if I keep in freezer or refridge. It just drives temptaures crazy. If you buy milk from refridges , it will get used to temp. It is same with cocount oil (unrefined).<br /><br />It really doesn't matter if you buy organic or extra virgin ...organic is similar to extra virgin for real! I found out in research because both of them means they have not been in heat process to change. Ppl just wanna sell and rip you off / extra charge when saying it ain't extra virgin.<br /><br />You will know it is , when it only is making with cocount no additional such as preservational.<br /><br />I wanna warn you this seller is ripping u off, it is NOT $15! I remember it is only 5 or 10 dollars.

review/summary: Spicy!
review/text: This ginger beer may not be to everyone's taste, but for those who like theirs spicy and not fruity, this is the only one. If you inhale through your nose right after pouring the ginger will sizzle your sinuses. For me, this is the only ginger beer I ever get, and it's kind of hard to find. It makes a *perfect* dark and stormy when mixed with Gosling's or Kraken rum and a squeeze of lime. Without the rum to cut it, it can be a bit biting. Yes, that's right, it's better when you cut it with booze. That's how snappy it is.

review/summary: Really Good Sugar Free Candies - Recommended!
review/text: Being diabetic, I am always on the watch for sugar free snacks. The "Jolly Rancher Sugar Free Hard Candies" are a great addition to my snaking list.<br /><br />At only 35 calories and 0 Net Carbs for 4 pieces, these do not impact my blood sugar levels or ruin my diet. They are slightly less sweet than regular candies, but do not seem to cause the "laxative" effect other dietetic candies can have.<br /><br />Highly recommended! I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HTYIES">GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free Candy, Just Chocolates Hard Candy, 4-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>

But after only two servings (8 pieces/ 70 calories) I experienced horrible side effects.<br /><br />I was not positive they were the cause so I tried them on three separate occasions and had the same results.<br /><br />Perhaps different people respond differently but I can certainly attest to the nasty side effects based on my own experience.

review/text: The BEST and most reasonable brownie mix on Amazon, plus I've ordered it at least 4 times from this site (I do a LOT of brownie baking during the holidays...!) and have NEVER been disappointed...so I'm giving it 5 stars...<br /><br />I make what I call "deep dish" brownies...I use a 10 x 15 inch pan instead of the standard 9 x 13 and I double up on the brownie mix...TWO boxes per batch...to make a VERY thick and fudgy brownie that my nieces and nephews LOVE at the holidays...if you want to try it, I suggest using 5 eggs for each batch (instead of the 2 eggs per box x 2 boxes = 4 eggs...what the manufacturer recommends) and lining the pan with Reynolds Non-Stick Parchment/Foil (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0068TZUXO">Reynolds Wrap Non-stick Pan Lining Paper - 30 Sq. Ft, 1 Each</a>)...you will LOVE the outcome...<br /><br />...and a few other hints to please your brownie customers...try a batch or two mixed with candy...I've done M&M's (plain AND peanut), Reese's Pieces, and even several kinds of whole Hershey's Kisses mixed in...I've used regular Kisses, the caramel-filled Kisses, and even the coconut creme-filled Kisses (my personal favorite)...forget those brownie mixes that claim they have "chocolate chunks" in them...if you WANT chocolate chunks in your brownies, put 'em in yourself..!

I also frequenlty make these for staff when I need something quick for the next day at work. They are always a hit.  And who doesn't have 2 eggs and a half-cup of oil at all times?<br /><br />While I have a recipe for homemade brownies using butter and cocoa etc., that takes a bit more time to plan and bake and clean up.  I love that these brownies can be made in about 35 minutes (with pre-heating) and otherwise without thinking too hard...  And everyone loves the taste.  In short:  Highly recommended.

review/text: I wanted to try this style cheese just to see what the fuss is all about on those cooking shows. I had bought super market deli Parmesan for years but it always tasted a bit flat to me. Just not exciting. Anyway I splurged, I'm an old guy and simply wanted to at least have tried the "good" stuff at least once. I typically use the cheese grated or shaved on salads or pasta. I was amazed this stuff is too good to waste on pasta or salads, It needs to be eaten freshly cut from the piece with sliced raw apple or pear. It's to be savored slowly and with concentration. It is simply the best I've ever had, anywhere. I will use it on my salads and pasta but I will never be able to go back to the impersonators. Just for information the seller A. G. Ferrari Foods was perfect also but the cheese overshadows all else.

review/text: This Parmesan is far better than any I have found in any US deli!  It was the favorite on a cheese tray which included some fine cheeses from France,Italy, and the US. We have also enjoyed it shaved on top of a green salad dressed with toasted walnut oil.  (We call this "Amazon Salad" because of where we got the two starring ingredients.) We really enjoy it grated and mixed with butter and hot thin spaghetti.  When my conscience bothers me, I switch to wole grain pasta!<br /><br />Kudos to the seller.  The cheese was very well-packed and we were informed by e-mail when the order was shipped, when it was due to arrive, and even after  it had been delivered to our front door! We will surely order this again.

"We guarantee that our fields are free from synthetic chemicals  and fertilizers, and all ingredients are Non-GMO."<br />  Ingredients are listed as follows:<br />  Organic cane sugar<br />  Organic dutch-process cocoa powder<br />  Natural malt flavor<br />  Soy lecithin<br />  Organic maltodextrin<br />  Salt<br />  Natural vanilla flavor<br />  This works out to 16 servings per container<br />  100 calories per 2-tablespoon serving<br />  22.9 grams carbohydrate per serving<br />  0.8 gram fat per serving,<br />  0 transfat<br />  0.0 (Zero) Cholesterol<br />  10.8 milligrams sodium per serving (low)<br />  0.8 gram protein<br />Allergens: soy.  ...gluten in this product.<br /><br />Thought and effort have gone into producing  this cocoa mix which can be  used lactose-free if you have a milk substitute you want to add.  Lots to appreciate in this product. I have 2 questions:<br />  A) what is organic maltodextrin?  Is it derived chemically from organic corn?  Perhaps someone can tell me in a comment.<br />  B) where is the inner seal under the very nifty plastic lid?  There is indeed an exterior plastic band that holds the lid in place til you open the container.  Since the product already involves so much effort --organic is effort, as you know--perhaps the manufacturer or distributor could add an inner seal.  If you are successful in reaching the website or a phone number for this, please let me know in a comment. Website and phone numbers are on the container,  but my efforts to reach were not successful. Wanted to make the suggestion.<br />  And yes,  I've been enjoying cocoa made with this product for about a month, am just about to open my third can of this four-pack, have drunk the rest and I'm still here.  Would feel better about it with an inner seal. With an inner seal in place, it would rate  five stars.  What do you think?

review/summary: Good ingredients, but much too sweet.
review/text: I was excited to try this product, as it contained much better ingredients than the usual processed hot-chocolate mix stuff. Although the subtle mint flavors are a lovely addition, I just can't drink it! I get about 1/4 through my mug before I have to toss it. Too bad. I will have to try toning down the sweetness by cutting it with some 100% pure cacao powder.

review/summary: Sadly, these are no longer oil-free...
review/text: Unfortunately for us "Engine 2 Diet" fans, the ingredients list has changed on these chips as of September 2009, and they now contain expeller pressed (canola, safflower or sunflower) oil. I hope to save someone else the mistake I just made in buying a pack of 12.<br /><br />Fortunately I don't have pre-existing heart disease that I know of, but if you're strictly following Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's program in "Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure", DON'T buy these chips, they're not what they used to be (which was just organic yellow corn and lime).

review/summary: These chips are really tasty and healthy, too!
review/text: I used to be able to buy these chips at Whole Foods but it seems they don't carry them any more.  These chips are one of the few chip products I have found that are both low salt and low fat.  So I am glad that I am still able to by them online.  I highly recommend them for anyone looking for healthy snacks.

review/summary: Not as anticipated, but I like them anyway.
review/text: Hi. I had to amend a previous review for this item because I only gave it 2 stars back in July 27, 2009.<br /><br />I've decided to give the chips another try, and after eating them for about a month now. I'm used to the taste now. Because of a few health issues I had to change my entire diet around by incorporating more low sodium or salt free items. I've noticed that since doing this I can actually taste the flavor in these chips. I can taste the corn and it's really good. I also like eating them with homemade salsa. That gives them a extra bit of kick while adding flavor and texture.<br /><br />So since I couldn't adjust my star rating from 2 to 4 I just deleted my previous comment altogether. These aren't for people who are use to a ton of sodium in their snack treats, but give them a chance and help your heart while you're doing this.

review/summary: damaged goods
review/text: the shipment must have had a very rough ride to my house as when it arrived every one of the bags were shaking down into a little ball . and the first 2 bags that I opened about 2 thirds of the chips were shattered . I communicated this to the vendor and they offered to credit 2 thirds of 2 bags.  I've been explained it was every bag in the shipment past 12 bags and they refused credit 2 thirds of 12 bags . I simply wanted a replacement of all 10 remaining bags and they said that they can only make a credit of the 2 bags . I am very dissatisfied .

review/summary: Great tasting, but not as hot as other Dave's Gourmet foods
review/text: I read about Dave's Gourmet foods in an issue of Inc. Magazine and I immediately wanted to try their products. While their various hot sauces are dead on for any spicy hot freak, I think the nuts could use a little more umph. They are great tasting and super fun for parties though!
