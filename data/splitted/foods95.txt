review/summary: BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so "addictive." My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is "decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods." So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]

review/summary: Dogswell Happy Hips - Made in China
review/text: I had bought this product last year my dog loved them, but... I subscribe to a couple of Bichon Frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from China I threw out what I had left for the outside critters in the forest.  I called Dogswell today and they verified that even though they say U.S. on them they are still coming from China.

review/summary: Made in China! My dog got very sick...
review/text: Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite "except" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still "Made in China" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again.

review/summary: reommend you avoid chinese sourced food products for your pet
review/text: These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients.

review/text: We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice.

review/text: I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp

review/summary: Causes diarrhea and vomiting!! Do not buy!
review/text: I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all!

review/summary: My dog feels better!
review/text: I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck breast (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a "subscription" status to save a little more money.  At roughly $20/month for us, it is well worth the "investment" - it just plain made him feel better!

review/text: Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.

review/summary: Made in China? Not feeding THIS anymore!
review/text: Up until now, I believed I was feeding my dogs a healthful treat that was good for them. Of note: the glucosamine and chondroitin content in these jerky treats is of the highest I've seen in a treat that they actually "like" and look forward to having. I was feeding these as a daily joint supplement to my poodle in particular who, as of late, had been experiencing more joint issues after a traumatic hip injury years earlier.<br /><br />Thanks to the savvy poster who brought to light this product is now being produced in China. Costco sells jerky treats made in China as well, and I no longer purchase those and warn my clients about purchasing them too. Only made in the USA and USDA inspected, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Why oh why can't pet owners find a decently priced, trustworthy jerky treat for our pets that is A. High in glucosamine and B. Isn't manufactured in China? Being that China has shown little diligence with regards to creating a child's toy that isn't later involved in a recall, I'm certainly not about to give any credence to something that will be ingested by my pets. I'm tossing the rest of these treats in the trash!<br /><br />No. Thank. You.

The treat was too tough and stringy for my small female Westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting.  I order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the 6 bags.

review/summary: Not Sure
review/text: My Shih Tzu loved these and I have been giving him these duck treats off and on for the past two years with no obvious problem even though they are made in China. Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something. Not going to take any more chances with this brand.

They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!  Do your research and read every label CLOSELY as they really try and fool you with the fine print.

review/summary: CAUTION!!!!
review/text: I've been buying Dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years. She's always loved them. The most recent time I purchased them, however, she got seriously ill, with heavy vomiting and lethargy. I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china. I find that pretty incredulous, considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range. Definately beware!

review/summary: Dog went Crazy - Neighbor Dog Wants to Move In - These are Disgusting!!!!
review/text: Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other "flavors" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like "beef jerky" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon's prices and delivery can't be beat.

review/summary: Warning: May Be Addictive
review/text: My dog absolutely loves these treats. We have tried many treats since we have had her, and she has never loved any of them as much as she loves these. When she is done eating one, she will stalk the bag and try to manipulate us into giving her another one. She literally goes crazy for them. I like the fact there are so few ingredients and that they do not have any grains in them. Our dog is getting older, so I feel good about the ingredients for her joints. The only reason that I gave them four stars instead of five is that they are made in China; I really wish they were made in the United States. I must warn you though; your dog may become addicted--just like mine :)

review/summary: These 'treats' are Made in China
review/text: In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.<br /><br />Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.

review/summary: WARNING: These dog treats are Made in CHINA. (We gave these to our dog who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease & diabetes)
review/text: We were shocked to find out that Dogswell a company we have been buying our dog treats for last several years have started outsourcing these dog treats to China. This is very disappointing considering 4-5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.<br /><br />It is very surprising why this product got around 4/5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text "Made in China" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.<br /><br />We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes. We fed our dog these treats for number of years and now wonder just how much they contributed to her illness considering these treats are NOT made in USA but China.

review/text: I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, "Made in China".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />Do NOT trust this product!!!

Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />Hello Karen,<br /><br />Thank You for contacting us here at DOGSWELL�.<br /><br />The DOGSWELL� manufacturing facilities meet the highest and most strict sanitary conditions. All of our plants have HACCP programs, have received high scores by independent Third Party auditors, have strict raw ingredient standards and continuously check our products during processing and when they are finished to ensure they meet our high quality standards. Our wet food for dogs, our dry food for dogs and our biscuits are manufactured in the U.S. and our treats are manufactured in China. We regularly visit our manufacturing facilities to ensure the quality and safety of our products. We are always looking to bring the manufacturing over to the United States, we have just not found a supplier who will add all of the vitamins and nutrients that we want at a price the consumer is willing to pay, once we find one, we will definitely bring it back over to the US.<br /><br />We don't determine our source country for ingredients based solely on the country of origin; we find the best quality ingredient combined with the highest quality supplier and testing specifications and select them. You can be confident that DOGSWELL� products are natural, high-quality and provide the best for your pet.<br /><br />Please know we certify that our products are safe and clean with regular testing and ensure that our products meet high quality standards. We test product from each batch that is produced and have never had our results come back positive for ANY harmful ingredients such as cyanuric acid, melamine, e.coli and salmonella.

Along with an in-depth knowledge of our supply chain, our regular tests assure our customers that we are providing their pets with only the very best ingredients. Tests are conducted at independent, third-party, U.S. laboratories that follow FDA and APPMA-approved methodology. Please see attached for an example of test results for our treats; I have attached one of our VITALITY(tm) products that were tested recently.<br /><br />Our material suppliers are certified clean and clear of any contaminants. If raw ingredients do not meet their specifications and pass safety tests, then the ingredient is rejected immediately and never enters our processing facilities. Moreover, we strive to use products from suppliers that treat their animals humanely. Please see attached for an image of our chickens in their barn. I do not know of a reliable site that describes the process.<br /><br />Please know that we honestly believe that pets are family too and we feed our products to our own pets regularly. Again, we test product from each batch that is produced and have never had our results come back positive for ANY harmful ingredients.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to contact me with ANY questions.<br /><br />Thank You,<br /><br />Jeff<br /><br />Jeff Haluck<br /><br />Marketing Assistant

review/summary: Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver
review/text: I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats.

review/summary: Chinese Product Masquerading as American
review/text: I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) "U.S.A. Rawhide" and on the back, in fine print, was "Made in China."  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our "furry kids" that won't make them sick or kill them!

review/summary: Zero stars- my dog became ill after eating these
review/text: My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.

review/text: I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?

review/text: My dog became very ill (vomiting, diarrhea, excruciating pain) in mid-Oct and spent three days at the Emergency Vet - and cost us $3500! They ruled out a bunch of things and were only able to say that he might have Irritable Bowel Disease but the biopsy to find out for certain would cost us an additional $1800. He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate. I can't say for sure that these were the cause but I won't be buying ANY dog food products (treats or otherwise) that are made in China. Treats made in the USA only for us!!

Finally, I have found a treat that's healthy, not only for his hips, but for his teeth, also.  They're nice & chewy.<br />I read food labels constantly, and it helps to be able to read the ingredients before purchasing on Amazon.  Also, buying Dogswell in bulk (15oz./pks of 3) as Amazon offers, is the best deal I have found, so far.  My 13yr. old, 33lb. dog gets 3 chicken strips a day.  The rest of the 15oz. pkg. goes into the freezer, whereupon the next day I'm able to snap each strip into thirds - that's how Ranger Bob (my dog) likes it.  Might not be a bad idea to offer it this way for smaller dogs.  Oh, and one last thing, Ranger Bob will bury pig ears, real bones, biscuits,"green bones" etc. but not these Dogswell strips!

review/summary: FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products 11/18/2011
review/text: I ordered three packages because the price was so good, then I saw this. I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]

review/summary: Nasty and questionable: MADE IN CHINA. Read the news!!!!
review/text: FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, " A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China." (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that "small number" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?<br /><br />We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.

review/text: It's more than a year that I daily feed Dogswell Happy Hips treats to my now 12 year old dog who has arthritis in her hips. Her moves are more fluid now, without the 'stiff' look to her stride because of the glucosamine and chondroitin contained in this product. Plus she looks forward to getting the treats every day (her favorite is the Duck Breast).<br />I also give my dog a Best Pet Health chewable tablet every evening that contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM. These products really do help my arthritic dog a lot.

Now I learned that ALL chicken treats for dogs (and also cats I believe) that are MADE IN CHINA are being investigated  by the FDA because some dogs have died after consuming them. These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of "made in USA", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food. Sorry this product, I don't recommend.

review/text: I found Dogswell products 7 years ago when my vet recommended the Glucosa-Chondro chicken strips to help my dog who had just had patella luxation surgery on both his knees. The vet said the supplements would help my little one avoid arthritis in his later years. I'd say so! He's pushing 8.5 yo and doesn't show any signs of slowing down even though he has pins in both knees. He jumps high, runs like a maniac and is spry as a pup. Between this and various other dogswell treats that care for his eyes, hair, coat, breath, teeth, etc, he's going strong which makes momma very happy. All in all, I love these products and recommend them to all my friends who have dogs.

It's not worth the risk.

review/text: My husband is always hassling me to eat something good with protein, as I am a carb lover.  These white meat chunk chicken in cans are great, because I'm terrible at meal planning.  All of a sudden, I'll be hungry NOW, with no time to cook.<br /><br />So I open a can of this Swanson chicken, drain it, dump it into a tupperware, add a couple heaping tablespoons of lite Miracle Whip, and start mashing at the chunks with a fork.  I scoop up the newly made chicken salad with saltine, Ritz, or butter club crackers.  Ta-da, instant protein-filled meal.  This chicken would be great for serving to kids, too.  I ALWAYS have cans of this in my cupboards.  I can add some more flavor by adding ground black pepper, mustard, relish, and other kitchen staples.<br /><br />It is cheaper at my local stores.  But, if you can't get out to the store, I've always had great service from amazon!

review/summary: I'm impressed.
review/text: For years I've walked by the tuna aisle in the grocery store and seen canned chicken.<br />My initial thought was...ewwww.<br />It just struck me as just plain wrong that chicken would be stuck in a can.<br />Then out of curiosity I picked up a can and......as soon as I opened the can it was like a revelation.<br />I drained it and no chunks came out with the water.<br />Sure enough I opened the can and all I saw were juicy chunks of white meat.<br />Perfect for salads, stews or soups.<br />I made a chicken salad for lunch and it was delish.<br />I can't wait to make some homemade chicken noodle soup this weekend.<br />Cheap and tasty.<br />Recommended.

review/summary: Great product to have in your cupboard and a good price
review/text: Update:  Please note per my information below: product description and photo are no longer accurate.  The product has a sealed lid, not a "pop-top lid" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed.  See below for the correct information.  I have notified Amazon of this error.  Somehow 5 grams of protein have been "lost" from the can contents.<br /><br />I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one, get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can).  This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more.<br />I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat.  This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use.  The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item.  The meat flakes into small pieces easily, so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it.  It would also make a good filling for enchiladas, tortillas or quesadillas.  I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product.  It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks.  For those who don't like tuna, it's a great alternative.<br />Basically, it's chicken when you need it ready to go, and it is a good source of protein with very little fat.  One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories, 9 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV), 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?).  If sodium is a concern, consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer.<br />It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long!  It's fresh when you need it.  I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some)<br />Update:<br />Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese.<br />I haven't tried the concoction yet, but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast.

review/summary: Damaged goods
review/text: At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK.

review/summary: Not as good as other canned chicken
review/text: I have purchased numerous canned chicken products before, and of course none compare to real chicken.  However, that being said, this product's quality is considerably below that of most canned chickens.  Other canned chickens have large chunks of white meat, while this product is full of small discolored pieces with pieces of what appear to be skin or fat.  Considering the price is also higher than the store bought competitors, I can not recommend this product.

review/summary: Good Product, Good Shelf Life
review/text: Received these in March 2012 and the expiration date was August 2013, so I got nearly a year and a half recommended shelf life.<br /><br />The chicken is good quality and is flavorful. Great for chicken tacos, burritos and chicken salad. Quick and easy, I rinse the contents.<br /><br />There is nearly 50 grams (10 grams per serving and the serving size is 2 ounces) of protein in each can which is one reason for selecting this product. I keep a year supply of food on hand and these fit in nicely with my food storage and rotation efforts.<br /><br />I also ordered the Tyson canned chicken and was very pleased to note the Tyson arrived at the same time and has a February 2015 recommended shelf life. I like both products and recommend both.

review/summary: Great shelf staple ...
review/text: I used this a lot for white bean / chicken chili, chicken salad, fettuccine alfredo with chicken and mushrooms.  The flavor is very good, it's low-fat, the sodium count isn't outrageous, and it works well with a lot of things.  Yes, I prefer using fresh chicken breast, but when I don't have any on hand or can't get to the store, this works very well.

review/summary: Useless to me...
review/text: I bought this to ship to me in Afghanistan, since it would be easier than asking my wife to go to the grocery store and then to the post office. Good price and fast shipping, but now I have to order a can opener. The item image depicts a pull-tab can which was my main concern, but the package that arrived did not have these tabs. If this is your concern, like mine, then don't buy.<br /><br />As for the taste or quality of the meat, well I'll just have to wait and see.

review/summary: Great chicken in a hurry!
review/text: I've always been a snob when it comes to my chicken; nothing but fresh chicken would do for me. Then one day I found an amazing recipe which oddly enough, called for canned chicken. I trusted the source of the recipe so I bought a couple of cans at the store, and I am SO glad I did. This stuff is great.<br /><br />It's true that it doesn't have the same consistency as freshly cooked chicken. It feels more like rotisserie chicken, as it tends to fall apart very easily. This is actually great for casseroles! I prefer it over the texture of sauteed chicken.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with the product, so I came to Amazon and bought a whole lot of it to put in my pantry. It was delivered, for free, in two days! Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Please Never Discontinue This Product
review/text: When it became difficult to find this product in our local grocery stores, I panicked until I found it on Amazon.  This has a MUCH better flavor than any other canned chickens I've tried.  For years it has been a major staple in my kitchen & desk drawer.  For a quick, guilt-free snack, it's tasty just smashed up in its own broth.  Mixed with some relish & either mayo or ranch dressing, it makes a delicious salad to eat alone, in a sandwich, or on crackers.  My elderly/feeble parents loved it microwaved with various tuna helper flavors as an easy main dish.  This is great in all of my favorite cooked chicken recipes, & it's always in the pantry, ready to use on short notice, but keeping just fine (unlike refrigerated alternatives) until it's needed.  When I can't incorporate the broth into whatever I'm making, I usually drink it, because it's too flavorful to waste.

review/summary: Not as good as other brands, texture too soft
review/text: I like the convenience of having canned chicken on hand. It's great for soup or salad. However, I found the flavor of the Swanson's canned chicken to be good, however, the texture was so soft, it just seems to mush away into whatever you're making. My kids LOVE chicken salad, and they were so happy to see I had just made some. One taste and they were like, what's this? Why is it so soft, so mushy. I bought a dozen cans, so I have to finish them up and we will be eating mushy chicken salad for awhile. I don't recommend this product.

review/text: This is my daughter's favorite. Lindt chocolate is one of the best I know on the market. But: this time I want to review also this shipper. This shipper deserves 10 stars!<br />The chocolate was shipped on days with extremely high temperatures and I was worried in what shape it's going arrive to. Surprise was on my side: all chocolates were in zipped food storage bag, which was inside of small styro-foam cooler together with 4 ice packs. And all that neatly accommodated inside of clean white carton box.<br />When I opened the cooler, the contain was still very cold! I could not be impressed more. And all that effort for value of $30 merchandise with the free shipping!!!! WOW!!!
