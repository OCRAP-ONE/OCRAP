review/summary: I think they changed the recipie?
review/text: I don't usually write reviews, but my disappointment flows over on this matter.  They have definitely changed the flavour of the Original Pemican Beef jerky.  It is the same great texture, but saltier and with a different flavour from before.  Maybe it is the bag material?  I had an old bag just to check my tastebuds against.  I used to look forward to Amazon getting stock on these and then buy a bunch up to have on hand.  If you read these reviews Marfoods, please bring back the old flavour, from the bags talking abut steak.  The new bag is a nice design, but I buy beef jerky for the taste.  Maybe advertise improved taste at some point after you change back so that we know it is safe to buy again.  It is still the best texture in a beef jerky and I will still buy some here and there to see if the taste comes back.  But I will wait to buy pounds again until the taste is back.

review/summary: NOT the original L&P recipe - contains HFCS
review/text: As per the product listing, this version of Lea & Perrins' iconic Worcestershire sauce contains high fructose corn syrup. Heinz has actually listened to customer concerns/opinions and, as of this year, started using sugar in the recipe instead of HFCS in the US version again (see the product info on the L&P website - the ingredients are listed there) but unless and until the product information is updated I'd assume what's being sold here is still old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, you can sometimes find the bottles with the orange label for sale in stores. That is the L&P imported from Britain and will definitely NOT contain any HFCS.<br /><br />Kudos to Heinz for listening to its customers, though. There is absolutely no need for Worcestershire sauce to contain high fructose corn syrup!

review/summary: Careful - not the real thing
review/text: First, it tastes OK, though slightly lacking compared to the real thing. But it's 90% of the full effect. How we lost that 10% is rather important though.<br /><br />This is what happens when an American conglomerate buys a little British company. The first thing they did was rehash the recipe to see where it could be made cheaper without anyone noticing, so they substituted spirit vinegar and high fructose corn syrup. The first just removes flavor, the second is implicated in health issues since fructose appears to interfere with lysl oxidase which is important in collagen and elastin production. The amount you get from this product is small, but avoiding every bit of it you can is important.

review/text: My mom bought into this product and went through bottles and bottles, at a lot of expense.  As far as she (or we) could tell, it did not improve her health in any way.  Conceivably if it was only a few dollars a bottle, it may give some noticeable boost (although we did not experience that), but it is NOT worth this huge amount of money people are being roped into paying.  Also, Mom didn't seem to mind the taste, but I tried it once, and honestly, it tasted so bad that I probably couldn't make myself drink a dose every day anyway.

review/summary: Something different...
review/text: These are not the typical Caesar salad croutons, but nevertheless, still very tasty.<br /><br />The ingredients:<br /><br />- Not overly salted so the herbs really contribute to the flavor.<br /><br />- The amount of garlic is OK, so your loved ones do not have to eat these croutons along with you to bear your presence :-)<br /><br />- No dubious "natural" flavors were used.<br /><br />- The package states "Product of Israel", so the herbs really seem to come from a Mediterranean climate.<br /><br />- The size of the croutons is on the smaller side so they can readily absorb the dressing. Very important for me, since I am usually a little bit in a hurry when I prepare my meals.<br /><br />On the obvious downside is the long transportation distance from the manufacturer to the US, which is usually a bit disturbing for consumers of organic products. I also couldn't find a "Best before..." info on the package.<br /><br />Overall still a nice crouton variety.

They are extremely salty and aside from that have no other taste.  I would not re order these again.  I do admit that I do not care for salty foods but if salt is used the taste of it should not be so overwhelming. Some foods are understandably noted for being salty, anchovies, pretzels etc. I do eat pretzels and like them as long as I don't feel as if I put several tablespoons of salt in my mouth. I do not taste any of the herbs that I expected in a product which claims to have as one of it's ingredients Italian herbs.

The box does indeed contain 48 4-piece bars like the product advertises, which is good because I've had problems before where the amount it said is not the amount I got. When I opened the box, it looked like a lot more than 48 simply because I did not know that 48 4-piece bars would look like so much. The Now and Laters are the delicious banana flavor I remember and are start out hard, and then become chewy, just like their famous motto. Definitely worth the money and the amount you get will last you a long time.

review/text: A regular bounty bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. This version is pretty well identical, except they use dark chocolate.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the milk chocolate version. I just think the "softer" flavor of the milk chocolate complements the coconut's taste and texture better. But... well, maybe that's just me! Obviously you have to make your own call.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars of both types in packages of varying number. So it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once.<br /><br />Enjoy in moderation! ;)<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Not ma's warm homemade, but ranks among packaged cookies.
review/text: A reliable soft oatmeal cookie among brand-name manufactured choices, as compared to homemade. I review, thus, on what it is, a 5-star, but my wife's oatmeal cookies are 6-star, of course. Being older, diet conscious, and needing to watch nutrition labels due to health conditions, I found this cookie to compare favorably with another brand recommended by my doctor & nutritionist. Honest! The big difference is the other had a serving size of 30g while this individually packaged cookie is 42g. Quaker oatmeal cookies had 3 � inch diameter, full � inch thick, with a shelf life of 4 months after arrival into my house. Too good to keep shelved that long. Grandkids approved.<br /><br />Comparing nutrition on equal gram basis, the oatmeal was fractionally more on calories & fat, but considerably better on sodium and fiber (things important on my diet.) Ideal for moms packing lunches, or office people needing a snack, I'd recommend this since the cookie is large enough to halve, making 2 snacks, or use as is. Being less than a chocoholic, the bits of chocolate were just enough. Being a giant nut fan, the ample almonds won me over. Almonds are the healthiest nut according to my nutritionist. Being a 64-year-old Quaker Oatmeal fan may have helped, as I enjoy oatmeal in meatloaf, bread, cookies, pie crust, cornbread, biscuits, granola, and any form except hot breakfast.<br /><br />I will be trying another Quaker oatmeal cookie flavor.

review/summary: Dogs LOVE Filling,...Only
review/text: My three dogs go crazy over any Dingo product. However, they are expensive compared to other dog treats and after our dogs have chewed out the meat filling, they leave the rawhide cover on the floor and beg for another Dingo even though they haven't finished the first one. Pig Ears seem to be a better value for the money because the dogs eat the entire treat and end up spending more time exercising their teeth. I'll save the Dingos for very special occasions.

In fact, she won't finish eating any other brand of rawhide treats we've bought her.  I guess it's that Dingo "meat in the middle" that does the trick.<br /><br />However, as of writing this review Amazon is selling them for eleven bucks when you can purchase the same 21 count bag for seven bucks at petguys dot com.  They charge shipping, but if you stock up and buy 8 bags as an example, the shipping is only nine bucks.  Also, online coupons are frequently available for their website.

review/summary: Too much RED DYE!!
review/text: I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.<br /><br />So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.<br /><br />Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.<br /><br />At least it wasn't made in China.

review/summary: Cheap Chinese-made products are dangerous to pets
review/text: I've stopped buying Dingo products when I noticed that they were being made in China.  I was on their website, and they answered one of the posters that was concerned about it, essentially stating that they test the products rigorously and go through strict quality control.  That's a bunch of CRAP !! They started making them in China to SAVE MONEY, they are not about to SPEND those savings on testing and quality control. What they do is GAMBLE that the products will be okay, and if they aren't they just RECALL them, write off the loss, and it's just too bad for the poor little pets that end up with life threatening illnesses.  Our government doesn't do anything about it, because our government is OWNED by Corporations, far be it for them to interfere with the Almighty Multi-National Corporations.<br />  I'm not taking ANY chances with MY dogs, I care for them way too much, to buy something that was processed in some factory in China that processes everything under the sun, from car batteries, to baby food. If there's some cross-contamination going on, it probably won't be discovered until it's already too late for SOME pets.

review/summary: My puppy tires of these...and they can be VERY dangerous!
review/text: My puppy loves to chew, so I got these.  She likes them until the meat entwined in them is gone, then she goes to something else.  Plus they can be VERY dangerous.  I saw her chewing on something one day and went to look.  She had found one of these she'd left where I didn't see it and had chewed it to where the end was gooey and mushy.  I've read that if they swallow this part, it can get caught in their intestines and block them OR in their throat and choke them.  I threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  I'll never buy them or anything like them again.  I don't get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  The best thing I've found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called "Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks For Dogs".  Do a search here on amazon.com or on Google and you can find them from $8.99 and up, but they're worth it to have something safe for your dog to chew on.  They are all natural, satisfies her need to chew, is full of vitamins and most importantly, SAFE for her.  They come in a huge bag, so for my little 6 pounder, they last a long time.  Sometimes I even cut one in half and give it to her.  The slices are pretty big, so they'd be very good for big dogs too.  Stay clear of ANYTHING rawhide or like that if you love your four-legged baby.

review/text: My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt.

review/summary: Missy's "Must Have"!!
review/text: When I got my dachshund from the Humane Society, she was overweight and had bad tartar on her teeth.  The vet said she'd need to be seen in a few weeks to have the tartar removed.  Instead, she was given a Dingo Bone every evening, which she chewed up.  Her teeth are nice and clean now.<br /><br />Missy was also placed on a low calorie food and no longer receives "people food". She gets her daily Dingo Bone right after her evening meal and she wants it IMMEDIATELY!  Doxies can get quite bouncy when they really want something.<br /><br />I really appreciate the large value package which is not offered in any store, and the price, plus the ease and fast shipping when I purchase through Amazon.

I don't know what it is about these things, but they bring out the crazy in my dogs.

review/summary: Good value mini rawhide bones - 40 lb Labrador pup enjoys them
review/text: After finishing a whole pack of 21 bones, our Labrador pup loved these bones with meat in the middle. A tasty treat indeed. The bones are wrapped properly and it keeps  both our puppy and us satisfied.<br /><br />In response to some glaring negative reviews, just be aware that anything your dog eats is a hazard. If those aforementioned bad experiences were true, I'm truly sorry. Take care of your dogs the best you can. Regardless, the rawhide is still a potential risk. However, the reviews referring to the bad quality due to the Chinese production is completely fraudulent. Just because it's made in China does NOT mean the product is made poorly.  It is simply a unsupported attack towards this company. I've also seen the almost exact "Anti-Chinese" review for Pork chomps rawhide bones.<br /><br />Some other thoughts:<br />* The meat in the middle can be a little jagged sharp sometimes. Just check it before feeding your dog.<br />* Great value for the 21 pack<br />* Our Labrador pup loves them<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with these rawhide bones with meat in the middle. If our puppy could say it, she would agree with me too.

review/summary: Our dogs love these
review/text: We have 2 dogs, one is 8lbs and the other 12lbs and both of them love these.  One bone keeps them busy for about 30mins.  They are fairly small so if your dog is any larger than 15lbs you will probably want to get the next size up.  Even our 12lb dog could handle something bigger but we buy one size out of convenience.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these but I suggest that you watch the price, as it seems to fluctuate a lot.  I bought two bags for the price that one is currently listed for!

review/text: If you have a dog or puppy that chews on everything and/or has a ton of frenetic energy, Dingo bones are great.  Some dogs need 'a job' to do to keep them out of trouble.  Each bone lasts my small terrier mix around 2 hours.  I enjoy, that unlike many dog treats, there is no odor or mess associated with Dingo Bones.  I wish that these were available for Subscribe and Save so I could get an automatic monthly delivery!

review/text: My dog is super picky about her treats (probably because she is hopelessly spoiled).  Why have a dog crunchie when you can have "people food"?  So finding a good chewy treat that helps her teeth and keeps her happy has been somewhat challenging.  She ADORES Dingo mini bones! They are the perfect size for her (she's a 9lb Chinese Crested) and she will spend an hour just chomping away at these bones.  So happy to have found something she likes!

They are expensive but if you put them side by side to the Dollar Store ones there's more meat in them. They also sell some with double meat these are a wonderful product and they are worth the money.

When I bought this, it was $12.99 which wasn't much of a "value" compared to the price at Kroger.  But I think they are now $9.99 which is like getting one 7-pack for free.

They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.

These were the only treats that would keep him entertained since he doesn't care much for toys and they were very easy to find.  Unfortunately my dog seemed to swallow a large piece of the mini dingo rawhides yesterday.  At 2 am I heard my dog let out a loud howl that I have never heard before, I went to check on him and found him gagging and obviously trying to throw something up.  Right as I was about to take him to the animal hospital he threw up the rawhide and he's all better now.  I'm NEVER giving him a rawhide treat, they swell in the dog's stomach and can kill them.  I rather not take that risk with my dog.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Great beans plus veggies alternative to 'classic' bean chili. Bell peppers are the most prominent added flavor note. Great with organic tortilla chips or crackers. Made with organic bell peppers, organic potatoes, organic carrots, organic corn in addition to typical chili ingredients. Consider adding even more of your favorite organic veggies such as tomatoes, bell peppers, or garbanzos for even more chunkiness and flavor note variety. The veggies change the taste and mouth feel with every spoonful. Great base for a party dip. A small amount of blended organic jalapenos provides some bite. If you prefer, can add a spoonful of agave nectar to increase sweetness. No GMO ingredients. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! Also like Amy's traditional chilis such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1CPZQ">Amy's Organic Medium Chili, 14.7-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176EG">Amy's Organic Black Bean Chili, 14.7-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>.

The fiber and protein content are excellent and you are hard pressed to beat Amazon's price (particularly with the $10 off they are giving right now).  It's a little bland but nothing a healthy dose of jalape&ntilde;os and some fresh ground pepper doesn't solve (I don't get the spicier chili because my wife doesn't like spicy food).  If you are looking for a healthy chili to help you maintain a good diet then this is what you are looking for.

review/summary: Best Canned Chili I've Tasted
review/text: I LOVE this chili.  It's not too mild, not too spicy, just perfect.  I'm ordering it for the second time here.  There are even tiny chunks of potatoes, but it's a perfect blend and a perfect meal when you don't want to cook--just open and heat it up! I saw another brand of organic chili with vegetables here on Amazon, that costs a bit less, but after trying Amy's, I just don't want to chance something else that might not live up to this chili!  I've also used it as a dip for chips, that was really good too.  And if you're on a diet, a can of this chili is under 400 calories--fitting into the amount of calories appropriate for a "diet" meal--and it's very filling!<br /><br />I wish this came in large cans like Costco sells giant cans of chili--it would definitely be gone before going bad in our house!  As many people who eat organic, I care about the environment, and try to make food from scratch instead of buying food ready-made in packaging, as that leaves a big carbon footprint as well as landfills....If I had the recipe to make this from scratch I would, but since I don't, buying cans of this is an indulgence I can't resist! Just make sure to recycle the cans, LOL!
