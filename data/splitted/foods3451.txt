review/summary: 1st time was AMAZING, 2nd... not so much
review/text: I ordered these red vines (I'm addicted) and they came promptly to my door.  They were super fresh and tasty, I think they lasted me a month and a half.  I was ecstatic because red vines are the best, as long as they aren't stale (like they always are at the grocery store on the east coast).  6 months later the order was placed again, they came fast but much to my dismay... the red vines were just as hard as at the store!  Why this sudden change in quality?  I am giving them one last chance and then I will make my final decision.

review/summary: My favorite candy
review/text: Red Vines cherry-flavored licorice is my favorite candy. This particular amount for the price is a great deal vs. the other offers listed on Amazon and what I've found in retail stores.<br />They took an unusually long time to ship from the warehouse. I placed my order in on a Thursday and it didn't even leave the warehouse until the following Wed. I live in Southern California and the warehouse was located only one state away, in Nevada. UPS then let it sit in the Nevada location for another day, so it didn't arrive until Friday. I know the super saver free shipping can take up to 10 days to ship. However, this was the only item in my order and was available in stock.<br />Basically, I love the product, but Amazon's customer service was definitely mediocre compared to my past experience. The convenience of having something delivered to your doorstep is pretty much negated by the lengthy wait. Next time, I'll order early before I run out since this is the least expensive offer for this only little luxury I indulge in during these economic hard times.

review/text: I purchased a can so I could have black eye peas on New Year's Day.  These are delicious, they competed well with childhood memories of my mother's cooking.  The store was sold out when I attempted to purchase more a couple of weeks later, and I'm so pleased to find them here, and at such a great price.  I enjoy them alone, and I love to mix them in with my rice, tomato and smoked sausage dish.  Black eye peas are nutritional and good for you.  Here you have all the taste, just by opening a can.

review/summary: Best Blackeye Peas EVER!!
review/text: While living in NJ as a misplaced southerner I was in search of some blackeye peas and found Sylvia's and much to my surprise these peas are better than you can make at home and in a lot less time!!  When we moved back to Texas we have been unable to find them in our local stores so we were thrilled to find them on Amazon.  Only issue, beware that when you order the two cases your cans will most likely be damaged as they are shipped in the cases and only plastic wrapped so ever time the cases are thrown from truck to truck the cans take a beating.  None the less...still the same tasty peas, just not in pretty cans!  :-)

review/summary: THE BEST I HAVE FOUND
review/text: When I moved to North Carolina, I found that none of the stores carry the pepperoni sticks. only the thin sliced type. So I went online and ordered some sticks. The first type I received was not very good. It was very dry and the taste was not very good. The second brand I bought was not too bad in taste but it was the size of a slimjim, very small. Then I found the Battistoni brand.and WOW. it is without a doubt, the best tasting Pepperoni I have ever had, and it is the large size that you would find in a Italian deli.I could not be happier with a product.  Also note that the price is a good bit less than what I was paying for the same size in Maryland. It would cost about $7.00 a stick in Maryland.

I chew a lot of gum and have tried a lot of different brands and flavors, but this one as at the top for how good it tastes.

review/summary: I Would Buy Elsewhere
review/text: I got my agar agar yesterday, and I feel like I've been scammed.  The only reason I chose to buy from Barry Farm was that it was the cheapest option.  But that wasn't the case.<br /><br />When I first held the package (which is smaller than what is pictured here), I thought it was oddly light for 4 oz.  So I weighed it on my military grade digital scale and bingo, it's 3.2 oz.  Without the packaging that would mean 3 oz.  I thought it might be my scale so I weighed my mineral makeup that came on the same day, 1.3 pounds each for a 1 pound bag.  So Barry Farm only shipped me 3 oz of product when I payed for 4 oz, which doesn't seem like a lot but when you do the calculations it's quite a dent.<br /><br />Let me compare this to the other agar option on Amazon by NOW Foods.<br /><br />Barry Farm (3 oz) $7.90 + $7.13 (Shipping) =  $15.03 (Comes in a plastic Ziploc bag)<br /><br />NOW Foods (2 oz) $4.20 + $5.38 (Shipping) = $9.58/2 = $4.79/oz * 3 = $14.37 for 3 oz (Comes in a plastic bottle)<br /><br />NOW Foods (32 oz) $40.79 + $7.55) = $48.34/32 = $1.51/oz *3 = $4.53<br /><br />So including shipping,<br /><br />Barry Farm $15.03/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $14.37/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $ 4.53/3 oz<br /><br />With a bottle instead of a plastic bag, my future purchases would be from NOW Foods.  I'm so tempted to get the 2 Pound bottle since an ounce is only $1.51 that way, but agar's gelling quality is so good that it gets used very slowly.<br /><br />Now about the agar.  I cooked it last night (1 Cup apple juice to 1/2 teaspoon powder), and left it in the fridge.  This morning I woke up to see it gelled quite nicely.  It doesn't have the doinky texture of gelatin jello and it's much harder to the touch.  I tasted it and didn't notice an exponential increase in the taste of apple juice, and the texture of the agar isn't as good as gelatin jello. It sort of just breaks apart in your mouth like...sand maybe? But at least it's supposedly healthy.<br /><br />So in terms of Barry Farms I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because at least the product worked.  But not going to buy from them again since I don't know if I'll be cheated.  Internets a scary place where merchant reputation is very important.  They should have put more product in the bag to ensure it measures at least 4 oz.  Now their reputation is tarnished.

Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier!<br />****

review/summary: So Many Problems
review/text: The first problem I had with these candies is that they arrived clearly worse for wear. They had been exposed to heat at some point, and having been packaged and shipped in an envelope that at some point was beaten by a monkey or perhaps a small cranky child, the candies were warped and lumpy and partially out of their wrappings. The second issue was with taste - they were unbearably sweet, the "coconut creme" filling had almost no coconut flavor and was cloying and unpleasant. There was very little difference in taste between the chocolate and the "coconut creme" filling. The third problem was with texture. The chocolate coating was waxy and thick and lacked the crisp snap of a properly tempered chocolate, and the "creme" filling was chalky, heavy, and not creamy at all. I found them to be inedible.

review/summary: Great protein containing cereal
review/text: My husband and I have been eating this cereal for almost 16 years after we initially went on the Zone Diet.  Until recently our local health food store carried it, but now has discontinued it though I am still able to order it by the case through them.  As the other reviews have said, it sticks with you better than most cereals, unless cooked, and it tastes good!  We have tried almost every other protein-containing cereal that we could find and most taste like cardboard.  It is wonderful having a quick breakfast with enough protein to exercise vigorously on.  We also like it because it is not too sweet and doesn't contain as much sodium as many cold cereals.

review/summary: Good, but sweet
review/text: I was looking for a handy way to have dark chocolate to snack on, in a more stable form, which I could measure out. I should not have been surprised, but I find this chocolate to be too sweet for my taste for dark chocolate.  I could not find information about the cocoa content online or on the packaging.  So all in all, I will consume this chocolate, but I would prefer truly dark chocolate with high cocoa content. Perhaps Mars makes such chocolate, but I have not been able to find it.

These are the largest cow ears that I have been able to buy, the dogs love them and I like the price. They are a bit smelly, about what you would expect from dried cow ears. Dried pig ears are really stinky, the cow ears just have a slight odor. I have purchased several boxes of these ears and plan on purchasing more of them each time that I need more. These are a good value and the dogs love them.<br /><br />Oct. 17 Update: These cow ears are one of Amazon's secret great buys. I am surprised that there are no other reviews of these ears. This is not a rip-off and I will be ordering many more boxes for m dogs.

I give it 3 stars because it is what it says it is...morel mushroom powder and bits in Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Unfortunately, you cannot taste much 'morel' flavor over the taste of the EVOO, and the EVOO itself is a bit on the bitter side (in other words, not the best EVOO).<br /><br />I will use the six jars I purchased (3 meat, 3 salad), but I doubt I would order them again.

review/text: You can tell by the color that this teriyaki sauce is a little different from what you're used to in the teriyaki sauces that have gluten. However, in this case Different Is Better! I have used this sauce in recipes that call for teriyaki, always great in every recipe. The surprise is, this sauce can be used as a stand-alone -- by itself, without any other ingredients, it makes a great marinade. Granted, it's a little thicker than traditional teriyaki sauces, so if you need it thinner you might want to add a little water. But this stuff really ROCKS. My very picky hubby who does not have to avoid gluten and typically turns his nose up at gluten-free stuff actually prefers this teriyaki sauce over all others.

The peach taste is subtle and does taste very natural not like the overly sweet ones that use fruitcoste.  For a low calorie drink the peach flavor can not be beat, it does help to serve very cold.

review/summary: Brings back wonderful memories!
review/text: I was browsing a retro/novelty candy website when I came upon Freshen Up gum. It brought back so many memories - I remember when it was first introduced and can even remember the commercials. It was the only non-sugarless gum I would chew.<br /><br />I started to place an order, but left the site when I saw that shipping was going to cost 2x the amount of the gum. Amazon was naturally the next site I went to - it's the site I can count on to find the product I need at the best price on the Net. I found right away, but it was being offered by a another company selling on Amazon. Although I am still disappointed in how much this company charged for shipping, it was at least a bit more reasonable than the original site I was at. Besides, I just had to try this gum once again.<br /><br />It arrived today and I couldn't wait to try a piece! I was a bit worried that it might not be fresh. When I put a piece in my mouth and bit down, it was just as I remembered it to be - Great flavor, incredibly soft and the squirt of flavor that every kid loved when I was growing up. I've been chewing it for over 30 minutes and the flavor is still going strong - that's something that sugarless gum just can't offer. Also, I have tons of dental work and the gum hasn't stuck to any of it yet (thank goodness!) I can't recommend chewing any sugar gum on a regular basis, but it certainly is nice to have around for a treat every now and then.<br /><br />Spearmint has always been my favorite flavor, but all of the Freshen Up flavors are great and long lasting. I've never been a bubble gum fan, but even their bubble gum flavor is great to chew!<br /><br />If you're looking for a soft, flavor filled gum to chew, you won't go wrong ordering Freshen Up. Try to get past the shipping charges and know that you will enjoy the gum.

review/text: I was a little disappointed by the taste of these sprouts.  I love alfalfa sprouts and radishes, and also I like zesty salads like arugula, but the flavor of these sprouts didn't live up to my expectations.  But the biggest disappointment was that most of what I think are the fenugreek seeds but could be clover didn't sprout(I don't know what either seed looks like but I do know what alfalfa and radish look like).  They remain rock hard despite being soaked for almost a week, so in every forkful I bit down on what felt like little pebbles that almost broke my teeth.  I have 4 bags of these seeds that I can't use unless I want to end up toothless.

review/text: Back home in Scotland I ate haggis at least twice a week and it's been a major craving for the 8 months I've lived in the US. This isn't that similar to tinned haggis in Scotland; mainly the texture of tinned haggis back home is finer and drier than this...but it is fairly close to the 'real' haggis in a skin and is spiced just perfectly. I think preparation counts for a lot with this haggis and I dry fry it in a pan whilst stirring it until it just starts to brown as I think that improves the texture. All in all it's great with a baked potato or just for fellow Scots missing a taste of home. If you haven't tried haggis then this is a great example of how good it is...and it really is like nothing else!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I need to start off by saying this stuff is amazing! When a person is first given the list of ingredients for haggis, the stomach may turn a little. Being an adventurous food taster, I had to try it. Popping the can the contents appear to be similar to dog food. Once you mash it up and heat it in the microwave, the haggis transforms into a bowl of steamy goodness. Who would've thought that a conglomeration of sheep's hearts, lungs, and liver mixed with oats could taste so good? I definitley didn't. I was pleasantly surprised how the flavors meld into such a magnificent dish. Anyone in the states who is turned of by either the ingredients or shipping cost, should reconsider and give this stuff a whirl. (especially if you enjoy beef liver or chicken livers) This product is worth the price. I will be picking up this stuff many more times.

review/summary: Thank you, Robert Burns!
review/text: For years and years we had said we would finally try haggis, but never had the courage to face it.  (We pictured chitlings.)  This Christmas I finally bought this product and we were entirely pleased with it and will buy it again.  As an alternative to cleaning and stuffing a sheep's stomach, I have to say it is convenient (think canned hash), and it makes a DELICIOUS shepherd's pie!  It doesn't require that scotch be drunk alongside it (or prior), but -- and in the tradition of Robert Burns -- it deserves a toast.  We recommend it most heartily.

review/summary: Haggis: a most under appreciated food!
review/text: I love meat. All kinds. From sushi to chicken gizzards, I love it. I tried haggis sausage at a RenFair and wanted to try more. Unfortunately, it's difficult to come by in Seattle. (I know about the British Pantry in Redmond, but that's an hour drive for me). I found this stuff and tried a can. I now know I LOVE haggis. For those who aren't familiar with it... it's kind of like corned beef hash, only with oats instead of potatoes and lamb liver/heart instead of corned beef. It's got a strong taste, but I like that. My girlfriend even liked it on crackers. If you don't have the ability to get traditional haggis where you live, Stahley's Scottish Haggis is a worthy substitute.

review/summary: Not the real thing, but not bad, considering it's canned.
review/text: I fell in love with haggis on my trips Scotland.  When visiting a Scottish shop in NC I purchased this brand along with another brand advertised here on Amazon (Caledonian Kitchen), just to compare.  Neither one are quite like the real stuff, but what canned food is as good as the original?  Both are tasty although both are a bit mild compared to what I enjoyed in Scotland.  I think I prefer the taste of this one. This brand seems to be a tad spicier than the CK and not so heavy on the liver.  I add a bit of ground black pepper and nutmeg which helps.  I was happy to see it on Amazon, but the price added with shipping costs keeps me from purchasing it.  For the little difference in taste, I ordered the less expensive CK in the 3 pack.  I'll wait till I go back to NC or another Scottish shop to buy this one.

review/summary: just the right amount of liveriness
review/text: I bought this at a local import store. I was excited and kind of scared to try it. It's very good. I've never liked liver, and this has a livery flavor, but it's just livery enough to taste strong and interesting, but not revoltingly strong. I thought the smell did remind me of dog food, but it's saltier than dog food (yes, I've tasted dog food). It melts in your mouth, it's very soft and tender in texture, and the oats are chewy. It's fairly greasy. I hope to try this someday the traditional way with the skin, as the other reviews I've read for this product claim it tastes nothing like the real thing. It definitely tastes like nothing I've ever eaten before, and I would highly recommend trying it. It doesn't take much to get satisfaction form it. I guess it kind of reminds me of chopped liver (which I never liked as a kid, but I might like it now), only warm, and less strong in the liver flavor. I've had chicken hearts and I can taste the heart flavor, which I might be confusing with liver, as I like chicken hearts. I can imagine it would taste good with cheese.

Perfectly seasoned and one can makes several servings, as this haggis is rich in flavor. Try some and this is made in America and does NOT contain any lung tissue like haggis made in Scotland does.

If you have a measuring cup that can measure 2/3 of a cup, and a bowl, you don't need to get the kind with the bowls, which I find wasteful.  Either way, they are a great snack.  I think they have 260 calories, so they are not a meal.  Either way, if you've had Easy Mac before, and like it, this is the same stuff.  If you are picky about your macaroni, this is not the macaroni for you.<br /><br />If you really find it bland you can always do what I do an put a little bit of sriracha in right before you eat it.

review/text: Didn't expect too much from these so I was surprised that with a few tweaks, I really liked them. I use 3/4 of a cup of water in a handled, plastic measuring cup and microwave for 4 minutes. Using a spoonful of cream cheese to mix in the cheese powder seems to give the M&C just that much more flavor and richness. The measuring cup is a convenient dish to eat from...not disposable, but hey, what are dishwashers for...and there's less trash. For fewer than 300 calories, not a bad meal.

review/summary: Nasty... Gets Old Fast
review/text: I bought this in bulk at Costco because I am a college student and needed something I could snack on while studying. These do require a microwavable bowl, as they come in individual packets. After eating it twice, you already get tired of the taste. It is not like regular mac and cheese at all. The noodles are sticky and after microwaving there is barely any water left to make the cheese powder mix work. It gets messy and the powder cheese crusts around the bowl. And you have to soak the bowl once you're done eating if you want to be able to get the mix out.<br />5 months later and I STILL have a few packets left. I just can't fathom to eat it. Only way I would eat the rest is if I had absolutely nothing else to eat. Save your money and buy something else. Hamburger Helper makes great microwavable noodles that taste better than this junk.

review/summary: Horrible taste / no cups included
review/text: This turned out to be my worst shopping experience with Amazon.com.<br /><br />I ordered two boxes of these Kraft Easy Mac single serve packs.  I'm a longtime Amazon.com shopper but had never bought food from them before.  These box of eighteen packs were sold by an Amazon marketplace seller but fulfilled by Amazon.  We've been buying Kraft Easy Mac cups for the past year now and really enjoy them.  So we decided to try these single serve packs (no cups included).<br /><br />Shipping by Amazon was fast.  To make a long story short these single serve packs tasted absolutely nasty!  We opened up the other packs to be fair but they tasted horrible as well.  Nobody could take more than a tiny bite. They tasted that bad.<br /><br />I don't know where the seller stored these boxes or where they obtained their stock but never again will I buy grocery items from Amazon.com.  It's too much trouble to return them, costs too much to ship back even when Amazon pays for part of the shipping.  Buying food items from Amazon was not worth it.<br /><br />I would give careful consideration in buying these single serve packs from any of the secondary marketplace sellers.  A lot of sellers are individuals and not necessarily a business.  You never know where food items like these are stored at in someone's house.  We wasted good money.

The only issue I had was that while the nuts were $10.50, the shipping was $9.95.  I didn't realize it until after, as I had multiple items in my order from multiple vendors.  My fault for not paying attention - but, to basically charge as much for shipping as you do the product - a very small item - is ridiculous.
