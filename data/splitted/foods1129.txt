review/summary: Zuke's Mini Naturals
review/text: These are excellent treats for training. They are the perfect size and you can put them in your pocket without worrying about your pocket smelling like dog treats or leaving crumbs behind. My dog likes all three flavors. The treats do become harder inside the bag after a month or two, so I would only open one bag at a time.  The price on Amazon is considerable less than at a pet store.

review/text: Although I think they 'stink', my dog absolutely loves these treats. They are small and easy to carry in your pocket. If you are having trouble with your dog heeling or following you around the house, just keep a few of these in your pocket and she'll follow you everywhere! My dog absolutely can't wait for 'training sessions' with these treats and because they are so small she can be rewarded often for following commands. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: My sheltie love these treats
review/text: My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, chicken, comes from chicken being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

Dried beef lung stinks up the entire room until she consumes it all).<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently the ingredients have changed for the PB flavor... the 1st two ingredients are now ground barley and rice, with actual PB coming in as the 3rd ingredient.  My sheltie still loves 'em though!

review/summary: Best dog treat - great for training
review/text: We have a 10-month-old boxer and found a trainer to work with us.  The trainer recommended these treats for training because they're small and the dog doesn't have to stop and chew and chew between activities.  Also, these chicken and salmon treats seem to have healthier ingredients than most other dog treats.  Truthfully, I am not an expert on what's good or bad for dogs nutritionally, but I'm sitting here looking at two dog treat bags.  One has dried whey, palm kernel oil, sugar, dicalcium phosphate, maltodextrin, defatted peanut flour, salt, soy lecithin and caramel.  Basically sounds like candy.  Mini naturals have chicken, ground barley, ground rice, lots of vitamins...no detectable sugars.  Maybe dogs don't need the grains, but the protein-based, no-sugar recipe seems like a better choice.  Try a bag and if you don't like them, you can return the unused portion to the company for a full refund.

review/summary: Great for Training!
review/text: This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.  Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior.  These treats are just the right size!

review/text: Finding these treats was a complete fluke. When on vacation in Hollywood, FL we stopped in a gourmet pet store. There was a cute yorkie that we were petting and we told the owner we had Chihuahuas. He was buying Zukes and absolutely raved about the treats. He recommended the chicken but we purchased the peanut butter treat. We keep the treats in the fridge. My dogs LOVE these treats. If we open the fridge they are right there. The size is perfect for training. I can't say enough great things about the product, healthy and it makes my dogs happy.

review/summary: Great size for training but absolutely unbearable smell
review/text: I thought these looked perfect for training so I gave them a try.  The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable.  We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days.  We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone.  If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands.  Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again.  I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor.

review/summary: Great for training and dogs who just love getting treats!
review/text: I originally bought a 6 ounce bag of these treats at my local pet store for 4$ a bag.  The owner recommended them because they are made from healthy items, and they are only 3 calories a treat.  The low calorie and healthy ingredients are a big plus when you are feeding them to your dog as a reward for training.<br /><br />The treats are moist, but do not leave a greasy residue on your hands if you are holding a bunch as rewards. The treats have a slight smell, but not anywhere near as much as some of the other moist treats on the market.  They are small in size, but provide quick satisfaction to my 50 pound dog and have really helped her learning process.<br /><br />As an amusing anecdote, my 6 pound Siamese/tiger mix loves the treats as well! Whenever she hears the bag, she comes running and will sit and "assist" me in training the dog, as long as she gets her fair share as well!

review/text: They smell HORRIBLE!  I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell.  I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong.  Call me crazy but "natural" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all.  Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list?  Doesn't sound very natural to me.<br /><br />I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier.

review/summary: Salmon Treats have strong smell
review/text: Sadly my dog is NOT fond of these even though she does like salmon and anything smelly! She will eat them (the first treat she rolled on as she'll do if I give her lox) but she won't do tricks for them and acts as if they were a run of the mill dog food instead of a treat. Both my mate and I found the smell rather unpleasant similar to old B vitamins or really old liver treats, not like salmon..<br />(FYI My is dog is medium sized black mutt.)<br />UPDATE:My dog seems to be getting used to these to some degree she will now do some tricks perhaps she prefers them a little dried out (they are still soft)or even maybe she was addicted to other treats though I usually only give her wheat and gluten free treats like freeze dried liver and dogswell treats..Perhaps she's stil not crazy about them because these treats do have natural gluten in the form of malted barley and ground barley (Not that good for me in terms of cross contamination as I am gluten sensitive and perhaps she is too?) Left a message for Zukes' but never heard back from them.. They are convenient in that they are small

review/summary: Perfect treat for training and other things
review/text: I've bought Zukes Mini Treats, chicken for such a long time.  I heard about it on TV series.  So when I checked at a store, they, to me, were expensive, some sites are better.<br /><br />BUT Amazon, so far, beats all prices.  I never thought that these treats would work so fast, it's amazing. Yes I saw it on TV, since I'm not sure one is allowed to say which series it is, I won't say what it is.<br /><br />First time I bought Zukes, 1 pound, (got two dogs), I bought it long ago, with other products, and like I wrote, both dogs learned fast, everytime I train, or make sure they always are good, mainly outside, they actually know I have those mini Chicken treats...probably the smell, and we have 2 Labs, so I guess it's the smell.<br /><br />First time I used them, it was only when they gave positive reaction.  I was quit surprised it didn't take long as dogs do remember, so when I give command, and they listen, I praise them, give them each the treat.<br /><br />I also got one of those treat packages, comes in handy outside.<br /><br />I have to say they remember better than I do, meaning when I say something new, a new learning thing, it seemed, at at least to me, that they knew if they did it, they'd get a treat.<br /><br />I want to make clear that although on occassion on some dogs, it takes longer to learn, but they do.  But also, there WILL come a time that they just do what they're told, like "not try to dig under fence, or try to go after Cats", that they actually do listen, but when they come inside doggie door when I call them, they sit and wait before going in the house.  So, yes, I give each of them one mini chicken treat.<br />Then they go in the house, and they both play.<br /><br />But in the house, if or when things get out hand, like door bell ringing, the best word for me that I taught was a stern "NO!" that takes their attention off the door.<br /><br />Here's a tip, another thing I used a long time ago...because dogs do what dogs do, meaning we have so many cats in the neighborhood, not easy to get them in the house.<br /><br />I started with a clicker, inside house, they know that clicking sound they get the mini chicken treat.  That, at last for us, WORKS ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say, other than if anyone is going to try the treats, make sure you try the chicken first, they seem, at least our dogs, love that chicken.  One pound of those treats are far better price than 8oz.<br /><br />Just make sure it comes from Amazon, anything over $25.00 you don't pay postage. (unless you don't care about postage, or you're rich..lol )<br /><br />The 3rd parties also, I found, but ONLY SOMETIMES, they also don't charge postage.  What I'm trying to say is if economy is hurting you, then just take the time, as I do, and just check out the prices.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions, or even suggestions as I always like suggestions, please feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Now I feel better doing the review. I should have done more reviews, I plead guilty to that.  In a way, this was fun to do.  Thank you for reading my review, and hope, especially if you have hard time training, hope you try these treats.<br /><br />Just remember THIS, never YELL, or NEVER EVER hit your dog, that is so wrong, especially if it's trained, and somebody wants to pet him/her, the dog will DEFINATELY think he or she might be hit.  Dogs are, indeed, smarter than people realize, and from 1967 til present, I always find out new things about our dogs, as we adopt them, they are wonderful animals to have, they WILL protect you, LOVE you, and do anything for you.<br /><br />I know this to be true..., so believe me when I say Dogs are great, my view is GREAT for us Senior Citizens, they do protect us, and in my case one literally saved my life in July, 2008.<br /><br />So reminding you if anyone has any questions, please ask, or recommendations, that's cool too, always listen to recommendations. :-)

You certainly don't want to walk around with these in your pocket.  We didn't purchase these from Amazon but price is about what we paid.

review/summary: My golden won't touch these treats
review/text: These treats may be great for some dogs, but my golden did not like the taste.  I had hoped to use them as small training treats (such as the BilJac liver treats), but she would have nothing to do with either the peanut butter or the salmon flavor. The salmon variety has a very strong "fishy" smell, too.

review/summary: Sour Smell emailed company
review/text: I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away. I fed the dogs one each then thought I better not give them anymore. I emailed the company and asked if that was normal. Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the "best by" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog. Thank You for<br />your inquiry and for supporting Zuke's!<br /><br />Matt Porray<br />"Bone Counselor"<br />Customer Service<br />Zuke's<br /><br />They date on the bag is for November 2013 so they are well within the expiration date.<br />But I emailed a friend (who in the past has donated many bags of Zukes treats to the dog club I used to belong for training classes) and I asked her the same question she felt they were not safe to feed with them smelling sour (vinegar like). I had never fed the chicken flavor before.<br />I think Iwill be sending these back. I am very disappointed, I don't mind treats that stink I feed a freeze dried green trip treat those really smell. The Zukes didn't smell like something even dogs would eat.

review/summary: Who Says Dog Treats Are Just For Dogs?
review/text: Once again, Zuke's has made a snack that'll give you an attack. I have always been a fan of dog food for as long as I can remember. It is cheap, delicious, and for the most part very easy on the bowels. Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals remind us all that dog treats are yummy for people, too.<br /><br />Zukes is taking us back. Back to the basics. 16 ounces of pure chicken delight, crisp and crunchy. And if you happen to have a dog, this is a treat you can share with your pet. It does not actually taste like chicken, more of a seitan meatloaf, but it tastes better than most chickens I have eaten. (I grew up on a farm in Virginia, so that's a big deal!)<br /><br />Treat yourself to Zuke's chicken-flavored treats. And maybe you can give one to your dog, too!

review/summary: Zero stars if I could
review/text: Less than 24 hours after my four year old dog ate a Zuke's "all-natural" bone, she developed pancreatitis!!! There was no other change in her diet, environment or anything but that Zuke's bone. When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause. Stay away from this and all Zuke's "all-natural" products!

review/summary: First Ingredient: Peanut Butter.... My Dog Loves Them
review/text: WOW.  NOTE:  No Wheat, Corn, Soy, Artificial Colors, Flavors and no Added Fat or By-Products.  On the Label, the first ingredient is Peanut Butter.  Made in USA.<br /><br />My chihuahua loves these things.  Although they are small, they are not as tiny as the berrybuddies we tried first (I don't even know what to do with those, they fall out at alarming rates from the buddy-toys hole).<br /><br />These - - he can chew, it's like he's eating peanut butter for a moment.  He doesn't just woof them down - he actually eats them.  I give him one at a time, and he sits and chews it for 10-20 seconds - much like peanut butter I would imagine.  They fit perfectly in the KONG toys (but not the busybuddy ones, they are smaller holes).<br /><br />The chicken ones were a bit too flavored for him - so I pinch them in half and add a few to his food - then he loves it - mixed with his food & warm water.  I want to try all the flavors!<br /><br />I also like that the company supports a cause with each bag purchased.  Very natural, very chewy little things, and my dog LOVES them.  Very good value.  Will be keeping these around for sure.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: The Zuke's Chicken Flavored Treats are just what I was hoping they would be! I got the chicken flavor (despite other claims of serious odor) because it was the cheapest flavor. My dog LOVES them. Her affinity for them, coupled with their size makes them perfect for training.  They are small little cylinders which are about 1/4" thick and less than 1/2" wide. They are enough to keep her interest, but not too substantial that they distract from training as she's chewing, as usually happens with a biscuit-type treat. They are also great for use inside the Kong Genius Leo (I have a size Large). They are thinner than a similar treat by a different brand which I found at my local Petco. I like that they're smaller because the other ones would get stuck in the tube of the Leo. These slide in and out without much friction at all. I don't find the odor to be as offensive as others have described. The odor is about average for moist treats, in my opinion. In fact, they smell very similar to my cat's treats.  So much so that my cat tries to steal them when I lay them on the floor while the dog is practicing "stay."  Also, you really can't beat the value! Treats can go so quickly when used during training and it's nice to find a quality treat that doesn't break the bank! I will definitely be buying these again!

review/text: These treats are relatively healthy when compared to the competition. They could be better by excluding grains and salt but they are treats after all. These are made in the USA which is a big bonus and they do not contain ethoxyquin which is a harmful preservative found in many dog foods and treats. I usually split these treats into 2 pieces, which is easily done just by squishing the 2 ends together. This makes my puppy feel like he's getting more treats.

review/text: Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.  She immediately loved them.  Since puppies have such short attention spans and require so much training, I need to use them frequently!  They are very reasonably priced compared to most products found in pet stores and have all natural healthy ingredients.  The small size of these treats allows you to get great use out of them, while giving them to your dog frequently for good behavior.  You won't need to constantly replenish your supply either.

review/text: A pound of training treats at this price is a good deal. I like everything about the treats including the size. They are NOT too tiny for my Great Dane and I can use a lot of them without filling him up and expanding his waist.  He loves the flavor, the smell is strong enough to entice without being offensive. The peanut butter flavor has not upset his sensitive stomach. They arent messy on your hands or in your pockets. They will dry out if left outside the package for any length of time so I usually separate some into a small tupperware type container for home and into small ziploc bags for carrying to classes or on walks. I will sometimes put a handful in my pocket and these actually survive the washing machine (not sure if that is good or bad).

He has also always completely destroyed any stuffed squeaker toy he has ever touched in a matter of minutes.  Not with these babies around. One whiff and the toy is forgotten; no fighting, no biting, no stuffing to pick up.  These are magic!  I only wish I'd known about them a decade sooner. Thanks.

When Bella was little I used small pieces of hot dogs but I wanted to switch to something healthier.  Zuke's mini treats seem to work really well.  I use the chicken flavored ones and I am really impressed with both how much the dogs like them and how much they smell like real food.  I thought that I would make this quick video to show the treats (and my dogs) in action.

review/summary: Great Treats! Our lab loves them.
review/text: These are great treats. I echo what other reviewers have said that they are great for training and you can't beat the fact that they are so low in calories. We previously tried Milk Bone Dry Treats and a few semi-soft options - all bigger treats, but these tasty little treats appear to be our labs favorite.<br /><br />Will only buy Zuke's in the future!

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: Let me start by saying my dog weighs 24 lbs but should be 17 lbs. I make this point because she is overweight and will eat anything.I purchased these treats because they are low calorie, all natural and had great reviews. I tried for 3 days but she wouldn't eat even 1 little morsel.Obviously I was disappointed and also shocked like I stated she's 7 years old and will eat anything. Maybe the bag I received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage.

review/summary: Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken
review/text: Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.<br /><br />While almost everything "tastes like chicken" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit.

review/summary: would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

review/summary: LOVE IT - and so do both my dogs, even the picky one!
review/text: Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a "variety."<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.  But it gets better later  :)  But whatever the dogs like and is safe to eat works for me!

review/summary: Sad to see it go, even the cat was sold!
review/text: When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.  My dog started having bowel issues - she'd get bloated and gassy, and have diarrhea at least once a day.  I seriously fought for this treat - I researched every dang ingredient in it to disprove of it being the cause and I'm here to tell you,  Zuke's is definitely giving us our money's worth.  But after 48 Zuke's free hours - her digestive disorders vanished completely.  It's not Zuke's fault and I am not at all bad mouthing their product, I still think it's the bomb.com!  I'm only sharing because I couldn't find one other person out there with the same unusual experience.  If it happens(ed) to anyone else, know that I'm jammin' some "Against All Odds" for both of us!

review/text: Our 10 month old mixed breed is a very picky eater. After trying a few different brands of dog treats someone suggested we try Zuke's because of the high protein and natural ingredients. Our puppy loves them!  The treats are small enough that I don't have to worry about breaking them up for training. There is a very strong smell with these treats, but it actually helps because our puppy comes running when I open the bag. I will be buying more flavors in the future.

review/summary: Spanish Crispy Treat
review/text: I pulled the trigger and decided to order these since I could not order my regular brand, Ines Rosales Tortas. If you are familiar with the Spanish Tortas, then you will be happy to know that this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />Compared to the Ines Rosales brand the Matiz Andaluz Torta seems a little darker but it does not detract from the flavor.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with this version of the Spanish Torta, it is basically taking dough with a high olive oil content that has been sweetened with sugar, anise and sesame seeds and baked until crisp. In the Matiz Andaluz Torta, the anise is a subtle afterthought after chewing a couple of times and it is a nice complement to the sugary and olive oil-flavored dough. Generally, I am not a fan of anise, but somehow I enjoy it in this food. I really enjoy tortas as a snack or with coffee and at 123 calories it's not bad on the waistline.<br />The only bad thing, and I don't know whether this is Amazon or the shipper or because of the trans-atlantic crossing, is that all the tortas arrived broken. But then again the Tortas are fragile. In a sense, though, it doesn't really matter since you have to break them anyway to eat, but just FYI. If you are looking for something light as a snack but want something not available at every bodega, you should give these a try as I believe you will be pleasantly surprised.

review/text: These cookies have virtually no flavor.  You know the saying, they "taste like cardboard"  Sadly there is no potential for chocolate bliss.  The outside of the cookies are a pale shade of brown almost grey.  Inside they are darker.  I don't know why that is.  They are a crunchy cookie (but not hard) with chocolate chips that are large in comparison to the size of the cookie.  The cookies themselves are bite sized.<br /><br />Out of all the Newman's Own Family Recipe cookies that I have tried my favorite to date is their Ginger Snaps.  They have heat & a pleasant bite to them plus bits of chewy ginger.  In second place is their Orange Chocolate Chip cookies.  These smell so wonderful & the orange flavor stands out.  Last we have this sorry lot.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars because 2 stars means "I don't like" them.  So while I don't actually hate them, I don't want to eat them again.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Curbs Cravings
review/text: My struggle to lose weight and keep it off has been going for a few years with varying degrees of success (-40, +10, -20, +6, etc).  I've found that one of the best tools for fighting naughty cravings is a scrumptious low-calories treat.  This bar is perfect for those times that chocolate is beckoning and your willpower is dwindling.  It's not super-chocolaty, but it is sweet enough to curb cravings and keep me on track.  I like that it contains a reasonable amount of fiber and a nice serving of protein.  These are perfect to keep at school or the office for an afternoon snack.  I also keep them on hand for an after-dinner treat.<br /><br />One thing to note is that these bars are on the tiny size.  They're a bit bigger than a fun-size candy bar, but not by much.  I wouldn't use these as meal replacement bars because they're definitely not big enough (nor are they touted as meal replacement bars--just a head's up).<br /><br />I try to avoid sugar when consuming protein bars and shakes, but have yet to find the perfect bar that doesn't have the artificial aftertaste.  Yleck!  While this bar does have some sugar (7 grams), it's not sugar-packed and, honestly, a bit of sugar seems to help me prevent overeating.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend giving these a shot if you're looking for a low-calorie bar that is tasty and helps prevent cravings.

This one is a nice in-between snack.  It's soft and has a chocolate flavor.  Now my problem is to keep my kids from stealing them.  They love the bars, but don't need them since they are so thin.

review/summary: A YUMMY, Deliciously Decedant but, HEALTHY Treat! YUM!!
review/text: I bought these terrific little treats not because I needed something to fill a sugar/sweet craving while dieting but, because I was looking for something yummy that would be somewhat "healthy" yet still be able to satisfy my cravings for chocolate! These little gems are PERFECT for only 100 calories per bar with 6 grams of protein & 6 grams of fiber!<br /><br />They're not super sugary sweet nor, do they taste like cardboard like some of those carb energy bars that you can buy at your local gym or GNC. Yuck!<br /><br />These bars do seem quite small at first (3� inches long) but, because of it's soft chewy almond nougat (it's NOT chewy like taffy-like as one reviewer had stated) and the peices of almonds throughout; coated in luscious, rich dark chocolate; you'll find yourself chewing more slowly; savoring each bite! My sweet cravings were truly satisfied after taking my time to enjoy South Beach Diet's- Whipped Chocolate Almond Snack Bars!<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweet & healthy alternative to satisfy a craving,  these will do the trick! If you're dieting & need something to help get you through the day until dinner, these bars are sure to fill that desire for something sweet & provide enough carbs, fiber & protien to get you there!<br /><br />These bars ARE a bit on the expensive side but if you compare them to what you'd normally pay for a candy bar, the price is right!

review/text: These bars are so delicious.  They are light but at the same time satisfying.  I would just as soon have one of these as a candy bar.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: These bars taste pretty good. While they don't make me feel as though I've died and gone to heaven, they make a fairly filling and relatively tasty snack.<br /><br />The bar is chewy, and I like that. The chocolate isn't the best in the world, but it's OK. Don't expect big chunks of almonds, because you'll be disappointed. However, there is just enough of an almond taste to make you know that flavor is there.<br /><br />This was a Gold Box deal, so the price was good. However, I don't think I would order them at the regular price, because they're not that fantastic. Actually, I like the peanut butter bars better.  Also, if I did decide to order them again, I would wait until winter. Where I am, when a package with chocolate bars is left on a front porch for any length of time, they melt! I put all the boxes in the fridge, and they hardened again, so my money wasn't wasted.

review/summary: um...okay
review/text: I bought these as a gold box lightning deal and got the case for 26 bucks.  They are okay...kind of like a chewier 3 muskateers bar.  Would not buy again, but we will eat them.  As far as I could tell there are no actual almonds in there.

review/summary: Tasty Low Carb Snack Bar
review/text: Having lost 15 lbs in the past 2 months on a low-carb diet, I have tried several brands of meal replacement bars and snacks. The South Beach Whipped Chocolate Almond Snack Bar is very good. It tastes like a candy bar to me. I am not sure why there are some complaints about the flavor of this bar, but maybe some reviewers have not eaten very many different types of bars... or they are eating ones that are out of date...<br /><br />This is marketed as a low-carb snack bar, and is not vitamin fortified, so they don't have to cover over the taste of all of those vitamins. At 100 calories, like me, you may have to limit a snack to half a bar, but they are so tasty that you might find it difficult to try to limit your consumption... I like the flavor better than the Special K chocolate Peanut snack bar (which is vitamin fortified) both having similar numbers with the Special K bar having more sugar... I do eat both bars for variety!<br /><br />I recommend trying any new bar in a small box to make sure you like it and are not sensitive to any of the ingredients before buying a whole case...<br /><br />See my other reviews for more chocolate-based low carb meal replacement bars and snacks!

review/summary: Gah! It tastes like paste!
review/text: So. Three stars for the fiber and protein and low sugar content all rolled up in 100 calories. But, wait. The taste. Oh.My.God. It is like glue and chemicals and you had better not attempt to eat this thing without a bottled water in your other hand. I almost choked trying to get this sticky, pasty mess down my throat. Bummer! Now I'm back to square one, looking for a low-cal bar with both protein and fiber that tastes good, or at least decent. This bar tastes BAD.

review/text: It really is la candy bar, but at least you get 6 grams of protein in your 100 calories.  Make sure product is fresh!

review/summary: suitable for my purposes
review/text: My boyfriend and I were each over 430 lbs because we ate Mcdonalds every day but then we slimmed down to around 160 in about 3 weeks, and that's because we switched to south beach diet. I eat the almond chocolate bars as my sole source of sustenance and I continue to have results.

review/summary: Traditional Mate
review/text: Ok. I love mate. I drink it every morning and most evenings. I run through it like mad. If you are new to drinking mate I would NOT recommend drinking this. I, personally, would buy it again b/c I's so accustomed to mate that I like all it's flavors and I drink it so often the price is good for me but this brand tastes MUCH more smokey than other brands. It definitely has that 'dirt and leaves' flavor so many people complain about mate. If you've never tried mate before I'd recommend Union Suave, EcoTeas Green Energy unsmoked mate, or Guayaki mate. Those brands are must more smooth and better for a first impression. Happy drinking!
