review/summary: What's inside?
review/text: Kellogg's cereals contain genetically modified organisms. Those are crops that have been altered in a laboratory by splicing in DNA from bacteria or toxins. They don't want you to know that, so they have spent over 600,000 dollars to fight against your right to know. Ninety percent of Americans want labels on food that contain GMO's. I would not buy Kellogg's cereals until they are labeled or stop using GMO's.

Not only does Lloyd like this food, but he also holds it down well.  In addition, he has his spring back, is more lively, and doesn't seem like an older dog at all.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Skeptical at First, but Now a Big Fan
review/text: My dog was initially skeptical about these thick, square, rather bulky biscuit and the first few days actually snubbed the product entirely.<br /><br />What he was doing and I later caught on to this was chewing them after lights out and after I'd gone to bed. I finally realized this when I awoke hearing a definite crunch by my bedside. I was very happy to see him eating and actually enjoying this pretty good quality snack.<br /><br />After the secret was out, he no longer kept them for bedtime chewing  but accepted them at any time I offered them.<br /><br />There are no wheat, corn, chicken or poultry by-products and when you see the overwhelming number of snack of poor nutrition, it's nice to experiment with healthier treats.<br /><br />These are large so this particular biscuit probably wouldn't be right for a little puppy, maybe a larger breed older puppy.

review/summary: best GF oats I've tried!
review/text: These are by far my favorite gluten free oats that I have tried.  I prefer them over Bob's Red Mill and one other smaller brand that is currently on the market.  I prefer them due to the fact that they are a bit sweeter and thinner cut than the others.  They really are the most like Quaker oatmeal (which is what I grew up on).  So if you like(d) Quaker oats but now need to have certified gluten free oats- this is your best substitution!  You will love to be able to make oatmeal cookies once again!

review/summary: Organic Gluten Free Oats!!!
review/text: I was so excited to find these on Amazon; I have been waiting for a company to start growing GF oats, that are also organic, for so long!  High praises to the Gluten Free Oats company for being the first (to my knowledge) in offering these.  It just seems logical that folks who have food intolerances and/or allergies, would also be very conscientious about the quality of their food.  So it baffles me why so many GF foods are not also organic.  So glad this company took the initiative.  My Celiac daughter and I were so delighted to have oatmeal for the first time in years. The oats are very fresh tasting and cook up nicely for oatmeal.  The oats cooked up nicely in pancakes too.  I pre-soaked them in rice milk and the result was that the oats completely blended in and there was no discernible texture to the oats once the pancakes were cooked.  I actually would have preferred a little texture, so next time I will make pancakes without pre-soaking the oats.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that the bag had "popped" open during shipping.  It was packed with other items and a heavy item probably squished the bag until it popped.  So sad to see 1/3+ of a bag wasted, but Amazon was great and quickly sent me a new bag.  I intended to order another bag or two tonight, but see that they are already out of stock!  Guess I'm not the only one who has been waiting for organic, GF oats.

review/summary: Quick, but not old fashioned.
review/text: Like other reviewers, we are extremely grateful to GF Harvest for bringing organic, gluten-free oats to market. We have now gotten three shipments of their oats. Our first two orders were not for rolled oats, but for organic GF Oat Groats, which we purchased directly from the GF Harvest website. Since we are lucky enough to have a grain mill and an oat roller/flaker, we were able to make our own rolled oats, oat flour, and even some crumbled oats (that we liked to pretend were steel-cut). The results: possibly the best-tasting oats that we've ever had, GF or not, crumbled or not. Creamy, sweet, and fresh. In the past, we had used GF oat groats purchased from Cream Hill Estates and Gifts of Nature, but these were mediocre. We have also consumed tons of GF steel-cut and rolled oats from Bob's Red Mill, as well as McCann's, but these were also nowhere near as good as the rolled and/or crumbled oats we made from the GF Harvest groats. Unfortunately, the GF Harvest organic rolled oats are also nowhere near as good as the GF Harvest groats. They just don't have the same fresh, sweet taste that we got from the  oat groats. Also, these are not, as the label claims, "Old Fashioned" rolled oats. Flakes as thin as these should really be labeled "quick" oats (which are bound to lose both flavor and nutritional value, simply because of their thinness). We hope that GF Harvest begins to produce true "thick" rolled or steel-cut organic GF oats (BRM produces both "thick" and "quick" GF rolled oats, which, unfortunately, are not organic). Either "thick" oats or steel-cut would do a much better job of retaining the flavor and nutrition of the groats. In the meantime, GF Harvest should really correct the labeling on these rolled oats to reflect the fact that they're actually "quick"  rather than "old fashioned".

review/summary: These oats are excellent!
review/text: I have been ordering from amazon for years and this is my first review of a product. I felt really compelled to share my experience and thoughts.<br /><br />When I first received this product, I had a few questions about the outer packaging. I called someone from amazon, but she couldn't answer my questions. I then called the company of Gluten Free Harvest directly and the lady there was so helpful! I have to say the customer service was excellent! After cooking with the oats (bread, pancakes, cookies, and oatmeal), I love the quality and taste of them. What I love most is that the oats are gluten-free  AND organic; I have yet to find a company that has both. Before my 41 oz bag was empty, I ordered a 25 pound box from the company directly and just received it a couple of days ago. Lastly, we have a gluten-free bakery nearby and I recently inquired about the type of oats they use in their foods. The owner said she buys her oats from  a small company in Wyoming and shared the name of THIS company.  We then talked a few minutes about the company and she is very happy with the fact that they are GF and organic.

So glad to find this. Very easy to make, nice texture and flavor. Add some organic raisins or berries and a bit of coconut milk and no sweetener is required at all. I have not tried baking with them yet, but can tell from the texture of the oats that they will make great cookies.<br /><br />Oatmeal raisin used to be my husband's favorite before being diagnosed with celiac, so maybe I will surprise him for our anniversary in a few days!

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I have not had oatmeal or my beloved oatmeal raisin cookies in two years, since shortly after my celiac diagnosis. Although there are companies that offer GF oats, GF HARVEST is the first, to my knowledge (and I've looked everywhere), to offer ORGANIC, GF oats. Since we eat an organic, as well as GF diet, we haven't been able to enjoy oats.<br /><br />Until now. I waited impatiently for these to arrive, and they were even better than my memories! The taste was rich, nutty, and delicious--even without the raw cream and maple syrup. The texture was a little softer than I like, but it was still good. Prior to my celiac diagnosis, we preferred rough-cut oats, which keep a very hearty texture after cooking. These oats did disintigrate a little, leaving a softer, more porridge-y texture. The texture was in no way a deal breaker though.<br /><br />I also made GF oatmeal raisin cookies with these. I soaked the oats in whey for a day (to make them more digestible), then dehydtrated them in my dehydrator. I ground some of the oats into flour and kept the rest whole for the cookies. They were incredibly good. My non-GF husband loved them as much as I did!<br /><br />I know I'm lame for being so excited over oatmeal (although I bet a lot of you celiacs get it!), but I can't recommend this highly enough!

They are very smooth and have a good taste.<br /><br />The only downside I've found is that they do seem to contain some hulls. More than any other gluten free oats that I've tried, unfortunately. In one serving of oats I always find at least 3 hulls, but usually it's more like 5 or 6. I'm sure you could just swallow them, but I don't like the texture while chewing, so I just spit them out.<br /><br />I will keep buying them, though! I like the taste, and like I said earlier, I haven't found any other place that sells gluten free, organic oats.

review/summary: Taste good but bad consistency
review/text: I used to get these oats when I first started eating GF.  However after eating steel cuts oats for a year or more I wanted a break and went back to rolled oats.  These oats taste good but have a consistency not unlike mashed potatoes.  One reviewer described the oatmeal as "creamy."  I don't think oatmeal should be creamy.  I want my oats to "fight back" a bit more than that when I eat them.  I have ordered GF oats from nuts.com and will re-order from them when my current order is finished.

review/summary: Very good GF breakfast treat
review/text: This is very good but takes some getting used to consistency wise. Gluten makes oatmeal thicken up and this stuff seems to get a little watery. But it is still a great product and if you sweeten it a bit, it is quite delicious.

review/summary: Coffee-Mate Hazelnut Powdered Coffee Creamer (Pk of 6 15-oz Containers)
review/text: I have been using this product for some time from grocery stores and have found it to be very flavorful.<br /><br />I recently ordered the product from Amazon because of the ever increasing prices of the product on my local grocery store shelves. My order of 6 each of the product was well-packed, promptly shipped, and because of the no-shipping-charge-policy of Amazon for this quantity, was well below the unit cost at my local grocery stores.  I am well satisfied, snd will order again when I have used up the product, if there is no price increase.

review/text: I am not a salt person - I'm on high blood pressure meds, yes, but have never been a big fan of salt except on french fries and onion rings (which I allow myself only infrequently) anyway.  It's hard to find good quality nuts of any kind that are unsalted.  These are first quality AND unsalted.  I eat them out of the can when I can't resist, but I mostly use them in stir-fry concoctions (the bottled sauces I use generally have way too much sodium all by themselves).  They are excellent with shrimp or with scallops.  Good stuff and the AMZN price (plus no tax and no shipping) makes them much more reasonable than local stores.

review/text: I discovered Brent and Sam's Cookies long ago, in a store that has a specialty food section.  I would buy all they had, (usually 3 boxes), of the Lime White Chocolate, and then hope I didn't run out before they got more.<br />I tried all of the flavors, they are all excellent, but the Key Lime White Chocolate was my favorite. This is a small sized (2 bite) crunchy cookie filled with white chocolate chips that your teeth slide thru during a crunchy bite.  The delicate flavor of Lime is just outstanding with the white chocolate.  The best cookies in the world, made with all natural ingredients. They freeze very well, so now I always have a good supply.

Some areas of treated moss on concrete slab still haven't shown any signs of die-off even after three heavy-dose applications. For some reason, it seems to work better on vertical surfaces. On the whole it's been an unimpressive performer to date.  Not sure what 'Safer' name is supposed to infer, but reading the label there's still plenty of warnings as to how dangerous this stuff is to humans and animals, so beware if you have pets that can get access to any of the treated areas you have. Shipped frozen from the seller I chose, so had to wait a day or so before I could use.

review/summary: Not bad for the price
review/text: I was surprised that this sauce had flavor. Even the few clams that were in it ,were not overcooked and chewy like most made in the Usa sauces are. Still for the price here on subscribe and save it comes out pretty reasonable. I can still remember when I was younger, that this sauce was imported from Italy. Not anymore. So, if you can doctor it up a bit with your own fresh spices, this is not bad as a base for your pasta sauce.

review/summary: Sirloin Tips treats
review/text: My dogs find these dog treats very tasty, but then they are dogs and find most anything tasty. The treats are advertised as "moist and meaty" and that is why I bought them. I wanted something soft that I could insert my dog's pill into. Unfortunately, they are not soft enough to push a pill into. At 1/2"x3/4" in size, they are big enough that I can drill a hole into the treat and put the pill in. (the pill is small) They are soft enough to cut with a sharp knife into smaller pieces if you wish (for smaller dogs). I would not consider these treats as 'moist' but they are not hard or crunchy. Saying 'moist' makes you think they have moisture or are squishy but they do/are not. They look like little cubes of marbled meat.

review/summary: My dog loves Sirloin Tips
review/text: My dog loves the Vitakraft Sirloin Tips.  I ordered them after our vet gave her a couple at the end of an exam. They are soft textured, not crispy and about 3/4" cubes.  Since my dog weighs 7 lbs, I cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife.  This is very easy to do.  She could eat the whole thing at once but I get a lot more milage from them and I think she enjoys them for longer too.  Of course, they have nothing to do with real sirloin.  Still she does love them and they are a great value.

review/summary: Delicious Organic Vegetarian Mushroom Soup (Chowder)
review/text: We bought 4 boxes of this for my husband's (quite elderly) grandmother. She didn't like it, I suspect because it's got a mild flavour, has no msg and is on the less salty side of things. But we loved it! Rich, creamy, thick with little chunks of mushrooms. Doesn't taste like it was made from a powder! Follow the instructions and cook for maybe even a little longer than package says.

review/summary: only a hint of flavour
review/text: Been a fan of Stash teas, but I never ventured into the flavored teas. I am always affraid of the flavor taking over the tea part of it. This one I have to be honest had a hint of the Vanilla flavor. Sometimes I think I am only smeling it, and not tasting it. It is perfect, but that's just me. The one star taken out, is the decaf part of it. I think if they made it in regular it will give me more buzz :)

review/summary: Really good, for decaf
review/text: I'd received a sample of Stash's English Breakfast Decaf with a previous order from Stash's website, and I knew it was good (for decaf tea, which is always missing something -- I think it's the caffeine.)  The price on this multipack was so good, that I could give a couple boxes away (which I did, cause I can't go through that much decaf tea in a year) and still save money over buying it in the supermarket.

review/text: I personally like loose tea best or Tazo better than this, but I live in a town where loose tea is hard to come by and I am trying to cut down on caffeine, so this tea works for me.  It definitely has the typical english tea flavor, like you find at a national trust property or a museum's tea house.  Amazon definitely has the best deal right now.  Overall, I am happy with this tea and will purchase it again from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Decaf Tea
review/text: I have a tolerance problem with caffein and usually decaf tea is weak and flavorless, not this Stash decaf Chai.  You can brew it for a long time and it doesn't get bitter like some teas.  It is delicious. I add a couple splenda packets and some hot milk and I'm set.  It's very, very good.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I have a hard time finding it at my local grocery stores. I go through a box a week so buying in bulk doesn't seem to be a big deal.<br />I find that it's good iced too.

review/text: I can't say if I like it's formulation more or less than the bigelow and twinning's earl grey teas because it's so different that to me, I wouldn't have guessed it was 'earl grey' in a blind taste test (since I'm so used to the bigelow and twinnings formulations).  It's definitely a lot stronger than the other two in taste.

review/summary: Not impressed by this tea
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

review/text: I love Earl Grey Tea. I have tried Tazo, Twinings and other Earl Grey teas and they are all good.  The caffiene-free Stash is a step above the rest for two reasons - better taste and no need to worry about drinking it several hours before bed time.  Best way to get the flavor from any bagged black tea is to microwave a cup of water for 2.5 minutes and immediately "throw" the tea in it from a distance.
