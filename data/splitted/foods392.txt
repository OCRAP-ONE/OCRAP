review/summary: so gross!
review/text: I can't believe how gross these bars are!  They sounded pretty good, and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd give them a try.  I sure wish I hadn't!!!  Now I am stuck with a whole box, and I couldn't even gag one of them down.  They have the worst aftertaste.  It doesn't even taste like edible food.  They are greasy and taste like vomit.  Sorry to sound so dramatic, but I want to prevent you from making the same mistake I did and save you your money.  Don't buy them!!!<br /><br />ps- is there anybody out there who actually likes them and wants to buy a case minus 1 off of me?!  I'll sell them for cheap!!  :0)

review/summary: Another organic bar, but its HALF fat.
review/text: This bar has 265 calories and 135 from fat.  I know, I know, its organic!!  Sorry just because its organic and natural doesn't mean that it can be 50% fat and be good for you.  If you like the taste fine, but be honest you're eating it for the taste, about the same calories and fat content as a Dove candy bar.

review/summary: Best overall organic bar
review/text: I've tried most of the organic bars on the market to date. I consider the "Organic Food Bar"  brand to be the gold standard, and I've enjoyed them for years. The Raw Revolution bars are proving to be just as good, and they are considerably cheaper. At the moment, Amazon is tied for the cheapest price I've seen for Organic Food Bars: 0.97 cents/ounce.<br />Amazon has the cheapest price I've seen for Raw Revolution bars: 0.60 cents/ounce! That is over a 30% difference. Its 1.31 for a 2.2 oz bar. Retail is 1.99/bar; and that is what they are on the Raw Revolution website, too.<br /><br />I love the taste; it had not occurred to me that some folks wouldn't like them until I read some of the reviews here. Then again, it is easy for me to learn to like foods that are healthy. Both of these bar lines seem high in fat to me (my dieting Mom won't eat them), but it is all healthy fat. I would like to see more of a Zone diet ratio (more protein).  They could have a bit less sweet for my taste, but that goes for every bar I've ever tried.<br /><br />Its funny (and makes so much sense) that Raw Revolution has so many chocolate flavors. Also, the Raw Revolution folks I met at the Outdoor Retailer show were some of the nicest folks; very liberal with their samples, too ;-).<br /><br />I wish that health food stores (and online merchants) would post the price per ounce for the plethora of bars that are out there. Maybe they don't want to draw attention to how expensive many of these products are! I am very resistant to paying over a dollar an ounce for bars, especially when these all organic, high quality bars are less than that.<br /><br />So the dollar an ounce limit for a 2.4 ounce bar is $2.40; for a 2.2 ounce bar it is $2.20, and so forth.<br /><br />For good bars that are only .41/ounce on Amazon, you can't beat Clif bars, 70% organic; a good staple. Probably the healthiest food at 7-11, if you're hungry and stuck. Clif Builder bars (chocolate) are good too; more of a "normal" chocolate crunchy bar.<br />Cheers!<br />Wasatch Bill

review/summary: NOT a granola bar!
review/text: I bought one box each of the raspberry/chocolate and hazelnut/chocolate bars looking for a healthy aternative to the grocery store granola bars that contain high fructose corn syrup.  Somehow, I thought they would have a granola bar type of texture, but they aren't even close.  My first reaction was that they had an unpleasant smell and funny aftertaste - but that was my first reaction to beer, too, and I managed to get over that.  They are definitely an adult, acquired-taste kind of snack.  Now I look forward to having one as a mid-afternoon snack, depending on what I've already eaten or plan to eat that day, because they are a fairly high calorie (276), high fat (15g) little treat.  Probably their best contribution to one's overall diet is the protein (7 grams or 13% DV).

review/summary: Better than I expected!
review/text: These bars are quite good actually.  They are chocolatey and you can taste the coconut and nuts, but they are not sickeningly sweet like most coconut & chocolate bars.  Plus they are moist and the size of the bar is just right. If you are expecting a candy bar type item you will be disappointed - this is not dipped in chocolate, rather the chocolate is mixed right in.  But if you're looking for a healthy snack that energizes you without the sugar burnout you get from other 'energy' bars then these are worth a try. I am quite pleased with them and am going to order some more.

review/text: This is by far my favorite of the all the raw foods bars I've tried. The coconut-cashew dominate most of the flavor and texture of this delicious, rich and unbelievably nutritious bar.

Don't pass on this bar whether you're into raw food or not. Superb.

review/summary: Incredibly filling!  Low GI
review/text: I don't know what the GI is for these bars, but they really manage to keep me full for hours.  I split one for breakfast and a snack a few hours later, and it does the trick.  When I start my day off with a Luna bar, i am hungry just an hour later. They are sweetenned with Agave nectar which does not affect your blood sugar as much as sugar, nothing artificial and everything organic and raw makes these actually good for you!  They do taste a lot like figs and cashew butter, which might turn some people off but I think its delicious!  Raspberry Chocolate flavor is amazing too.  Calorie count is 276, which is fine for breakfast and lunch combined.

review/summary: Good, but  not the best!
review/text: First off, I have no "acquired taste" for raw food or anything of that sort. I do eat meat and cooked food, but I also like to eat healthy foods. I tried these bars as an alternative to the highly processed crackers and cookies that I usually have for a snack away from home.<br /><br />The chocolate taste is a little bitter, but I got used to it after a while. Coconut and cashews are plentiful enough, as far as I'm concerned. Texture is much like a walnut brownie, if you will, but fortunately this is healthier and has no refined sugar. It's a delightful and filling snack or morning to midday meal. Lacks a bit in coconut taste; I prefer the Coconut and Agave for that.

I gave the Hazelnut and Chocolate bars only 4 stars because I thought they were a bit doughy (uncooked!)and had a somewhat sweet/sour taste. Overall, I liked them a lot. They're excellent for people who want to avoid gluten and diary!

I've had other raw chocolate bars that taste like reconstituted hay -- but this is rich, full-flavored and very satisfying. Unlike the reviewer above I've tried the spirulina bars as well, and there is QUITE a difference between the two. I love the spirulina as well, and a friend of mine who has picky kids says they love both. Pretty cool!

review/summary: Surprisingly Great
review/text: I first tried these when the organic co-op I belong to had them displayed for sale during pick-ups. I love the flavor, I've only tried 2 or 3 but this is my favorite. I keep them in the car and at work as a healthy alternative when I'm hungry but can't get to a meal. One day I was driving home from work and was starving and had half a bar and was totally satisfied! Also these don't dry out, I often eat half a bar then eat the other half later and somehow they stay super moist. Maybe it's oil or something bad, I'm not sure, but it works great for me. Reading some of the 1 star reviews it seems some people just don't like the flavor. I was lucky and got to try out 3 bars before deciding on a favorite flavor. I wouldn't suggesting buying a 12-pack for a sampling, however I haven't found these sold in stores (just started looking) so not sure where you would taste... I think this is a good price too, or at least it's cheaper than my co-op sells them for! And love the subscribe and save option too...

review/summary: A bit rich for my liking
review/text: I'm a fairly frequent consumers of various types of bars as snacks -- I do a lot of running and they always seem like a good, easy way to fit in a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack without having to walk to the cafeteria at the other end of the building.I think of myself as having a fairly high tolerance for weird protein bars and "food products," but the Raw Revolution Cashew and Agave Nectar bar seems like it might be a bar too far over the edge for me.<br /><br />Obviously, this bar is not competing with the typical chocolate-covered energy bar, because the wrapper is covered with references to "organic," "live," "raw" etc.<br /><br />I bought one of the Cashew and Agave Nectar bars out of a vending machine, and it was kind of unusual compared to my typical Cliff Builder bar, or Zone bar, or regular Clif bar. First, the 2.2 oz bar itself is pretty small, especially given the fact that that little bar contains 290 calories. Second, it's pretty oily. It felt almost slippery when I opened the package. The bar itself is a block of tannish brown with small lighter chunks that are evidently cashew bits. It is firm, but soft. None of these are showstoppers for me, just different.<br /><br />However, a major difference appears when you start to eat it. Energy bars -- across the board -- are often criticized for being candy bars masquerading as nutritious. Yes, they may have good-for-you ingredients, but eating a couple of them a day delivers a LOT of calories and carbs. So I often break one in half, and have part in the morning, part in the afternoon. When I opened the Raw Revolution bar and saw how small it was, I thought, "Oh, great, 290 is on the high end for a bar like this, and I'll want to eat the whole thing because it's so small." Not so. to me, this was RICH. So rich, I almost had trouble eating more than a couple of bites.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is amazingly short: organic cashew, dates, agave nectar, almonds, sprouted flax seed. All "100% raw."<br /><br />I guess the target audience is more interested in the ingredients and preparation than in the taste. I found it okay, rather bland, but with sort of weird bitter after-taste (I think that may be the dates) and after-texture (may be the bits of sprouted flax seed suspended in the date substance). And although it isn't bad, the excessive richness of the thing keeps you from having another bite very quickly, so you just sort of sit there and ponder what's going on in your mouth, not all of which is expected, or necessarily pleasant. It's a bit sticky/chewy, but again, not in the way a bar with caramel or corn syrup would. Probably better for you than those things are, but unusual, and to me, off-putting.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think I'd buy another one of these. It wasn't horrible, but I didn't like it all that much.

review/summary: AMAZING FOOD
review/text: I don't even want to call it Raw Food, and rather call it Amazing Food, because these bars taste better than any processed or refined energy or nutrition bar, along with a lot of healthy raw foods that don't come in a package. I have been ordering these with Amazon's subscribe and save for several months, and each box delivered has not waned my appetite. The people making these are doing something that others aren't, you can really respect the attention to flavor/texture and even packaging of these bars. The wrappers are inviting and not at all messy - foil wrapped on the inside to preserve all that is good about this amazing food. I've been ordering the Chocolate & Coconut, along with the Spirulina & Cashew, and often have an impatient battle in my mind on which to pack in my bag to take to work or school. They are amazing.<br /><br />Recently, I have also noticed that they have changed the shape of these bars (they are still 2.2oz and the wrapper size is the same) but the bars are now a more elongated rectangular shape. Previously, they had been more square, which didn't make eating it difficult, but the change is welcome because bites are now more uniform. But I wasn't nitpicking on it before, rather giving regard to the consideration the manufacturer has given to producing these - they are just getting better and better.<br /><br />They fill you up in a good way. Amazingly recommended.

review/summary: a very pleasant surprise
review/text: I originally went on amazon to purchase some bars from Go Raw, which I'd only recently tried for the first time. Naturally, while I was looking for those, amazon recommended Raw Revolution's bars as a product others had also viewed/purchased. So, I ordered a couple boxes of them, since they seemed like a good value. When they arrived in yesterday's mail, I was very pleasantly surprised when I tried the Coconut Chocolate flavor in particular. The Spirulina bar is also satisfying; the Coconut Chocolate was my instant favorite, however.<br /><br />I love the simple, whole-food based ingredients, and the sense of nutrient density that comes in each bar. I am sure that when I use them for their intended purpose, during extended athletic competitions or during a long round of disc (frisbee) golf, or during a game of ultimate frisbee, they will be even more appreciated.<br /><br />If you're looking to get away from the high fructose corn syrup sweetened bars and or want to just get something that is easy, very healthful, and tasty, these bars should be great for you.

(300 cal for the chocolate coconut variety)<br />And they don't have refined sugar, but the dates and agave nectar add a lot of fructose... again, taste great, not low-cal.  I've tried the chocolate coconut, chocolate raspberry and coconut agave varieties and they're all good.  They're quite a bit like a brownie, but not as cloyingly sweet.  They're not sticky, crunchy or crumbly either, which makes them perfect for taking into meetings or class.  I eat them for breakfast or post-workout.

review/summary: Better flavor than the cashew bars
review/text: These bars have a pasty consistancy and are greasy with a slightly off-taste (in my opinion).  They are very sweet and are, indeed, filling so they are great in the car when trying to avoid fast-food but I only like them enough to use them as a last resort.  Great ingredients though and probably very good for the body.

review/summary: yummy!
review/text: Since not everybody loves these, I thought I would try to write a review with enough information to help others determine if they might like them as much as I do. I used to struggle with sugar cravings. I've found over the years that if I implement a relatively low carb diet by completely avoiding most sugar-laden items, I have no cravings whatsoever. This discovery has allowed me to lose a lot of weight. It has also made me lose my sweet tooth. These bars are perfect for me because they don't taste that sweet and because they don't trigger those old sugar cravings. For some reason, Larabars bring back those old sugar cravings. When I get a box of Larabars, they call to me all the time (those of you with cravings will know exactly what I mean). But with Raw Revolution bars, I can enjoy one without having a craving that makes me want to grab another right away.<br /><br />If you like the taste of really dark chocolate that isn't all that sweet and if you like coconut, you'll probably like this bar. Keep in mind there is no chocolate coating. The cocoa is simply mixed in with all the other ingredients. The ingredients, in the order listed on the box, include cashews, sunflower seeds, agave nectar, coconut, dates, cocoa processed with alkali, almonds, and sprouted flax seeds. I love having one of these bars mid morning with a cup of coffee. It's a great treat.

review/summary: Tasty, chewy, indulgent!
review/text: As many other reviewers have already pointed out, these Raw Rev bars are not your typical granola bars. They are soft and chewy and sometimes they are a little oily. The thing is, it tastes exactly like what it is - ground cashews, almonds, agave, flax, dates and maybe cocoa or coconut depending on what flavor you get. It tastes exactly like what you would think all that ground up and pressed into a bar shape would taste like. And all of those things are delicious so of course they taste amazing all smooshed together! It is reminiscent of cookie dough. I am surprised that some people think these are nasty. I laughed when I read descriptions saying they taste like vomit. I suppose it is an acquired taste thing. If you like natural tasting things with only a few ingredients, you will probably really like these. I have found that they taste really good if they are refrigerated. Every now and then I find a rock or some kind of husk in one. I really don't mind though... I'm not too picky!<br />They are pretty high calorie, but you would have to expect that for something made primarily of nuts and dates. They are high in fat, but these are extremely healthy fats that you shouldn't feel bad about eating at all. In fact, most people probably don't get enough of these healthy fats. That said, it is still a lot for one person unless you are using it as a meal replacement, so for that reason I try to split the 2.2oz bars with someone or stick to the smaller 100 calorie bars if its just for me. I like all of the flavors that I have tried and it's hard to pick a favorite, but I think the chocolate coconut or coconut agave is at the top of the list. I do love coconut! All in all, these are quite tasty and I really appreciate the minimalism of them and they have saved on many occasions when I need some energy during the day or when I am craving something sweet, and I feel pretty good about eating them too.

review/summary: Chocolate Coconut are great!
review/text: These are definitely raw bars, so if someone is expecting a granola bar they're in for a surprise. The texture is like a Larabar- it's soft, slightly gooey, with pieces of coconut and nuts. I've tried a few flavors of these bars and the Coconut Chocolate is by far the best. I like them for breakfast before exercising. They're not too heavy that they weigh you down, but they certainly fill you up. They're a bit pricey, but Amazon has the best price for a box I've seen.

review/text: As a Sport Nutritionist and athlete, packing healthy meals is daily ritual.  But boy, there are those times when I get caught without ... and thank goodness for Raw Revolution.  The nutrition profile of any so called sport or "nutrition bar" undergoes drastic scrutiny from me because so many of them are junk food in disguise.  But this product in any flavor is a die-hard winner.  Plus, anyone that can make Spirulina taste good is aces in my book :)  Amazon also offers the best price I've seen.

review/text: Coconut Raw Revolution is delicious!  This is my favorite flavor - though, the raspberry is pretty good too.  These are dense bars that are moist - not crumbly.  These are sort of brownie-like and feel like pure indulgence.  For about 220 calories they are a great breakfast or pre-workout snack.

review/text: This bar was given out to serious mountain bikers during a recent race and I had a chance to sample one.  I found it delicious and because of it's raw live essence food content it is also a healthy snack alternative that is easy to carry with you.  I always have one in my lunch bag or carry one with me when I'm out shopping all day.  It does have a slight oily feel but I don't find it objectionable.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Best Meal Replacement Bars
review/text: Our family all eat bars of one sort or another with the exception of myself.  For medical reasons, I recently had to start being gluten free.  Eat isn't always easy to find gluten free food when you travel or are not able to bring your food with you.  I started looking for a bar to take along with me.  I had tried other on the go foods and finally found the raw revolution bar and I haven't looked back.  It is not only gluten free, half a bar satisfies me.<br /><br />My son plays a sport and competes at a high level.  He sometimes has very little time to eat and so has depended on gatorade G2 series, power bars, etc.  The first time he looked at this bar, he was turned off by the claim that it had "raw ingredients". Out of necessacity one day he tried the bar and really liked the taste and most importantly he found that it doesn't give him a high sugar high as the other bars did.  He has given up the other bars and finished my supply within a week.<br /><br />I found the bar expensive, and moreover found it was on backorder at the store I found it initially.  I was in Chicago and the Wholefoods there had it on sale for one dollar each....I brought back 2 boxes...these promptly disappeared from our cupboard. The wholefoods in our town couldn't order it and I was thrilled to find it on amazon and placed a recurring order with amazon at a price that is excellent compared to $1.95 I paid originally at the co-op store in town.

review/text: First, I will say: I eat a lot of salads and fruit, and not much processed food, so I have unusually biased tastes. That being said, these remind me of brownies. Perfect for a sweet tooth, and surprisingly filling for how small they are. I love them, but  gave a friend (with an average american diet) one to try. At first she was skeptical, but then said it just tasted like chocolate.

review/text: Delicious creamy and chocolatey taste with just the right mouth feel. I like the moistness of the recipe, and that they are not overly sweet. We get no glycemic rush from these because they contain only whole and natural foods. I think they are a perfect meal replacement, trail snack or appetite-surpressing treat to have before meals. The flavor is superior to the flater taste of the Raw Revolution chocolate flavor without coconut.

review/summary: Misleading Brand and Labeling
review/text: A local grocer recently had a display of various flavors of these bars. I read all the labels and was surprised to find that most of them said that they contained between only 82 to 90 percent raw ingredients.  I'm trying to keep 100% raw while I (hopefully) recover from an illness, so the only flavor I purchased was the one that did not say it was less than 100% raw- the hazelnut chocolate.  I was very pleased that it was delicious and satisfying. I intended to make it my breakfast five days a week during my commute, and perhaps see if I could buy cases of it.<br /><br />Then the first box arrived today. The top of the box read "90.6% raw."  I was surprised and disappointed that I had missed that on the label in the store. Concerned that I was losing cognitive function, I went to my garbage box of non-compostable-nor-recyclables and found the wrapper from last week. I examined it carefully and it did not mention that these contain 9.4% cooked ingredients. I opened the box that had just arrived and saw that the bar labels were the same as last week: no mention of non-raw ingredients.<br /><br />Note their legal disclaimer on this site:<br /><br />"Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."<br /><br />-- They may want to add that you should also not rely on the info on their labels.<br /><br />I don't recall seeing the 90.6% figure on this site last week. I don't have evidence that they didn't have it posted here, but as you can see from this review I'm a pretty obsessive reader of info about the things I eat.<br /><br />In sum:  Their labeling is misleading about the raw content of the hazelnut chocolate bar. At the very least, given what I've experienced and what they seem to feel they need to place in their legal disclaimer, I don't believe this brand is worthy of the trust of the people I care about just yet.  I hope very much that changes, and that I can buy their products in the future. For now I'm boycotting until they are more honest in their labeling and less disingenuous in their branding.  Hopefully, eating raw will help me to live to see that day.  Godspeed, Raw Revolution.

review/summary: great bar
review/text: One of the best tasting bars I've found.  Tastes like a fresh brownie with no "bar" aftertaste.  Only problem is very high calorie count, but I guess you can't have everything.  They are very filling.

review/summary: Very strong chocolate flavor
review/text: I saw these at a local health food shop and decided to give it a try since I wanted a dairy free chocolate bar.  You certainly get the dark chocolate - very strong and bitter. I knew coconut was in there from the label, and from the shreds of it I could see in the bar but I really did not taste any coconut - the chocolate flavor overpowered it completely.  The label says it contains almonds, but you don't taste that either.  I was hoping for more of a harmonious blend of both chocolate and coconut.  It certainly isn't sweet either.

review/text: These are not for everyone but they are great. I drastically changed my diet about 5 months ago and had trouble finding an alternative to have for a *treat*. All that changed when i found Raw Revolution products. These are my go to snack. I like the 100 cal version. I don`t care for the Apple cinnamon variety. They remind me of a masticated apple loaf. I like the products because they use agave nectar as a sweetener and other *pure* food ingrediants. I can actually read the ingrediant panel

review/text: dislikes: a little too much cocoa flavor that kind gives it a little hint o' bitter chalkiness and OCCASIONALLY a little soapy taste (i got over it)<br />Likes: they're Kosher and Organic. I could not taste the dates, thank God. I enjoyed the brownie like texture and the predominate coconut/chocolate flavor(as the name suggests). it's a good size bar which makes the glutton in me happy. There's a bit of an oily residue on the bar that seems to bother some people but it truly blesses my heart.<br />I would definitely buy the coconut/chocolate bars again and will probably try some other flavors too.

review/summary: Taste Good
review/text: Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate - - - - I was looking for a brownie type snack, since I can't eat regular brownies.<br /> The taste is close enough to a brownie to satisfy my craving.  The inside is a cake like texture, but the outside layer is wetter (or oily) giving it a texture more like candy.  I believe it is all one batter, but the outside and inside cooks up differently.<br />Being all natural, and full of nutrition makes this a great snack. I enjoy these very much, and I recommend these and plan to purchase more in the future.<br /><br />NO PEANUTS, NO CORN

Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items.

review/text: I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/summary: Terrible Taste
review/text: I have always loved Flare 5 gum by Wrigleys and it was the only gum I ever purchased.  Within the last 6 months or so it has become impossible to find in my area, no grocery stores or gas stations carried it anymore.  Out of desperation, I checked online and found it available through Amazon.  I was thrilled!  I ordered a large lot and waited anxiously for it's arrival.  Sadly, it took about 9 days to reach me but I ripped open the box and popped a stick in my mouth expecting that wonderful cinnamon burst of flavor that lasts for hours.  Within seconds I had to spit it out - it tasted like plastic!  I checked the expiration date on my lot and it was not expired.  I decided to give it another try and took another stick out, it smelled okay, looked okay, but the taste was the same!  Horrible plastic taste, Ugh!!  Naturally, I thought I should return the product but this is not an option with Amazon as it is considered a grocery item.  Looks like I have 15 packs of plastic-flavored gum to hand out to unsuspecting people that ask if I have any gum.

review/summary: Our twins love this one. With the subscription, the price is fair
review/text: Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

review/summary: Dessert to Them.  But is it Nutritional Enough?
review/text: My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: My baby's favorite 2nd stage food so far and great for constipation!
review/text: I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein.

Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.

review/summary: good for you but not best flavor
review/text: We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family.

review/summary: Too runny...
review/text: My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick.

review/summary: Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others
review/text: My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.

review/summary: Son loves it
review/text: My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.

review/summary: FOUND SHREDDED PLASTIC IN THE BABY FOOD!!!!
review/text: I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing.
