review/summary: Wonderful product & excellent quality for vegan cooking.
review/text: I just finished making a vegan coconut-curry tomato soup using this coconut cream product.  I am so pleased with the quality and with how well it worked in my recipe that I've just placed an order for two more cartons. This has a very delicate hint of coconut that adds a much needed creaminess to some of my recipes. Looking forward to trying it in other recipes and drinks.

review/summary: A Rich Barbeque Sauce with a Kick
review/text: This is the best hot sauce I've tasted in some time.  The first listed ingredients:  mandarin oranges, honey and mangos, give this sauce a strong sweet barbeque sauce flavor.  Indeed, you don't notice the heat for the first half second or so that it hits your tounge.  Then wham!  A fairly potent heat wave hits, courtesy of the fourth listed ingredient, habanero peppers.<br /><br />This sauce is not for everyone.  On the one hand, a significantly large portion of the population thinks Tabasco sauce is hot.  At 11,000 scoville units, this is about 5.5 times hotter.  On the other hand, purists will find this sauce way too mild.  If your idea of hot begins with Blair's 'After Death' (97,000 scoville units, or almost 50 times hotter than Tabasco) then Crazy Jerry will seem positively sane.  But if you are like me, and want some flavor to go along with your pain, then this is a nice sauce.  In the last week I have used it on tri tip steak, rice, eggs, chicken, and of course chips and found it added a real zest to my menu.  A tasty treat, it's worth a try.

review/summary: An excellent hot sauce.
review/text: Totally worth the buy. Very flavorful and hot. This hot sauce isn't nearly the hottest I've had. One reviewer mentioned Blair's 'After Death' and he's right in saying this is milder than that. However, it makes up big time in taste. I am a seasoned hot sauce guy and this is my go-to for just about anything. Big flavor and great heat. Maybe the best all around sauce I've tried so far. Very hot for a beginner, delicious for an expert. Buy it.

review/text: While it may not be the hottest sauce out there, it is certainly the tastiest hot sauce that I have consumed from a bottle. The taste is simply too good to resist. After I was introduced to it by a friend of mine (Thanks, Brent!) I went through a dozen bottles in less than a month.  Goes very well as a dip (I've used it as a dip with cheese dippers from Mazzio's).  Real good stuff.

review/text: I learned about this product when I visited Japan.  They call it "Crazy Salt or KURESOL" and use it for everthing!<br />The package looked very American so after I came home, I googled (image search and compared to the photo on my iPhone) and was I right! It is sold here!!<br /><br />I use it in place of plain salt & pepper seasoning. Just 1:1.  I think since it is seasoned salt and herbs are basically fillers, I take less sodium if I go with the 1:1 ratio. I am salt sensitive and try not to have a lot of sodium in my diet so this product helps.

Paula now seems to have created her own seasoning mix (for her store I guess), but I am stuck on Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt.  It is a great go to seasoning.  Great as the finishing touch or bringing out flavor on the grill.  Love it on grilled corn.  Really great mixed with self-rising flour for chicken/pork chop breading.  It is sort of hard to find, but buy it by the case at Amazon and give it as a hostess gift!

review/summary: Caution -- it's addicting! :-)
review/text: I have to admit to being addicted to Jane's KMS. I first tried it over 30 years ago and was instantly smitten by the subtle blend of flavors that goes with virtually anything you'd sprinkle salt on for serving. It's especially good on eggs & veggies, and we even keep it on the table in a salt shaker instead of plain salt. I don't know why stores don't stock it, but it's hard to find here (Alaska) as well. I freak when I realize the container that's currently running low is my last. We used to look for it on road trips in the lower 48, but now that it's so easy to order here we'll have no more worries about running out. Buy it, love it, share it.  Jane's rocks!

review/summary: High sprout germination rate in standard sprouter
review/text: I purchased these sunflower seeds from Living Whole Foods, and was worried about how many seeds would actually sprout when  used in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GHUD86">Easy Sprout Sprouter</a>, since I'd read many reviews on other sunflower seeds sold on Amazon saying that they need to be germinated in soil, etc., and that in most cases, they had a terribly low germination rate.  Still, I figured I'd bite the bullet and just try it out.  When the seeds arrived, I saw that the package they came in also said they needed to be germinated in soil.  I figured I'd still give it a go, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that after an 8 hour soak in water, and then twice daily quick (5-15 minute) soaks, I had a nice set of small sunflower sprouts within a couple days.  I'd estimate somewhere around an 80% germination rate, though I really wasn't counting.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for sunflower seeds for sprouting purposes in your regular sprouter, these do seem to work.<br /><br />And yes, the seeds taste quite yummy all by themselves, if you're impatient...

review/summary: breakfast tea and tin isnt for tea storage
review/text: OK first of all it isnt bad tea but there are some issues with product.<br /><br />First, this is filled with their breakfast tea even though tin states afternoon tea and differentiates from phone booth english breakfast tin tea which is the exact same thing.  I bought both products hoping to try 2 different types of tea.  I was not happy and didnt realize difference until my kids opened both types of tins.<br /><br />This brings me to my second issue, the tins.  I bought these four packs because I believed I was receiving tea tins...imagine that tea...packaged in storage tins for tea. But unfortunately what is not stated is that these tins are marketed to be banks with a open slot in the lids to put money/coins. tea must be stored in an air tight tin.  These had a cheap piece of scotch tape placed over the coin slot. Really? Pretty tacky and should be advertised as a bank novelty. I am upset because I bought 8 tins so I could store some of my other tea bags and loose leaf teas and these are useless for that purpose

review/text: *****<br />Red Mellow Bush is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea (caffeine-free) is certified organic and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Grown in the high desert regions of the Cederberg Mountains, the shoots of Rooibos have been hand gathered by South Africans for generations. It is prepared like a traditional tea, undergoing meticulous drying (oxidation) and cutting. Organic Red Mellow Bush has an earthy vanilla taste and pleasing orange color with hints of autumn straw. With an anti-oxidant level comparable to green tea, Rooibos has no caffeine, is rich in minerals, very low in tannin, and is relaxing to the nerves. No wonder they call it the miracle tea. Discover the wonders of Rooibos!" What an invitation!<br /><br />It is my husband's favorite tea, and is pure premium rooibos. If you haven't tasted rooibos before, it is a pleasant, earthy, herbal flavor that most people like. I prefer my teas stronger, so I use two tea bags, and you might do the same if you like a deeper flavor.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love rooibos, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Rich, bold taste without caffeine
review/text: Although this is an herbal tea (from the South African red bush), it is full-bodied and rich enough to serve as a substitute for black tea. It is not as bitter, which is both a pro and a con. The pro being that you can steep it as long as you like to bring out the flavors. The con, however, is that it will never have that astringent bitter taste that is characteristic of black tea.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this tea is to steep it for at least five minutes with freshly boiled water. You can steep up to ten minutes and it will only make the tea stronger without ruining the flavor.<br /><br />In the summer, rooibos is excellent brewed double-strength and poured over ice. Add a little vanilla and milk for a smooth iced drink.<br /><br />Happy sipping!

review/text: I was 1st introduced to Numi teas when I was drawn to the artistic, beautiful packaging of Numi's rooibos tea (the version with the artistic drawing of elephants in an african savannah) at Safeway supermarket as I needed a small food item but that had an expensive-look to serve as a "community" gift for everyday munching or drinking for coworkers at work for our small kitchen/computer/lunchroom at a prestigious company. After finding their rooibos tea so wonderfully tasting as well as relaxing to my nerves as I get anxious and nervous, rooibos tea has been my #1 breakfast tea to drink in the morning.<br /><br />Their rooibos is much milder than you find with the more affordable Twinings tea but rooibos tastes a little nutty and you don't need sugar since it has a very mildly sweet taste. I, however, will also add organic raw honey to it to give me the benefits not only of the herb but also the benefits of the organic unprocessed honey which makes it a complete healthful breakfast tea for me.<br /><br />There's a VERY TINY cut in the corner to indicate where to rip the teabag package but what I don't like about Numi teas is sometimes, the cut is not there and so that same small paper-plastic packaging that holds each tea bag is difficult to open OR when you rip it at the cut end, the rip still doesn't result in the opening of the tea bag pkg - it's protective with tough plastic on the inside and you NEED scissors or else you won't be able to open it unless you're Superman.<br /><br />But what i love about their teas is that, like another reviewer posted, they don't taste like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula. So you get the benefit of the herb in the tea without the yucky flowery herbal tastes/flavors.

review/summary: The Best I've Tasted
review/text: I've tried many rooibos teas and this is the best I've tasted so far. It has a smooth mellow flavor and it makes you feel more relaxed almost instantly. This tea proves that organic really is better. I first drank rooibos tea as a child living in Africa and I never forgot it. I'm so happy I can get this tea in America. It is a very healing tea and is even safe for babies to drink if they have colic. It really does soothe the digestive system. The best way to prepare this tea is to use two teabags per mug. I also add half and half and two packets of stevia. Sipping this tea on a rainy day makes me feel happy. I can highly recommend this brand.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I must preface this by saying that there are very few Numi teas that I haven't tried...and loved!  This, however, is not one that I even like.  Maybe I'm not a red tea drinker or maybe it's the flavor, I'm not sure.  The aroma didn't get me excited, nor did the taste, after drinking it both hot and cold.  I also tried a squeeze of lemon, which didn't seem to help either.  The box says it is an "earthy vanilla South African healer".  I didn't really detect the vanilla, but I suppose "earthy" is a good description.  My mom, on the other hand, loved this tea, so guess who will get the other box for Christmas?

review/summary: A quick breakfast classic
review/text: Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts... I remember eating them a while ago as a little kid, and they're still pretty good.<br /><br />The pop-tarts come 2 per wrapper, and there are 6 wrappers in each box, and there are 3 of those boxes inside another larger box, for a total of 36 pop-tarts.<br /><br />The wrappers are nice-looking, full-color printed, and are made of somewhat sturdier plastic, compared to the thin foil wrappers from other packs of pop-tarts. This makes them good for putting in vending machines (according to the label), and you can microwave them in the wrapper if you want.<br /><br />The boxes are perforated so you can fold the box into a neat countertop dispenser with a "Pop-tarts" sign, possibly for use in stores. Although I have no need for the dispenser, I tried folding it for fun, and it took a bit of effort to avoid tearing the box apart.<br /><br />As for the actual pastries, they're the same as any other pop-tart. A flat-ish rectangle, with some sugary filling, and frosting on the top. I did notice that Kellogg's has been cutting back on the frosting and filling a bit, as there seems to be more crust around the edges, and you can also see the crust through the layer of frosting, which is quite different from what I remember a few years ago. Still seems to have the same taste as I remember, at least.

review/text: These Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts are quite good! Just the right hint of cinnamon so that it is not overpowering. These are perfect for quick-in-the-rush breakfasts, for kids and adults alike! Also, not too sweet to make a tooth hurt. I just LOVE these toasted to where the edge starts to get golden brown - yum!<br /><br />This is a LARGE box, with each pair of Pop-Tarts packaged in a thicker material than you would buy at the grocery store. Grocery store bought Pop-Tarts have the shiny, silver packaging. These were packaged like the ones you buy at a convenience store/gas station. I consider this good, as it helps them hold up better if tossed in the backpack on the go.

review/text: Just don't expect there to be 36 bags of pop-tarts making 72 pop-tarts, it's 3 boxes of 6 packets of 2 pop-tarts. That being said I thought it was a pretty good deal, and I can never find Brown Sugar Cinnamon at my local grocery store. The food was fresh and the packaging undamaged. I did have one poptart be kind of crumbly as a result of the shipping but I would say it's comparable to the damaged ratio in the grocery store.<br /><br />If you like Brown Sugar Cinnamon, you should buy.

review/summary: Great - very tasty
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order. Honestly, I thought maybe I'd get something that was<br />stale or very old when ordering online.  However, the price at the time was a good deal, so I tried it anyway.<br /><br />I also received the type of pop tarts that you could sell retail on a counter somewhere.<br />Rather than the ones in a thin, silver, foil-like packaging, these come with a thick printed plastic<br />packaging.<br /><br />The pop tarts themselves are a little bit thicker than the ones you get off the store shelves in the<br />boxes of 8 or 12.  I love that, because the crust part is really the only part I like.  This flavor is<br />good, because it isn't as sickeningly sweet (despite being brown sugar) as some of the jelly-like flavors.<br /><br />All in all, I received a fresh product that was very tasty. I'll be happy to order them again as<br />sales pop up.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Update Nov 9, 2011:<br />Well, I placed a second order.<br />This one was not nearly as fresh, and contained one box less than the last order.<br />So, be sure to read the listing carefully to see how many you are getting. I thought I had<br />notice of a sale, but it was really a count decrease.<br /><br />This batch came with a couple of the boxes' perforations already popped (not clear open)<br />and nothing was as fresh as the previous order. Not sure why, but I didn't like the<br />quality swings of this item. I'm dinging a star for lack of consistently fresh product.

review/summary: Poptarts are good, packaging horrible.
review/text: This is my third pop-tart purchase in the last few months. I am always on the look out for good deals on the large boxes of poptarts and am glad to have found them on Amazon. The first two came in great condition... package was intact, pop-tarts in one piece. The reason for the two stars for this transaction was due to the shape of the pop-tart box. Someone in shipping must have played soccer with this box... it was all torn up, holes on each corner of the individual boxes (you get three boxes). You open up the boxes, and inside are the boxed poptarts that when you open the top, you can set it in your pantry and pull the individually wrapped (2 per package) just like you see in a convenience store. You can't even use the box for display to hold the pop-tarts, it's that banged up. And of course, with the boxes destroyed, can you imagine what the poptarts looked like?? Crumbs everywhere. Very disappointed.

review/summary: Tons of compliments on my steaks and other foods I use it on.
review/text: I found this stuff at Sam's and bought it "just to see", now I cannot cook a steak without it. It is a great flavorful accent with out being overpowering. People rave about my steaks, and I've even given away some of my precious supply of the dust. They love the flavor. We don't even feel like we can get the same good steak flavor at steakhouses anymore. As a matter of fact, this seasoning has left one of our fav steak houses wanting for a visit from us. We can get better flavor at a less expensive price at home. We no longer go out for steak.<br /><br />I am *not* a big fan of heavy rubs or crustie-peppercorn-garlic seasonings. I like to be able to taste the meat, which means I am also not a fan of steak sauces like A1 or even worcestershire. I think that with those heavy seasonings and sauces, that's all I can taste, and, sorry, but "yuk". I like good cuts of meat, and I'm not about to ruin them with heavy sauces, spices or marinades.<br /><br />I've expanded to using the dust on everything I grill - steak, tri-tip, pork tenderloins, sturdy white fish, hamburgers - it makes all of them taste fantastic without being overpowering. I even sprinkle it on lighter fish that I quick sear in a pan on the range when I make fish tacos....yummy!<br /><br />I've not been able to find it at Sam's or Wal-Mart, recently, so I am glad to find it on Amazon - yay! Amazon!!! I don't know what I'd do without you. I will be stocking up with this mega-sized 2 pack, and will hope that Durkee/Tone's continues to make it....Please!!!!

I figured the only reason this seasoning is disappearing off grocery shelves is because, its too good for the average citizen to purchase, this stuff is Chef material!! It's invisible on your steaks or ground beef. There are no chunky spices that are identifiable, its literally Dust! This is my secret seasoning & the only steak seasoning I need, when I could no longer find it on the shelves, I went to Google & Amazon had it! You know its good when you search the internet for a seasoning. I could go on & on. THIS IS THE BEST! If you never tell your friends your secret, they're food will NEVER taste as good as yours!! Try it once & you'll never want to eat another steak without it!! Ever!! Can't wait until my order arrives!! It's Grilling Season!!!!

review/summary: Durkee/Tones Steak Dust
review/text: One of our families favorite spice blends.  We tend to use this on grilled "red meat" (It is great on Johnsonville Bratwurst not to mention steaks).  I was delighted to find a source of the Durkee packaging as Durkee was the original manufacturer label and more economical per an ounce.  This double pack will last us several months.

I have used this product for a couple of years now and I use it for everything from steaks to hamburgers and I have also been known to use it in a sauce every now and then. I think it is the best flavor enhancer for any dish where beef is involved.

review/text: We love this seasoning. My husband nearly went into withdrawals when our grocery store stopped selling it. I did a little research and found it is now being sold under the Tones label. I haven't tried it under that label but I assume it is the same recipe.<br /><br />This seasoning is wonderful. It enhances the taste of beef. We have used it on pork and chicken and it tastes pretty good on those too. For one cook-out he used this seasoning and I made little gift pouches. I put golf ball size containers with the seasoning in it. I knew from prior experience that everyone would want a sample after tasting it. It really is that good.

review/text: I ran across this product while browsing Amazon reviews and I had to try it based on some of the comments.  I tried it for the first time on grilled strip steaks last night and it was A-MAZING!  I coated the steaks pretty heavily per other reviews and think you probably can't put too much on.  It includes just the right amount of salt and enhances the steak flavor instead of covering it up.  We were practically licking our plates at the end, I can't imagine a better meat seasoning and I can't wait to try it on other meats, chicken and fish!  I will never be without it again!

review/text: I bought this steak dust without any expectations. I just wanted something different to try on steaks. Usually I sear my steaks on the stove top and then finish in the oven. The dusting didn't do much for that method of cooking, but when it became grilling weather, I put some of this on a strip steak an wow! It was freaking delicious. This past weekend I tried it on some ribeyes that the grocery store had on sale, and I think it was one of the best steaks I ever had. My in-laws couldn't believe that all I did was season them. They thought for sure they were marinated. This steak dust is a high quality product, and really makes your steaks stand out.

He was a VERY happy man.<br /><br />It took us a bit to figure out the shaker.  The powder is so fine that it clogs the little holes.  Just give the container a little squeeze and the powder with blow across the meat.<br /><br />It's mild enough that you can use a lot and not be overpowered.  I still do sometimes add some pepper.<br /><br />My kitchen will never be without it again!

review/text: A favorite of my family and has forever ruined ordering steak at restaurants because their steaks cannot hold a candle to ours.  We tried this as a sample at Sams Club a few years ago and enjoyed the savory taste it added to our steaks ever since. Steak Dust does not overpower the steak with spices, rather it accentuates the natural steak goodness. I couldn't believe it when Sams discontinued carrying Steak Dust and searched all over for it.  Thankfully, Amazon carries it.  Friends and family always compliment the tastes of our steaks because of the Steak Dust Seasoning.  I'm salivating right now just writing this review.  Mmmm.....Steak Dust.

review/text: Even though I suspect this is ground up beef bouillion it does not matter as it works in a superior way to season grilled steaks on a barbeque. I fully coat the meat and sear at high temps to creat a savory crust. I have never found its equal and do not enjoy most premade seasonings for grilling, however this is an exception. It is also a rare exception to my rule that any ingredient list that reads like a chemical factory was needed to make it should not be eaten. This seasoning only really works well when cooking on the broiler or barbeque, do not bother if frying in a pan, it is not the same. Buon appetito

review/text: I've used this for both pancakes and waffles and it's horrible. I followed the directions on the package and the waffles come out extremely dense; it's like eating bread from world war 2. Maybe if you add baking powder and dilute the mix a bit it will come out better. But then why not just make it all from scratch. The pancakes are a bit better, but not by much (using powdered sugar in the dry mix instead of honey made it taste a better). The only positive is that it is all natural and doesn't have any artificial or questionable ingredients. So at least it won't contribute to my premature death and preclude me from finding a better mix.

review/summary: It's Just Curry To Us
review/text: We spent a few weeks in Morocco last year and bought ras el hanout in six different places--in Fez, Marrakesh, Rabat, and Meknes, at spice stands and supermarkets. The name means "head of the shop"--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365� for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning it over after the first hour. Fabulous! Ras el hanout is about the same color as cumin. (See the article in Wikipedia for info on the main ingredients.)<br /><br />We were sorry to find out that this product is nothing like the real deal. We bought it because our Morocco stash is running out. It looks and tastes like ordinary curry powder, including a fair amount of hot chili pepper, not at all like ras el hanout. We threw it out. Don't waste your money.

Amazon is the only place I know to get the box of 24 in the chicken only.  I rated it five stars because she likes it!

review/summary: Messy and apparently undelicious
review/text: My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits.

review/text: To all you cats out there,<br />I love this food, my pet keepers feed it to me 4 times a day, I meow in protest if it's late. If asked I'll even sit on command so I can eat Whiskas morning, noon, and night!<br />Thank you for keeping them well supplied.<br />Stella<br />(typed by the Keeper)
