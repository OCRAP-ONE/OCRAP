review/summary: Great multi purpose product
review/text: I purchased this coconut oil to use on my dry skin and to make my own facial wipes. Coconut is a natural antibacterial agent, so it's perfect for a facial wipe. The smell is great, very mild coconut smell, it's a great moisturizer, I use it as a hair treatment - the only thing I haven't done is use it as a supplement but at this price you could do so easily!

review/text: I've used this as a moisturizer for my scalp and for my body for a little over 1 month now. It has stopped my scalp from becoming dry and flaky like it used to do, yet it's light enough to not make my hair greasy (I have relaxed hair with the usual "new growth"). This makes my skin feel soft and absorbs pretty easily, especially after the shower. I also love the light coconut scent.

review/summary: Great for skin, so moisturizing!
review/text: I got this because I read on a forum I frequent that it helps with "chicken skin," which I have unfortunately carried over from my teenage years. "Don't worry about it," my parents would assure me, "that goes away when you get older." No, mom, I don't think so. I'm in my 20s and still have rough skin on the back of my arms and it's not fun. I've tried $50 creams, exfoliating scrubs, etc. from high end brands, and nothing has ever really worked. I've only used this a couple of times and I already feel a huge difference. I just use it right after the shower and it absorbs into my skin wonderfully. I liked it so much after using it the first time, that I used it on my legs, hands, etc. and my skin everywhere is softer than it has ever been. I even tried it on razor burn(I get the WORST razor burn), and it really helped soothe it overnight. I usually buy products for specific uses and this is my first time trying something completely natural on my skin, but I'm so glad I did. Try it, it's so much more worth it than all the more expensive, chemical-filled products out there!

review/summary: Coconut Oil is good for almost EVERYTHING!
review/text: This stuff is amazing, I'm so glad I discovered it.<br />I originally purchased it for my dog after reading that it's good for them.<br />His coat is amazingly soft and shiny (I am also giving him humic minerals, so that's not all just the coconut oil).<br />After I developed a horrible case of Candida, I started using this for everything!<br /><br />The candida is making my hands and feet unbearably itchy, and my mouth developed oral thrush (red and inflamed under my tongue with white spots) Putting the coconut oil on my feet followed by a couple pairs of socks, completely stops the itching.<br />And after putting coconut oil and occasionally plain yogurt under my tongue for about three days the thrush is almost completely gone.<br />I have noticeably more energy after using the coconut oil for food and such for a few days in a row.

review/text: I tasted 2 diff organic oils and this tasted better and more rich in flavor. At first I was grossed out cuz it reminded me of bacon grease, as I saw other reviews mentioning that =P After a couple bites in one setting, I developed a taste for it. I decided to make eggs for my dogs, myself, and my son and they were WEIRD BUT DELICIOUS. I will try sneaking this into my fiancee's food to see if he can taste a difference. What's weird is I felt full instantly and usually I eat alot so I can see where this is a good staple to my diet in losing excess weight =)

With both those applications and the effect I get when I use it on my hair as a pre-shampoo moisturizing treatment, it's really great.  I bought this brand at the store, really liked it, read reviews of it and others, and decided the lovely smell, the smooth texture and the subtle taste were ideal.  It's a great product and I recommend it to people all the time.

It's not greasy at all... very light and coats the hair shaft well.  I highly recommend!

review/summary: Fantastic Oil option
review/text: I was looking for a healthy alternative to olive oil, this was, compared to Whole Foods prices, a GREAT deal. And coconut oil had been recommended to me by 2 separate friends that are amazing cooks and very very healthy people.  We made stir fry with it and won't go back to regular cooking oil, incredibly flavorful and I would say "gourmet".  There are instructions that this oil is meant for temperatures 350 and under. Baked a white birthday cake at 350 degrees with this oil and the cake had a great coconut flavor but came out drier.  But kids still devoured it.  Came super fast via mail, and a friend was right in recommending me buying this on Amazon vs. the store.

review/text: I love raw organic unprocessed coconut oil and this brand I use quite often - both for sauteeing or just 'taking a swig' in the morning with a piece of toast (a version of dipping the bread into olive oil).  I live in pretty warm climate, so most of the time it maintains runny consistency.  In the winter it gets solid, but still very easy to work with.<br />I use it to make my own homemade chocolate (without white sugar) and with great results.<br /><br />I also make my own skin moisturizer with shea butter, argan oil, avocado and coconut oil and couple of drops of lavender oil.  It feels and works spectacular both on the skin or tiny amount on the hair.<br /><br />It's just all around marvelous product and if you have not yet, definitely try it!!

I tried parachute coconut oil that is pretty famous in India but then I realized that it did not suck that well into my skin so I decided to check Amazon for coconut oil and came across this product that has 5 stars. I decided to give it a try and within two uses I became a huge fan. This oil does not take time to penetrate skin and I felt so good after my shower. I am totally in love with this product and plan to use it for many more years. Love, love, love it. Yet to use it in food but will surely give it a try since it smells so fresh and good!

review/summary: Very good product, but a 60% price increase in a week?
review/text: I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Amazon's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).<br /><br />All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't "take" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.<br /><br />One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's "pure extra virgin" -- keep in mind that "extra virgin" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes "virgin", "extra virgin", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is "extra virgin" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars "no cholesterol!". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being "extra virgin".<br /><br />OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).<br /><br />PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.<br /><br />PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions.

review/summary: Bleck the taste!
review/text: I buy and use coconut oil often.  I use it to cook with, spread on various foods, take it for my health, use on my skin and hair; kind of a coconut oil junkie.  I bought this to try thinking it was better bang for my buck.  It works well on my skin and hair but in my humble opinion the taste is terrible.  I much prefer the taste of Coconut Pacific 100% Pure Organic Extra Virgin Raw Coconut Oil.  I hope Coconut Pacific's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DHM8S">Coconut Oil Extra Virgin Organic 14 Oz - Noni Pacific</a> will come back into stock soon as I mainly use Coconut Oil and Olive Oil for day to day cooking.<br /><br />So, if you are seeking coconut oil for your health where you eat up to a tablespoon a day - do not buy this as you will never get it down.<br /><br />If you are only looking to use on your hair and skin this should be okay.

I had it on my skin for three or four hours also and it never absorbed in, I had to wipe it off.  I didn't see a difference in my hair or skin afterwards either.  Disappointed to say the least.

review/summary: MIRACLE NATURAL PRODUCT
review/text: I've had the worst eczema for years. My skin will fall off my pillow and pile up that's how bad it was.<br /><br />I've tried so many things from lotions, cetaphil, cosmetics, steroid creams, olive oil. All these things made my skin worst. This product immediately soothed my dry skin and didn't feel uncomfortable. I've super-sensitive skin and it didn't irritate me at the slightest and it doesn't have unneccessary ingredients like alcohol which dry and sting your skin.(I just don't understand how products get away with that.)<br /><br />Also, I heard there's a bunch of antioxidants and apparently it can even help people with aids, my skin looks years younger and I don't feel bizarre anymore whenever people walk my way or make eye-contact with me.  I believe if more people knew about this cosmetic companies would run out of business, this is truly a miracle natural product.

With hot summer weather, the coconut oil turned into a liquid state and leaked out of the sealed container soaking everything else I ordered from amazon.  Thankfully it was nothing I couldn't clean up.  Just keep that in mind when ordering with other items.

review/text: I bought two of this product since I thought the price was good.  My daughter has African-American hair that is relaxed and dry, so the combo of coconut oil and olive oil (roughly 1/2 tablespoon each), mixed with about 1/4 cup Silk Elements conditioner (from Sally's beauty supply), or any favorite conditioner, really makes a big difference for her dry hair.  Wash out the mixed conditioner, and hair is soft but not oily.  My other daughter has very curly, frizzy hair, and it works well for her hair as well without feeling greasy.

review/summary: A health Miracle in a Jar
review/text: I love this stuff. It is delicious. It is solid at room temperature but I prefer it in liquid form which I achieve by running the jar under hot water. I take 1 tbsp about 3-4 times a day and use this as a moisturizer after the shower. It tastes yummy but I did have to get used to the feeling that I was swallowing oil. My hubby had no problem w this and even joked it was so good that he could drink it with a straw. I have suffered w a systemic yeast infection for years which has caused numerous skin problems and a nasty white tongue. This has cleared that up in a week. The pimples I had on my arms and thighs are gone and so are my undereye dark circles. My nails are growing smoothly and my hair stopped falling out when I brush. I also started using it as a vaginal moisturizer and I am extremely pleased with the results. I also noticed how it helped with my cold. My symptoms were mild whereas everyone else had a more severe reaction. It also helped with my cracking feet and my pinky toe, which has been blackened forever, is returning to normal. I love using it on the kids lips because I know when they lick it off it's not harmful. My hubby started taking it as well when he saw how I benefited and he loves the natural burst of energy he gets after. My daughter finally tried some and now loves it on her madelines in the morning. I cant say enough wonderful things about this product. I feel like a brand new person. I wish doctors knew more to recommend this instead of blaming loss of energy and skin problems on aging. This is healthy for you, gives you energy, aids in weight loss and kills bacterias, yeasts and fungus. First magazine just wrote an article on the benefits of adding coconut oil to your diet in their January issue. It's so good that I'm going to subscribe to it.<br />UPDATE: I still LOVE this product and use it daily. I've found it makes the best pancakes when you grease the griddle w some. It is an excellent wood cleaner and the only way I clean wood, now. I also make a lip scrub w a drop of coconut oil in the palm of my kids' hands and a pinch of sugar. They love how yummy it is, I don't worry if they get it in their mouths, and they no longer have dry, cracking winter lips. My youngest has been using it nightly, after her bath, and the excema that plagues her legs, hasn't returned w the dry, cold air. This has become one of the most used products in my home.

review/summary: Wonderful Product
review/text: Recently, I wanted to "up the ante" on my Omega fatty acids so I added Coconut oil to go along with my doses of flaxseed oil and fish oil. Yes, Coconut Oil is a saturated fat, but because it's a medium chain tryclyceride (MCT), it's more easily absorbed by the body and converted into energy, not stored on the body as fat. This product has a nice flavor--I use it in cooking and it doesn't depart any heavy "coconut" flavor. Sometimes I just eat a tablespoon. The benefits are tremendous: microbial properties, helps thyroid, liver, pancreas, bones, skin, soothes the digestive tract. The list goes on.<br /><br />I bought one jar for the kitchen and one jar for my bathroom. This product is great to put on right after a bath or shower. Yes it's a bit greasy at first, but rub it in well and let it absorb, then wipe off the excess with a damp towel or wash cloth. Your skin will be satiny smooth.<br /><br />Bonus tip: I give a teaspoon to my dog every day. Studies show dogs' prefrontal brains benefit from this wonder fat.

I can eat spoonfuls of it right out of the jar. (with some chocolate ovaltine - it taste just like 'Almond Joy').  The wide mouth of the jar makes it easy to get to the product without melting it first.  The jar is made of plastic, but you can easily transfer the product to a glass mason jar - if you  want to.

They don't even compare.<br /><br />Moreover, I use it as a body/facial moisturizer and it is magnificent. A little goes a long way and my skin stays smooth all day.  Love it.

review/text: Received my Coconut Oil yesterday, opened immediately for a taste.<br /><br />1. Pulled off the safety seal and the aroma of fresh coconut wafted out-very pleasant<br /><br />2. Took a teeny, tiny bit of the "oil" (it's a solid) for a taste. With the aroma, your mind sets you up for MOUNDS...it is NOT.  It's very subtle and not at all sweet and it melts on your tongue faster than butter.<br /><br />3. I toasted a waffle to give it a real test---Most excellent, a hint of coconut and I added a dab of berry preserves....very good.  I have a friend who sautees shrimp in it and serves with a mango salsa---now doesn't that sound GOOD!<br /><br />4. I proceeded to put a small dab on the back of one hand and I do mean SMALL---VERY small...rubbed the BACKS of my hands together to liquify and then distributed over my hands and lower arms.  The dab was so small it was almost not "there".  My hands were so smooth it was amazing.<br /><br />More testing to begin on the long term benefits - right now - very happy<br /><br />** Update - one of the major reasons for purchasing this product are the multitude of health benefits for consuming coconut oil---I just discovered one that is ADDICTIVE.<br />Keebler makes a new wheatable NutCrisp small cracker: Crunchy Cashew...a little dollop on a cracker and it is absolutely heaven---you can easily get your 3 (recommended) tablespoons a day

Then the benefits of coconut oil are reinforced in Wheat Belly, by William Davis, M.D. I am Southern, so I tried breading okra in almond flour and frying it in coconut oil. Now I am trying to learn to cook with coconut flour too. I am off wheat and dairy completely and don't feel deprived. Can't beat that.

review/summary: Super quality - will never order any other brand
review/text: I purchased this because I'm on Weight Watchers and had read about how helpful EV Coconut Oil can be on a weight loss program.  It has definitely helped me shed the weight - especially around my belly.  I also love using it on my skin and hair - it makes them feel so healthy.<br /><br />I found that if you keep it at temps above 76 degrees it stays pretty clear - but if you live in a cooler climate (or have air conditioning) it can solidify.  I find that I can only consume it when it's in a liquid state - I seem to gag if it's even slightly solid.  Just a few seconds in the microwave can fix that.  I highly recommend this brand - it tastes great and works!

Most excellent as a dietary supplement to keep you regular. Awesome to cook and fry with when you can use that extra coconut spice. I buy two or separate one for the bathroom and kitchen.

review/text: Much more affordable that in my local grocery store. I use this stuff as a moisturizer, in my cooking, as a base for cleaning products and even give some to my dog to keep her coat shiny. The coconut smell is actually quite mild, which I like, I don't like it to be overwhelming other smells/flavors. I bought another brand previously but it was hard to get all the coconut oil out, the shape of this brand's container makes it easy to access the full container. Just polished off the last jar after many months. Will keep buying this brand from Amazon.

review/text: I use this all the time for cooking, and as a hair and body moisturizer.  My only complaint is that my kitchen stays quite warm so the coconut oil is always liquid.  When you pour from the jar, it dribbles down the side so it always leaves a telltale ring on the counter.  If that could be resolved, this would be a five star product for me.

review/text: This has become a "can't live without" product in my kitchen. It's my main cooking fat since it's more heat stable than olive oil and it makes the best pork chops we've ever eaten. I also use it for baking and for making roasted veggies. Even our dogs get a little scoop of coconut oil with their dinner each night and their fur is immaculate--even the rescue pup who has a fungal skin infection that we've struggled to manage.
