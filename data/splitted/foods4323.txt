review/summary: Good as toddler food, too
review/text: I chill these and give to my toddler.  It works for that, too, and she loves them.  I'm glad to be getting some pumpkin in her that she otherwise wouldn't eat.  The only flavor she doesn't like of the Plum brand is the spinach/peas/pears.

review/summary: Sour baby food
review/text: We love the pouch size and the price but this baby food Is sour, although the banana and pumpkin should be sweet components. The color of the puree is a light yellow and not orange as it appears on the box. There is no pumpkin taste. Lemon juice concentrate and citric acid have been added therefore the predominant taste is sour banana.<br />Ingredients: organic banana, organic pumpkin, organic lemon juice from concentrate, citric acid. The composition list is different than on the company's website.

review/summary: The Go To Meal!
review/text: I don't review often but when I am satisfied with a product like this, well I just had to say how much I appreciate and love this product.  I have very picky eaters.  They don't eat ANYTHING new.  But, this product did the trick.  I've been feeding this to my now 13 month old since he was 5 months old.  He can't get through the day with at least one of these pouches.  I send (among other things) this pouch to daycare everyday.  At home he has it with some oatmeal and organic butter.  My toddler daughter also loves this.  She will take a pouch to pre-school and actually finish it every time she finds it in her lunchbox.  I even gave one to a co-worker who recently got braces as an adult and even she liked it, though she preferred the pear and mango one more.  I can't recommend this enough.  I bought a single serving pouch at Target first to try it and once my kids were hooked I've been doing subscribe and save.  I also do subscribe and save with the pear and mango one...it's delicious!

review/summary: a winner!
review/text: My baby loves this. He makes a hilarious "impressed" face with his eyebrows when I give him the first bite and it's this. I have tasted it too and find that it tastes pretty good to me (I can not say the same about all baby foods that I give him and he seems to like). I also feel good about the fact that this is a fruit & veggie mixture because I'm trying to sneak as many vitamins into him as possible. I also think this is a good consistency to work with the Plum spoons that screw onto these pouches (the stage 1 foods tend to drip off the spoon). Pretty slick!

review/summary: Too sour for baby to eat
review/text: My baby made funny face and turned away every time I tried to feed her. We tasted it and surely, it was too sour to eat. I opened 3 more pouches to make sure and they were all the same taste. I think they accidentally put too much lime or lemon juice in it. Before I contacted Amazon, I went back to read others reviews, I found another customer with the same issue.

review/summary: bug infestations!
review/text: This is my first review on Amazon.  My daughter has been enjoying these pouches since she was 6 months old and eating solid food.  I used to buy them at a retail store, but switched to Amazon a few months ago when my local store stopped carrying them.  This review in no way has anything to do with the contents of the pouches at all, these are great foods for infants and great snacks for toddlers.<br /><br />My review is to alert consumers to a bug infestation I got because of the packaging these items come in.  Soon after getting these from Amazon, I started finding miller bugs in my pantry.  I would clean out my whole pantry and remove them only to have the problem recur and worsen.  I finally identified the source as these pouches!  They come in a pack of 6 and the last two shipments I have recieved have definitively without any doubt had eggs of these miller bugs in them, the last batch of which I watched hatch into disgusting maggots as confirmation that I had identified the source correctly.  I would never write this if it was not true, buyer beware!  I now have a huge problem with these bugs and I am having difficulty getting rid of them.  I have cancelled my subscriptions so I will no longer introduce new eggs into my pantry every month!

review/text: My baby (13 months) loves this flavor of Plum Organics. I tried it too and it's a little sweet with a slight tang to it, though not as much as the Peach+Apricot+Banana flavor. I started feeding her this when she was about 11 months. It's a little thicker than the other flavors (I've only tried Pear+Mango and Peach+Apricot+Banana)so it doesn't easily fall off the spoon. I'm not too good at getting her to eat veggies, so I was happy to find this.

I wish I'd found them earlier (he's completely on solid foods but we use these for meals on the run).<br /><br />Make sure your child likes the flavor before purchasing the whole case.  My son is not so crazy about the purple carrot one (its tart).  I wish there were more vegetable options.<br /><br />Also our favorite meal was food mixed with cereal and that defeats the purpose of the packaging.  I also feel guilty about the trash.

review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

review/summary: Salty and vinegary!!!
review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/text: For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

This 2 oz package allows for a little "portion control". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!

review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/text: Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.<br /><br />Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service<br /><br />Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.

review/text: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!

review/text: I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.

They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.

review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.

review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.

review/text: These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

review/summary: Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!
review/text: Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.

The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...

The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...

review/summary: Maybe the worst chips ever.
review/text: These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case "& Chive") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.

I keep saying.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.<br /><br />2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.<br /><br />It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.<br /><br />Bottom-line: Delicious!
