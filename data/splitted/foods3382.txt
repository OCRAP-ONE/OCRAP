review/summary: Typical Instant Mashed Potatoes but GREAT Packaging
review/text: To be honest, they tasted like any other instant mashed potatoes; neither really good nor really bad. I tend to make homemade mashed potatoes but I like to keep the instant around for those times when I only have twenty minutes to pull a meal together or I am just too tired to make the effort. I really like the separate pouches. In fact, I like them so much, I still have an open box of another brand of instant mashed potatoes that I have to measure out the portions of but I keep reaching for these instead because it's so quick and easy.<br /><br />Nutritional Information (2/3 cup prepared):<br /><br />Calories: 140<br />Calories from Fat: 60<br />Total Fat: 6g<br />Saturated Fat: 4g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 20mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Potassium: 320mg<br />Total Carb: 18g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Vitamin A: 4%<br />Calcium: 4%<br /><br />** May contain wheat and soy ingredients

review/summary: I think that I got a bad batch or they changed the ingredients
review/text: I tried an envelope from two different boxes and both didn't taste good to me at all. I've bought this in the grocery store before and always liked it and other betty crocker potatoes but either I got a bad batch from amazon or they changed the ingredients. I bought this in bulk for a fair price but I had to give the rest of the boxes away because I couldn't stand to eat them. Maybe another flavor won't be as bad but I won't waste my money buying it in bulk to find out.

review/summary: This is the Real Deal
review/text: I use this oil in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite 4-Ounce Old Fashioned Table Top Popcorn Popper</a> and love it. Its semi-solid texture makes it easy to work with, since there's no need to worry about spilling or dripping when adding it to the kettle (it melts to a liquid once heated). I combine it with Flavacol salt, Pop Weaver kernels, and Mor-Gold Plus butter substitute. The result is truly authentic tasting theater style popcorn.

review/summary: Essential to making great popcorn
review/text: I received a WhirlyPop popcorn popper for Christmas. After a little web research, quickly discovered that coconut oil, as used in the Real Theatre Popcorn Popping Oil, is a key ingredient to making great popcorn. Using regular canola or other vegetable oils just does not compare to using this popping oil. My family loves the popcorn we make with this oil. We will never eat microwave popcorn again.

review/summary: Yeah, but which movie theater?
review/text: The taste I am looking for is reminiscent of old, small town theaters with fantastic, melty, buttery popcorn - not that of today's mainstream digital 3D multiplexes.<br /><br />That said, this popping oil colors the popcorn the perfect shade of yellow, despite the oil's orange appearance, but we're eating it, not putting it on display.  Old time theater popcorn has a rich buttery taste even before adding butter.  This oil adds very little, if any, flavor.  Being coconut oil, the kernels pop well and are tender, but it's all style & no substance.  I'll be moving on to try the next brand of oil.

review/summary: Beware the "Artificial Butter Flavoring"
review/text: There is no mention in the product description of the "Artificial Butter Flavoring" in the ingredients.  Just thought I'd mention it, for those that want to avoid that additive.  If I'd known, I would have chosen a different product, or gone with pure peanut oil.  And yes, I, too, was surprised at the small size of the container, but that's not the fault of the product description.  I should have looked more carefully at the "16oz" written plainly in the product description.

review/summary: Yummy!!  Second time I bought this item
review/text: The item description clearly states the size of the container and that it is one pound, so I knew what I was getting. Yes, it is a small container, but it really does last a long time.  The small size jar also makes it less messy than a gallon sized jug would be when you get to the bottom (would get all that gunk on your hand and arm).<br /><br />Very easy to manage when it's in a solid state.  In the summer it does soften up a bit.<br /><br />My family loves the flavor and the slight color that is added.  We also add salt.  To us, it tastes like movie theater popcorn.  I don't use a popper.  I use a heavy bottomed pot - allowing the steam to escape during popping.  Will definitely buy again and highly recommend.

review/summary: Love this oil...best popcorn ever!
review/text: I love this popping oil.  I've tried straight vegetable oil, and the Orville Redenbacher popcorn oil and nothing really compares.  The container is small in size, although depending on how you pop your corn, you don't need much.  Just using this oil makes a difference in the popcorn, but I did find that in order to get the complete movie theater taste, you have to add Flavacol to the oil before popping.  As others have mentioned, the oil is part of the perfect popcorn recipe, but not the only thing needed.<br /><br />I was so impressed with this oil, that I sent a friend a container (along with Flavacol) as a gift.  She told me it was the best popcorn she'd ever had.  I will continue to buy this for my popcorn.

review/summary: Great, just realize what you're buying
review/text: First off, for those that think this product has gone bad because it has become solid - You're mistaken. Coconut oil turns solid at room temp, that's just the nature of it. Second, for those that say it adds no flavor - You're also mistaken. This oil has butter flavoring added. You'll quickly realize this if you taste it by itself.  No, just using this oil won't make your popcorn really buttery flavored, as you can't expect a tablespoon of flavored oil to add that much flavor per kernel when you're making a huge bowl of popcorn. You should add Flavacol at a minimum, and other toppings/butter if you really need something thats majorly flavorful. Personally, this with Flavacol is all I use, its exactly the movie theater type taste I like. Also, please be aware of the size you're actually getting for the price. This thing is pretty small, but I think its worth it for the quality and the fact that I don't need a huge gallon container of coconut oil taking up space in my cabinets. Its enough to last most people for a while. Overall, I highly recommend this product and I'm sure I'll be buying it again.

review/summary: LOVE this Product!
review/text: I've been using the Wabash Valley Farms Popping Oil for a long time, and really love it!  The smell of microwave popcorn is nauseating, and the taste is almost as bad.  I really wish they'd ban it from our office.  When someone pops it, the normal smell is awful, but when they burn it, I have to leave the building!  Ugh!  Early on, my Mom taught me to cook my own popcorn in a heavy, lidded pot on the stove, and that's the way I've always done it.  This popping oil is luscious and makes the popcorn SO much more tasty than that nasty stuff from the microwave!  Try it, you'll like it!!  It'll make movie night at your house the BEST ever!

review/text: We got a new popcorn popper for my son for Christmas, and got a container of this oil to use in it.  It is really good, and provides an authentic, movie theater style taste.  The only negative for me is that the oil is a hard chunk, and you have to scrape it off in order to measure it out, but it really isn't a big deal.  I already need to order some more, a week after Christmas, because we are making so much popcorn.  Try it, it is a nice sized container, and great tasting.

review/text: These are great for making macaroon cookies.  They bake up nice and crispy.  If you want more finely shredded coconut, you can use a food processor to chop them up.  I make macaroons regularly as a tasty way of adding healthy coconut to our diet.  Since these are organic and unsweetened I use my own sweeteners and other healthy ingredients to make great recipes.  Buy in bulk if you plan to use the coconut regularly.  Note, these are dehydrated flakes, so macaroons made with this are not the usual kind made with fresh, finely shredded coconut.  They are more crispy like a cookie and we love them.

I can't say that I've tried all the brands out there - mainly because I had all but given up on American coconut flakes, that always tastes like cardboard. Similar Brazilian products tend to be less dry, you bite into a flake and taste the coconut natural oils. Well, this is as close to that as I've ever tasted. The flakes might be dry outside, but are still juicy & flavorful. I eat these as a snack and a treat, straight out of the bag!

review/summary: Yummy Healthy Coconut!
review/text: This dried coconut is delish! I was first attracted to coconut after learning about the health benefits of its saturated fats, via the Weston A Price Foundation and Mark's Daily Apple. I appreciate that it is unsweetened, and the flakes are big enough to easily grab a few for snacking. Very good value when purchased with the "subscribe and save" option.

review/summary: Yay no sugar!
review/text: These are definitely without sugar so be prepared for that.  When mixed with milk or other liquids it helps to bring out the taste of coconut moreso, but I like them<br />just as they are.<br />A 7-ounce pouch is about 7 inches tall, which was much bigger than I was thinking.<br />One pouch is a generous helping of coconut flakes!<br />The flakes themselves are not the tiny little slivers that we're used to cooking with, they're much wider.  Just in case anyone was wondering about that!

I put them in spaghetti sauce, I serve them as sandwiches on toasted rolls, I serve them over noodles in a brown gravy... the list goes on and on. Add them to soups, to Rice A Roni dishes, too, and get a nice protein boost to your meal. A wonderful inexpensive meal in our house consists of dried Chinese noodles (NOT fried Ramen noodles, but unfried noodles that we get at a local Chinese supermarket) cooked with a can of Tender Rounds, including their gravy. A little seasoning, a little hot chili sauce.... mmmm. Tastes great, costs little and opens up congested sinuses to boot!

It's a shame they couldn't maintain their healthy agenda...I would actually take off more than  one star, but two seems extreme...although the Red Dye may be enough to turn off some people, which I can fully understand!

review/summary: Cans too dented to open
review/text: Many of the cans were too DENTED to open in our electric can opener.  These cans appear to be returns to the distributor from retail stores because they are too heavily damaged to be marketed.<br /><br />My best guess is this distributor is taking ten cans of product he would normally have to throw away, packing a couple normal cans with it and selling it on Amazon.<br /><br />EVEN the CENTER CANS in the carton were badly dented.  But the cans were excellently pack with air cushion bags all around.  Accordingly, they were NOT damaged during shipment to me.<br /><br />The rounds, which are actually more meat bally spherical than round, taste acceptable.  I didn't check the expiration date.<br /><br />Three stars because I like acceptable tasting meat substitues.<br /><br />It would be nice if Amazon inspected the distributor since this product is not being sold "damaged" but I see I'm not the only one reporting this problem.

They are also good in plenty of other things like sandwichs and plain pasta with the gravy from the tender rounds as a sauce. If your not a vegetarian you might not like these; but they are really great. By the way my perfect tender round sandwich is composed of a tasty multi-grain or white hamburger bun, some mayo, and of course tender rounds.

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/text: Buying a spice blend on the internet is a crapshoot, but I lucked out with this one. I am so glad I bought this blend, and will definately be buying the rest of their spice blends.<br />  The smell nearly knocked me over when I opened it, it was so fresh and strong.I can honestly say I have NEVER bought a spice mix that smelled as fresh. I love these products!<br />  This one has a lot of cinnamon/allspice smell to it. It kind of smells like a good chai. Fantastic product!!

review/summary: Great Gum for Dental Care
review/text: I absolutely love this gum. The whole calcium from milk idea is perfect for gum that is meant to help take care of your teeth. This together with xylitol makes this, by far, my favorite gum to buy.<br /><br />The one reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is I REALLY wish Trident would get rid of the Aspertame. The gum would be sweet enough without it, especially with the flavorings and xylitol already in it. If Trident did that one thing, this would be the standard of all dental care gums.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />ALSO, what's the deal with the high price for this 12 pack on here? Someone else already pointed this out in the reviews, but it definitely needs to be mentioned: This is listed at about $1.74 per pack when buying in bulk, but my local grocery store sells the stuff individually for about $1.50, and I've even seen it on sale for $0.99. The price really needs to come down.<br /><br />=========

review/text: This is a great product and it arrived very quickly and in great condition. However; if the total purchase price including shipping ends up being any more than $17 for the same amount of gum, then it is not a deal at all. It costs me about $17/$17.50 including tax if I purchase the same amount from Walgreen's - plus I don't have to wait for it to be shipped. Please note that the gum itself works very well at lessening tooth sensitivity and freshens breath with a great taste.

review/summary: Aspartame & BHT - no thank you
review/text: For the health-conscious - read the ingredients.<br /><br />Aspartame:<br /><br />Aspartame accounts for over 75 percent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA. Many of these reactions are very serious including seizures and death. A few of the 90 different documented symptoms listed in the report as being caused by aspartame include: Headaches/migraines, dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, muscle spasms, weight gain, rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability, tachycardia, insomnia, vision problems, hearing loss, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of taste, tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss, and joint pain.<br /><br />According to researchers and physicians studying the adverse effects of aspartame, the following chronic illnesses can be triggered or worsened by ingesting of aspartame: Brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, parkinson's disease, alzheimer's, mental retardation, lymphoma, birth defects, fibromyalgia, and diabetes.<br /><br />Aspartame is made up of three chemicals: aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. The book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing," by James and Phyllis Balch, lists aspartame under the category of "chemical poison."<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />BHT:<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: "Big Daddy" is Right!
review/text: My sister found out about smoked paprika thanks to "Big Daddy's House" on the Food Network.  I use it constantly and find it as great a staple as garlic in cooking.  Smoked paprika indeed adds a beautiful smoked flavor to foods without the barbeque grill.<br /><br />Purchasing the small jars from the supermarket was getting too costly.  By purchasing the 1 lb. size, I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price, but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika, please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do, please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Excellent for the price
review/text: First this is Spanish La Mancha Saffron, grown in Spain, by far the majority of the saffron we see here in the US. Although the Blue Crocus flower is native to Iran and not Spain the best saffron is considered to be this from La Mancha. Now as for the grading system the main difference between grades is how many long yellow "styles" are attached to the stigmas which is saffron. Pure stigma saffron (basically no yellow styles) is the best quality.<br /><br />This is deep bright red Spanish saffron indicating very high crocin. The best indication of grade is the "Superior Quality" label which is the translation of the Spanish "Coupe". There are just a few styles. Bottom line you might find a more purebred saffron for a higher price. But this is a very high quality product at an unbeatable price from the best growing region in the world. The flowers here would seem to grow under the natural conditions the best, perhaps avoiding any kind of chemical alteration.

review/text: I purchased this tin of saffron for my wife's birthday. Yes, a birthday present. She happens to be a professional chef who always knew the value of high quality ingredients.  Using top-quality -- and yes, this is the best you can buy -- saffron enhances so many spanish foods, risotto and a whole lot of other dishes. You always dissolve saffron in a liquid so that the intense aroma infuses the entire dish and mixes in subtle ways with other flavors. And since you need so little, this tin will last for years. There is simply no substitute. If this is your first purchase of top quality saffron, you will be impressed and wonder how you could ever cook without.

review/text: This saffron has too much style which is the thin Threads which attached  to the stigmas. The style has no CULINARY VALUE, that means NO AROMA, FLAVOR .  The stigmas are the values of saffron. The stigma is thicker than the style and looks like a horn.  I would say about 80% of the content is style. I won't buy this again.

review/text: My family has always used saffron to flavor rice dishes, stews, desserts and even drinks.<br />I bought this product because it was a good bargain. La Mancha Spanish saffron, however, lacks the deep warm flavor and aroma of saffron. Usually, few threads of this expensive spice are enough to dramatically enhance the flavor of a big pot of rice or stew. Unfortunately this is not the case with La Mancha Spanish Saffron.<br />Cooks who have used good quality saffron will notice that La Mancha Spanish Saffron is inferior.

It's hard to find them in grocery stores except as an item mixed in with other chips, such as Doritos, Fritos, etc.  Some words of caution.  Amazon lists a variety of sources.  The cost of the chips plus shipping averages out to about $20 for a box of 30 one ounce bags (sources offerring lower prices have higher shipping costs).  The quality may vary, depending on the source.  Individual reviewers have not indicated the source that they used, so it is necessary to check the ratings for each source.
