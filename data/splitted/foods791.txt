review/text: I have a finicky basenji and he loves these treats. My dogs are also getting up in years but their joints and bones remain strong. I don't know if these treats contribute to that, but I've been giving them to them for a long time, so maybe so.

review/summary: Yummy for my dog
review/text: My mom purchased a variety of treats for my dog to try.  He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.

review/text: I have a 12 year old Corgi that has been having problems going up and down stairs, has had no interest in playing with toys over the last year.  Went to the Vet and they gave him Rimadyl.  This helped some but still was having issues, and having to carry him up and down stairs.<br /><br />Started giving him the Zukes on a whim after seeing it in the local pet store.  This stuff WORKS I am sold.  He is playing with other dogs now, goes up and down the stairs, brings toys for us to play with him again.  He is like his old self again.

review/summary: What an amazing find!
review/text: I spotted this in a local gourmet supply shoppe. I had never heard of Wild Olive Oil<br />before so I came home and did some research. The first thing I found was that this line<br />of Olive Oils is used exclusively in one of the world's best restaurant, El Celler de<br />Can Roca (3 Michelin Stars), of Girona Spain. Proprietor, the celebrated Joan Roca,<br /><br />OK, that got my attention. Then I found the company website with amazing detail on the<br />process to harvest and process these wild (organic) olives.<br /><br />"Our Wild Organic Olive Oil come from the point where Spain's largest river, the Ebro, flows into<br />Catalonia from Arag&oacute;n. A number of artificial lakes were created during the last century to generate<br />electricity. Here on these arid slopes some 600 metres high, near the village of Riba Roja d'Ebre, grow<br />numerous stubby Arbequina olive trees, small and contorted and often very old.<br /><br />The unique advantage of this altitude is that there is no incidence of the infamous white fly Dacus Olei,<br />which presents such a big challenge to organic olive farmers at lower altitudes. This means that Can Solivera<br />can grow E.U. certified olives here without the use of pesticides.<br /><br />Once harvested, our Wild Organic Olive Oil is pressed in one of the last remaining traditional stone mills in<br />Spain. The olives are ground by 3 huge granite wheels and then pressed in a pile of some 65 round straw mats.<br />The oil is then decanted from the "alpech&iacute;n" by gravity in large masonry cisterns."<br /><br />Armed with this and other information I could gather, I went back to the shoppe, bought a 17oz.<br />bottle of this amazing stuff along with some fresh French bread, and made a beeline for home.<br /><br />All I can say is this, the Gods of Olympus must surely have a bottle of this on their dining<br />table. Its that good. Its light but earthy, medium bodied but full flavored and very fruity.<br />Its great for just dipping, or in salads or for finishing. And this price is very very reasonable.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of the Spanish Olive Oils, and now I'm even more attached. Thanks to the<br />wonderful people at Solivera(dot)com for all the great background information, and for this amazing<br />gift to the culinary world. 5 Pits

review/summary: Stanley wants seconds!
review/text: Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this "Gravy with Beef" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word "choosy" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing.

review/summary: Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough
review/text: When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses "...it's mostly water," our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the "beef and liver" chunks in the future.

review/summary: Pedigree Dog Food, why I give if 5 Stars
review/text: I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.

I just purchased a second bag today and the lady at the store  - only found at Pet Stores -  told me that this is a very popular brand among cat owners especially the salmon recipe - true I noticed the shelves were almost empty. I'll continue to purchase this one for her. The price is reasonable too and at the store they always have a special offer going on! Check it Out!! They also have Nature's Recipe for Dogs :D

review/summary: Okay.... odd consistency
review/text: I prefer the normal Skippy Natural over the honey flavor, having tried both. The honey flavor has a strange, kind of more plastic-y consistency, and sugar comes before honey on the ingredients list. It tastes okay, but I don't think the extra sweetness adds anything.

review/summary: Tastes so good!
review/text: I few years ago I tried the current 'commercial' peanut butters out there: Peter Pan, Skippy and Jiff. After tasting each, I felt that Skippy tasted the best overall. When I was looking for some Skippy PB to get my fianc&eacute; one day, all they had was natural (it was all on sale at the grocery store). I picked it up and hoped for the best. This PB tastes SO good it's ridiculous. The honey flavor is subtle but appreciated. And you truly DON'T have to stir it. So it's healthy and tastes great.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I think the name is a bit misleading. Sugar is listed as an ingredient before honey. Maybe they should have called it Peanut Butter with lots of sugar and some honey.<br /><br />It is also considerably sweeter than the plain natural - 5 Grams of sugar per 2 tbsp for this vs. 2 for the Natural.

review/text: Natural peanut butter (pb) is good because it has no hydrogenated oils in it(trans fat)regular pb can list trans fat as 0 bc it has .5 g of it..which the FDA calls 0.<br /><br />anyway, Skippy is a pretty tasty pb for what it is...a grocery store pb. It has a nice rich taste an a nice hint of honey(which is nice but too weak for my likings) It is not my favorite though.<br />My favorite would be a product called naturally more. Naturally more is another natural peanut butter, except it has better ingredients and better taste.<br /><br />hope my review was helpful ;)<br /><br />link to my favorite product<br />Naturally More Peanut Butter Natural, 16-Ounce

review/summary: Very Yummy
review/text: This caught my eye at target the other day. I am a big fan of peanut butter and eat quite a bit of it to fit my fat macronutrients. The honey aspect just screamed at me I have to try it. There is about 10 extra calories (in at 200 for 2 tablespoons) from my other PB. It is definitely worth it. Price point is very reasonable considering the PB prices lately. With the honey it is a tad bit sweeter than regular PB and it's a bit thin in comparison. Almost flows like a thick honey.  Very delicious and would and most likely will get again.

Yes, the natural does feature less sugar, but we both find the taste of the honey is a sweet addition to our PB&J's, on carrots or celery or with apples.  We find the regular natural is best when making peanut butter cookies!

review/text: This is by far the best peanut butter (natural or not) that I've ever had. The addition of honey makes it incredibly yummy. I have to stop myself from eating it right out of the jar. I love that it's natural; no hydrogenated oils or preservatives or any other weird ingredients. Unlike a lot of natural peanut butters, you don't have to stir this one every time you use it or keep it refrigerated because of the addition of palm oil, which is a healthy fat. Other peanut butters (ones with hydrogenated oils) taste rancid compared to this. Will definitely be purchasing again and again.

review/summary: Not just honey for sweetener
review/text: I ordered these because they were the cheapest 'natural' peanut butter offered.  It tastes great if you like sweet peanut butter -or dont want to add anything else to a sandwich -but we dont taste the 'honey' -just 'sweet' peanut butter.  What I didnt notice is that it not only uses honey for a sweetener but sugar as well.  And since sugar comes before the honey on the ingredients list, that usually means there is more sugar than honey.  Add to this the fact that 90% of all sugar is now genetically modified and the label does not say it isnt...<br />We like the taste of this so if taste and the absense of hydrogenated oils is your only concern, this is a good choice.  If you are trying to stay truly natural and non-gmo, this is not a good option.

review/summary: human quality ingredients, unique manufacturing process-- my goldens enjoy it
review/text: My two goldens approve of this product. Blue Buffalo uses top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, no indigestible corn or wheat, a wide variety of wholesome and varied vegetable ingredients and several probiotics to promote healthy digestion and absorption of nutrients.  On top of that, this is a very palatable food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo also uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the basic "kibble" food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to better maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into dog food.<br /><br />I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo food for my cat, too.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional information:<br /><br />-One cup contains 462.8 calories<br />-NO animal by-products<br />-NO artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors<br />-NO corn, wheat, or soy AND gluten-free (great to know after last years' pet food scandals and deaths with other brands, in which added glutens were contaminated with melamine)<br />-Crude protein 25% minimum<br />-Crude fat 14% minimum<br />-Omega 3 fatty acids  0.25% min<br />-Omega 6 fatty acides 3.5% min<br />-Glucosamine 400 mg/kg max<br />-Major ngredients, in order:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice (very digestible grain source vs. the usual corn), whole ground barley, oatmeal, rye, whole potatoes, tomato pomace (natural source of lycopene), chicken fat (preserved wtih natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, blueberries, cranberries, flaxseed, barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, glucosamine hydrochloride, yucca schidigera extract, green tea extract, turmeric, garllic, sunflower oil (natural source of Omega 6 fatty acids), oil of rosemary, the whole bunch of expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food would be a good match for your best pal.

review/text: ...but of course, "Jacob" the exuberant, 16-month old Weimaraner rescue has a VERY broad definition of "edible":-)<br /><br />Full disclosure: everything we place in his dish fills him with delight.<br /><br />We purchased this brand based on the recommendations of the local breed club and a local dog specialty shop. Although our dog is a pet, and neither a show nor field dog, it was clear that owners with major investments in their show and field animals had high regard for this food.<br /><br />While I haven't sampled it, the manufacturer's emphasis on "human-grade" primary ingredients appeals to us. In the workplace, we often talk about "eating our own dog food"  in evaluating services and products delivered to customers, and this is also true for the food we choose for out pets.<br /><br />An additional note about this food. Without getting too graphic, cleaning up after your dog might present a slightly different experience. We've noted a slightly softer consistency overall. Just be prepared for a change in what your dog leaves behind...

And they are large enough pieces to really taste the cherry (not tiny bits or just cherry flavoring like you get in other bars).  This has become my favorite chocolate fix (although Godiva Key Lime truffle is a close second)...

review/summary: My favorite among many
review/text: Of all of the Green and Black flavours, Cherry Chocolate is probably my favorite.  Green and Black's Dark Chocolate is superb, and here it is mixed with large pieces of dried sour cherries.  Perfect with tea, particularly after an opulent dinner that needs to be capped off by something tart.

review/summary: great if it didn't almost break my tooth
review/text: I almost broke my tooth on this bar and have been having major tooth pain for months since.  I bit into something very hard and crumbled, which I'm assuming was a broken cherry pit...and at this point I hope it was cause that would be gross not knowing what I bit into.  They mentioned that you may encounter them on their website...but nowhere on the package. Be warned so you don't need dental work after buying an expensive chocolate bar!

review/summary: what an icky trick!
review/text: I've got to be honest, I don't care at all about free trade. I do care deeply about taste and this stuff takes two things I love and somehow screws them both up beyond recognition. what an awful disappointment. I don't think "tart" is a fair description, mouth puckeringly sour and acidic (not in a good cooking way, more like a stomach acid way) would be a more accurate description of the flavors. I don't taste any chocolate and not really any cherry (even tart) it's more just a chemical reaction with no flavor. it's actually similar to their chocolate chili bars - I love both of those things too and love the combination but rather than getting chili flavor and heat you somehow only get the unpleasant heat and no flavor.

review/summary: Finally!!
review/text: Finally I found a food that doesn't give my 1 year old Giant Schnauzer diarrhea. I have a 7 year old mini schnauzer who is very picky and has bad teeth, but always enjoyed Blue Buffalo, but poor Conrad had upset tummy every few days. So I switched him to Diamond brand, same deal. We tried probiotics, pumpkin, rice but nothing worked. A friend has the most beautiful boxer and told me about Ultramix so I decided to give it a whirl.  Both dogs gobble it up! In fact I think I will have to get a "slow down" feeder for Conrad. His stool hasn't been loose since which makes us both happy! :) yay! Yes, it is a bit pricey but I love my dogs and care for them as I do my 5 children so I want their diet to be the best it can be. I do super saver shipping and have it auto shipped each month which also saves a few bucks. Very pleased!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084FO5KY">Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix Large Breed Adult Dog Food</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084FO946">Castor And Pollux Natural Ultramix Adult Dry Dog Food</a>

review/text: We bought this as our 2 year old son was didn't like to drink milk. We saw the ad on on tv and decided to buy this. When we opened the package it was merely sugar mixed with traces of badam (almonds) and cardamom. However there was no trace of saffron! Even one strand of saffron makes the milk yellow and emits nice fragrance. Apparently MTR  is indulging in deceptive advertising. This is not healthy for kids as it is full of sugar. I have written to the company, but so far no reply.

review/text: These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts. You'll have three solid blocks instead of 18 wafers, even if you used next day delivery. Best to order this product when cloudy weather is forecast, and high temps will be in the 60's or less -- apparently those brown UPS trucks get pretty warm in the sun!

review/summary: Great Cookies -- Period
review/text: I've purchased most of the gluten free cookies available on Amazon and in local stores.  These are best of the bunch.  If you like wafer cookies -- they're good whether you can eat gluten or not (I grew up eating cookies with wheat and these compete with any "normal" wafer cookie (I wouldn't go as far as I would with Blue Diamond's Nut-Thin crackers, which I would say are better than regular crackers -- but they are at least as good as most cookies -- if you serve them to friends they won't wince (or even know they are eating gluten free) when they bite into them).  The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).  Also, an added bonus for anyone shipping to APO or DPO, they will ship to these addresses(again a caution about the heat, especially if you are shipping to Afghanistan during the summer).
