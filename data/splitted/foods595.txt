review/summary: An energy drink, not a health supplement ... don't be confused!
review/text: I appreciate the can labeling for stating nutritional facts and that there are two servings per can.  Like most people will probably do, I drank the entire thing minus a couple of sips.<br /><br />The drink labels itself as a "super-energy supplement".  The word "supplement" in and of itself has health benefits implied.  There are no specific health benefits to this drink and it shouldn't be consumed or bought with that in mind.  The ingredients labeled across the top - especially L-Carnitine has received press over the past few years as a fat dissolver, muscle builder.  Unfortunately, L-Carnitine interferes with Thyroid hormones (Synthroid, etc) and can make them less effective.  You won't see warnings about that on the can but it's something worth being aware of.<br /><br />The amount of caffeine (per serving) in this drink is about the same as a cup of coffee or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTST70">Red Bull Energy Drink, 8.4-Ounce Cans, 4-Count (Pack of 6)</a>.  I prefer my coffee with my occasional Red Bull because I love the taste of that.<br /><br />This drink has an appealing looking can and catchy name "No Fear".  This branding has made it's way into some of the MMA circles too (Uriah Faber).  The taste of this drink is citrus-like and has a predominant grapefruit taste to it.  It is sour to the taste buds and actually defies the 66 grams of sugar that it contains (33 per serving - 2 in a can).<br /><br />I got the kind of kick a Mountain Dew gives - too much sugar, too much stimulant.  3 stars for an overhyped, pricey energy drink billed as a supplement.  At least a Red Bull states what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.<br /><br />Coffee and an occasional Red Bull suit me just fine.

review/summary: Great fruit flavor
review/text: A boost in the energy department is always welcome, whether it's for an early morning wakeup call or a mid-day pickup, and for those who don't care for coffee there are a wide range of energy drink options available. No Fear's entry into the cut-throat arena is a tasty one that I'd definitely try again.<br /><br />The flavor is a blend of fruits, which I thought tasted like peach with a hint of grape, while my wife took a sip and proclaimed, "Definitely pineapple!" Whatever any given drinker gets out of the fruit blend, it's definitely a better taste than the average energy drink and has a much more pleasant flavor than Rockstar or Monster.<br /><br />On the ingredient and nutrition front, No Fear has a lot less Vitamin B6 and B12 than other varieties, with most of the energy instead coming from the taurine, caffeine, and sugar.  A full can gave me a bit less of an energy jolt than a shot of Five Hour Energy, but it also didn't make me jittery at all. If you like the sugary energy drinks but want a better flavor than the rest of the competitors, definitely give No Fear a try.

review/summary: Tastes good and provides a quick pick, however also contains a lot of sugar
review/text: The taste is good and it has enough caffeine (174mg per can) and taurine (2000mg per can) to provide a good long lasting pick-up. It also has some trace vitamins added, which although nice, still don't make this a healthy beverage by any means. It would be nice if the Amazon product page listed the full ingredients for this product and as things stand now (and have for the past week or so), the short sentence that does serve as a product description lists this as being sugar free which it is not. They do make a sugar free version of this product and it looks like they simply used the same product page for both. I did chuckle a bit because right above the sugar free description is a large legal disclaimer saying the actual ingredients as listed on the can may be different from those listed on the website.<br /><br />It does contain a large amount of sugar (OK technically high fructose corn syrup). The sugar will keep me from buying this paticular version in the future as I have no issues bombing my body with too much caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins but I have to draw the line somewhere. If you have no issue with the sugar content then this is a good choice as it taste good an is effective. I am hopeful someone will take the time to correct the "sugar free" error and then expand on the product description on the main page.<br /><br />Servings: 2<br />Calories: 130 Per serving or 260 per can<br />Sugar: 33 grams per serving (66g in the can)<br />Caffeine: 87mg per serving (174mg if you drink the can)<br />Taurine: 1000mg serving<br />Inositol: 100 mg serving<br />ginseng: 50 mg<br />guarana: 50 mg<br />grape seed extract: 25mg<br />L-carnatine: 25mg<br />L-Arginine: 10 mg<br /><br />Also has Vitamins C, B6, B12, folic acid, selenium, and zinc ranging from 10%-100% of RDA per serving.

review/text: This is the  first energy drink I've tried.  The 16 ounce can has 2 servings at 130 calories each - so - it's a great candy bar snack substitute.<br /><br />No Fear Super Energy Supplement is very delicious, perfect afternoon pick me up. It's lightly carbonated, tastes fruity and there's no added sugar.<br /><br />I'm really tired of coffee by noon and No Fear is a refreshing change.<br />Vitamin C, B6, B12, Selenium and Taurine are a few of the ingredients I wouldn't get in my coffee!<br /><br />Thumbs up to No Fear, Super Energy Supplement.

review/summary: It's pretty good, and it works a little better than most other energy drinks...
review/text: I have a very high tolerance for energy drinks, so I was pleased that this one gave me a noticeable boost in my energy level. I deliberately waited until a morning when I when to bed ultra-late and got up ultra-early, to see how well it would work, and I was pleased. I wasn't bouncing off the walls or anything, but I didn't have any issues with sleepiness and my energy was consistent. Focus also wasn't a problem.<br /><br />Energy drinks tend to have a characteristic sort of 'herbal' taste to them, and this one is no exception, but I actually enjoyed the flavor. It's flavored with grape juice and more generic 'fruit juice' (per the label), and it tastes good- sort of like a carbonated fruit punch. There IS an aftertaste, but it's really mild and brief.<br /><br />I don't normally use or recommend energy drinks, but I enjoyed this one and it worked.

review/summary: GREAT CHOICE
review/text: Let me admit straight off that I have never used an energy drink before and this was my first attempt.  I was very happy with the results and felt a noticeable a little boost in energy but the sweetness of the drink prevented me from rating it five stars.<br /><br />The taste of this drink reminded me of a cherry soda.  It was easy to drink the whole 16 ozs and I felt an increased alertness and little boost of energy for the next 4 hours.  Not being familiar with energy drinks, I was afraid of how it would taste and any after effects but this drink dispelled both of these worries.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this energy drink again since it did provided a boost in energy without any bad after effects.

review/summary: Fruity Taste; High Priced
review/text: This No Fear Super Energy Supplement drink has a crisp, fruity taste, like Pomegranate.  Each 16 ounce can is supposed to have 2 servings in it, but once the tab is pulled, you have to drink this beverage or lose the fizz.  Each can has your daily recommended vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12.<br /><br />The price is prohibitive.  If you think you need this particular product, and have prime shipping, you will pay close to $2.50 per can, which is probably higher than retail.  If you are paying for shipping, it will cost more than that.

review/summary: Great tasting and a good kick, without making me shaky
review/text: I've been drinking No Fear for around about 6-7 years now.  I've tried numerous other energy drinks (during a long period when No Fear was unavailable as they changed distributors), and nothing has ever even come close in flavor and kick.<br /><br />Like all energy drinks, it probably is an acquired taste for most, but after a couple cans you'll be hooked.  Energy drinks are highly personal, but for me, I've always gotten a solid, long-lasting kick from No Fear, without the shakiness, nervous energy and inability to concentrate I've experienced with other drinks.<br /><br />Currently you'll probably only find this stuff on the shelves in Arizona as they expand their distribution, so a case of 12 might be quite a leap for a new drinker.  I'd suggest trying several cans over a few days before you decide if you like the stuff!  On the off chance that you don't want to finish your case, send it my way!

review/text: This is a new, nice energy supplement drink that can please folks wanting a quick Energy Pick-Up.  It comes in 16 oz. cans containing Arginine, Taurine, and L-Carnitine. The taste is interesting and the product does seem to pick you up.  It contains a HUGE array of desirable supplements, from Sugars, to Folic Acid, To Vitamin B12, Caffeine, and much, much more !!  It's fairly priced, equivalent to products in its class.  If you want a "pick-me-up" in the afternoon, this would probably fit your needs !!

review/summary: No Fear of the Supplement, Some Fear of the Price
review/text: I got a single can of this as a sample from the Amazon Vine program.  I've never been one to drink energy drinks as I have always feared they would be overstimulating, so I don't have a lot of experience with them.  I split the drink with my son, since one can has two servings.  We both knew right away that we liked the taste.  To me it tastes like a delicious fruit punch. I was waiting for a jolt after drinking it, but none came.  I looked on the can and saw that it has less caffeine than a cup of coffee, and I read somewhere that taurine is supposed to regulate blood sugar, so that was a plus.  It's really hard to read the ingredients and supplement facts, and it took me a while to figure out that its name was No Fear.  I am an allergic person, and morning mucus is often a problem for me.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that after drinking it I was spitting up a lot of mucus.  In a little while my bronchials and head were clear, and I felt calm yet alert.  I think the price is kind of high, but I was thinking I might be able to stop buying Mucinex and use this product instead.  Putting it in a can almost forces you to drink 2 servings at once unless you have a good stopper for the can.  A bottle with a screw top would be better.  Nevertheless, I'm giving it 5 five stars because it makes me feel good, and that's what it's all about.

review/summary: Better than others I've tried.
review/text: I'm a coffee drinker and I also use the 5 hour energy shots so I didn't expect to get a big energy rush from this as I've built up tolerance to caffeine and vitamin B. However this drink did give me a boost that was very smooth and without jitters. The ingredients are basically identical to other drinks of this sort but what surprised me was the taste. While not great it was pretty good and had minimal aftertaste. That sets it apart from other energy drinks I've tried, and I've tried just about all of them. If you like this type of product then this is definitely worth a look. I checked the label and there wasn't any specific flavor listed so I guess there's only the one.

review/summary: Good taste, bad value
review/text: In the cutthroat market of energy drinks, you would think someone would come along and have a lower price. I am not a coffee drinker, I prefer an energy drink when I wake up. The "No Fear" energy drink is like all the other products out there. The taste was not that bad and had the same ingredients as other brands. As far as the product it did its job and I liked the taste. However, the price is just like everything else out there with no bulk discount. I am able to get AMP or NOS at 2 for $3 at most gas stations in my area, I will stick with them. I would consider buying this, but not at the current price.

review/summary: Great taste - wrong description on page
review/text: This energy drink is very good tasting, IMO.  It's extremely sweet...extremely, which I happen to like.  It tastes like a mixed berry drink to me, and it goes down nice and smooth.  There's no overly harsh taste from caffeine or carbonation like I've gotten from other drinks.  For me, it's something that I would enjoy in the afternoon but not early in the morning, though, so it isn't my choice for an early morning pick-me-up.  Since I drink caffeine in the morning and not in the afternoon, I "like" but don't "love" this stuff.<br /><br />As for the description on Amazon, it's incorrect at the time of this review.  I'd never had No Fear before and wasn't familiar with it, but the good reviews enticed me to try it.  What also enticed me was Amazon's description that it's sugar free.  While there is a sugar free version (which I noticed after ordering this), this one definitely is not - there are 66 grams of sugar per can.  That's not a cut against the product at all, but had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered this version.<br /><br />If you like sugary drinks and are looking for a sweet energy drink, this is very good stuff and worth giving a try.<br /><br />******************<br />The nutrition facts weren't available when I bought mine, so here's a listing:<br /><br />Serving size:  8 oz<br />Servings per container:  2<br /><br />The following are the amount per serving:<br />- Calories = 130<br />- Carbs = 34g<br />- Sugars = 33g<br />- Vitamin C = 100% DV (DV = "Daily Value")<br />- Vitamin B6 = 100% DV<br />- Folic Acid = 10% DV<br />- Vitamin B12. = 100% DV<br />- Zinc = 10% DV<br />- Selenium = 10% DV<br />- Sodium = 4% DV<br />- Potassium = 1% DV<br /><br />Proprietary Blend<br />- Taurine = 1000mg<br />- Inositol = 100mg<br />- Caffeine = 87mg<br />- Panax ginseng Root Extract = 50mg<br />- Guarana Seed Extract = 50mg<br />- Grape Seed Extract = 25mg<br />- L-Camitine = 25mg<br />- L-Arginin = 25mg

review/summary: Best energy drink period.
review/text: No Fear used to be my coffee, but tastier and without the ex-lax effect. Out of all the much worse energy drinks out there (Rock Star and it's billion different flavors, Red Bull you can feel the kidney stones going down your throat practically, Full Throttle's dry and dehydrating drinks and Monster just doesn't count as an energy drink) No Fear was taken off the shelves. The Mother Load I may be able to understand, because that may have been a heart attack in a can. The regular red can, the sugar free and the orange dragon fruit had what every other energy drink out there lacks: delicious taste. There's something else about it, and I don't know how they did it but it also doesn't make you crash. When caffeine wears off it wears you out, but No Fear surprisingly didn't give you that effect. I encourage stores to put this product back on the shelves and No Fear to freaking keep producing these perfect replacements for coffee!

To me, I find it strangely distantly similar to licorice...I don't know.<br /><br />The bad, in my own contention of course, seeing those new commercials about sugar being sugar and your body can't tell the difference...this product contains high fructose corn syrup (at least it did as of this review or when I received it).<br /><br />Product details:<br /><br />Nutrition Information: Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate (Color), Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor, Inositol, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Caffeine, Caramel Color, Fruit Extract (Color), Monopotassium Phosphate, Creatine Monohydrate, Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc L-Methionine, Soy Protein Isolate and Rice Flour, Guarana (Paullinia Cupana) Seed Extract, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Selenium, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin<br /><br />This product is 16 oz and the serving size is half that...so double the nutrition data in the pic I provided if you drink the whole can.

review/text: Now this drink has real flavor, rather then just a differnt slant on sweetness.<br />I thought it tasted like mango, chased with peach & maybe a bit of raspberry twist.<br />No Fear has a lighter, cleaner fruitly flavor then many energy drinks,<br />and is very enjoyable going down.<br /><br />I was surprised to notice a definable boost of energy<br />that far outlasted by about 2-3 hours the Lo-Carb Monster drink I'm used to.<br />It was a good feeling all the way, and no let-down.<br />Oh but here's the down side, I'm going to mention 3 of the biggest differences<br />between No Fear and Lo-Carb Monster.<br /><br />No Fear;<br />Calories - 130<br />Total carb - 34 g<br />Sugars - 33g<br /><br />Monster;<br />Calories - 10<br />Total carb - 3g<br />Sugars - 3g<br /><br />In all fairness I'm sure Monster has less bad stuff because it's low-carb,<br />still no matter how you slice it, it has less bad stuff.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the taste, and LOVED the energy of No Fear.<br />I can't figure how the drink can taste lighter, and yet have more sugar, but it does.<br />If you're someone who's not concerned about extra calories you should give No Fear a try.<br />It delivers a powerful engery boost.

review/summary: woke me up!
review/text: I love this product.  After one can, I'm sold.  I might opt to try the sugar free since the carb content is 30+ per serving and each can has 2 servings.  That's a bit much for one can.  The reason why I'm sold? I was dead tired and this woke me up and got me moving early in the morning. I had nothing else in my stomach and it did not cause a stomach ache.<br /><br />I personally did not detect an after taste and thought the drink was refreshing and light tasting.  Yes, it's sweet, it's going to be it has tons of sugar. I also noted a huge sodium content. I mention that in case you wish to know.  I personally only drink Energy drinks in extreme emergencies and so I don't mind the carb and sodium content in this product but I might if I drank them more frequently.<br /><br />In closing, it has a nice flavor and does the job you expect an energy drink to do.

review/text: Have been getting this for a while and when local stores had trouble getting it, I turned to Amazon.<br />With Prime shipping, this is a great deal and an awesome product.<br />The only issue I have occasionally, is if this is incorrectly packaged at the warehouse, it will arrive damaged.<br />It ships in a 12 can case, but the warehouse has a habit of packing on its side which can result in damage.<br />To date 30% of my shipments have arrived damaged BUT, customer service has been awesome resolving issues!!!

review/summary: Good but not great energy drink
review/text: The "No Fear" energy drink had a good flavor that tasted like a combination of citris and apple. While the flavor was okay and the drink did wake me up without causing me to be jittery, it was lacking something. Perhaps a little more carbination would have helped. I didn't like this drink as well as "Rockstar" or "Monster", but if you are looking for something different to try, "No Fear" is a good alternative.

review/summary: Fear the Flava
review/text: Energy drinks are pretty common these days and tend to contain the same main ingredients (sugar, caffine, taurine) so it really comes down to how they taste and do they give you a kick.  On the taste side this one has a kind of light fruity taste that I found pretty refreshing.  It did not taste very "energy drinky".  On the kick side I really didn't notice much, certainly no more that the average Red Bull or Monster - but your mileage may vary.  I'd recommend trying it for the taste and you may end up liking it.

review/summary: No Fear Super Energy Supplement Works, if You Can Get Past the Taste
review/text: Everyone could use a boost in energy from time to time and with the abundance of energy drinks and pills available, that added boost isn't very far away. No Fear Super Energy Supplement is one such energy beverage that is readily available and prepared to add a little bounce in your step, increasing alertness and filling the body with vitamins, minerals, and other ingredients known for their energy- enhancing qualities.<br /><br />Energy drinks often have an odd taste and No Fear is no different. However, it isn't as bad as some other energy drinks I have sampled over the years and I must agree with others who claim that it has a taste similar to that of Red Bull. The flavor is berry- like, but with added herbs and other things that are somewhat difficult to describe. The taste is certainly not something I would seek out, but it isn't terrible and I found that it left the palate in a short time. There was no nasty aftertaste, so once you got past the few seconds of unpleasantness, there was nothing left to remind you of the so- so flavor you just experienced.<br /><br />As for the energy component, No Fear is about as good as any other energy drink and I found that it did succeed at making me feel a little more alert and ready to get up and go. I sampled this drink for the first time when it was getting late- around 10pm- and I was starting to feel a little drowsy. Normally, I rely on caffeine to get me through these moments, but this time, I reached for No Fear instead and I found that I did feel wider awake and ready for a second wind.<br /><br />Energy drinks have their usefulness and No Fear is good at boosting energy so you can go about your day. It isn't the best energy drink I have ever tried and certainly not the best tasting. But the flavor isn't bad and it does make a difference when you need to eliminate sluggishness and keep yourself alert and ready for action.

review/summary: The only thing setting it apart is the skull
review/text: I have had my fair share of energy drinks...from the old fave, Red Bull to the more sinisterly painted Monster energy drink. The basic ingredients in these drinks are the same with differences in amount. And of course let's not forget the packaging. That is where the drinks differ. While Red Bull has a more subdued packaging, Monster drinks looks like something radioactive that a Marvel Superhero would drink before "hulking" out. No fear continues the trend by featuring a skull with wings which would make an awesome tattoo if you were to get one.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad but at the same time, it doesn't taste significantly different to set it apart from the other drinks on the market.

review/summary: Better than sucking sugar from a straw
review/text: As far as energy drinks go, this wasn't so bad. I don't think you can find one that actually tastes good, but that's mainly because of the energy ingredients. I have had far worse, and this one didn't give me the jitters or shakes as some will, and did provide a decent energy boost.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to really love this one over others, for me, it's better than most, but not something I will regularly consume. A few diet cokes usually have enough caffeine to 'pick me up', and tastes MUCH better....

review/summary: Low fiz taste makes No Fear a good buy
review/text: This lightly carbinated energy drink, that has a tropical fruit flavor and smell, brings a crips drink that would be great in hot weather. There is virtually no aftertatse. It is better on the inside of the can than out, dinged for weird art graphics and hard to read red print on black base can. But, if you're looking for a nice ebergy drink to get you through those last hard hours, it is a good buy.

review/summary: I will stick with 5-hour Energy Drinks
review/text: I usually drink a 5-hour Energy drink<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GX1K14">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength (24 Bottles Grape)</a> when I first get up so that I can quickly get in to my morning P90X routine. I put one on my nightstand before going to bed and quickly drink it down in the morning. I don't much care for the taste (though I don't exactly hate it) but I like the effect of energy drinks on my exercise performance, and that is why I decided to give this No Fear drink a try. I was disappointed and will stick with 5-Hour Energy. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1 - Calories: At 260 calories a can, there is a 65X difference. It does not fit in with my nutrition goals.<br /><br />2 - Taste: It's a little sweeter than a Red Bull. I don't much like Red Bull though and the flavor of No Fear was not an improvement over 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />3 - Size: This is a BIG can yet it has roughly the same amount of caffeine, taurine, etc as 5-Hour Energy. Why drink this massive can of fluid when a small shot will do? If I REALLY enjoyed the taste, I might feel otherwise.<br /><br />4 - Energy Boost: I found the effect of No Fear to be similar to that of 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />Bottom line: 5-Hour Energy works better for me.

review/summary: Typical Energy Drink
review/text: No Fear,Super Energy Supplement is your typical energy drink, and in my opinion tastes very similar to Red Bull. I tend to find all energy drinks taste the same though. Drinking the whole can at once also provides about the same "pick me up" as drinking 2 cans of Red Bull. If you're a fan of energy drinks, you'll probably like "No Fear,Super Energy Supplement". If you hate the taste of products such as Red Bull, you probably won't.

review/summary: What's to Fear?
review/text: I am a rather casual consumer of energy drinks.  I have had my fair share of them to get me through the day as needed. My very favourite drink got pulled off of the market for no other reason than because of its controversial name.  "No Fear Energy Drink" has an eye catching can design and what's inside had a decent berry taste.  Many drinks are either sickeningly sweet or have funky aftertaste due to the taurine and other ingredients. No Fear was better than a good many better selling energy drinks.  As for its properties:  it really was rather mediocre as far as how much of an energy 'boost' that it gave.

review/summary: Best tasting energy drink I've ever had
review/text: I'll have an energy drink on occassion but am not addicted to them as some of my friends are. With No Fear, Super Energy I would definitely consider drinking them on a regular basis. Most energy drinks taste like cough syrup to me but this one has a pleasant fruit taste. It was more like drinking fruit punch with a little kick. I didn't feel a zinging energy boost but I did manage to stay up later that evening after drinking the supplement at about 2:00 in the afternoon. I would recommend this for anyone who dislikes the taste of energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull and only need a slight energy burst but if you need a super boost of energy pass on No Fear.

review/text: `No Fear, Super Energy' is a big claim when there are so many energy drinks out there.  For about less than three bucks a can, it competitive in price, but I have to be honest.  The taste was bad.  It was like a chemical peach flavor without much fizz.  I am sensitive to caffeine and Taurine, but really did not feel much of a boost.  If you like your vitamins, there is plenty of Vitamin C, B6 and B12.  The calorie intake is 260 a can!  I think I will stick to Red Bull or RockStar, even if they cost a little more.

review/text: I've not tried a bunch of energy drinks, but have used Celsius products <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JOY1Q4">Celsius Green Tea, Raspberry Acai, Value Pack, 4 ct.</a>in the past, and drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X5FYJQ">Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion, 30-Count</a> before workouts; with great success in boosting my energy levels using both products.<br /><br />When given the opportunity to try out 1 can of No Fear 'Super Energy' Supplement via the Amazon Vine Reviewers program, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />What I like about this drink:<br />1. It tastes good.  Kind of like Squirt soda or a sweet grapefruit juice.<br />2. There are TWO servings per can.<br />3. One serving has 100% of your daily recommended Vitamin C, B-12, and B-6.<br />4. It contains Grape Seed Extract, which is believed to boost your immune system.<br />5. Contains some Zinc and Potassium to help with recovery after a workout.<br /><br />What I don't like about this drink:<br />1. The calories - but I hear there's a sugar-free version.  Not sure how that would affect the taste though.<br />2. NO ENERGY BOOST for me.  None. I do drink coffee and perhaps that means my tolerance is higher?<br />3. 34g of carbs per serving.  Again, the sugar-free version might be worth a try for some.<br />4. Two servings in one can may be deceiving to some who would not read the can to see that they'll get 2x's the calories, caffeine, etc... by drinking the whole can.<br />5. Expensive!<br /><br />For me, there are better options out there for energy drink supplements.  My recommendation is to give it a try if you don't mind the sugar and calories in this one, and see if it works for you.

review/summary: Shareable size, but flavor is meh and no kick?
review/text: This large (16oz) two-serving can is big enough to share, and has some ingredients not found in my usual energy drink (Redbull) such as L-Carnitine.  But I found the flavor lackluster, the calorie count high, and somehow I didn't get the bit of a buzz that I normally get from an equivalent amount of Redbull.<br /><br />I've had Redbull in many conditions and combinations and always enjoy it (and always notice a bit of a perk, if not an outright buzz).  There wasn't any similar effect that I noticed from drinking a serving of this NoFear on an empty stomach.  Redbull hardly tastes natural, but this stuff tastes...weird, like flat RC Cola mixed with something.<br /><br />Comparing labels, the NoFear claims slightly higher caffeine content (87g vs 80g) than an 8.4oz Redbull, but also has more calories/carbs.  For a class of product that's already heavy on sugar, adding even more doesn't seem wise.<br /><br />It comes down to that I didn't think "that was tasty!", nor did I feel energized. Flavor preferences are personal, and I'm sure some people will get a caffeine jolt from NoFear, but for my tastes, Not Recommended.

review/summary: Oily Kool-Aid (Sorry, Kool-Aid)
review/text: No Fear has soy in it.<br /><br />The initial flavor in this was not too bad.  I don't know that I have ever liked one on the first try - even my favorite sugar free Red Bull.  The initial flavor wasn't too terrible, but then it had a sour aftertaste.  It has a seriously chemical flavor to it and a slippery, kind of oily, feel to it - kind of like pouring gasoline in kool-aid.<br /><br />The problem for me was the excess carbonation.  Take a drink, burp.  Take a drink, burp.  Not something to drink in polite company.<br /><br />Then there is the sugar and the serving size.  I don't know why manufacturers say that 16 oz is 2 servings.  Maybe so that we think there are 130 calories?  There aren't.  There are 260 calories. That's more than my morning omelet.<br /><br />In any case, I wouldn't buy a case of any energy drink without trying one first.

It doesn't even taste good, so why would anyone put this crap in their body? It has lots of caffeine and 260 empty calories per can. There are supposedly two servings per can so if you down this whole can know that you double all the amounts on the label. There is no good reason to consume this stuff.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: From the product description: "A brand new taste"- relative to an earlier version? To me it tasted an awful lot like sugar-free grapefruit juice. "Toughest can on the shelf"? I disproved that immediately, while trying to remove the bubble wrap form the single can Vine offered, the knife went a millimeter too deep and made a nice scratch in the can, which immediately burst. I slapped into a containment glass, but it is the Vine's way of rarely offering enough of a food or beverage for the reviewer to form an honest and well considered opinion.<br /><br />OK, ok, I know that's not what they meant by "toughest drink", but I was unaware that was a quality anyone would ever seek in an energy drink.<br /><br />As it stands, I am not very well acquainted with this style of beverage anyway, while I saw them mainly as hangover cures, I guess many regular users see them as an important part of their intake of vitamins and minerals. And Taurine and the other raft of fairly obscure supplements. And often caffeine, although my label was somewhat damaged and I couldn't quite make out the rather extensive list of ingredients. I suspect this is of little interest to the average user in any case.<br /><br />I happened to be pretty beat the day it arrived, and didn't even want to stop for a Five Hour Energy- my usually dependable source of a brief respite from fatigue- so it was a perfect time to try it out. Any "lift" or burst of energy was not readily apparent, although it did help chase away the blahs for a little while. I still went to bed early.

review/summary: Excellent Tasting Awesome Energy Drink!
review/text: Normally, Energy drinks do not do much for me. Actually, most of them either make me sleepier, or leave me with an odd feeling in the stomach and do nothing to improve my energy. I find that most of the powdered or small bottles of Vitamin-B filled energy drink-mix or "shots" tend to work better, extending my energy for a longer amount of time. Nothing too amazing, but if I don't feel like I am going to make it through a whole work day, I can take one of those and last through the shift and then some.<br /><br />Then I tried No Fear, "Super Energy Supplement" - and I experienced something I had never experienced before! I was not bouncing off the walls, but I went from awfully tired (feeling like I wouldn't last more than half hour before falling asleep) to having plenty of energy for hours and hours and hours! I did not feel too tired to get up and go do work - in fact, I felt like I was full of energy and could do whatever I wanted without worry of tiring myself out! Also, the energy lasted me for quite a long time! Seems to last a good 15 to 18 hours! I drank one just after midnight as I got to work tired, and was still plenty awake and full of energy at 6 PM (18 hours later) trying to get to sleep for the next work day!<br /><br />I found this odd, and figured it may have been a fluke. Considering I have never had such success with energy drinks, I had to perform some tests and compared days where I was not tired to days that I was tired and tried a No Fear drink. I have more energy when tired and using a No Fear than most days when I am fully awake! No Fear helps me go from very tired to being able to perform on one of my better days. I have to say, No Fear works great! No doubt about it - it tastes great, works great, and I am very happy to have found it!<br /><br />I am also very happy about the flavor. I would have to describe the flavor as a grapefruit-soda type flavor. My best description would be "Squirt, but with actual grapefruit flavoring" - because you don't taste much actual grapefruit in those other sodas. I love Squirt and grapefruit flavor, so No Fear's flavor was nothing less than AWESOME! And, I did not get that odd feeling in my belly that I tend to get with most other energy drinks!<br /><br />If you are wondering if No Fear is for you, I would recommend giving it a go. I normally have little to no benefit from energy drinks, and this one really worked! The flavor is great, and I did not experience a lack of energy when it wore off. I seem to have different results than most, but I think it is still worth giving a try!

While I realize that each can gives you TWO servings (33g per serving,) it is a can, so it would be inconvenient to keep it open while it gets stale and loses the fizz.  If sugar does not bother you, I suppose this is a great choice for you and as with most energy drinks, be careful not to overdose!

review/summary: I LIKED IT SO WELL I BOUGHT THE COMPANY!
review/text: Not really:)I absolutely love the taste of this energy drink, though! But does it give you energy? Yep. But I would only use it to do certain things or at certain times of the day. By that, I mean I wouldn't use a whole can of this stuff as pre-workout drink if I was planning on having a massive iron pounding workout. Off the top of my head, I think is roughly 175mg of caffeine in a whole can. It takes about twice that much caffeine for me a big and heavy workout day to give that "in the zone" iron punishing feeling. The best uses I've had with No Fear is drinking a half can in the morning for excellent pick-me-up and taking on days when all I plan to do at the gym is cardio or biceps. Small workouts. For those it works great and I get a good clean energy from it. No jitters. No stomach problems. In fact, I will usually drink half on the way to gym and save the other half while I'm doing cardio.<br /><br />I suppose the downside to No Fear, as with most energy drinks, is that it has quite a bit of sugar and calories. And it's slightly pricey. For me, the calories and sugar are mostly a non-issue since I have a fairly high metabolism rate and mostly watch what I eat(except on the weekends ;) A 16 ounce can has 260 calories and 66 grams of sugar. Not real good for some people. I'm not sensitive to caffeine, at all, so a half of a can may work wonders for some people. I think what really helps provide a good dose of energy(aside from the caffeine) with this stuff is it having 2 grams of Taurine in a can. Add in 200% of B12 and it all comes together to give a rather nice hit. I've tried numerous energy drinks over the years and most I haven't been impressed with either because of taste or lack of energy. The taste of this stuff is very good. Has a nice citrusy afterbite to it. Goes down smooth. The best energy drink I've tried is Knockout Punch. By test I mean taste, price and energy.... that stuff has 320+ mg of caffeine in a can... potent stuff.<br /><br />But you really can't go wrong with No Fear. It's a close 2nd to Knockout Punch Energy Drink. With No Fear you're going to get at excellent tasting energy that is going to give you a good kick in the seat of your shorts if you use it for the right purpose. Just don't drink a can 30 minutes before you workout and think you're going to train like Ronnie Coleman in his prime. I primarily use this a wake me up get me going morning coffee substitute. I hate coffee... but I like this stuff so much I bought a 12 pack after trying a free sample. I'm a stickler for high quality health supplements, so if I buy a case of something you can bet it's good stuff. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 or a 4.25 out of 5.<br /><br />If it would have had a whopping load of caffeine in it it would have gotten at least a 4.5 from me. The Knockout Punch I mentioned eariler I haven't reviewed yet, but I would give it a solid 4.5 stars out of 5, in comparison. With it's only really downsides being too much sugar and calories for some people. To be honest, even being in great shape, I don't need all of the excess junk calories and sugars I get. I don't really complain about that stuff, usually, but I know it's a concern for many people, which is why I always try to point that out in a review.

review/summary: No Fearing This Energy Drink
review/text: Energy drinks are one of those things that you love or you hate. Some companies get the flavors right while others miss the boat entirely. No Fear gets it right. Very drinkable and smooth. No major crash afterwards. Those familiar with these types of drinks will not get the "shakes" either. Again, you either buy the conspiracy hype regarding these things being bad for you, or you're an adult who can read a label and know exactly what you are going to get. Personally, I have been enjoying these style drinks in moderation for years. Since this particular brand can be hard to find in some areas, you might as well get it here on Amazon.  No Fear here!

review/summary: Yucky Tasting and High in Sugar, Carbs and Calories
review/text: I prefer Monster or Rockstar energy drinks, but I am always trying new one's because I like variety. The first thing that I noticed when I got this can was the amount of sugar, carbs and calories in this can. It is ridiculous! 260 calories, 66 gm of Sugar and 68 carbs per can. There is supposedly 2 servings per can, but who drinks just half a can? Plus, in can form it is hard to save.<br /><br />Now for the taste: in my opinion this tasted like sour passion fruit. It was nasty! I wasn't able to drink more than two sips because I found it so repulsive. I realize that people's taste buds are different and some people may love the taste, but I hated it. I recommend trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WQ1NT0">16 Pack - Monster Rehab - Tea + Lemonade + Energy - 15.5oz.</a> if you want a great tasting drink that is low in carbs, sugar and calories.

review/summary: Look elsewhere...
review/text: I'm a fan of most energy drinks, but No Fear's Super Energy is not impressive.<br /><br />Each can contains two servings, each serving being 130 calories and 33 grams of sugar, and only 90 milligrams of caffeine. For me that is a lot of empty calories and not a whole lot of "energy" to be honest with you.<br /><br />Taste wise it's actually quite pleasant. Drink it super chilled or iced and it's refreshing.<br /><br />Energy wise, it's not even close to my standard <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001534R00">Celsius</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VMVOF8">GURU </a> that I drink.<br /><br />If you're not too concerned about calories and want something a bit different than coffee in the morning, give it a shot.<br />If you're wanting some energy and not a bunch of sugar, I'd recommend taking a look at the two products mentioned above.

review/summary: Does the trick
review/text: Received a sample can of this through the Amazon Vine program. I tested it on the morning of my first day with a new job and it certainly provided a boost. Because it was a new job, I hardly slept the night before. In the morning I felt dead tired, so I drank down the can of No Fear. Suddenly, I was ready to face the day. The effect was better than coffee.<br /><br />With all of the above in mind, No Fear Super Energy Supplement is certainly worth a try for those folks looking for something to help keep them awake and alert. No Fear tastes pretty good, and the energy boost effects kick in almost immediately upon drinking it.

It would be great for mixed drinks too for parties but I just used it as a supplement to lunch and I didn't want to nap around 3 pm when my energy usually dips. Very impressed that I didn't feel jittery or nauseated after drinking it either. I MUCH prefer this one over Red Bull.

review/summary: Pumps Energy, Taste Could Be Improved
review/text: Take it from someone who has never taken an energy drink, never downed an energy "shot". I am a total newbie to the burst of energy you're supposed to get with these new fad drinks. So here is what happened when I tried this product.<br /><br />I waited until I was dragged down and tired. Side bar: I am fit and active, and am rarely tired. Continuing, the day I was dragged down, I drank 1/2 of the can and had to stop because the flavor repulsed me. I forced myself to drink it so I could see if it worked or not. After about five minutes of downing 1/2 of it, I definitely felt a surge of energy. I got to my feet and continued my day with the energy I like to have all the time. I did not notice that the effect died off; I seemed to feel fine the rest of the day (approx from noon to bedtime).<br /><br />So I think this product does what it says. I just wish it tasted better. It was unpalatable to me, but sometimes, medicine doesn't taste as delicious as we wished it did.

review/text: No Fear comes in a 16 oz can. The can contains two servings (total 260 calories per can).<br />I don't know of many people who would drink half of this can and then store the rest for later or share it.<br />This stuff tasted sweeter than regular soda and probably is. It also has a bitter taste almost like grapefruit.<br />It was bad it just wasn't good to me. The first two ingredients were Carbonated water and High fructose corn syrup.<br />There is way too much sugar in this for me. I didn't really feel an energy kick. I would not use it again.

review/summary: Did not seem all that different from other brands
review/text: I will state up front that I do not drink energy drinks frequently.  I like to use them for a big pick-me-up when I really need it.  Therefore, I don't really have a brand loyalty and will usually just drink whatever is on sale or looks most interesting that day.<br /><br />This drink was like most others - a little too sweet and with a flavor I could not exactly place.  The taste was okay, nothing to get excited over, so I was hoping for a big energy boost.  What I got was the normal sort of kick I get from most energy drinks - not really a burst of energy, but feeling slightly more alert and on-the-ball.  The effects just wore off gradually, so at least there was no crash like I have experienced with some.<br /><br />The price is pretty comparable to other such drinks, so there is really no savings to entice me to purchase this brand over any other.  I can't say that I would turn down one if it was offered to me, but I don't think I would go out of my way to seek it out either.

review/text: Where red bull is your standard, and for good reason, there are always going to be other attempts at achieving their success. Make it bigger. Creepy can to appeal to the kids. Illusion of a hard core drink without the so-called "kick".<br /><br />It's just "eh". Energy drinks never really taste too great.  So this has it's cough syrup flavored carbonation with extra water to make it big. At least with Red Bull, they have the formula down to give it their "wings".  But No Fear, I fear is too weird.  I don't get it.  I was given one can, so I can only rate my one short experience with it as non-effective, and not worth the unpleasant taste.  I won't be going out of my way to buy one.  But, if I wanted a couple energy drinks, and they were the only ones available, I guess I would get them.  But there really is no point.

review/text: The No-Fear, Super Energy Supplement is...well, a super-sugary energy drink.  I normally drink diet energy drinks, either Monster or Red Bull, so maybe that was what made this seem so darned sweet to me.<br /><br />Did I feel a significant jolt of energy after consuming it?  No, not so much, especially given that it's a 16 oz can.<br /><br />I prefer Monster to the No-Fear in the "large size energy drink" department.<br /><br />I wish I could write a longer review here, but there's not much to say.  I received this drink for free to test, so I don't know what it costs.  The only reason I'd consider buying No Fear is if it had a substantial price advantage vs. Red Bull or Monster.

review/text: No Fear, Super Energy Supplement is not all that its cracked up to be.  I was stoked to try it out because I really enjoy energy drinks.  I didn't care for the juice taste and it was too sweet.  The "juice" taste was too overwhelming for my taste buds and it made me feel loggy instead of refreshed.  You can taste the HFCS in the drink and it taints the product in my book. The sticky sweet taste ruins what could have been a really good energy supplement.  The crash I had afterwards was even worse.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good energy drink I advise you to look elsewhere.  I do not recommend No Fear.

review/summary: Too many calories and too strong a taste...
review/text: I was looking forward to trying NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK because I definitely could benefit from a daily energy drink, and this one was recommended by a friend. But I found it much too strong, and grimaced after the first sip.<br /><br />As a person who loves to eat lemons whole, I've never avoided strong, fruity flavors, but NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK has a pronounced pineapple taste (with a touch of grapefruit and grape), and pineapple in particular has never appealed to me.<br /><br />I had to force myself to drink half a can, which I discovered later, is 130 calories. The entire 160 ounce can is 260 calories, containing a whopping 66 grams of sugar. That's considerably more calories than I use up in a workout.<br /><br />On a positive note, an 8 ounce serving does fulfill 100% of the daily requirement for vitamins C, B6 and B12, and 10% for folic acid, zinc and selenium. It also contains soy, and traces of sodium and potassium.<br /><br />Additional elements in the drink are difficult to determine from the can, as the print on it is not only small - it is too thick to be readable. I was able to find out however that the primary ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and carbonated water. It also contains l-carnitine, which has definite health benefits (I take it daily for hyperthyroidism), as well as grape seed extract, targine and argine. It appears to have few preservatives.<br /><br />I did not notice any difference in my energy level the hour after drinking it. But five minutes afterwards, I experienced a bout of frequent burping.<br /><br />Personally, I would not drink NO FEAR ENERGY drink again. But taste is subjective, and people who like the flavor and do not mind all the calories might enjoy it. My inclination, however, is to stick with my favorite drink, glaceau vitamin water zero (acai blueberry or mixed berry) which is delicious, nutritious and calorie- free, and leaves me feeling clear-headed and motivated.

review/text: ....even though this was in the fridge for me, my husband grabbed it before I could get to it!  This is typical of him, eating and drinking things I intended to consume; but here is what he had to say about it:  fruity, smooth, no weird after taste like many energy drinks contain.  Did not notice any caffeine buzz or "energy" but very good as a beverage.  Would he drink another? Sure, but probably would go for something else with less calories, less sugar, and more of a kick.<br /><br />I have to note that before I placed this in the fridge to chill, I noticed that the entire can contains no more caffeine than a large strong coffee.  The sugar content is high, and for those who want to spare themselves extra calories will not be impressed with that here, but my guess is the that this appeals to a crowd who doesn't (yet) have to worry about caloric intake.

If I see a sugar-free No Fear, I will try it. For me, my choice will continue to be Monster Absolute Zero or diet Rockstar. If you don't mind the crazy amount of sugar and you like berry-flavored drinks, than this No Fear is a good choice.

And yes you will inevitably crash from it. (I did.) It does taste better than red bull and about the same as Rock Star. But seriously, 2 of these day as some people reported seems to be putting you on track for health problems. And why in the world does an energy drink need a skull on the front? I downed my can before doing an MMA session. The guys in my class were not extra intimidated when they saw the skull. (Bummer.) I did not have any greater than usual work out ability. Time did not slow down. UFC fighters and BJJ black belts did not run away in fear.<br /><br />This really isnt a bad drink, I was just hoping for something different or better or healthier than EVERY OTHER energy drink out there. Instead it just seems to be trying to cash in on some sort of bad a$$ mystique. While pumping you full of carbonated water, HFC and citric acid. (Also contains Soy?!?)  I'm going to stick with black coffee, green tea, yerba mate, exercise and multivitamins for my caffeine, energy and supplement needs.

The syrup is high fructose corn, and the preservatives and colors just make it worse.<br /><br />I know this drink is sought after as referenced in so many reviews here, but the sugar content and syrup definitely left a bad feeling in my stomach...will not be drinking it again.

review/summary: Big on sugar, low on ... everything else
review/text: Go to any grocery store, gas station or nutrition shop, and you will no doubt be overwhelmed with the panoply of energy drinks on the shelves. There is clearly money to be made here, so every company under the sun has their own brand, replete with flashy packaging and a mad-scientist assortment of ingredients. No Fear Super Energy Supplement drink is just such a drink. The cool black can with the menacing skull and bold lettering are alluring, likely to attract many. Tread cautiously, dear energy drink consumers.<br /><br />The aforementioned flashy labeling atop the can highlights ingredients such as Taurine, Arginine and L-Carnitine, which are all great components of a good energy drink, but the quantity included in this beverage are so minimal that their impact is likely negligible. And caffeine? 85mg per serving. Slightly higher than a cup of green tea. Basically, every ingredient falls far short of being able to have any real impact -- other than the sugar. But, I'll let the nutritional panel speak for itself:<br /><br />Serving Size: 8 fl oz (240ml)<br />Servings Per Container: 2<br /><br />Amount Per Serving:<br />Calories: 130<br />Total Carb.: 34g (11%)<br />Sugars: 33g<br />Vitamin C: 60mg (100%)<br />Vitamin B6: 2mg (100%)<br />Folic Acid: 40mcg (10%)<br />Vitamin B12: 6mcg (100%)<br />Zinc: 1.5mcg (10%)<br />Selenium: 7mcg (10%)<br />Sodium: 100mg (4%)<br />Potassium: 20mg (1%)<br /><br />Proprietary Blend: 1.35g<br />Taurine: 1000mg<br />Innositol: 100mg<br />Caffeine: 87mg<br />Panex ginseng Root Extract: 50mg<br />Guarana (Paullinia Cupana) Seed Extract: 25mg<br />Grape Seed Extract: 25mg<br />L-Carnitine: 25mg<br />L-Arginine: 10mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate (Color), Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor (Contains Soy), Inositol, Ascorbic Acid, Caffeine, Caramel Color, Fruit Juice Concentrate (Color), Monopotassium Phosphate, Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Guarana (Paullina Cupana) Seed Extractive, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Potassium Sorbate, Selenium Complex with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin.<br /><br />Well, if that list isn't compelling enough to get you to rush out and slam a few of these, maybe the taste will! The flavor is something akin to a slightly un-ripened fruit blend, with a metallic, vitamin aftertaste. If you aren't yet drooling, then perhaps the energy rush will get your head swirling. Speaking of ... .<br /><br />For an "energy supplement," there was nary a buzz derived from this beverage. I experienced an ever-so-slight perk, likely due to the sugar content, rather than the blend of B-Vitamins, amino acids and caffeine, which was quickly followed by a large crash, again, likely due to the sugar (66g in the entire can, may I remind you!).<br /><br />Bottom line:  No Fear Super Energy drink is essentially nothing more than colored sugar (well, high fructose corn syrup, specifically) water. You're honestly better off drinking a good old 12 ounce can of Mountain Dew, which has better flavor, a bigger energy boost, lower caloric impact and cheaper cost. Fear the No Fear.

review/text: If you like No Fear, you will like this.  It has a refreshing citrus taste and is not over carbonated like some of the other energy drinks. You get more energy then from a soda, but not enough to make you feel jittery or have a big crash.  It's not as much energy as compared to a Red Bull.  It tastes like Mt.Dew, but not as sweet.

If you've ever ordered an energy drink from a television network website because it had the logo of your favorite TV show then you've drank something VERY similar to this. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the company that makes "No Fear" sells this exact beverage under different names to anyone who wants an "energy drink" with their company logo on it.<br /><br />The drink isn't bad, it's just boring and completely unoriginal. If your are a fan of energy drinks like I am then you won't find anything new here when you open a can of No Fear.

review/summary: You'll have more energy than....the average housecat!
review/text: NO FEAR, as energy supplements go, is okay. Based on one can, it seemed to provide enough caffeine to fuel my typical Saturday, although a busy workday would have been a better test. (Alas, the Vine program only provides one can, so I couldn't compare.)<br /><br />It has a nice, fruity flavor, with little aftertaste. The carbonation seemed a little weak, which gives it a sort of "watered-down" feel.<br /><br />Like other energy drinks, NO FEAR contains taurine, an essential amino acid for felines which they get from their carnivorous diets. (In cats, a deficiency can cause blindness.) As for its health benefits in humans, the jury is still out. I'm not convinced it has any particular benefit, except that listing it as an ingredient probably increases sales.<br /><br />I only mention that because NO FEAR and other emergy-drink products tout themselves as "health" drinks, but that's not necessarilly true. If you buy NO FEAR, do so because of its caffeine content. NO FEAR contains about 83 mgs of caffeine per 8 ounces, which is more than Pepsi Max (69 mg) but less than a typical cup of coffee (110 mg) or black tea. NO FEAR is certainly an option if you don't like the taste of coffee or you just prefer cold, fizzy drinks.<br /><br />But maybe an extra dose of taurine in the morning will hone your catlike reflexes and allow you to attack your day like a leopard taking down a gazelle!<br /><br />Right before your six-hour nap.

review/summary: Not Very Healthy!
review/text: The first thing I do when Iam trying or thinking about trying a new product is look at the ingredients, at least I can do that in a store, where I can see the product up close.  Online you may get the general idea, which is open to interpretation.<br /><br />I've never had an energy drink before, or any energy product besides 5 hour energy.  With that, which I have only tried that once, was if I drank the whole bottle, tho it is small it may have given me energy, but I didn't feel very good, until it wore off.<br /><br />This product, No Fear, which I had to turn the can around to even see what it was called, it's a 16 ounce can, which is supposed to be 2 servings.  On the front of the can it says super energy supplement.<br /><br />I took a few sips.  It tastes like grapefruit, so the taste isn't bad.  It's kind of refreshing.<br /><br />Then I read the ingredients on the back of the can.  What I saw amazed me!!<br /><br />Calorie wise it's 130 calories, but what really surprised me is the amount of carbohydrates, it's 34 grams, but the sugar is 33 grams, and both of those are for ONE serving!<br /><br />I wonder if the real energy you are getting is because of all of the sugar that is in this product!<br /><br />The caffeine level is 87 mg's, so I don't know how much that computes to when you are considering the amount of caffeine, what differentiates a high caffeine level versus a low caffeine level.  I suspect that this drink is on the higher end of the spectrum as far as the caffeine level.<br /><br />I just wonder if the can shows it's for 2 servings, what if you don't want to drink the whole can at once, which is 16 ounces?  If you saved the other half of the can, just like soda, which first has fizz when you open the can, if you have some left over it won't have the fizz.<br /><br />Iam really not sure who would want to drink this product or why, but for me, just the amount of carbohydrates and sugars would make this a drink I could never consider drinking.<br /><br />At least for me, this is NOT a healthy drink!  Maybe if your main concern is having more energy it may not matter to you, but at what cost?<br /><br />I would be curious to see how someone would feel who had drank this whole can of No Fear.<br /><br />What they should fear is getting diabetes, especially if they drank this on a regular basis!

review/text: I have tried many "energy drinks" and try to use them sparingly, but with everyone's overloaded schedules these days, it's easy to see why people buckle under for some "magic" pick me up sometimes. This particular drink is one of, if not the worst I've ever tried! It's so sweet that you will wince while swallowing this stuff. It also has a terrible taste(whatever flavor it is?)that will not leave you wanting more, but will leave a "I can't wait until it's over" sensation. If you want a good one that doesn't effect your stomach(like me, if I drink three cups of coffe, my stomach is wrenched!) try Celcius, it's very low carb and doesn't make you run out of gas. Like all of these drinks, it's easy to become addicted to them, use only when you just need a boost and not just because you like to ZING! ha-ha! ....Oh yeah and you all know the "magic" is caffeine... right? ;-b

review/summary: Nice energy boost, followed by a hard sugar crash
review/text: The text on this can of No Fear Super Energy Supplement is very blurred, like the red ink doesn't line up with the rest of the print on the can, so I didn't try too hard to read it before I started drinking it.  I was a little more than halfway through the can when I realized that there are two servings per can--does anyone save half a can for later?  If you can figure out a way to do that it's probably a good idea, since each serving will give you 33 grams of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup.  I could have eaten a candy bar and come out ahead.<br /><br />All that sugar, plus 87 mg of caffeine (per serving) did give my skull wings, right before the sugar crash that followed.<br /><br />The flavor is far too sweet for my tastes, with kind of a weird fruit flavor.  It felt like the inside of my mouth was coated with syrup, like I'd been drinking cough syrup.  Come to think of it, this would probably make a great flavor for kids' cough syrup.<br /><br />It wouldn't work as a kids' drink, though.  The label warns: "Not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine."  Those who are allergic should know that it also contains soy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sugar boost but couldn't possibly eat another bag of Skittles, this is for you.  If all you want is the "proprietary blend" containing taurine, inositol, caffeine, ginseng root extract, grape seed extract, l-carnitine, and l-arginine, you might want to check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW">sugar free</a> version.

review/summary: Do We Really Need Another Energy Drink or Any Energy Drinks at All?
review/text: I have drunk energy drinks in the past, though they were coffee flavored rather than fruit flavored.  They seemed to help wake me up in the morning and give me enough of an energy boost to help me kick off my day.  I usually substituted these drinks for breakfast, so the calories were not an issue.  I was unsure of what this energy drink would do for, or to me.<br /><br />Initially, I was unable to identify the flavor.  I kept sipping to try to figure it out.  The next thing I knew, the drink was gone.  It was about that time that I figured out the flavor was grapefruit.  Before I go on, be aware that there are less expensive ways of getting a grapefruit flavored drink.  For example, you could drink Ocean Spray's grapefruit drinks, which include several varieties.  Crystal Light also makes a grapefruit drink.  Lots of options exist that do not contain the caffeine of this energy supplement.  Of course, where is the fun in that?<br /><br />I drank the whole, 230-calorie can.  Of course, that is supposed to be two servings.  Did I feel more energetic?  Actually, no.  I felt a bit light-headed rather than energetic.  I even felt a little sleepy, perhaps because of all the calories.  All that caffeine also seemed to require a number of trips to the restroom, and my mouth felt dry.  I guess there is more evidence that caffeine is a diuretic.<br /><br />Do we really need yet another energy drink?  I wonder whether some of the "energy" effect is related to the belief that an energy drink will wake you up.  This drink did not seem to give me more energy.  Just the opposite, it made me feel tired.  The flavor was okay, but there are less expensive ways to drink a grapefruit flavored drink.  Maybe an easier way to get energy is to get plenty of rest and to get some exercise.  Something to consider.<br /><br />Good luck!

No. It didn't burst through my energy slump from 7 to 9 PM. Fell asleep watching TV. Again.<br /><br />I went online to find further information about this product. No Fear is a spin off of Sobe. Sobe name is derived from South Beach in Florida. They also make clothes. Skateboarding, surfing and Extreme Sports gear. Wetsuits. Their website focused on models for wetsuits. Couldn't get to the information on No Fear. There are actually websites/blogs that only feature reviews of energy drinks. I didn't look at them, to be perfectly Sinatra. Sobe was bought out by Pepsi in 2000. I am a Coca-Cola person. But whatever. I won't hold that against them. I heard that McDonald's bought out Chipottle. There was some truth to that, but more like both chains were owned by the same parent company.<br /><br />Coca Cola > Pepsi<br />Starbucks > McDonalds<br />Peets > Starbucks<br />Chipottle > Taco Bell<br />In N Out > McDonalds<br /><br />But, you know. Sometimes you're in the mood for a McDouble or a McRib. This is starting to remind me of Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction. Segue to Jim Carey in Yes Man. Because there is a really funny scene involving Red Bull and Zooey Deschanel! Which brings us right back to--<br /><br />The Bottom Line is Green Monster > No Fear!<br /><br />PS: They said it was a pack of 12 cans for review but they only send you one. Cheapskates.

Only after consuming a third of this 16 oz. drink I felt more alert, energetic and a tad jittery. The drink is lightly carbonated, and fruity with a raspberry-like aftertaste. It's similar to Red Bull but the flavor is not as sharp and heavy, which kinda belies the intimidating skull, wings and dark d&eacute;cor of the can. `No Fear' contains 130 calories and if you're calorie conscious you don't need to drink the entire can for its effects to be felt.<br /><br />Like most energy drinks, this ought to be consumed if you're looking for a jolt of energy, not necessarily for the flavor. But it's tasty and it certainly wakes you up!

review/text: The Bad: The taste is a version of 'grape,' that is more like bitter, low-class red wine. Tart in an unpleasant way.<br /><br />It comes in 16-oz cans, with "two servings" per can. Since it's carbonated, you either have to drink the whole can over an extended period, save it and hope it doesn't go flat, share it, or drink it fairly quickly like any normal soda - and get a lot of caffeine and sugar in a pretty short time. Drinks like this should come in smaller cans.<br /><br />The Good: It will perk you right up, which is the point.<br /><br />Doesn't give the jitters like some of these drinks tend to. I drank the full can - two servings - but it didn't make my heart palpitate or anything.<br /><br />I drink several cups of coffee a day, and occasionally drink energy drinks like this as well. Despite my caffeine intake, a caffeinated soda like Diet Coke will still keep me up at night. Notably, this drink did NOT keep me up.

Therefore, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tried a can of NO FEAR SUPER ENERGY SUPPLEMENT. The drink tastes surprisingly good. It's not as sweet as a 5-hour energy drink, but NO FEAR doesn't have a bad taste. It tastes like a soda and reminded me slightly of Mountain Dew.<br /><br />I made sure to try my can of NO FEAR late in the afternoon after I had a long day. I felt tired and didn't have much energy and was thinking of taking a nap. The drink gave me a boost, but unlike 5-hour energy, the kick in my energy level didn't happen immediately. It was a gradual boost over about a 45-minute period. The tiredness didn't wear off until several hours later.<br /><br />I'm still not a fan of energy drinks and will continue to limit my consumption of them. However, in the future if I feel I need a pick-me-up, I'll look for a can of NO FEAR instead of just relying upon 5-hour energy boosters. If you're looking for an immediate boost, you'll want to drink something different, but if you're looking for a more gradual pick-me-up, you might want to try NO FEAR.

review/summary: Nice Scent and Taste, in Intimidatingly Heavy-Duty Packaging
review/text: I'll admit this up front: I'm not an energy drink consumer.  I've never had a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L9XK4">5 Hour Energy</a>, nor a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTST70">Red Bull</a> (even mixed in with something else), nor a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBHVU">Monster</a>, etc.  This was my first-ever energy drink.<br /><br />Don't shake.  This is a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />Given my energy drink virginity and the can's color scheme and artwork, I expected something the color and consistency of an unholy mix of blood and motor oil, smelling of saddle leather and diesel exhaust, and tasting like fire and going down like acid.  I mean, really, black and red, with a scarred, angry skull?  Who exactly is the target demographic, resentful Goths and sociopaths?  Bikers?  Posers who want to look badass?  The product description here says it's the "toughest can on the shelf by far."  What does that mean, that the can is specially structurally reinforced, so that it's, like, hard to open?  Or am I supposed to somehow believe that I'm the toughest by far because I am able to keep it down?  Or does their "tough" mean they've packed this stuff with so much mega-engineered super-energy power that they're toying with the very elements of time and existence?  I'm having a hard time reconciling the product inside with the can and text outside.<br /><br />So, I was very pleased to find it was not what I expected.  Poured from the can, the beverage is light and flows as any water-based liquid, with no gloppy, syrupy viscosity.  The color is a clear reddish, with a tinge of pink, no cola-brown.  The scent is quite nice, distinctly fruity, with more than a hint of berry.<br /><br />And the taste.  Thankfully, it didn't taste like something packed with sugar and caffeine.  It didn't taste like a product that would come out of a black can with a winged skull on it.  The drink's appearance and taste match nicely, with the taste being distinctly fruity/berry, with a pleasant and light dry fruity aftertaste.  I thankfully did not get any of that funky industrial-artificial chemical flavoring taste.<br /><br />I opened the can and tasted it at first at a cool room temperature, and it was passable, not at all nasty like some drinks can get when they warm in the slightest.  It is much, much better over ice.  The carbonation is light, nothing compared to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JXBHQK">Coke</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JX9FDM">Pepsi</a>, and it fits the taste nicely.<br /><br />I ran it past a core consumer target, my 16-year-old daughter.  I did not tell her what it was, and she liked both the scent and taste.  She mentioned she tasted a little bit of peach.  She was surprised that it was an energy drink, and without prompting said it tasted unlike any energy drink she's ever had, better than both Red Bull and Monster.<br /><br />And the "nutrition" stats: 130 calories and 87mg of caffeine, 34g carbs, and with plenty of sodium and potassium, etc.  All this is interesting, until you see that this is for an 8-ounce serving; the can contains two servings, so double everything.  Also interesting is reading on the can: "Not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine," and, "This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease."  I'm not too sure what to make of these statements, but I know for a fact I've never read it on any of my beloved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K9C4ZG">Diet Dr. Pepper</a>.<br /><br />There is 2000mg of taurine, also known by its handy nickname 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, in every can.  That's ten times the amount of anything else in the can, so I have to infer it's supposed to be a good thing.  The Interweb has a lot to say about taurine, essentially that it's naturally occurring and a needed thing for humans.  My quick survey has the usual daily intake at somewhere between 40 and 200, so this can is dropping a good ten times that on you.  I guess the logic is that a little is good so a lot is better, but that usually is not the case when it comes to the fine-tuning of body chemistry.  One source says, "the influence of high taurine doses on [crucial physiological] processes is uncertain."  Another source says, "...a 2003 study by the European Food Safety Authority found no adverse effects for up to 1,000mg of taurine per kilogram of body weight per day."  So, that means at 220 pounds you can slop up 100,000mg/day, 50 count `em 50 cans of this product.  So there you go, definitive ambiguity.<br /><br />As for super energy, I drank my pint of No Fear at about 4:30pm after a morning coaching high school rugby practice, then straight to marching in a St. Patrick's parade, then home to loading/unloading rugby gear, laundering jerseys, storing gear and supplies and parking a full trailer by hand.  After 30 minutes I did feel considerably more energetic, and had a slight headache.  Are the two related?  Maybe, but then again, maybe not.  No convulsions, no heart attack, no trembling hands, slurred speech, or eruptive bleeding from my eyes.<br /><br />Bottom line: After decades of drinking diet soda, this just isn't my kind of drink, and I'm unlikely to purchase it, if anything because of it caloric content.  That being said, I did like its taste, and don't have a problem recommending it to folks who like energy drinks.

review/summary: Can't taste the taurine
review/text: The selling point for this energy drink over others is that it has a "brand new taste." I suppose if one wants something different from the taurine/B complex flavors of the Red Bull and Monster, then it definitely does taste different, and sweeter and fruitier. Others report grape juice flavor; I also think there's some watermelon flavor in there too. It certainly doesn't taste bad, and I don't detect any chemical or other aftertaste. I still do prefer my classic energy drinks, but I have no regrets about trying this one out.<br /><br />The bottom line is, if you need a kick and don't like Red Bull and Monster, and coffee's not your thing either, you might want to give No Fear a try.

review/summary: Much, Much Better Taste
review/text: This is a berry flavored beverage that actually tastes like a berry drink. Most of the energy drinks have a chemically after taste and the flavors are weak and don't mask it well. The new taste that the advertisements are talking about is backed up by reality in this case. I shared it (it is a big can) with some of my friends who drink a lot of energy drinks including Monster and No Fear and they were also surprised by the flavor. Good news: the can shows only 1 carb per serving and lists no sugars. Not sure about that, but it's better than some competitors that have the equivalent of a dozen donuts worth of sugar!<br /><br />A huge down side is that a can of this has about 260 calories, which makes it one of the higher calorie energy drinks out there.<br /><br />Also, the caffeine in this drink is appx 87 mg per serving (2x each can) which is lower than some of the other energy drinks. So if you are going for caffeine for energy this one wont work. Admittedly, they are going for supplement energy from Creatine, Guarana, L-Carnitine and Taurine and you really ought to know what works for you before you start buying cases of this stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a much better flavor which will likely become a favorite for energy drinkers.

review/summary: Unique Flavor That I Surprisingly Liked
review/text: The No Fear energy drink, like almost every energy drink out there, does very little to decribe it's flavor.  I can say that this is somewhat grapefruit flavored, which I wasn't expecting.  The flavor though is smoother than actual grapefruit and gave the drink a nice refreshing taste.  I think most people would be surprised by this flavor & the pink color of the drink after seeing the black can with the skull logo.  The taste is odd at first but by the time I had a few drinks, I was enjoying it.<br /><br />As for the contents, the sugar & sodium levels are as expected.  But, the vitamin & supplement content was a little more diverese than most drinks.  I really felt that I got a good blend of extras - besides just caffeine, sugar, and vitamin B's.  This also contained Vitamin C, Zinc, Selenium, Potassium, Grape Seed extract, L-Carnite, L-Arginie, and more.  It did feel like a super energy drink, as the can promoted.<br /><br />For the same price, other drinks don't take this extra step.  Considering the extras & flavor, I was pleasantly surprised!

review/summary: Good flavor, but not the greatest ingredients
review/text: THE CAN: The can itself says it's a "Super Energy, Supplement". Nothing about which flavor it is or is not. Sounds like they are trying to market to those that are addicted to 5 Hour Energy, Liquid Energy Berry, 2-Ounce (12 Pack) shots and the like.<br /><br />SMELL: Yes, I wanted to know how it smelled before I drank it. It completely smelled like I was about to drink a grapefruit drink. I'm personally okay with that but know others may not be too excited and wonder if it would have a bitter bite to it like grapefruit.<br /><br />TASTE: I was pleasantly surprised! Drinking the other brands there is always this "bite" that makes them sometimes hard to drink. This has the best flavor of them all!! And it did NOT taste like grapefruit, but sort of a fruit punch flavor.<br /><br />COST: Currently at $2.33 per can on Amazon (includes shipping), I guess the prices is average. But for about the same price I could get a grande house coffee with an extra shot of espresso from the overpriced Starbucks. I would still get a boost from Starbucks AND with less ingredients going into my body.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: First three ingredients are: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid.<br />Really? The cheapest and one of the worst product to put in your body is, HFCS.<br />An easy Google search on the health dangers of HFCS will reveal that HFCS is related to health problems as weight gain, dental cavities, poor nutrition, and increased triglyceride levels, which can boost your heart attack risk. No thanks!<br /><br />The print on the can was very difficult to read, so I couldn't really tell you what other ingredients are in this thing. It does have an allergen warning of "Contains Soy".<br /><br />ENERGY BOOST: I'm use to having one(1) cup of coffee a day at that. So when I drank this I was wired within 15 minutes. It definitely had the boost!!<br /><br />OVERALL: Still nothing replaces healthy eating, exercise and a good night's rest for living a high energy life. But since we don't always get that, a supplement such as this drink does come in handy.<br />It taste great and gives a good boost, but at the cost of damaging ingredients.

review/summary: Does the job, but doesn't stand out as better than other energy drinks
review/text: "What's not to like about an energy drink that comes in a black can with a cracked skull with wings and the words "NO FEAR" emblazoned across the top, right? Well...<br /><br />It tastes sort of like carbonated strawberry or grape, a slight pucker-inducing dull fruity taste. Not bad, just not delicious. It's sort of par for the course when it comes to energy drinks. If you like Monster, Amp or Red Bull, this should be just fine. If you drink your coffee black, this will be a huge improvement unless you just love that mud-like taste.<br /><br />As far as energy, this has about the same effect on me as the Monster and Amp line of energy drinks: it gives me a subtle energy boost, and that's a good thing. Red Bull leaves me feeling wired and edgy and I don't want to waste the extra kick by sitting around vibrating, feeling restless and hating how my skin feels like it's crawling. The caffeine in a can of this is on the low end of an average cup of coffee, but it's also loaded up with taurine, l-carnitine and arginine, as well as things like vitamins B and C--things that seem to have some other potential health benefits other than just getting me through an afternoon energy slump (assuming there's enough of those things in there to be useful).<br /><br />Overall, I give this 3 stars. It does the job, doesn't taste unpleasant or leave a nasty after-taste, and falls within the price range I'm accustomed to with other similar energy drinks. It doesn't stand out as being better than other energy drinks I've tried, though, but would have earned an extra star if it tasted a bit better.

review/text: Not sure why I didn't get any real boost from this.  To me, it really isn't anything more than glorified Mountain Dew.  With 33g of sugar per serving (2 servings per can) and 130 calories each, it should at least give you enough energy to offset the calorie and sugar intake it provides.

review/text: I was surprised at the taste of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8">No Fear,Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce Can</a>. It was nice and fruity, and didn't have that chemical almost-citrus taste that most energy drinks seem to have.<br /><br />Because I had evening plans, I drank the No Fear in the early afternoon. The can is two servings, but I did down the whole can.  It wasn't sugar-free, so I thought that the "rush" I'd get would be a sugar high, followed by a crash.  However, I drank the No Fear around 2pm, yawned a small bit through the afternoon, and stayed up a few hours past my usual bedtime. I slept well and had no problem waking up the following morning.<br /><br />I was pretty happy with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8">No Fear</a>, and would get it again - probably even over another brand.

review/summary: Tastes good, not like a vitamin
review/text: This energy drink tastes like fizzy grape juice.  Not fake grape soda, or that other energy drink "b vitamin" flavor, but balanced, grape-juice sweetened soda that goes down very easy.<br /><br />If you want an energy drink, that doesn't taste like one, and are ok with sugary sodas, you should try this.<br /><br />What it is:<br /><br />- Great tasting.  Grape juice-based soda with a nice purple color.  No vitamin flavors that I notice.<br />- Not a diet drink.  Sweetened with plenty of sugar.<br />- Caffeinated. About two strong cups of coffee worth (130 mg I believe) in a can.<br /><br />What it is not:<br /><br />- Not: a huge boost of B Vitamins.  B Vitamins work great, but they don't taste particularly good.  Think red bull flavor.<br />- Not diet.  A whopping 66 g sugar in a can.  This is the same, per serving, as any other sugar-sweetened soda.  Tastes good.  Blood sugar spike.<br /><br />Overall:  A good product if this is what you want.  I personally try to avoid such sugary drinks, but for those that like them, this one tastes great.

review/summary: Mostly High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: No Fear Super Energy is mostly made up of high fructose corn syrup - it's the #2 item on the ingredient list after carbonated water. Each 16oz can contains 66 grams of sugar (and 260 calories)! Yes, there are some other ingredients which may increase your energy, but most of the energy will undoubtedly be due to the HFCS.<br /><br />Each can is said to contain 2 servings, but since it's a carbonated beverage, it's not really going to keep well. The flavor is like carbonated cherry cough medicine.

review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a big "energy drink" person because I don't want to drink a lot of high fructose corn syrup, preferring instead a slimmer waistline.  That being said, I drank "No Fear" for an added pick-up that my usual dose of coffee wasn't providing due to a lack of sleep.  First of all, the drink was fizzy and tasty, with a hint of fruit, so it went down easily, unlike a few other energy drinks I've sampled.  Second, a half can (8 oz.) was about 128 calories, which wasn't objectionable.  Would buy it again if the need arose.

review/text: Well, there's this. No Fear energy drink. It has a taste that's vaguely like fruit punch, which was ok. Not terribly great. But let's face it: you don't want this for the taste. You want the kidney-vibrating energy boost. Well, you might want to look elsewhere because I didn't notice one.<br /><br />Now it's not like I'm some energy drink drinker; far from it. This is the first one I've had in about a year or so. I do drink lots of Diet Coke, but that's about it, and frankly I get the same amount of "boost" from the caffeine in that as I did from this, plus it's a lot cheaper.<br /><br />So can I recommend this? Well, taste-wise it's ok, but I'm sure you can get the taste and the energy boost elsewhere for less money.

review/summary: No Fear Says it All
review/text: Granted, No Fear is better tasting than most of these types of energy drinks.  It's fruity like a popular canned punch and there is enough in this can to split between two adults.<br /><br />However, regular coffeehouse drinkers may be a little disappointed if they don't feel the same rush they get from an espresso shot, though this also contains a significant level of caffeine.  Also, to try to put it mildly: If coffee tends to "run through you," don't be surprised if this has a similar effect.<br /><br />Despite the impressive list of supplements, this is not a health drink, by any means. It cannot overcome the fact that High Fructose Corn Syrup (after carbonated water) is second on its list of ingredients- it's a GMO food additive that dehydrates the body, for starters.<br /><br />At 66 grams of sugar in one can, it's like drinking fruit flavored soda with vitamins added. This may seem effective short-term if you're mostly interested in a tasty energy boost and you prefer this type of method to obtain your sugar intake.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the nutritional supplements cannot counteract the other ingredients, especially if you need increased energy long-term.

review/text: Surprisingly I had never tried No Fear energy drinks but when I got offered this product on the Amazon Vine newsletter I figured id give it a try. I'm so glad I did, I'm also happy to see it offered on Amazon.com. This drink is right up there with some of the best ive ever tasted. Great taste and no mentionable crash aftrrward the calories are reasonable for an energy drink however keep in mind it is 130 calories per serving and this bad boy contains two. It also has 34g of carbs 33g of sugar 1000mg of Taurine 87 Mg of caffeine 25 Mg of L-Carnitine and 10mg of L-Arginine. The price may seem high but its actually about the same as most others. For around $28.00 you get 12 16oz energy drinks it equals about $2.33 a piece so like I said not bad. I recommend this drink for anything from helping you wake up in the morning, to working out or even a mid day pick up but probably not if your trying to loose weight. This drink will for sure help you show No Fear!!!
