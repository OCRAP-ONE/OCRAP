review/summary: good stuff
review/text: first let me say that i have not purchased this from amazon only my local gym it is cheaper on here so i will be buying it from here soon as far as the product my trainer introduced it to me and my friend, since we was trying to lose weight and build lean muscle, i have used it roughly 2 months and love it i drink it every morning and it curbs my appetite i can go till 1:00 or later before i start felling hungry where before i was hungry from the moment i woke till i went to bed, i also drink my shake after my workouts in the evening 3 times a week. as far as the taste if you just mix with water for me it is a little hard to swallow, i blend up frozen blueberry's and strawberry's which i thaw and add 2/3 cup water mix with powder in a shaker pretty good stuff you can also leave berries frozen to make shake thicker and more like a milk shake if you add powder to blender to mix it will be a little foamy that's why i mix it in a shaker if you decide to buy it try different ways till you find the way you like to drink it!

review/summary: Excellent Protein
review/text: This protein has an excellent amino acid complex. I prefer Milk and Egg over why proteins as they are absorb into your body more efficiently. Whey protein is absorbed quickly, and if you are only working out once or twice a day, then a lot of the protein isn't going to get absorbed effectively. Milk and Egg based proteins take longer, so you get a constant flow of protein rather than having your body trying to absorb it a couple times a day. I take about 2 scoops of this protein, 2-4 times a day, and, working out every other day, I've been putting on about 5lbs every other week.

review/summary: NOT CHOLESTEROL FREE
review/text: I bought this because the amazon page says that it is "cholesterol free." It isn't...it actually has more than most (I think around 40% of your daily intake in one serving). Plus it tasts REALLY bad (I've been mixing it with Muscle Milk to cover the taste because I'm too cheap to just throw it away), it's extremely grainy (kinda coats your throat going down making it super gaggy) and sometimes all the protein in it dumps out and coagulates into a nasty ball inside the shake ball in my shaker-cup if I don't drink it fast enough...I've eaten some pretty horrible stuff (mostly on dares) and I can't handle a Universal only protein shake...too nasty. I'm sticking souly to Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition brand protein powders...lower cholesterol (Muscle Milk is only 5% per serving) and MUCH better taste.

review/summary: Good brand, tastes good
review/text: During my first pregnancy, I drank this tea quite often.  There are so many herbs that you "shouldn't" eat or drink while pregnant, it is nice to have a good tasting tea to enjoy, and that actually benefits you during pregnancy.  I think this tea is supposed to be for 2nd & 3rd trimester use.  I've also tried their nursing tea (which is really quite a lot better than the Yogi Nursing Tea, in my opinion), and I've tried their raspberry leaf tea (I'm not a huge fan of the taste, but the raspberry leaf is supposed to do great things for the uterus, so I will drink some later in the pregnancy. Sigh!) I was able to find this particular tea, the Pregnancy Tea, at a local store during my first pregnancy.  During my next pregnancy, I went back to the same store (and a few others) to search for this product, but couldn't find it anywhere!  I was pleased to find it here, at Amazon, for a good price.  Since I would have ended up buying at least six boxes anyways, it was great to be able to buy in bulk & save a buck or two a box in the process. I like it, I drink it, and I'm going to go enjoy a cup right now.

review/summary: Highly endorsed by my midwife
review/text: I just want to start out by addressing a previous review that links this tea to her miscarriage by way of uterine contractions. I'm not sure that the raspberry leaf in the tea is a strong enough amount to really cause a scene, but I do know that contractions are most likely not the cause of a miscarriage. Most miscarriages are caused by a genetic abnormalitywith the baby. If contractions caused miscarriage then there would be a ban on relations with your spouse in the first trimester, as those relations usually result in uterine contractions. As for the tea, my midwife highly recommends it and has been in the field of delivering healthy babies for 20 years. I've been taking this since around 8 weeks pregnant and am now 14 weeks and baby is doing great. It has an enjoyable flavor, though I do add raw honey to it. I like sweet tea. I am not far along enough to know the benefits in later pregnancy but I am looking forward to seeing how the tea affects my pregnancy. I did not drink it with my first.

review/summary: Not OK in first trimester
review/text: When I found out I was pregnant I had to give up my beloved caffeinated tea so I bought this thinking it would be safe in pregnancy.  BUT, my doctor said no red raspberry in the first trimester (ingredient in the tea) as it is a uterine stimulant.  If you are thinking about buying this tea, ask your doctor to see if the herbs are safe for you in your pregnancy.  On the other hand, the taste is good and I will drink it in my 2nd and 3rd trimesters.

review/summary: First Trimesters Watch Out
review/text: I have to give this product one star is that it should have a warning on its package. The tea contains raspberry leaves, which is considered by some not recommended for first trimesters. Here's my story: After stopping drinking tea for pregnancy, I was looking for a caffeine free tea. When I shopped for maternity pants, I saw this in Motherhood. I bought one and tried it that night. I liked it immediately and drank four glasses of two tea bags. That night, I was shocked to see my weight dropped 3 lbs. I didn't know why and continued drinking this tea until I was out of it in two weeks. I started looking for this tea online and came across a website, where a lady said her doctor didn't recommend it for first trimesters because it could cause contraction. Another website said that the raspberry leaves were considered cause contractions and could cause miscarriage among first trimesters. I then found this tea on Amazon and ordered it, deciding to stop drinking it until I entered 2nd trimester. Unfortunately, at my u/s I was the fetus stopped growing at 3 weeks ago. I looked through the journal, it was the week that I started drinking this tea.  The tea tastes light and refreshing, but it should have printed a warning on its package.

review/text: This is an authentic Nonya curry paste from Prima Taste which is a brand that Singaporeans back home prefer over all others.  This particular packaging is the paste only and does not include the coconut mix (that comes in the boxed kit version) which needs to be purchased separately and added for authentic flavour. It's good for those that would like to use their own coconut milk or avoid coconut milk altogether.<br /><br />If you're looking for an authentic Singaporean yellow curry, this is the one, forget the other brands as they are nowhere close.<br /><br />The directions are simple and the dish is easy to prepare.

review/text: I highly recommend these pork tenderloins from Omaha Steaks.  They cook up easily and remain 'melt in your mouth' tender.  Of course I add a lot of spices to them pre-cooking along with some olive oil.  The meat just readily falls apart when you touch it with your fork.  The taste I guess depends on the spices you use.  I mainly use garlic and black pepper but throw in a dash of several others too and the flavor is just remarkable.  I will be buying these again!

review/text: It is a surprising good tea at great price. The best part is its after taste, leaving a very enjoyable clean, fresh and delicate sweetness at the back of your mouth. I could feel the breath improved too.<br /><br />I work in the office and always wanted to eat some candy or cookie in the afternoon. After start drinking this tea (about a month ago), I was surprise to find out that I didn't have the same desire to eat the candy or cookie any more! What a surprise nice finding! I think it is because of its satisfying aftertaste. Each tea bag, I would say, could make two good cups of tea easily.<br /><br />I also highly recommend following FooJoy Shoumei White Tea (B0007UXIW0), FooJoy China Green Tea (B0007V1Q78) in this line.  If you like black tea, you might want to try Foojoy Dim Sum Bo Nay (B0007Y7Z8E). It is very interesting: very dark in color and you will think it would be strong. But not! it turns out to be very mild and smooth -- almost kind of roundness...

review/summary: Strong Chewers Delight
review/text: Good Buddy rawhide chews have been a staple for our strong chewing dogs for ages. Before Castor & Pollux took the reigns we purchased the larger rawhide sticks because they lasted a good 15 minutes or more of tough no-holds-barred chewing; but now we've moved to the rawhide chips because they're more cost affective, and they don't leave rawhide stains on the carpet. The stains came with the company change, and while they clean up with a damp towel, it's a hassle.<br /><br />The rawhides are packed by weight, so chips within a bag range in size. The larger chips last five to ten minutes, while the small chips last about five minutes. Wonderfully, Good Buddy pet chews are made in the USA from grass-feed beef, and natural chicken flavor. Our big dogs absolutely love them, and importantly they've never cased a choking problem.

review/text: I get these for my dog, who is still young and has the urge to chew from time to time. I like the fact that these are made from grass-fed beef and are manufactured at a US facility. Many other rawhide products are produced in Columbia, Mexico, or China, which I'm not comfortable purchasing. When purchased in bulk--the package of 4--the price is pretty decent. It takes my medium-sized dog about 45 minutes to an hour to consume one of these on average, which is just about right for her. I've been happy with these and plan to keep getting these for her.

review/summary: The best I've found
review/text: I am on a highly salt restricted diet (and potassium too.) I have End Stage Renal Failure, or kidney failure, so on dialysis. Also diabetic so my overall diet is extremely restricted. This is the first 'salt' substitute that acctually has a salty taste. Most others use potassium which is a poor substitute, or various herbs and spices to make up for the missing salt. They add flavors to be sure, but still no salt-like kick of flavor enhancement. It's too bad Amazon doesn't also sell the 1 pound package, that has to be obtained from the small manufacturer, which right now is extremely backlogged. Took me 4 months to get my direct order of the 1 pound package, but a great price saving for everyday use. If it is hard giving up salt, try Table Tasty, I think you will like it.

review/summary: FINALLY! A salt substitute that's worth something!
review/text: Tired of all the "salt substitutes" that are just shakers potassium chloride with different labels? Those things don't taste like salt at all; they have a slight "bite" on the tongue like a spoonful of salt does, but that's about it. If you dissolve them in water, they has little or no flavor at all, and what flavor they do have is nothing like sodium chloride.<br /><br />This stuff, on the other hand, is the real deal. It doesn't rely on potassium chloride, nor on only "herbs and spices" as other substitutes like Mrs. Dash or the (in)famous Costo seasoning does/do. Instead, it relies on a combination of herbs, spices, and nutritional/brewer's yeast. And it actually tastes (not just feels on the tongue) "salty" despite having no sodium.<br /><br />With this stuff I can honestly say I have no desire for a salt shaker or to add salt as I cook. This is the real deal. Try it!

review/summary: BEST NO SALT SEASONING I'VE EVER TRIED!
review/text: I have to cut way down on my salt intake and I have tried so many salt substitutes I've lost count. Some were terrible, some just ok. Then I read great reviews on this Benson's Table Tasty.  It is fabulous and does not contain potassium chloride (which I can't use due to some medication I'm currently taking).  Table Tasty is very flavorful. One could swear there is salt in it but, NO, NO, NO!  It is COMPLETELY SALT FREE and also potassium chloride free (potassium chloride has an odd after taste and does not give you that zing you get from salt, so you wined up using a lot more). I've tried this on eggs, popcorn, cooked hamburger, chicken so far and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who is on a low sodium or sodium free diet.

review/text: Ever since I attended nursing school, I have been wary of salt. I'm trying to cut salt from my diet now while I am young so it isn't difficult to make the shift when I get older. This is an AMAZING product, I can't believe it is salt free. I put it on everything! It would not be useful for baking as there are other added savory spices, but to give foods some zest this is some awesome stuff. Everyone I know is getting one in their stocking this year!

review/summary: I'm a believer.
review/text: I really need to cut down on my sodium intake because I have very high blood pressure - I've been a salt fanatic for MANY years (I put salt on almost everything), so I'm a very harsh critic when it comes to salt substitutes. I recently ordered and received a similar no salt substitute "blend" from another website, and it has absolutely *NO* salt taste. I've tried a few others as well that also tasted nothing like salt...so I really didn't have high hopes for table tasty.  I figured I'd order it anyway based on the positive reviews (and it was shipped very fast).<br /><br />I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted this product.  I thought for sure it would only taste like a sodium-free spice blend like all the rest, but it actually has a salty taste when you try it right out of the bottle.  The taste and smell actually reminds me a lot of those flavor packets that come with Ramen noodles, or the "Cup-a-soup" packets in a box, which are both LOADED with sodium!<br /><br />It's hard to believe - I have no idea how they've achieved this since there's NO sodium at all in the product.  All I know is I will now be ordering a large bag!

review/text: My mother is restricted to a low sodium and potassium diet.  This seasoning does has a salty flavor and has added some quality taste to such a bland diet.  Eating eggs and other certain foods without salt is not palatable.  I tried this seasoning and was pleased with the salty flavor.  She really enjoys it and we take it with us when she is in the hospital to season her meals.  We will probably buy the pound bag next time.  Five Stars for this product.

If you want something really good try Himalayan Pink Salt sold through Amazon --- it's outstanding !!!! I purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. Yum , real salt but good for you.

review/summary: Nice coffee from around the world
review/text: Just got this the other day.  Nice sampler, coffee from many different countries, no blends, just beans from the area.  All of them are good, ranging from mild to bold in flavor so there is something for everyone.  The Brazilian is an extra bold, gives you a bit more coffee in the cup.  There was even Peruvian, I didn't know they grew coffee, very nice stuff.  Looks like we are getting some more choices now to the Green Mountain and Tully's blends.  This is good for the consumer, more choices and lower prices from competition.

review/summary: Peruvian
review/text: I purchased the Peruvian coffee and it is only "okay." It has a smooth flavor but it is a bit weak and it definitely doesn't brew a `full-body' cup of coffee.  Also, the plastic cup and lid are a little stronger than all the other k-cups that I've tried and every time I put it in the coffeemaker I have to apply enough pressure that I worry that it might damage it.  So, I will still use the product that I have but I will certainly not be purchasing it again.

review/summary: Unpleasant experience
review/text: This is for Costa Rica blend. I do not like giving bad reviews but I rely on reviews myself , so I feel it important. Amazon sent me an email about their newest kcups and I was excited to try them. After looking at all choices and description, and reviews, although they were hard to find since most were for the variety pack; I chose the Costa Rica blend. I did not want too bold a coffee and this seemed to fit the bill. After trying two brews with different strengths, this coffee just tastes " off" and like an inexpensive coffee. It actually upset my stomach causing acid, with very little consumed. Specifically, though, the taste is weak, like old coffee;  not smooth or full flavor, and the smell which I noticed immediately-had an unpleasant aroma. Not the great coffee smell we all welcome with our morning coffee. Maybe I got a bad batch but the date was ok and these are new, so I think it's the way they are. I cannot recommend.

I signed up to get these every 6 months for the reduced price.<br /><br />I should have been more careful and read the details. These cans of soup are a lot smaller than I am used to seeing in the store. Camp bell's Chunky soup is usually in cans that are larger than an ordinary soup. These cans however are the typical size of a can of soup.<br /><br />On top of the size of the can, I realized that I can get regular size of Campbell's Chunky Soup for cheaper than these cans if I find them on sale.<br /><br />I highly recommend passing on this purchase and spending your money somewhere else.<br /><br />What did I learn with this purchase? ALWAYS read reviews before buying anything on Amazon :)

review/summary: A must for the serious cook
review/text: Glace de Viande Gold in a classic brown stock reduction.  It can be reconstituted into a full flavored stock by using 1 part glace to 20 parts water.  The stock is great for moistening stuffing, making soups or making a jus for dipping.  The flavor is much more complex and professional tasting than other prepared stocks and broths found in most grocery stores.<br /><br />A glace is traditionally made by reducing stock veal stock for 8-12 hours until it has the consistency of a thick syrup.  To bring this product to the consistency of a classic glace add 1 part de Viande Gold to 3 parts water. I use the glace for adding flavor to sauces when I don't want any extra thickening agent.  If I want the flavor of a glace but also want it to help hold a sauce together I use More than Gourmet's Demi-Glace Gold which is pretty much the same thing but it contains a roux.<br /><br />These products last for months in the frig so I purchase these in the 16 oz. tubs.  For some of the glaces and stock reductions that I use less frequently I purchase the 1.5 oz. pucks.  They are made using classic recipes and are the real deal.  I keep 8-10 different varieties on hand in my kitchen and would not want to think about cooking without them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010OQQ2Q">More Than Gourmet Demi-glace Gold� French Demi-glace, 16-Ounce Unit</a>

review/summary: Demi Glace Gold
review/text: I have become a huge fan of Demi Glace and my family loves it as well.  It is expensive, but once you learn to make sauces with it you will win a lot of fans.  I am nothing more than a father that cooks when I get home from work so I have no expertise other than what I have learned over the years feeding kids.  However, once I started using Demi Glace to make sauces with chicken, pork and beef it brought a flavor to meals that I only had when dining out at more expensive places.  I love the Roasted Chicken and the De Viande Gold for just about everything I cook.  My wife loves my sauces just for dipping bread. I seldom ever see a bad review for any Demi Glace product and if there is a bad review I believe the person using it just doesn't take the time to learn how to cook with it.  The internet has many recipes for these products.  I think the easiest of the recipes are sometimes the best tasting.  Also don't worry about shelf life.  Unopened it will last a long time and when kept in the fridge it will last up to 6 months.

review/summary: Glace de Viande Gold =  7 Stars
review/text: What an absolutely great product made with quality ingredients and does exactly what its supposed to do.  Forget 5 Stars this product deserves 7 Stars for exceeding expectations for 16 ounces of liquid gold.  I used to make sauces like this at home and it is a chore usually only fine restaurants take the time and effort to make.  Making this Classic French Brown Sauce from scratch will take you at least 24 hours with many reduction stages and you start with a 20 quart stock pot, 14 lbs of sawed veal and beef bones and 14 hours gently simmering on the stove. Skim and strain and then further reductions.  If you have a fine restaurant then this is required but if you are a home chef/cook then make life easy and reach for the jar.<br /><br />I love this little jar which is a very thick reduction, a concentrate.  I mainly use it as a sauce and will cut it with 3-4 parts of water depending on my use so you can see a little of this can go a long way and is not expensive at all.  It is a great value.  You can use it in many different ways to up the level of you cooking and your dinner guests will be pleased...even the 7 year olds.  I've been told I make the best "gravy" in the world.<br /><br />Here ya go the ingredients say it all:  Veal Stock (Veal Bones, Water), Beef Stock, Mirepoix Stock (Made of Carrot, Celery, and Onion Stocks), Red Wine, Tomato Paste, Gelatin, Salt, Carrot Stock, Celery Stock. Product contains soybeans.<br /><br />No junk, no artifical, no fillers, gum sorbates, msg etc.<br /><br />You will usually only use a few tablespoons at a time but no worries because this will store in your fridge for over a year with zero problems.  About 1.5 ounces of this will yield about a cup of sauce when cut with 3-4 oz of water.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the Veal Demi Glace, Poultry Glace and the Mushroom Essence.  You can put these Glaces to many different uses in your cooking you are only limited by your imagination and experimentation.  Great stuff for the home cook.

It is thinner than the traditional cracker, but it has a nice bite to it, and stays crisp for quite a long time, which surprised me.  I had an open package for several weeks, that I put in a ziplock bag, and the crackers stayed fresh.  They are very reminiscent, in taste, of the traditional crackers, and have that nice distinctive crunch too. Many gluten free products are crumbly, but this one held up pretty well.  I would definitely buy this cracker again. It was a nice surprise, and makes a great snack, or a great quick lunch.  I can't wait to try the onion flavored crackers, since these were so good.  In general I'm not a big fan of this brand, and find a lot of the products quite dreadful, but these crackers redeemed them!

review/summary: A bit fragile, but tasty
review/text: Very tasty and crisp crackers! I'm not on a gluten-free diet, I eat these just because I like them. They tend to break easily when I spread margarine on them, but they don't shatter into a million pieces, they just break a bit here and there. They stay fresh for at least a couple of weeks if kept in a ziploc (they never last me more a couple of weeks!)<br /><br />Ingredients: Corn Starch, Palm Oil, Soy Flour,Sugar,Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose,Soy Lecithin ( Emulsifier),Baking Powder( Sodium Bicarbonate & Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate),Caramelized Sugar, Yeast Extract, Citric Acid.

review/summary: great for diabetics
review/text: This product provides a great taste in a low calorie low carbohydrate drink. Being a diabetic this product allows me to enjoy a sparkling drink that everyone can enjoy. You would never know it was low calorie by the rich taste. I have also ordered the sparkling pear lite. I have previously tasted it and I like it even better.

review/text: I ordered the pear and the apple. The pear to me was ok, had an off taste but the apple is super! I am diabetic and was so happy to see a sparkling beverage that had no added sugar and seemed good quality.<br />At Easter I could join in with everyone in toasting and my glass was as fizzy and sparkling as the next. I felt special! If your diabetic you know how hard it is to find great products like this.<br />Only thing is I wish the company made ALL the flavors with a no added sugar version. I would buy every single one and try it! hint hint

review/summary: Stevia Extract
review/text: I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again.<br />For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar.

review/summary: Excellant product - good price
review/text: Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Bad batch of Stevia
review/text: Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.

review/text: I have been using Now's Stevia Extract for a year now and am totally satisfied.  I like sugar, but not the fat.  Nutra-Sweet and Equal have negative health issues and are expensive.  I use Stevia in my iced tea, on my cerial, and I bake pies with it.  Other than slightly clouding my tea, it tasts wonderfully sweet with no calories.  I like buying it by the pound, and Amazon has the best price.

review/summary: SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND
review/text: EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This "NOW Stevia powder" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% "steviocides" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, "The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This "NOW" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. "Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz." is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. "Swanson" and "Nature's Way" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: my preferred sweetener
review/text: I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.

review/text: I love NOW's stevia extract, I put it in everything - tea, cereal, curries, stir fries, baking.  There are no sugar carbs at all and it is 200 time sweeter than sugar so 1 lb goes a long way.  The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another.

BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />..."It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia.

review/summary: Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia
review/text: I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.

review/summary: you have to use double the dose of this..
review/text: i don't like to knock a product..however<br />i have used stevia for quite a number of years now.<br />my favorite is the 3.5 oz Kal pure stevia exract there are no fillers..<br />unfortunately i have 1 lb of this NOW brand and i noticed right away<br />that it is no way near as potent as the Kal brand....this powder is not as dense as KAL..<br />it is true you will have to double or maybe triple the amount<br />you normally would use in your drink/i have not cooked with this...<br />it does not dissolve as quickly as KAL and does'nt have that nice sweetness i am used to<br />...i will finish it and that will be that.<br />maybe the product needs to be compacted..i'm not sure though...

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I've used stevia powder for years. NOW is an excellent source at a great price. If you are baking, stevia is not very good for that as it will not give the same texture as white sugar. However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.

review/summary: Amazing price as opposed to buying retail...
review/text: I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks. Which leaves me little choice other than water. So, I make a half-gallon of Kool-Aid with a teaspoon of Stevia EXTRACT and a teaspoon of liquid saccharin. Some complain this is too sweet for their tastes. But, do the math, a pound of sugar is LOT more expensive and takes at least a full cup per half gallon.<br /><br />In the past, I've had to purchase Stevia at the health food stores for $12-$15 an OUNCE. Here I bought a POUND (16 ounces) for less that the cost of four ounces from the health food stores. Fantastic price!<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, a POUND of Stevia is a LOT of Stevia (At least a year's worth...;-}  )<br /><br />In a year, I'll buy another jug of it.

review/summary: Best of all
review/text: I tried several different brands of stevia over the yrs. IMO This is the best tasting. One or 2 mini scoops is all you need. There is NO bitterness with this brand. I have been using it for over a yr, and even substitute it in my cooking, where it calls for 1/4, 1/2 or cup of splenda I use this instead BUT not equal portions I use the mini scoop, 1,2,3 scoopfuls is all thats needed.

review/summary: Stevia
review/text: Excellent product and received in record time...thanks and good job!  Taste is perfect and consistency the same.  The only thing I question is so much plastic is wasted because the container is less than half full each time I've ever received this product.  A container half the size or a slightly larger should be considered, to stop the waste of excess plastic that may end up in landfills if not recycled.  I wrote to the company three years ago and asked if they would consider package modification, but never was acknowledged.

review/summary: Teeny tiny spoon!
review/text: I've been trying a number of different kinds of stevia, both liquid and powder. This one is my favorite. It has a very neutral taste and one tiny spoon of it is perfect in a big glass of oolong hibiscus iced tea. A heaping tiny spoon of it is perfect in a chocolate/banana/soy milk smoothie. I originally got it to put in something called "mega muffins" but managed to use up an entire 1 oz container of it without even making the muffins and have had to order more. I really like that it's organic. I've been trying different sweeteners in my hibiscus oolong iced tea, and this is not only better than any other stevia product I've found, but works better than any other sweetener as well. Even regular granulated sugar. It dissolves pretty much instantly. I'm thinking about ordering the 1 lb size (although that would probably last me about two years) I just wonder if that size comes with the teeny tiny spoon!

review/summary: NOW stevia extract
review/text: As a healthier alternative to other sweeteners I have tried, stevia extract fulfilled the billing it had received.  I had been led to this brand (NOW) because it reportedly had less bitter aftertaste than other brands and I found that to be true although there is still a slight undesirable aftertaste.  Stevia provides sweetness but a different tasting sweetness that takes some time to get used to.

review/summary: This Stevia Powder doesn't desolve well in cold liquids.
review/text: The pure product while being much more stronger than sugar, is "cut" down in strength to that of sugar packet strength.  The result does not desolve well in cold liquids.  The has a more pronounced and unique flaver than sugar which enhances the taste to whatever you put it in.<br />The NuNaturals stevia packets sold in Vitamin Stores desolves better but is 3 times more expensive.
