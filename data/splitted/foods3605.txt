review/summary: Not a good idea
review/text: I like so much these biscuits. They're so great but there was a little space of time (I think) where heat caused cookies were pasted each other. Is not a good idea to ask for chocolate or something like that.

review/summary: disappointment
review/text: They shipped on time, but in the last minute. The product is an entire disappointment! The chocolate on the biscuits melted and solidified again. Consequently, the biscuits were stuck together! You could simply ate several pieces at one time, since you could not separate them without crushing them!

review/summary: crisp but a little too sweet
review/text: The flavor is good but this cookie is much too sweet for my taste.  It's  surprising for a French product since I find their pastries to be less  cloying or sugary than American desserts.  The best I can say of these is that they're crunchy...if that's what you're looking for.

NEWS!<br />I called Amazon and they said they will wait three days then make a refund if the seller doesn't make good on this order.<br /><br />I am sure if they don't make good they will not be selling anything at Amazon and from the looks of the setup i'd be willing to make a wager that they are long gone!<br /><br />I love the cookies!

review/summary: Snails 'n' Schrooms
review/text: When I was in catering one of the most extravagant appetizers we served, at all of the best parties were crimini mushrooms stuffed with escargots, parsley, garlic, serrano ham, butter and bread crumbs made from sour dough bread.<br />Now, with these Burgundy escargots available tinned and cooked,this recipe tastes even better. I served them recently at Easter with a huge bottle of Schramsburg Rose' Champagne and my family flipped: in food goodness ecstasy, that is.<br />I've also used this product in empanadas with red onions, garlic and manchego cheese.<br />Yes, I know they are snails but these are the Rolls Royce of snails: not your garden variety type...as it were.

review/summary: A Great Vanilla!
review/text: For several years I could never understand why I could not get my mother's and grandmothers's old recipes to come out tasting the same way I remembered them to taste while growing up.  I said something to my mom one day and she asked what type of vanilla I was using and smiled when I told her it was just the basic stuff you get at the grocery store.  She told me to get some Watkins original vanilla extract and see if that helps.  Well, that was all it took!  I couldn't believe the difference and will never use any other vanilla again.

review/summary: Caused a pancake problem!!!!
review/text: I read the reviews of this product..so I decided to buy it. I am so glad I did. It is actually a plastic bottle, which is great because I dropped it soon after opening the box. The smell is so strong, it makes the other bottle of vanilla smell funny..like a vanilla want to be. I threw the other bottle away, even though it was almost full. I didn't write this review until it was used. My mom(who lives with me)made her pancakes. She usually has some left over..not that day. They were the most flavorful pancakes I have ever tasted. You can really taste the difference. I usually sneak my dog Porky a piece or two under the table. Not that day...he is still mad at me. My mom had to make another batch because everyone ate more than usual. If you buy this product, make sure you make enough...it really is that good!!!

review/summary: Watkins vanilla
review/text: If you never tried Watkins vanilla before, I suggest you do.  Take a bottle of Watkins vanilla and a bottle of other vanilla bought in the grocery store.  Smell the Watkins, then smell the other brand.  The other brand ends up smelling like medicine compared to the wonderful vanilla fragrance of Watkins.  I think it makes your baked products taste better.

review/summary: Our favorite vanilla
review/text: When I ran out of this last time, I tried to substitute it in my baking, and we could really tell the difference - in a bad way! This vanilla extract imparts a truly deep, rich vanilla flavor that's distinct and lends to true home-baked goodness. Like many home bakers, we use a group of trusted family recipes, and I've specified "Watkin's Double Strength Vanilla" in the recipes so that when someone tries to make it, and it doesn't taste quite right, I can determine that it was probably that substitution!

However, as I was surfing Amazon's grocery items, I came across Watkins vanilla and immediately ordered a bottle.  It was safely packaged and I used it that afternoon in a chocolate pie.  Yes, I was very pleased with the flavor and aroma and plan to keep it on hand from now on.

review/summary: Less expensive here than at Walmart
review/text: I used this for years when I was a cake decorator, and now my 2 daughters also believe this is the only vanilla they will use, especially for holiday baking.  However, if you are older, you will almost need a magnifying glass to tell how many ounces are contained in this bottle.  Unless I missed something, I don't see the number of ounces mentioned in the description area.  It can also be purchased at Walmart, but I believe ordering from Amazon costs slightly less, even with shipping.  Our Walmart carries it only in a 2 oz. bottle for $3.78.  There is also a caramel flavor, which is yummy in our baked oatmeal recipe.

review/summary: Not an EXTRACT - it's artificial vanilla FLAVORING
review/text: Do not buy this product if you want vanilla extract, which is legally defined by the FDA as being derived from a tincture containing at least 13.35 ounces of relatively-dry vanilla beans per gallon of 70-proof alcohol.  Vanilla may be the only food flavoring that the FDA has developed standards for - which is understandable given that this orchid-derived spice may be the most popular flavor worldwide.  The popularity and use of vanilla extract in cooking and other products undoubtedly resulted in the need to standardize its formulation.<br /><br />Not sure why Amazon continues to advertise this flavoring as an EXTRACT given that the bottle's label fails to identify it as such.  Unfortunately I couldn't read the label shown on the low resolution image of this item on Amazon's website, but after I received shipment of this item I noticed the top of the bottle's front label actually reads "Watkins Original Vanilla Double Strength - Artificially Flavored" - and thus it clearly does not identify this product as being an EXTRACT (merely mentioning in the fine print at bottom of front label that it contains vanilla extract).<br /><br />Furthermore, the bottle's back label lists its ingredients - and their order of preponderance shows this flavoring contains more water, sugar and "propylene glycol" (a component of anti-freeze!) than vanilla extract!!!<br /><br />Sure would be great if Amazon would correct this item's product description by removing the word "Extract" from both its banner and "product features" section.  Even better, it should note that the product is "artificially flavored" and also list its ingredients in the order of their predominance (i.e., Water, glucose, propylene glycol, vanilla extract (alcohol, water, extractive of vanilla beans), alcohol (8.25%), artificial flavors, caramel color. Contains Sulfites.).<br /><br />Hopefully, no one else will fall prey to this item's false advertisement.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: This is a very good product for any price. People knock it a bit because of the corn but I've spoken to Eagle Pack and have found they are very open about their product. Carbohydrates are carbohydrates are carbohydrates. No cat needs them. Ever! Apparently the grains used in this product are local to Indiana and surrounding areas (Michigan, Illinois, Ohio)? That's never a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. I've also read the company is non-GMO but I haven't confirmed that information through e-mail. The point is that unless your pet is allergic to corn or rice you're wasting your time going grain free. Potatoes and peas are just as useless as corn or rice and cats would never eat any of these in the wild. So if you want a food that is locally sourced (for the most part) and don't want to pay twice as much for Orijen simply because they use peas and potatoes this is a great option.

I made a 6-cup pot of coffee and used an entire pack of Boyer's and still added 1 scoop of my store-bought dark roast coffee to get a robust coffee taste.  The first pot I made was weak as tea, but the added flavors (Vanilla Nut, French Vanilla, etc) were excellent.  If they would darken the roast I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Tastes like what I imagine food in hell would taste like!
review/text: I work out every day and I've choked down the newest protein powders that tastes like chalk.<br />I eat tomatoes chopped up on food even though I hate them.<br />So after the first bite and that sudden WTF realization that this tasted nothing like apples or cinnamon I figured I would just trod through it.<br />My gag reflex had other plans! (I just burped and almost threw up again!)<br />I'd like to find what ever taste tester at Cytosport OK'd this flavor and punch him or her in the crotch!<br />I tried to give it to my dogs (they are the left over cleaner uppers) and they looked at me like I was holding a club in my hand!<br />They lick their own butts (one of the dogs used to eat from the cats' litter box) and they wouldn't come near it!<br />They must be smarter than me because I figured that I'd try a second container with whole milk instead of water.<br />So much for bigger brain=smarter.<br />I am going to try to feed the last four containers (uncooked) to the squirrels outside and see if they will eat it.<br /><br />Have you heard the saying "anticipation of death is worse than death itself"?<br />Well I have six containers of their maple/brown sugar as well.<br />And I am not too manly to admit that I am scared, yes SCARED, to try one!<br />(Burped again, choking back bile!)<br />I just ate a piece of bread slathered in mustard to block the taste.<br /><br />So in summary, AVOID THIS STUFF LIKE RAT POISON!<br /><br />I may yet call the poison control hotline.<br /><br />If you don't see a review of the maple/brown sugar flavor in the next week, call 911 for me!

review/summary: Too Sweet, does not mix
review/text: I love Muscle milk and the idea of it with Oatmeal sounded right on track.  The stuff does not mix and is too sweet.  Real oatmeal with Muscle milk over it would be great, this stuff is awful, and it's 300 calories.<br /><br />If I wasn't so lazy, I'd return them.  I'll mix it with a shake to gag them down.

review/summary: Use milk instead of water -  tastes better
review/text: I have low blood sugar, so I am always excited about trying a new product that is high in protein to keep my blood sugar levels stable.  I have been using Muscle Milk shakes for several years and have enjoyed good results, so I was very excited about trying Muscle Milk oatmeal.  I was soooooo disappointed by the awful taste.  Didn't want to waste the 6-pack, so I gave some to my Mother.  She said she loved the taste, but she used hot milk instead of hot water to mix.  Then I tried heating milk for 60 seconds in the microwave and then pouring it into the cup.  Wow!  What a difference.  The taste is so much better that I plan to add this product to my list of food staples.  Before I purchased, I read a few reviews that gave poor ratings due to the taste.  Try it with hot milk, and you might like it. Since I have low blood sugar, I need to eat a lot of protein which can increase cholesterol; this product only has 5mg of cholesterol per serving, so it is a great way to increase protein.  Also, I found the one cup serving to be a little too much.  So, I just eat 1/2 at breakfast and put the container in a gladware container and reheat the next day.

review/summary: Less than wonderful
review/text: I am a fan of the Muscle Milk Milk and Oats oatmeals by Cytosport.  The product comes in several flavors of which Banana Walnut is one.  The banana flavor was detectable but the walnut was understated.<br /><br />My preferred flavor is blueberries and cream.<br /><br />Milk and Oats is in my opinion a healthy product which delivers a good amount of protein and vitamins.  It provides a healthy start to any day.<br /><br />One caution with this product.  It took me several times making the oatmeal to make it turn out right.  It takes a little more effort than add water, stir and nuke.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: I love this stuff.  Normally I would eat egg whites and oatmeal, like my personal trainer wants me too, but I have a young kid (7) that I have to get ready for school each day, and I never seem to have time for cooking in the mornings.  My personal trainer actually put me on to Muscle Milk N' Oats when I decided to to a 2 week road trip and I knew I would have very limited chances to cook.  Since then I have been using them every time I need a good breakfast in a hurry (when I don't have time to make egg whites and oatmeal).  This stuff tastes great, and you can make it in about 2 minutes or less.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I love the Maple and Brown sugar flavor.  I tried the Vanilla flavor and I didn't like it.  I haven't tried the other flavors.  I have been eating the Maple and Brown sugar flavor almost every day for about 5 months and I haven't got tired of it.

review/summary: By far, one of the worst breakfast foods ever...
review/text: I've tried Maple Brown Sugar and Banana flavored Muscle Milk and Oats and they are absolutely terrible.  I am a big fan of Muscle Milk, but this is an awful way to consume it.  It's simply a scoop or so of the Muscle Milk powder with some wimpy, fine oatmeal flakes.  Add a little bit of hot water and you've got a super pasty extra strong, hot, pungent soup of protein powder and oatmeal.  I couldn't eat the six-pack obviously, so I gave to some friends to try... every verdict from everyone was that it was terrible.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could.

review/text: The OJ is barely noticeable, but who cares? The kids love it. The mango tastes as if (color me surprised) it was actually ripe when processed. Bag size is good for 1 serving for an older child, a bit much for a young child. At roughly $1/bag, these won't make an everyday appearance in the lunchboxes, but will be a nice option when fresh things aren't available.

But when I only received the raisins I thought, WOW I could of got the SunMaide Chocolate Raisins in a Big Container for just alittle more money, for a lot more raisins.. They should show this product individually, instead of the group of 3, because I thought I was getting all 3 items.. So for $8.00 it wasnt worth it, just to have 1 item for that expensive cost, that I could eat all in one sitting.<br />Even tho it was Ghirdelli's name on the product, it tasted no different than the normal chocolate on a raisinette!!

review/summary: Makes AMAZING lasagna
review/text: I first saw this in the grocery store about a year ago and although its price was a bit more steep than traditional lasagna noodles, I decided to give it a try. Am SO I glad I did! These noodles are paper-thin and although they do not give the impression of covering the pan, do NOT be fooled. They DO expand to perfection while baking! For one who texture is a big deal, this old-world lasagna is a culinary delight because it allows you to actually enjoy the flavor of the marinara and cheese with just a hint of pasta, similar perhaps to a cross between angel-hair pasta and thin-crust pizza. The top layer becomes slightly-so crunchy when baking so it makes the cheese on top super scrumptious.<br /><br />There is a fabulous recipe ON the box but it uses their brand-label pasta sauce. I personally used Bertolli's Red Wine marinara blends because I think it is a much richer and flavorful taste with the ricotta and meshes beautifully with the noodles. I punched it up with some baby spinach and baby bellas in the layers and only used half a lb of ground turkey meat (for those who prefer more veggies) I made one pan for our family and the other pan for a new mother from my church. Her small family of 3 LOVED it and gobbled it up in a day!! I won't go back to traditional noodles after tasting this. VERY IMPRESSED!!!!<br /><br />So here's the rundown:<br /><br />5 Stars: skipping the burdensome task of boiling noodles beforehand<br />5 Stars: excellent taste, texture and quality<br />5 Stars: recipe on the box was obviously tested beforehand (a rare commodity these days!!) and works wonderfully with their product

review/summary: WHAT A FABULOUS ITEM
review/text: Not great tasting if you fix your lasagna using these noodles and plan to eat it within a 60 minute baking time.  However, if you fix your lasagna in the morning it is fabulous after baking that evening for dinner.  Or even better, refrigerate and bake it off the next day.  These noodles save tons of time and taste just as good as the ones you have to pre-boil.  But they only taste just as good if you do not eat them right away.  Then they taste a bit like cardboard.  They do need to absorb some of the sauce and cheese, etc.  You will not be sorry you bought these.  They sure save time.  And, I love being able to buy them at Amazon.com.

review/summary: Why can't I give 0 stars???
review/text: I have an amazing recipe for Chicken Alfredo Lasagna that originally called for these noodles.  Being a skeptic, I always used the traditional ones.  This lasagna has always turned out flawless. Well, today, Christmas Eve, I was very short on time and decided to give these a try.  What an idiot mistake on my part (first, to do on a holiday, and second, to think that there is ever a valid short-cut to give you the same results as the long route).<br /><br />I baked according to directions and was utterly disgusted to see the results.  The noodles were thin, gummy, and almost non-existent in the dish.  Sure, they "stretched" to the edges of the pan as they claimed, but who cares?  It's garbage!  I'm pretty confident in my abilities in the kitchen, and I don't think the mistake was on me.  Now that I think about it, I believe I tried these several years ago and had horrible results...which is why I didn't use them in this recipe in the first place.  Too bad I didn't think of that earlier when I was only concentrating on saving time.<br /><br />So, now we'll be having spaghetti and meat sauce (thank goodness I've always got a back-up).  But, alas, I wasted about $40 in ingredients and 3 hours that I'll never get back.  Thanks for nothing, Barilla.  I'm done with your products.

review/summary: One of the better soup bases
review/text: This Pho soup base is good if you don't have time to make soup from scratch. Very few restaurants actually make Pho soup from scratch. Most don't want you to know that they actually use one of the Korean or Japanese made beef dashida or Hondashi powder soup stocks and add a few ingredients such as star anise, clove, peppercorns and lemongrass. Pho is a good profit making dish. (Consider the fact that a pound of rice stick noodles cost less than a dollar.)The key to good Pho is having very fresh Thai Basil, Cilantro and Mung Bean Sprouts. If your going to add some sriracha, hoisin, chili sauce and lime to your Pho, you'll never know that this product wasn't made from scratch. Extra meatballs please.<br /><br />This Asian Food Grocer/Wholesaler thinks that Por Kwan brand soup bases are some of the better products on the shelf.

If what you're looking for is a way to make pho at home, my suggestion is to either take the time to make the broth from scratch, or abandon the idea and go to a restaurant. This is absolutely not worth your time or money.

review/summary: melts in your mouth.....
review/text: These are great, tasty snacks for babies who are starting to eat finger foods.  They are a bit crunchy, but quickly melt so they don't pose a choking risk.  I buy them all of the time for my grandson, but I love them myself.  Eighty of these poofs have 25 calories, you can't beat that when you want to munch!  They are fat free and contain a fair amount of vitamins.  Nothing not to like, try them even if you don't have any little ones!

review/text: I usually order vanilla beans to make my own vanilla extract for myself and others. I thought I'd try this paste and I'm glad I did. First of all, I can use it right away instead of having to wait 3 weeks for the extract to mature. Second, I like the fact that although I don't have to mess around with the beans when making ice cream, I still get the black specks in anything I make.<br />The flavor is good.

review/summary: Really energizes, tastes great
review/text: I'm a green tea fanatic, and have tried over 150 bagged/loose leaf varieties. I have a crazy job, and used to rely on coffee for the energy boost while sleep deprived. Coffee works, but at the cost of digestive issues, acidity and a dehydrated "run-down", stressed out feeling. Enter green tea, which energizes and rejuvenates in a completely different way form coffee. Green tea's antioxidants, small amounts of caffeine and theanines promote a feeling of relaxation as well as stamina, and you can drink several cups without  feeling stressed out and jittery (ie the over-caffeinated syndrome from coffee).  While bagged tea will never equate the taste and freshness standard of looseleaf, if you are looking for a convenient tea offering a true energy boost to take at work, this tea is fantastic. The triphala extract (an Ayurvedic herb blend known for promoting regularity, energy and well-being) really does seem to rev up your metabolism and digestion while sustaining a level of peaceful energy. I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of this tea - it's got a faint blueberry 'zing' to it and doesn't taste medicinal at all. In fact, I subscribed to have this item delivered to me regularly as I went through so many boxes quickly. It's a great price and the little peaceful sayings on each green tea bag help remind you to stay centered and happy with each sip!

review/summary: Energy and Slimming
review/text: I have been a tea drinker for years and have always felt I was buying good tea when I bought the Celestial in the grocery story. Once I tried Yogi tea, I was hooked. I started it while going on a Juice Fast and needed energy and something to hold me from one meal to the next.<br /><br />This tea is perfect. It is great to take to work for breaks and just at home in the morning to get me up and moving. I have totally stopped drinking coffee and use my coffee maker to heat up water in the morning for my tea.<br /><br />I love the flavor (not fond of minty flavors) and it really seems to help me last from meal to meal. I no longer need a caffeine fix in the morning and my day often starts at 4 a.m. for work. I need all the energy I can get to get through a day at work.<br /><br />I have also lost weight which has been a battle after age 60. The tea with other sensible weight lose plans really has worked. This will always be my favorite, while also trying the other teas.

review/text: Love the taste of the tea.  However, I strongly urge people with high blood pressure not to use this product without talking to their physician first.  After drinking the tea on and off for two weeks, I discovered that my blood pressure was increasing.  A review of my habits indicated that the only new introduction into my routine eating and drinking habits was the Slim Life tea.  It appears that the Eleutro root can interfere with your medication to the point that it renders your HBP medication ineffective.  Needless to say, I immediately discontinued using the product and as a result, my pressure went back down.<br /><br />Yogi teas are great but it appears that this one is not for us (consumers with HBP).

review/summary: Good tea
review/text: Main reason for buying: weight loss<br /><br />Compelling force: Other reviews and product description influenced my decision to buy. I'd previously tried the lipton original green tea which was terribly bitter, so definitely needed an alternative option.<br /><br />Taste: light blueberry smell and flavour. Not bitter due to the blueberry. However, after trying it without any additives, I decided to add pure honey and low fat milk (1%) and these made it taste a lot better. Drinking it as it was prior to the additives was like drinking hot water with sprinkles of light blueberry.<br /><br />Effect: Tends to fill me up and does not make me feel hungry for hours. Be mindful of the caffeine as well as it may keep you up if taken too late at night. My belly feels less bloated as my metabolic rate increases with the tea. Remember to exercise as well for better results. I suppose that's just common sense if you're attempting to lose weight.<br /><br />Verdict: It does work and I tend to jump around a lot due to the caffeine. I have actually become more impulsive (in a nice way) and energetic. Went on a 10-mile bike ride last weekend and was never hungry or thirsty.<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, I would recommend it to a friend. However, you need to make some time for it. I drink an average of 3 cups daily. Go figure !!! Good luck

But the more I drank it the more I liked it. It has a strong, slightly sweet, but very nice taste. No cream or sugar necessary.<br /><br />I don't know about the weight loss or appetite suppressant claims. I do find it helps me eat less, but the same is true of most liquids. In any case, I drink 3 or 4 cups of this a day (package says one cup is about 1/3 the caffeine in coffee) and it does help me reduce eating.

Stevia creates a very bitter taste in my mouth.  So I will be sharing this shipment with my friends who don't mind stevia.  I'm going to look at other Yogi teas and check on the ingredients closely.

review/text: Today is Sunday, December 26, 2010. This is my second reviews on this product. I could not create 2 reviews on the same product so I had to delete and edited the old one. On the previous review, I had given 3 out of 5 stars because it didn't help suppress my appetites. Anyways, I continued to drink the tea for over a month now. I got to say it does work. It did not make me feel jittery at all. I was 140 lbs on November 1, 2010 and now I weight 128 lbs. My weight goal is 120 lbs so I will keep drinking the tea until I reach my goal. Please understand that there is no magic in this tea. I was able to lose the weight is because I work out 3 to 4 days a week in the gym (cardio) and I also watch what I eat. By drinking this tea will help control my appetites and I don't feel that hungry. Oh I also don't eat anything after 6pm. If I get too hungry, I will eat a mini carrots are 1 orange.<br />I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don't think it work compare to the first month when I first started to drink this tea. It does work but I just don't think It work like the first month. I was able to lose 10 lbs  in 1 month but now I'm on the second month. I was able to lose only 1 to 2 lbs at the most. My diet plans and exercisers were the same in November but I was only able to lose 1 to 2 lbs during the month of Dec. I am not sure why I was not able to lose more than 2 lbs after I lose the 10lbs. I will place another order soon...<br /><br />I hope my review will help some of you that are searching for a tea that you can enjoy drinking and at the same time it will also help to suppress the appetites. Thank you for reading....

review/text: I LOVE TEA. Ever since I've been trying to cut coffee out of my diet completely (cause of teeth coloring), I started to drink at least 3-4 cups in the morning to rehydrate and get my caffeine kick, and 3-4 more cups throughout the rest of the day. That being said, I never previously found a tea mixture that I could drink for more than 3 days in a row at a time.<br /><br />I've been on a life long hunt for a tea that's a little fruity without extra calories, actually tastes a little fruity, smells/tastes delicious, and gives me a slight caffeine kick.<br /><br />Now, before I go onto my rave about my love for this tea, this tea is not for everyone. If you're not really into the blueberry tasting thing, this is definitely not for you. My office smells like fruity blueberriness when I make this tea (luckily my coworkers don't mind it and enjoy it).<br /><br />I previously tried other fruity teas but found they 1) didn't taste like the fruit even in the slightest bit, 2) only had an amazing scent but no amazing taste, or 3) had some taste of the fruit but left an awful bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />In. comes. Yogi's Green Tea Blueberry Slim Tea. I have to be honest. I did not buy this for the slimming effects. I bought it for the promise of the blueberry taste. This is the only tea that fits exactly what I was looking for. I bought this 6 pack thing and zoomed through it within 2.5 months flat. Yikes. And this was with me doing my best to not use more than 3 tea bags a day (several times I broke and went through 5 a day :[[[ ). I loved it that much. Still love it. I've been trying other teas that promise the blueberry taste, but I find others are not as smooth as Yogi's.

review/summary: Great Tasting Tea with an Energy Boost
review/text: I'm not a tea connoisseur, but I know good taste when I taste it.  This is some good tasting tea, let me tell you.  I've tried the original Green Kombucha and it is good also, but this one is my favorite.  I have also tried a few other flavors and many brands but this one still has the rest beat.  No need to add anything but hot water and you're good to go.<br />Also this gives a little energy boost, for me anyway, that I can feel and almost as much as an equivalent sized cup of coffee.  The only warning I would give about this product is beware drinking a whole cup of this then some water, because you WILL have to pee soon and often.  Meetings and classes are hell after this so be warned.<br />I also highly recommend you buy this from Amazon since it comes simply packaged and at a great price.  Thanks again Amazon for the great discovery!

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: Green tea is your best weight-lose friend. Several years ago, I gained 15 pounds with no change to my diet except for an introduced intake of diet coke, about one per day. I stopped the diet coke and took up green tea. Although I started seeing marginal weight changes pretty soon, the great long-term benefit of green tea is that now I can pretty much eat anything, and I never have to worry about my weight as long as I drink a few cups of this tea everyday (not once in a while or twice a week. And "eat anything" is within reason - i.e. no eating 8 donuts in a row everyday.) I highly encourage making green tea drinking part of your morning, mid-day and afternoon routine. Swap it for coffee and even water. Drink decaf if you prefer to remove the caffeine effect. Do it for 30 days to get in a routine. I'm usually on the receiving end of "how do you eat the way you do?" I'm quoting this only to show that you will be a size with which you are comfortable without dedicating yourself to a life of steamed chicken breast and spinach or abysmally small serving sizes "I'll just have a bite of the creme brule. No really, I can't have anymore - I already had fries for lunch." This tea also regulates your hunger, so you're not craving snacks all day. The blueberry slim life tea has always been my favorite, and the boxes I got from Amazon were exactly what I expected. Plus, they were a great discount from the retailers that carry the tea - usually it's like $4.99 a box, and I got the set of 6 for less than $3. If you're a tea drinker, this is a great deal. I was a little afraid the boxes may be squished or mistaken, but they were intact. I'll definitely buy this again through Amazon.

review/summary: LOVE IT!
review/text: I am a big tea drinker and this is by far the best green tea!  The taste is pleasant and fruity and it doesnt taste bitter like other green teas...it is great with honey but not needed at all...  I think it helps keep me going throughout the day...i am a stay at home mom and need a extra boost in the afternoon!  Works perfectly and doesnt make me jittery at all!  Highly recommend it if you want to try out green tea but unsure of getting straight up green...due to the bitterness...this is a nice mix of flavors!

review/summary: Great tasting tea!  Berry flavor and appetitle control.
review/text: I got this tea imagining it might not taste that good since it is for appetite control, but boy was I wrong!  The tea tastes great. There is some stevia in it so it is a little sweet without sugar.  It has a few berry flavors that really mix well.  It is now one of my favorite Yogi teas.

review/text: i love yogi tea! the writings on the paper tab attached to the string of the bag have wise, centering sayings and since i teach mindfulness to my clients, providing yogi tea for them reinforces their learning:-) this tea is subtle and easy to drink and helps shed toxins from the bloodstream.

review/text: i will definitely have to say this tea works if you want to suppress your appetite. I had this tea in the morning with my breakfast. I noticed that it doesn't seem to mix well with eating. It makes me feel wayy full after eating a normal breakfast. The tea takes about an hour to actually take any effects on me, but it gives me a lot of energy and no appetite! So, i would say eat a smaller meal with this tea, otherwise it will make you sick. Overall, it is a good tea and does what it says!

review/summary: Great Tasting Tea
review/text: I got some free samples from the gym and liked it so much that I ordered it from Amazon.  I love the blueberry taste and smell.  Haven't really noticed any burst of energy of appetite suppressant but it is a natural diuretic (beware).  I still think it's a great tea and drink it to distract me from snacking.
