review/summary: Try a sample first
review/text: Just like other reviewers, my cat also went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food. I DID gradually switch foods and yet when only the Wellness food was left, he would refuse to eat it. He lost over a lb over this whole ordeal. The only way I could get him to eat was to sprinkle some other cat food on top. (Someone randomly gave me some since he knew I had a cat.) What ended up happening for the past month was that the cat would pick around the Wellness pellets and eat everything else. I finally had enough and bought the food he's been eating for the past year (also grain-free, also expensive). He acted like it was Christmas and gobbled down the whole bowl, just like old times.<br /><br />My cat is NOT a finicky eater by the way. He is a stray that we found last year. Up until this purchase, he has eaten everything we set in front of him. Maybe your cat will love this food. Maybe not. Try a sample first because I'm pretty mad about wasting $30.

review/summary: 7 Cats would rather Starve
review/text: Two households and 7 cats later, I still have an almost full bag of this stuff.  I put it out because I ran out of their regular food, and couldn't make it to the store right away.  My 4 cats, despite not having eaten in almost a whole day, won't go near this stuff.  It just sits in their bowl.  When I first brought it into the house, they tried it, but haven't eaten it since.  I would not recommend it, despite the good ingredients

review/summary: Great nutrition, but my cat won't eat it.
review/text: I really wanted my cat to like this food (especially considering how expensive it is), but she just doesn't want to eat it. I introduced the food to her by mixing it in with her old "junk food" dry kibble, as recommended. She simply eats around the Wellness kibble, and I find little bits of it slightly chewed up/spit out by her bowl. I've been testing to see what happens if I don't feed her again until she clears her little bowl of food, but she just mopes around howling (something she normally doesn't do) and starves herself instead of eating the Wellness kibble. What a waste. :(

review/text: Well each cat is different, and ours didn't care for this food one bit. The price for the small bag is a bit steep (compared the larger size of the same product), and the smell was not pleasant (but it's cat food not an air freshener) - otherwise the product was of good quality. You can't blame a product for a picky cat.

review/summary: Great ingredients, and loved by my cat.
review/text: My little guy loves this stuff, and I have nothing to complain about with the ingredients. It's expensive, but since my schedule makes it difficult to him feed an all-wet diet (I do a combo of wet and dry), it's worth it to me to make sure his dry food is as healthy and cat-appropriate as possible.<br /><br />Just remember is that this food has a higher caloric density than most, so you don't need to feed as much as you would most dry food.  The feeding guidelines on the back are too much for most indoor-only cats, so adjust accordingly.

review/text: We heard a lot about this product from some friends.  We decided to switch from Science Diet since Wellness Core has much more protein, which should hopefully decrease the chance for diabetes or other diseases related to too many carbs.  Our cat didn't like it at first (it has a strong smell), but she adjusted to it in a couple days.  She loves it now!

review/summary: Wellness CORE
review/text: My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Wellness Kitten Health Dry Kitten Food, but does not seem to like Wellness CORE.  I think he's a "chicken" eater.  I rate the Wellness Core 3 Stars, as I haven't completely given up yet on mixing it in with other foods he likes: California Natural Chicken and Rice Dry Cat and Kitten Food; Innova Cat and Kitten Food; Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kittens; and Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Chicken Recipe.  The Wellness plastic bag is one of the nicest kibble, dry cat food bags on the market, featuring a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags, that are seemingly more paper based, do not have.

review/summary: Caused my 15 year old cat to have diarrhea for first time in his life.
review/text: I have a 15 year old neutered male domestic short hair kitty who is overall very healthy and happy. I was excited to put him on this food after doing extensive research because it was high in protein, grain-free and had several great reviews. I had him on Innova Senior, but it was a little dry and he didn't really "love" the food. However, since starting to feed Wellness CORE a few days ago, my kitty has had diarrhea every time he uses the litterbox. I've owned him his whole life, and he's never had diarrhea before and it's the only thing that's changed in his diet (he also gets Wellness wet food at night). Although I already have him on a high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein in this food might be too much for his digestive tract to handle. I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the condition improves and maybe is just a side effect of the transition, but I'm not pleased by the initial experience. We'll see what happens.

review/summary: First Rate Blend.
review/text: I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe"s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says "Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co." Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Prefect for Jura expresso machine
review/text: I have a Jura Capresso automatic espresso machine.  I like it, but I have found it difficult to find beans that make expresso that takes much like what you might get at a Starbucks.  The beans have to be very robust, but they can't be French or Italian roasted because that makes them too oily (which can clog the machine).  I've tried lots and lots of different beans, some quite expensive (like more than $20 / lb.).  I saw these at Costco and decided to give them a try.  They are perfect.  The flavor is great, and the roast is pretty dry so they work beautifully in my machine.

I'm actually drinking it right now: the aroma is quite strong, the coffee is full-bodied, rich, and goes down nicely. The beans by themselves are also quite tasty.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good brew at a good price.

Since this is one of the more affordable Costco coffees, I really wasn't expecting this to trump my favourite brands!<br />I'm getting a much richer and smoother coffee than I was with pre-ground, vacuum sealed grounds, and beans from any other brand I've tried.<br />Now I can make equal, if not better coffee than I can drink at coffeehouses!  Unlike some other reviewers I am having no trouble producing a strong, rich espresso from these beans.

review/text: This coffee is ok for the price.  Better than most supermarket brands.  Similar to Starbuck's House Blend.  I prefer a little richer, darker brew than this, but I think the quality is fine.  No "off" flavors that I detected.  I forgot to add that it seems to me to be low acid.  This is a large bag I ordered and I left the whole bag out on the counter and used it from there, but it got a little stale before I used it all.  I would suggest just taking out a bit at a time and storing the balance.

review/summary: Promising Aroma, but Disappointing Coffee.
review/text: I enjoy whole-roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!

With litters on the ground, I love sharing my Olewo Carrot product with the new puppy buyers! Thank you for making this great product available.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: My wife and I have included Olewo carrots and beets in our Bearded Collie's diets for over six years. All three have beautiful coats and virtually never have digestive issues. They love the taste and wait patiently for each meal. I know of many friends that started their dogs on these products and feel the same as I do about their value. I like the products so much that I order extra so I never worry about running out.

review/summary: Lovely product and company
review/text: As a breeder and exhibitor of Great Danes, our dogs are always on the go. Utilizing Olewo Carrots, our dogs have firmer stools, easily handle stress of traveling & showing weekly, and are rarely ill despite the multitude of dogs they come in contact with. They have amazing shiny coats which require no additional products. We wean our puppies adding in Olewo Carrots to their kibble to aid in digestion, boost immunity and to naturally worm. We share the benefits of Olewo Carrots with everyone we can and believe every pet owner should add it to their pet's diet.

review/text: As a breeder and exhibitor of Great Danes, I am thrilled with the results I am seeing with adding the carrots and beets to my dogs food. I am seeing shinier, softer coats, and the 2 that I have with some skin irritation have improved as well in just 2 weeks. Stools are also firmer and my picky eaters love the carrots. With traveling alot and being around many different dogs I am happy that the products also help boost their immune system.  So many benefits of adding just a couple Tablespoons a day.

review/text: I have 2 dogs of my own that I use to feed dry food only.  A friend of mine recommended adding in Olewo supplements to my dog's food. I hadn't really heard of supplements for pets but I did a little research and liked what I found. My dogs love to carrot supplements in their food! I have a smaller dog who is a picky eater and would refuse food sometime. After adding in the carrots to her food she went crazy and finished every bite. I am also feeding my dogs the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083QBWKU">Olewo Dehydrated Red Beets Dog Food Supplement, 2.2-Pound</a>. If you are going to try the carrots, get to red beets too!

This not only taste better it saves you alot of money.. all you need is a few drops. I used it this Christmas to flavor chocolate melts. It was delicous. This product is sold in many stores but this flavor was no where to be found. I found that you can find anything and everything on Amazon.com..

review/summary: They look yummy enough for me to eat
review/text: I'm pretty picky when it comes to what I feed my 4 year old shar-pei- in fact, I cringe at the thought of routinely feeding my dog most of the mainstream/ popular brands after 'google'ing some of their ingredients. Selecting a treat that I'm comfortable giving her can be frustrating.<br /><br />I ordered these treats in hopes that they were acceptable and wouldn't be spit out on the kitchen floor. I must say that they far exceeded my expectations. There was actually a split second where I wanted to try one- they look like something you would serve on a plate with a glass of milk! The shape reminds me of minature muffins with the texture of a crunchy cookie. My girl not only didn't spit out the treat, she ran into the living room to eat it/ savor it in privacy! Her reaction was pretty funny.<br /><br />If you are looking for a treat Made in the USA, with ingredients you can pronouce, and doesn't look like it was processed at ACME industries then you may want to give these a try. (I also ordered a box of the Ulti'mutt', so glad I did!)

review/summary: Makes some very flavorful chili
review/text: Last night I made a pot of chili using this chili powder, and it was probably one of the best tasting batches of chili I've ever made (been making chili for over 20 years).<br /><br />16 oz of chili powder is quite a bit.  I use about 3tbsp per 5qt pot of chili, and probably make chili about once every month or two...so this will last me probably a couple years.<br /><br />Be sure to have a container to put it in, because it comes in a non-resealable foil bag.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/18/2012<br />OK, so it didn't last me a couple years.  9 months after purchase, I probably have enough for another 6 or so pots of chili, so I'm back to order more.  Less than $10 for one year's worth is certainly a good deal.<br /><br />To make my chili spice mix, I blend this chili powder with Oregano, Basil, Thyme, Marjoram, Cumin, Black Pepper, & Salt.

review/text: This chili powder has a great full bodied flavor.  I don't know if I can explain it so you'll understand, but some red chili powders have kind of a dull taste behind them.  (Don't know how else to describe it.)  Fortunately this brand's chili powder is always tasty.  I've been buying it for years and would recommend it to any chili lover.  I made enchiladas last night using my red sauce, (made with this chili powder), and got rave reviews from my husband.  I consider myself an "expert" on this sort of thing.  I had my first enchilada at the age of two.

Of course you can add more cayenne if you need it hotter.

We call them "squeezers" and any time I ask him if he wants one he gets extremely excited and says, "yeah yeah yeah!!"<br /><br />At less than half the price of Revolution Foods and Plum organics versions, these are a great alternative. I realize these are not organic, but they are all natural and there is no added sugar, so I still feel good about giving them to my child. At .16/oz (subscribe & save price) they are only slightly more expensive than buying applesauce cups at the supermarket.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the GoGo Squeeze for an excellent on-the-go snack. If you're staying at home, I'd suggest trying Mott's "Healthy Harvest" Peach Medley or Summer Strawberry. My son loves those too.

It kills me when I buy these and see all the packaging used for 4 measley appplesauces. This company really has a good product, but the pricing and packaging are way too high. I was hoping by buying them in bulk that they would come separately without the cardboard box. Still not great, but would be better. Not so! It's nice that the pouches are resealable, but they are so small, that there wouldn't really be a need to reseal them.

review/summary: Great for a healthy on-the-go snack
review/text: My 3-year old and 10-month old love these.  They are easy to throw in the diaper bag. GoGo SqueeZ applesauce has taken the place of fruit snacks in our home.  Two things two watch 1.) The small yellow lid is a potential choking hazard. 2.) The little one gets so excited when she eats it that she squeezes it too hard and makes a mess.  Enjoy the treat, it will go fast.

review/summary: One of the best toddler snacks out there
review/text: This stuff is great--it's ultra-portable and my twin toddlers can eat it in the backseat of the car without making a mess.  Even better, it's a snack that I can shove in my purse to have on hand "whenever", and it won't spoil. A nice, non-messy alternative to crackers when I need a portable snack.  And I love that it doesn't have any added sugar.

LOVE the fact that they are wholesome, with no added ingredients. Just fruit - and my daughter LOVES the taste. Thanks Amazon, for bringing these to us. Our grocery store stopped selling them and I had to go hunting online. Price is identical.

review/summary: Very convenient and tasty!
review/text: I first came upon applesauce in a pouch when I was in France for a few months.  I was sooooo happy to find it here with the same brand in the states.  These pouches make it extremely easy to get a fruit serving no matter where you are.  It's great for kids because unless they sit on it with the lid off (which is bound to happen with kids sometimes), there is literally no mess.  No spoon to carry around, no frustration of opening a cup of applesauce only to realize you left your spoon at home, no anger from finding out your other fruit got squished in your bag.<br /><br />I also love that the applesauce is JUST APPLES.  No added sugar, etc., so we know it's healthy!  I recommend this product to anyone with kids or anyone with a busy lifestyle!

Even happier to be able to buy them for such great price at Amazon. Our 2 year old, who does not touch applesauce because of the messiness, is hooked.

review/text: my family has tried just about every fruit pouch out there, this one unfortunately was the worst. maybe i'm naive but, when i look at packaging that has apples and strawberries on it and is called "apple strawberry" i assume that's what it is...not apple, strawberry and banana. i just don't understand why/how companies do this. reminds me of the time i went to a restaurant to have broccoli cheese soup, only to get 3 bites in and find out there's ham in. thanks guys depending on which religion i might be i could be in big trouble.  in this case, it's a matter of my son being intolerant, not anything fatal, but induced vomiting isn't fun. it wasn't until later of the smooshed in side of the pouch did i "see" wher it said banana. i'll be staying with Dole Squish'ems and the Fruit Buddj

review/summary: There's nothing seriously wrong with these dried shiitakes
review/text: As far as I can tell, these dried shiitakes are just as good as other brands of dried shiitakes.  This product includes whole shiitake mushrooms of all sizes from very tiny ones to medium-sized ones to moderately large ones.  I didn't see too many colossal-sized shiitakes, the ones the Japanese would call, "donko," which are separated from the rest and sold at a higher price in Japan.  Havista didn't explain what they mean by "3-5 CM" and how it differs from "3-4 CM," which is slightly more expensive than "3-5 CM."  These dried shiitakes will fully occupy exactly 5 1/2 one-gallon plastic jars.  Product of China.<br />Caution:  Havista's dried shiitakes are extremely rich in vitamin D2.  Without even contacting Havista, I can tell that these shiitakes received plenty of sunshine where they were farmed.  I get hypercalciuria (calcium sand in my urine) after eating only two-thirds of the dried shiitakes in a 1-gallon plastic jar.  Hypercalciuria is a symptom of hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D overdose).

review/summary: Good Chipotle
review/text: This Chipotle Powder has heat mostly when you either microwave it, or use it while your cooking... It goes great sprinkled on cooked quinoa and vegetables. I cook with no fat and oils so this is a good way to add flavor. I am going to buy some paprika and mix it in a separate jar 75% chipotle and 25% paprika and see how that comes out, I might add some other seasonings but dont know what i will use yet. I have made it with Tuna Steaks, and salmon and chicken so far... Needs to be added with other items, but i think if i made a liquid sauce using this powder i will be able to create a more flavorful dish.<br /><br />So all in all for the price its a great deal... but the shipping is kinda steep for a light item. Maybe buying more than one item saves money?!?!?!?! I'm not sure... but i will make another review after i try all these things, and see what goes better with this item<br /><br />P.S. Amazons super saver free shipping is cool cause its free... but it takes SO LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG to get your stuff... Oh well at least its free lol

review/summary: Tasty, but...
review/text: I was looking for something new and spicy when I came across this product.  The quantity and the price really sold me without a second thought ($.6 an ounce?!).  The flavor is a little more subdued than anticipated, but when it does come through, it lends a delightful, almost hickory-like smoke.  Unfortunately, this is a little unbalanced as the actual fleshy flavor of the the pepper is quite dim.  My other concern with this powder is that a lot of the heat isn't released when sprinkled on top of food.  I can put a healthy dose on top of my dinner, which lends a nice kick, but when it gets to my stomach and begins to digest, the warmth comes out and my tummy gets warm.  I also noticed this when adding it to soup.  I added to some soup what I thought was reasonable based upon what I had sprinkled on top of solid food and the soup came out far more... exciting than anticipated.  So, the powder tends to lock in the heat unless you actually mix it into your meal and allow it to dissolve/soak up water.<br /><br />Ultimately, I find this to be pretty tasty even though it could be a little more balanced.  Also, keep in mind that the heat it lends dry-ish will be far more subdued than the heat it lends when thoroughly cooked in.  Oh, and I have a huge jar of it that only cost me $12!
