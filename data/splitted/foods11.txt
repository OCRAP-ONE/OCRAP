review/text: I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage.

review/summary: Not bad, but it really is just a taste of thai
review/text: Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy! The coconut and ginger flavors are very mild.<br /><br />Each recloseable, Chinese-takeout-shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container. One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there weren't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3, plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier. (Of course, one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you're not fond of it, but I like them all!)

Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors).

review/summary: More than just a taste of Thai
review/text: Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).<br /><br />While some people have remarked on the "over-sized" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.<br /><br />While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual "taste of THAI." I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat.

review/summary: Eh...
review/text: I had recently tried a similar product from Trader Joe's and, not having a TJ's around me presently, I decided to try this more readily-available variation.  I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things...

review/summary: Tasteless mess
review/text: I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess.

review/text: While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. I find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries, and is maybe a little less spicy.

review/text: Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better! Has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a good amount of heat. It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to "spice it up". We wish it had a lower sodium content. While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing! Really good with chicken, beef, pork, tofu and veggie dishes. Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals. We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it. Will buy again!

review/text: Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!

review/summary: Jittery, lacks body
review/text: I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice.

review/summary: High Quality My Dog Enjoys and My Budget Does Too!
review/text: My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to "encourage" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives.

review/summary: This is great dog food!
review/text: A few years back, prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor, I switched my dogs to foods without corn.  I was convinced, right or wrong, that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections.  I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!  I haven't seen them so spunky and full of energy.  I've got a coon hound and two jack russells (mine are not the "bounce off the wall kind", mine are mellow, laid back kinda dudes!)  They gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full...no more begging in the kitchen than normal! Everyone's skin seems smoother, eyes are brighter, heck, I think I'll go have a bowl!  All I can say, is if you are looking for a good quality dog food, this is the one for you.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!

review/summary: I would give Harmony Farms extra stars if I could!
review/text: I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach, and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight, she slept almost all the time, and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: My co-worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'Whole Dog Journal' recently and I was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods, I had been feeding my dog Beneful which is basically just junk food.  I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago.

review/summary: Quality dog food delivered to your door!
review/text: No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!<br /><br />July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.

review/text: I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.

review/text: Everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands, like purina, iams, or god forbid moist & meaty. Ingredients like ground flax seed, peas, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners, by-products, and low-quality corn show this to be true.<br /><br />I just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams ProActive Health and decided to make the results known. I let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first, and placed the two piles a bit apart. He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.<br /><br />Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande.

review/summary: Excellent for Wheaten Terrier's Sensitive Tummies!
review/text: Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.

review/summary: Both formulas are excellent for my dogs!
review/text: I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!

review/text: I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy.

review/summary: The best food for dogs!
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky.

review/summary: Solved 2 different digestive issues for 2 different dogs!
review/text: I have 2 husky/shepherd mixes. The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up. He also wouldn't eat more than a few nibbles at a time. The 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea (vet's food didn't fix it either). He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result. They're both more relaxed.<br />We purchase at our local grocery store (Hannaford here in NY) for about $1.31/lb. For the price, ingredients, and results - you can't beat it.

review/summary: Excellent chips
review/text: Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture, but, I would highly recommend trying these out.

review/summary: Variety pack, packed lunches
review/text: I discovered Pop Chips awhile back and fell in love with the BBQ flavor- whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative. Hubby is a teacher, so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school.<br /><br />Since I mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week, I thought the variety pack would be different for him. He gets his crunchy fun and doesn't realize the Pop Chips aren't as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting. Score! Plain are fine, vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor. Single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo, but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich.

review/text: I like these Pop Chips a lot, but not all the flavors.  This variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like.  These chips have strong flavor and are not greasy.  They are fairly filling and make a great snack.  They're pretty noisy (like most chips) so don't take 'em to the local theater!<br /><br />These came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging.  I can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as I found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things, and after several months it still tasted fine.  ;)<br /><br />These are a pretty good size for a quick snack.  Quality has been consistent over several different batches.  I really like the texture and crunch, and love the lack of greasiness.

review/summary: Didn't care for the variety selections
review/text: I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order.

review/summary: Can't beat the taste.
review/text: A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.

review/summary: Delicious alternative to greasy traditional chips!
review/text: These are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips.  Great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty, crunchy snack.  They are light and crunchy and they taste really good. I was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good.  The original flavor reminds me a lot of the Munchos chips.  The original flavor and salt/vinegar are my favorite but they are all good.  My least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor (I don't like cheddar) but most people really like it. I have purchased these several times now and I will continue to do so.  I  highly recommend this product for anyone!

As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.

review/text: I agree with many of these reviews.  The product tastes good - not fantastic but good.  I don't like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.<br />Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.  Don't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips - eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).<br />If you do get the big box - just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them - and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two.

review/text: Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar.

It arrived within 3 days! the flavor is awesome! just like what I hoped for! if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you! if you are happy with the regular potato chips and doesn't care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are! those chips have so much flavor! they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor! I have lived in the U.K. for a while and one thing I have always missed is the crisps that I used to eat in U.K. those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps! I will be order those again!

review/summary: Perfect Pop Chips
review/text: I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online.

review/summary: Just my 2 cents...
review/text: I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said, Pop Chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Salt & Vinegar by far.<br /><br />The calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair!
