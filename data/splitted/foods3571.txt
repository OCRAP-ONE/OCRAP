review/summary: Sublime Treats!
review/text: My wife and I received these as an unexpected Xmas gift through fed-ex on Xmas day this year.  I had never heard of The Tea Room, the makers of this item, nor the product.  After having tried one, I picked up the receipt and made it a point to learn what it was called and who made them.  Simply put, this was one of the most exquisite little bites I've put into my mouth in quite some time.<br /><br />There's a variety of flavors, all sweet, but it's the consistency and texture of these little pillows that hook you.  Also, receiving them as a gift was just perfect - as I don't know that I'd buy them for myself, but I sure would as a gift for a special someone.  A bit expensive? Sure.  Luxurious?  Absolutely! Outstanding product.  Recommended!

review/summary: Quite Disappointing
review/text: I don't know what happened to my macarons, but they smelled and tasted slightly of moth balls.  I usually buy macarons from a Korean bakery in downtown L.A., but wanted to try "real" French ones.  I'm pretty sure this isn't what they are supposed to taste like.  Even the frozen ones from Trader Joe's have better flavor than these ones.  The only one that had any discernible flavor was the strawberry, and that was because of the strawberry jam filling.  Also, they look so beautiful in the picture, but mine were all jumbled up in the box, and some were even crushed.  Could be a shipping problem, but the FedEx box was intact.

review/summary: A bit more informative review
review/text: I can vouch for Fresh Choice as an top notch supplier, they have the best price on stone crab claws, which were sized as advertised, and they ship fresh cleaned conch meat and other fishes at a reasonable price.<br /><br />Now, these lobsters are warm water tails, and it's possible to get a mushy one, so you take your chances, there's no way to predict how a tail will cook up.  That goes with the territory, but this supplier has them at a good price (these days) and their quality has always been first rate.  They freeze just fine, so it's most efficient to order several things to spread out the overnight shipping costs and stock up for those special occasions.<br /><br />Follow up:  For xmas I ordered some of these as presents and for myself.  Yes, you can get a soft warm water tail.  But I didn't see any, and the 8 oz. tails were really sweet and flavorful.  Like I said, good supplier.

review/text: We are already used to the different texture of gluten-free products, so I'll say that as far as flavor and texture goes we love this flour. I've used it in everything, every type of cooking. I recommend adding xantham gum for cookies, brownies, etc. Helps it to be less crumbly.<br />Compared to other brown-rice flours this one beats them all.<br /><br />Because it is made from brown rice, a whole grain, it is a little more grainy and crumbly, so I recommend adding in another high-nutrition flour like amaranth or quinoa flour, but not necessary of you don't mind the texture of whole grains.

review/summary: ANOTHER WINNER FROM JUICY JUICE
review/text: TASTES LIKE THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE 100% JUICE!,<br /><br />JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE, is a simultaneously self-serving and altruistic mission.<br /><br />"Juicy Juice Berry"- A MOST PALATABLE VARIETY OF JUICY JUICY:<br /><br />This is one of my favorite varieties of Juicy Juicy. Why is it? It is very palatable and obviously very sweet. However, there is none of the high fructose syrup in it that is added to other punches. Afterall, this is 100% juice.<br /><br />So what's in this stuff?:<br /><br />Apple Juice, Grape Juice, Raspberry Juice (Water, Juice Concentrates) Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Citric Acid. It is the combination of juices in this blend that makes this taste like a treat. For children and adults too, who like the sweet taste of soda pop or sweetened punches, this product represents a much healthier and palatable alternative.<br /><br />For providing this excellent, anti-oxidant rich alternative, as a compromise between healthy beverages and sugar sweetened drinks, I feel that "Juicy Juice Fruit Berry" has easily earned a five star rating.<br /><br />Now if only there were a way to decrease the amounts of natural sugars without affecting the taste?!<br /><br />WHAT IS THE "JUICY JUICE" BRAND?:<br /><br />Libby's "Juicy Juice Fruit Berry, 46 fl oz" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program "Arthur" with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said, "Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur". Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most "Juicy Juice" products are significantly less expensive than "Ocean Spray" and "Northland" juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />THE INEVITABLE COMPROMISE:<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is "Juicy Juice" and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />LOOKING FOR MORE INFO?:<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at "juicyjuice" on the world wide web. They have several useful links to pediatric nutrition sites and "Frequently Asked Questions" about their products.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT]

review/summary: The good, the bad, the really bad customer service
review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift. Initially, it was fun going through the box and reliving the childhood memories the candy evoked. Then I hit a stale candy. Then another. There is nothing worse than biting into stale candy, unless it is the knowledge that someone paid a premium for it. (There's less than $10 worth of candy in a $40+ box, very little of it "retro", most of it hard candy.) I wrote to the company, and their response was essentially, "gee, that's too bad." They advised me to put the candy in the microwave to freshen it up. No other solution, as it's "not their fault." To sum up, some of the candy is good, some is really bad, and you'll never know which is which until it's in your mouth. I wouldn't buy from this company because they don't stand behind their product.

review/text: This is a good mild and sweet ceylon cinnamon.<br />Anyways, i'm using it to lower blood sugar, i'm not diabetic but i'm trying to loose weight and by lowering blood sugar it helps regulate the insulin levels. A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant. If cinnamon can help control the level of blood sugar and, by offshoot, fat levels, then that is corroboration of what some have said regarding its weight loss potential.

review/text: I adore cinnamon and try different types and sources. Sadly, this cinnamon is tasteless. It is extremely dry [which I assume means it has very little actual "oil" in it]. Moreover, its texture is actually unpleasant. It feels as through the cinnamon bark has been "cut" with some tasteless, dry filler. Oddly, there is a mild clove aftertaste to this brand. That is not unpleasant but I prefer the spicy flavor of Saigon cinnamon, but that is a personal choice. I can't recommend this particular Ceylon cinnamon. Sorry.

I have tried them all, regular, fig, pomegranate, blood orange and tamarind. I like them all. A couple of other things I like a lot are sesame oil and Chef Jimmy's My Mojo. My Mojo delivers a great deal of flavor for a small amount of sodium.

I decided to try to buy it anyway. Well, I also got 1 box, and wrote to customerservice@dcdistributions.com asking for the rest of the order. They didn't answer me by email, but in about 10 days I got a box from them with the 5 missing boxes, and a whole bunch of samples. One would thing that after so many months had passed they would fix the problem, but it didn't happen so far.<br />As to the beverage itself, it does contain honey, and it is nice and smooth, not too spicy, not very sweet and quite drinkable.

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews and the product description, but from the minute I opened the bag, I was sorely disappointed.  I may have received a "bad batch" (or maybe the bag had been on the shelf much too long) because the beans don't even smell like coffee - the aroma was something like a mildly unpleasant chemical odor and nothing more.  I ground up the beans thinking that might release some of the oil that makes coffee flavorful, but that didn't change anything.  The finished brew was, not surprisingly, terrible as well; the chemical aroma had dissipated, leaving no flavor at all.  To top it off, the half cup I drank left me with terrible shakiness and heart palpitations from the caffeine, which obviously they didn't remove enough of.  I would tolerate this stuff until it was finished if it was drinkable, but unfortunately, the two bags I bought are going immediately into the trash.  I would strongly recommend looking for another brand.

review/summary: Makes a good full bodied espresso
review/text: The title says it all.  This is a good decaf espresso.  There are no subtle nuances or it would have gotten 5 of 5.  It is strong enough to stand up to milk in lattes and flavorful enough for an espresso.  It just did not wow me, though it is a tiny step down from "wow".<br /><br />It is much more flavorful than Starbuck's espresso and a local roaster's beans, so this is a recommendation.<br /><br />I just happen to have a higher recommendation for Larry's Beans Decaf Espresso which has those subtle nuances that I like.  I think traditional espresso lovers will prefer the Caffe D'arte.  For my taste I prefer the Larry's.  If Larry's is not available, I will go with this product, the second best coffee I have found.

review/text: If you expect this to taste just like the Verona you get at the Starbucks store, you will be disappointed. It's close, but be sure to use the medium cup setting. A better (and presently more expensive) Starbucks K-cup is their French Roast. Nevertheless, all of the Starbucks K-cups are over-priced, presumably because of the name. To my taste, there are a number of better dark roasts available at more reasonable prices, including two of my favorites, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7N2">Green Mountain Double Black Diamond</a> and especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain Revv)</a>. And, of course, the three great dark roasts from Coffee People: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XLH4Y">Jet Fuel</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZDK">Black Tiger</a>, and their Kona Blend (if it's ever available again).

review/text: Found this at costco at a significantly lower price and gave it a try. I like a bold but smooth cup of coffee and find most to be too weak at medium setting. I had settled on Emiril's Big Easy as my most recent favorite until I tried the Verona. Admittedly, this is what I tend to buy in bean form for a full pot, and I was surprised to find that the k-cup version is actually very close to what I make in my drip. Full flavored without an over-roasted taste that you get with some Starbucks coffee, it's become our go-to cup. If Amazon's sellers get their price down I'll buy it here and save myself a trip to Costco.

That being said, I must say that this coffee is outrageously overpriced. The exact same box (54 count) sells at Costco for $34 reguarly. We buy it from there monthly.<br /><br />The coffee itself, is by far the best coffee(hence the 5 stars) you can get out of this magnificent little machine. It has a bold, deep flavor yet lacks the bitterness you often taste with rich, strong coffee. It is our favorite, without question, and we have tried practically every brand made.I cannot imagine finding a coffee from home that I will like better.<br />HOWEVER.....<br />Amazon, please check your pricing. If Costco can sell this cheaper, I am sure you can do better! If that day ever comes, I will be happy to add this product to the myriad of items I purchase from you.

review/summary: Best Kcup coffee I have had
review/text: I have been a coffee drinker for the past 10 years, admittedly starting a bit later than my friends around me.  I began by drinking whatever drip coffee starbucks was serving on a given day, and, over time, I graduated to asking only for the bold drip that was on tap that morning.<br /><br />Over the past year and a half, Starbucks has lost their way by adding the pikes place and blonde roast blends and rotating their bold coffee selections such that the coffee I have grown fond of drinking, is now only offered in their stores on an occasional basis, much to my chagrin.<br /><br />Fast forward to a weekend last year with in-laws where I was introduced to a plethora of bold coffee choices in the form of K-cup coffee, which I initally took for gimmick coffee, since I have always believed that the best coffee must be brewed directly from a freshly grounded coffee bean, and that anything that comes under the heading of instant was what lazy coffee drinkers called their morning cup of joe.<br /><br />Well, I must admit that after sampling nearly 10 brands of K-cup coffee, I was finally able to enjoy a cup of the starbucks verona blend.  In the space of 2 mornings of drinking verona k-cup coffee, I am a changed man.  I have stopped going to starbucks or other local coffee houses in search of a consistently good tasting bold coffee.  I have stopped because the rich, sweet verona coffee flavor that I have come to associate with a good cup of coffee comes in a little plastic cup that I load every morning into my newest kitchen appliance.<br /><br />I am still a little chapped at the price to buy the verona K-cup (both amazon and elsewhere), but I advise you to look around, as there are deals to be found, if you are willing to do some investigative work and are willing to buy a larger quantity.  I purhcased a 54 count box of verona at Costco for approx 60 cnets a k-cup.<br /><br />As for me, since the middle of June 2012, I have made my coffee every morning in my kitchen, and I am grateful to live in a time when as a consumer, I have a choice in how I choose to spend my coffee allowance.<br /><br />It may not be everyone's prescribed method to procure and consume coffee -- I must admit that I have always enjoyed the daily banter that comes with visiting my local starbucks (I have come to know over 50 starbucks baristas in the time I have been a starbucks customer), but in the end, the uneven quality and lack of consistenty in their coffee offerings has led to me to the decision to enjoy the bold, sweet verona blend coffee in the comfort of my home (for the record, I set my k-cup coffee maker to dispense 6 oz of water with each k-cup I use, in order to realize the dark roast flavor that I desire).<br /><br />The verona blend has consistently been rated the #1 choice among starbucks customers, and their team of mixers has configured a k-cup flavor that captures the essence of what I first tasted in a starbucks storefront here in the heart of silicon valley so many years ago.

review/summary: Most favorite KCup so far
review/text: Have been testing and tasting many of the Kcups for the past two years.  I like a dark bold cup of coffee.  Thus far the double black diamond, Expresso Rainforest, Tullys French roast, Parisians Knight, have been my most favorites until I tried the Verona. Perhpas this will be my most favorite.  I tend to like a variety but do find a few that I enjoy over and over again.  The Verona is SMOOTH, no bitterness, no after taste.  It is a very flavorfull blend that makes a bold statement without shouting.  Starbuck, don't know why you have to demand a higher price than the other kcup, but on those early morning times when I want to be woken up in a delightful way I will buy the Verona.

review/text: Received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas. I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00634YDEQ">Starbucks Caffe Verona K-Cup for Keurig Brewed (54 Count)</a> available from Amazon.  I recommend this brew to anyone who likes a darker more intense flavor.  Ordering from Amazon makes my life so easy especially being a Prime member. Now one click of the mouse and I have 54 cups of delicious coffee on the way to my door.

review/text: Starbucks has set the cost of a k-cup at slightly under $1.00<br />Nothing to be done about that.<br />If you like over-roasted coffee (and I do) you pay the price.<br />This company offered fast service and a fair but still high price.<br />But as I mentioned, the quality of the coffee makes it worth the price

review/summary: A favorite but WAY overpriced
review/text: This is probably my current favorite kcup but come ON amazon! This is around $12 cheaper for this size box at Costco. Total rip-off to purchase from Amazon. I haven't purchased any kcups from Amazon since I first got my Keurig because they have upped the prices so much it's ridiculously overpriced. I hate it because I LOVE to purchase things from Amazon but they will not be getting my k-cup business unless they deal with this ridiculous priced item. The coffee itself rates 5 STARS but given the price, can't justify that high of a rating.

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: I drink my coffee black, so I'm picky. Like really picky. I got this while it was on sale here on Amazon, about $15 off the normal Starbucks K-Cups prices at this time. Wife and I both enjoy the coffee. I like it more than the random variety of k-cups we've been using for the last few months. I think I might actually like it more than the Pike Place k-cups we just finished off, and I actually prefer Pike Place when I'm at a real Starbucks. It's a k-cup. What else do you need to know? It's not quite the Starbucks that you get in person at a real coffee shop, but hey, none of these things are.

review/text: This is the best k-cup starbucks has out, I wish someone could explain to me why its only at costco while all there other k cups are in grocery stores.<br /><br />The last time I remember costco exclusives I remember them having blends like the promenade blend, the directors blend which they would later never have listed anywhere again (A real shame as the promenade blend was without a doubt one of the best blends starbucks ever made even if they don't acknowledge it's existence)<br /><br />Its rich, sweet while exceptionally bold (bolder then their extra bold k-cups I wish someone could explain how that happened).  It has a good smell, dark color.  This reminds me of the days when you could get good coffee in the stores (now getting a bold coffee at starbucks involves getting in the store before noon and hoping they decide to brew it that day and aren't in one of their Pikes place pushing modes)<br /><br />But first dunkin donuts, then this as far as exclusive k cups, I just wish their was some place that carried them all.

review/summary: Starbucks in a K-Cup!??  YES!!!
review/text: I love my Breville K-Cup machine although I did have to go through a few different coffee types until I found ones that were not watery on medium to large size.  I found a few and was very happy with them.  However I was missing my Starbucks and when they announced the K-Cup direction, I was cautious they would cheap out and give us watered down versions.  I was wrong!!!  by weight, each cup contains more coffee grounds than the leading k-cups.  Each cup of Starbucks K-Cup (on large size) tastes.... like STARBUCKS' COFFEE!!!<br /><br />Verona is wonderful - just like having it at the shop.  Also try the Sumatra and get the 54 count boxes , its a better value.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, Extra Bold
review/text: This is a dark, extra bold coffee. If you enjoy Dunkin Doughnuts coffee, you will not like this coffee, but I love it! Starbucks introduced their much weaker Pikes Place coffee to compete with Dunkins et al. A comparable Caffe Verona k-cup taste is Tully's Coffee's Italian Blend Extra Bold, but the Italian pod typically leaks for some weird reason. Caffe Verona (54-ct) is currently $35 at Costco locations (plus any local sales tax), which makes it about 65 cents per k-cup (before tax). Today Costco online is charging $35 (store and online price is usually the same) PLUS $10 shipping, so if you're a Costco member, it's actually much cheaper to buy at the store itself.

review/summary: First good K-cup
review/text: We have had a K-cup coffee brewer for two years and have tried many different coffee varieties. Most of them are bad, maybe 1 step above Folgers. Tully's was decent and was our mainstay.<br /><br />Starbucks K-cups are a relatively new addition, and I have to say it puts them all to shame. Even the Tully's tastes like dishwater in comparison. The Verona is rich, flavorful, and well roasted. I don't rate It down because of the price, it is clearly higher quality than the competition, and if you shop around  you can get it relatively cheap.<br /><br />I give it a 4 because it's still not quite the same as a premium drip coffee, and because Keurig hasn't yet figured out how to make compostable K-cups.

review/text: I too purchased this at Costco.  Although the price for 54 k-cups is about the same as the price for 80 other-brand k-cups, I splurged. It turns out this coffee is actually more economical for my taste: I used to brew two Newman's Blend x-bold k-cups at the small-cup size, but now one Starbucks k-cup set for large cup brew was actually stronger. So while 80 Newman's might have lasted 40 mornings, the Starbucks will now last me 54. Not to mention how delicious, satisfying and multi-dimensional this roast is.

Its dark, but not overly dark that a casual coffee drinker couldnt enjoy it.<br /><br />I would wait to buy it on sale, they are pretty expensive at regular price. Normally if you wait for a special you can find it for $.50-.60 /ea in a quantity of 50 or less. I cant justify buying larger quantities or spending more per cup, but if you can, this flavor is a good choice.

One K-Cup brews me 16 oz for my first cup and then I can use the same K-cup for a refill of 8 oz and its still just as strong as the first!  The delivery of this product was just a matter of 3 days which was great because I thought that I would run out before I got my order.  I've checked other prices online for the 54-count and this price is beating the competition by about 5 bucks and that's including the cost of shipping. Great coffee at a great price and right on time.

review/text: Starbucks Caffe Verona, Dark, for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is an excellent coffee.  Labelled a "dark" brewed coffee, it has a rich, deep flavor but, does not taste "burnt" like some dark coffee brews.  It has a pleasant taste and aroma...would recommend to coffee lovers that enjoy medium to dark brewed blends. Personally, I do not care for dark brewed coffee. While visiting a relative, I tried this brew and was pleasantly surprised...very enjoyable. The vendor from Amazon provided a case that was delivered quickly.... just before we used our last remaining K-Cup.

review/text: I'm not sure what to say about this product, the box it came in was so beat up it looked like the UPS guy ran over it with his truck before delivering it.  In the past I will get the k-cup boxes inside another box made of thicker material. This time, the box you see in the picture is the box they ship this in.  I haven't tried them yet, but when you shake them the coffee inside makes a little bit of a thumping noise as if there was a marble inside. None of my other k-cups do that.  In fact, some in this box don't do that either.  I will update this review once I taste them.
