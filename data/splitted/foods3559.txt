review/summary: Irish orange pekoe tea?
review/text: Purchased this for my husband, who only drinks tea. He prefers Irish Breakfast tea, but often drinks English Breakfast tea as well. He tried it and stated it tasted like Tetl*y tea. To me, it tasted like the orange pekoe tea served at fast food establishments.  It isn't unpleasant, but it just doesn't taste like Irish Breakfast tea, even when brewed with a large amount of leaves in a single cup.

review/summary: Forget Beer Face, I have a case of Tea Face
review/text: Nothing beats a creamy, sugary cup of steaming hot tea on a cold and rainy day (I live in Washington, so I drink a lot of tea).<br /><br />I usually buy loose tea at the grocery store, the price isn't great at $24.99lb but the taste is so far above the drab Lipton tea bags I grew up with that now I can't bear to drink tea from teabags.  It's like watching television on a tiny black and white after a few weeks of using a a nice flatscreen, horrible and strange.<br /><br />The price for this Davidson's Irish Breakfast was so much lower than what I get at the grocery store that  I thought, 'ha! It must be my lucky day!'<br /><br />Well, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the bag, the tea smelled wrong.  I still had a few teaspoons of Irish Breakfast from my last visit to the grocery store and when I compared the teas they looked noticeably different.  The grocery tea, hereafter known as 'Good Tea' was darker, the tea leaves more solid with occasional bits of bronzyness scattered willy nilly throughout.  The 'Good Tea' was not just slightly darker, it was several shades darker.  Also, the Davidson's Irish Breakfast had a grayish-green tinge to it.  In fact, it looked a lot like the oolong tea I bought last year and have yet to finish (guess I'm not an oolong girl).<br /><br />I made a cup for my hubby, adding just the right amount of cream and sugar.  When he's busy working, sometimes I think he'd drink a cup of soy sauce, as long as it was hot and he didn't have to fetch it himself, he's just so distracted, but he took one sip of the Davidson's and made a sour face.  Anyways, he wouldn't drink it and I had to toss my cup down the drain too.  There's no amount of sugar, cream or lemon slices that can fix this hellish brew.  Sorry, but I'd give this a pass.

review/summary: Too much like keemum
review/text: My impression of Irish Breakfast has always been mostly Assam, sometimes blended with Ceylon, but never Keemum. English breakfast usually has that smokey leaf, but not Irish. This tea was smokey. If you are like me, and you don't like that smokey flavor, you won't like this one. I really didn't like it and would not recommend it to anyone who's serious about tea. Go for Harney & Sons...it's worth the extra cost.

review/summary: Its a question of taste
review/text: Advertisement for tea says it is strong and flavorful.  The taste must be quite subtle.  The tea, when steeping, presents with a deep reddish brown color.  The aroma is quite mild.  I brew an 8 cup pot; with one heaping tbsp. At 4 minutes the flavor is to mild.  This is brewing as reccommended.  To get an adequate taste I brew 6 cups with 2 rounded tbsps. for 5 minutes.  This is the upper limit of their strength recommendations.  Well; what do I hsve?  At any level of brewing I either have a wimpy cup or one so bitter no pleasurable flavor could be discerned.  This is the first Davidson's tea that I have not liked.  I can not recommend it to anyone.  Purchased at Amazon.  Arrived quickly in good condition.  Surprisingly little dust and sweepings size particles.

review/summary: The very best loose tea and it's organic!
review/text: This is my second favorite Davidson's loose tea, the first being English Breakfast.  I have alternated between the Irish Breakfast and the English breakfast for my last four orders and have finally come to the conclusion that the English Breakfast is slightly more flavorful and a bit stronger.  They are very similar though, almost too close in my opinion to bother offering both.

review/text: The Davidson's Irish Breakfast tea is a little mild for my taste but is nevertheless quite tasty. Also, Davidson's teas are guaranteed to be organic which is a quality I appreciate and enjoy. I often blend my own teas together and have found that Irish Breakfast goes well with South African Rooibos tea and the two together give me an added dimension of flavor that either one alone does not possess. At any rate this is an excellent tea and if you order on Amazon's Subscribe and Save you receive an extra 15% discount on subsequent orders. So, what's not to like?

review/text: I give it five stars for value. True, it's not THE best tea I've ever drunk, but it's pretty darn good. Definitely better than Twinnings. I drink loads of tea. This one is slightly smokey. I use a lot to make a strong brew. You can simply grind it up more to make it stronger. It has a fairly clean taste. If you don't use enough tea, it may test a bit wine-like and thin. It's not a real robust, thick flavor like some Indian breakfast teas I've had.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish they'd grind it finer like most breakfast teas and I wish it were a bit more robust and fuller-flavored.

We go through a TON of loose leaf tea because we brew Kombucha dark & long plus we drink a whole lot of it!  This tea at this price is just perfect for the job!  I can't say how it is brewed the regular way because we don't drink it like that.  My husband did make iced tea with it & he loved it.  I mean really really loved it!  Maybe that's why our Kombucha is so delicious?<br />At such a cheap price it is worth trying.  The subscribe & save is no commitment.  You can cancel any time & adjust how often, how much, & even skip or have your item/s sent earlier.  Totally no risk.<br />Highly highly recommend!<br />Where else can you find ORGANIC TEA at this price?<br />Oh & it's packaged in a brown roll close type bag that is lined with plastic/wax?  on the inside.  I immediately remove it from the bag & store it in glass mason jars in a dark cabinet.  Stays nice & fresh!

review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/text: This is very good coffee when prepared by itself, but it doesn't play well with others.  I tend to mix flavored coffees into my plain coffee to get a mild flavor and to smoothe out the edges on the (cheaper) plain coffee that I buy.  This has a fairly mild flavor on its own, which is lovely by itself, but when mixed with other coffee it brings out an unpleasant note that was rejected by the whole office.

review/summary: Good salt
review/text: This salt is very tasty and a noticable difference in flavor. However, if purchasing the coarse grind make sure that you either also purchase the grinder offered by this seller or use a stainless steel type grinder, as the usual grinders will not be able to do the job. The coarseness of this salt is truly a strong crystal that is not easily broken down otherwise. The fine grind is perfect for the normal table shaker however. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try something other than the usual iodized salt found in the supermarket.

review/summary: Sweet Cooling Burst of Flavor
review/text: If you are looking for an all-natural mint without sugar, the xylitol-sweetened mints are pleasantly minty with a sweet burst of flavor. The mints crumble fast, have a cooling sensation and dissolve almost immediately after being crushed. These are not the type of mints you can suck on for any extended period of time and only serve to refresh the mouth immediately.<br /><br />Unlike sugar, Xylitol will not promote tooth decay. This ingredient also helps to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actually produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />Xylitol has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br /><br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br /><br />Inhibit the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br /><br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br /><br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30g per day can cause stomach discomfort. Since one box of mints is 42 grams, you'd almost have to eat an entire box of mints to experience any problems.<br /><br />The strange ingredient in these mints is "Hibiscus powder." This is sometimes used in diet formulas. It may cause you to feel less hungry.<br /><br />Please keep out of reach of pets, especially dogs. You may not want to keep this in your house if you have dogs.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Ricochet Peppermints, 6pk of 100 pieces/1.48oz tins<br /><br />Ingredients: Xylitol, Natural Peppermint Oil, Natural Hibiscus Powder (no Gum Arabic as incorrectly stated in above description)<br /><br />This was my first time trying xylitol mints and I was not disappointed.  They are very sweet & refreshing.  They have a different sweetness than sugar, but it's not phony or sick tasting like some alternative sweeteners.  I was surprised that the mints are light purple, but it's a natural coloring from hibiscus flowers.  I do wish these mints were a little bigger.  They are .42grams/each and the size and shape remind me of Smarties candies.  They dissolve quickly, but that's probably because they're almost pure xylitol and have no added chemicals.  They also make a lot of dust, but I can put up with that for the great ingredients.  I was debating between these and Spry xylitol mints, but the Spry ones have calcium lactate and gum arabic.  Plus they're made in China and Ricochet are made in the USA.  The tins are convenient and have quotes on the inside lid, but some of the tins have loose latches.  Not a common problem, but one of the six didn't close as securely.  So if you have one that closes securely, you might want to save it.  Overall these are great mints and would be even better if they were bigger and available in more stores.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tasty xylitol gum try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00124VRPU">Xyloburst Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 100 Count</a><br /><br />***2012 UPDATE: I just bought another 6-pack & the mints have changed a bit, mostly improvements.  They are now bigger (increased from .42g to .5g) & they make less dust.  They are also more minty.  They are still purple, but the hibiscus powder ingredient has been replaced with "natural coloring."  Packaging looks different & they have given them the new name Xyla. The price was still the same, which is nice since the mints have increased in size. Still 100 mints/tin, but weight is 1.76oz rather than 1.48oz. Nutrition facts have remained the same (1 calorie/mint with .4g xylitol & .4g carbs).  Overall the mints are even better than before.  Taste even better & last a little bit longer.

review/summary: Ricochet
review/text: These are probably the strongest mints I've tasted other than Smints.  They are about the size and shape of a sweet tart.  Like the previous reviews stated, they  are kind of crumbly and dissolve quickly in your mouth.  Good for a quick blast of mint to coat your mouth.  If you're looking for a mint to suck on, you're better off with Spry.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: An earlier review mentions possible intestinal discomfort but points out that you'd need to eat almost a whole tin to get that dose.  I wouldn't just dismiss that possibility!<br /><br />The mints are tiny, chalky, leave white residue on your fingers, and dissolve within seconds.  I'm still going to give them 5 stars, because I can't stop eating them.  They have a very clean, very strong peppermint flavor, with no odd notes or aftertaste (which I've noticed in another brand).  Between the peppermint flavor and the lack of bacteria-friendly sugar, they leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I have them at work, and have noticed reduced cravings for midafternoon snacks -- I figured it was because they gave my mouth something to do, but another review mentions hibiscus, which seems plausible as well.<br /><br />And despite eating an entire tin in a day on more than one occasion, I haven't had any stomach issues.

review/summary: Richochet Mints; Messy but Good
review/text: I must say, these are probably one of the healthiest mints out there.  Just a few ingredients which are chemical-free, plus xylitol is very mouth-friendly.<br /><br />These mints taste good, they have a nice mint kick without being a sinus-burner.<br /><br />They are the size of a Smartie candy, and the color of a purple Smartie.<br /><br />Ricochet mints dissolve VERY fast and are delicate.  They break up easily, so don't keep them singly in your pocket.  Inside the (cool) tin there is a layer of powdery dust from the crumbled mint pieces, and it kind of makes a mess.<br /><br />Overall, I like the mints.  The tins are cool, and the mints deliver a quick burst of freshness without sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I recommend them.

review/summary: Refreshing with xylitol
review/text: These mints are different from the other xylitol mints to which I had grown accustomed.  They have a great fresh, cool, minty effect--typical of xylitol--and are very good.  The main drawback is that they can dissolve very quickly vs. some of the harder mints I have had, which is the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.

review/summary: Naturally Perfect
review/text: These mints are really tasty.  The mint flavor is strong like an Altoid.  They are about 1 cm in diameter.  The packaging shows a colorful red/white striped mint which looks nothing like the mint.  They are white with a bunch of pink flecks throughout.  That doesn't make a difference to me, since I was looking for flavor alone.  However, if you are looking for a colorful candy for Christmas, this isn't what you are looking for.  The biggest selling point to me was a tasty mint made with Xylitol.  I will definitely be ordering these regularly.

review/summary: Love These Mints
review/text: I am a hypoglycemic and have recently decided to respect my body's need for very low amounts of sugar so that I do not end up as a diabetic. Before beginning this new lifestyle my creature comforts were mints & gum, but because almost all of them are made with sugar / sugar alternative that raise insulin, I thought I had to give them up completely. Xylitol doesn't require insulin to metabolize so these mints were a god-sent. I love having multiple packs at once - I keep one in my purse & one at the office. Any time I need a breath freshner, a throat soother or a sweet treat I pop 2-3 in my mouth & I'm good to go! I'm so glad these mints exist.

review/summary: Great tasting sugar-free mints
review/text: The things I like best about these mints is their strong mint flavor and that they contain only a few ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Arabic, and Peppermint Essential Oil. I purchased them because I had read some articles that said Xylitol was good for oral health, that it helped to keep plaque from forming and from sticking to your teeth. I do notice that my teeth feel clean after eating a couple, but I'm not sure if it's really going to help my dental health, other than they're better than sugar because Xylitol doesn't promote tooth decay.<br /><br />They come in a little metal box that's easy to throw in a purse or briefcase and they come in a pack of 6. The price seems reasonable compared to other mints in similar metal boxes.  Since I like the strong, cool flavor, I'll probably buy them again.

review/text: I started using xylitol mints upon recommendation from my dentist. Apparently xylitol has a number of dental health benefits. These mints contain no artificial coloring, are vegan (many mints contain gelatin), and are only one calorie each. They dissolve quickly in the mouth. They have a pleasant minty flavor, but are not super strong like Altoids. At about two bucks for a tin of 100 mints, these are a good buy for the quality.

review/summary: Never thought sardines could taste this good!
review/text: I've only eaten sardines for about a year.  I heard they were healthy and environmentally friendly (lower on the food chain than tuna or salmon), so I decided to change eating habits.<br /><br />I tried a couple other common brands that were on sale, and they were fishy-smelling.  I had been told long ago that, "if a fish smelled 'fishy' then it was too old and you shouldn't eat it", but for many months I thought it was normal for sardines to smell this way.<br /><br />Then I tried Season Brand and it was a whole different environment.  No strong fish smell!  I felt like I had gone to a fancy restaurant and had the fish served on a plate rather than in a tin.  It was a complete joy to eat these, and I look forward to opening a tin every chance I get.  I prefer the oil and the lemon/garlic as well as lemon pepper.  Their anchovies are also wonderful.  Top notch quality and flavors!!

review/summary: Great fish with surprisingly complementary seasoning
review/text: I eat mine mashed on buttered toast with fresh black pepper. I bought them on a lark at the Black Mesa market on the Navajo Nation in Arizona at routes 160 & 564. These are large fish, running 3 per tin. The "new fillet style" touted on the box means that the fish are halved and presented flesh-side up. It makes for very attractive fish, but it seems less a "fillet style" and more a packing process to fit larger fish in the small tin. Don't let my tone turn you off though. These are really great sardines, firm and meaty with a mild taste, not too salty and not too oily. I didn't know what to expect from the lemon & pepper flavor, but I really liked it. The lemon citrus nicely complements the sardines while the pepper gives the faintest hint of zing. The only minor quibble I have is that, because these are bigger fish, you're more likely to notice scales. For some reason I can take the skin and bones and fins, but scales turn me off. Again, this is a minor detail that I noticed during prep and not at all while chowing. Overall, these guys are fantastic fish and might even replace my usual standby sardines in tomato sauce.

review/summary: Looking for a mild sardine?
review/text: As I have liked Season's Norwegian brisling sardines in olive oil, I thought I'd give another flavor a try so ordered these. There are various areas of the world sardines hail from and this version is from Morocco - aside from being fillets, this type are bigger than the little guys from Norway. And guess what - they are even milder than Norway ones.<br /><br />I don't normally drain off the oils in sardine tins as I just add the oil to my salads/grains which is how I normally eat sardines. But these are so mild, I can eat them plain as well which is about a first for me as I normally can struggle to eat sardines without submerging them in something else.<br /><br />If you don't drain off the oil they can be a bit too oily tasting by themselves but still very much a worthwhile choice.

You certainly get what you pay for and this is no exception. A finishing drizzle on dishes that are begging for it sends them into the realm of gastronomic adventure.  There is a reason why the pour spout only allows for a tiny stream of this essence of Olive Oil craftsmanship, admiration and expertise to escape from the bottle.<br /><br />When you first try it, take a tiny amount in a spoon and slurp it in with the air.  You will never forget it.

review/summary: Great Tuscan olive oil
review/text: Although I like to try lots of different olive oils to explore the many and varied flavors, if I had to choose just one, it would probably be the Laudemio, produced by a consortium of 30 top quality producers in the heart of Tuscany. Laudemio is produced from early harvested Tuscan varieties of Frantoio, Moraiolo and Leccino olives grown and pressed on specially selected soils in the Chianti zone.  What makes Laudemio so special is that it combines the best of the classic, "grippy" style of the best Tuscan olive oil with the softer, more buttery notes more typical of the better olive oils from southern Italy and Spain. That makes it great not only for drizzling over grilled meats and vegetables, but for dipping in your favorite loaf of crusty Italian or French bread.  Clear and intensely green, fruity, full, well-rounded and spicy, this dark olive- green has subtle floral and mineral aromas, and it is full -bodied and peppery, with a very fresh and lively after taste. It is a classic olive oil of the highest quality, and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Shockingly bad
review/text: I have no idea how this was even approved by taste-testers at Kikkoman to be sold for public consumption. The moment I put it in the saucepan and added veggies, the smell was really off-putting, something like mustard that had gone bad. I thought maybe it would taste better than it smelled, but the taste was disgusting. It really did taste like mustard sauce that had turned at some point. It was also overpoweringly sweet, but didn't taste traditionally sugary--the ingredients label says it has stevia extract, so maybe that's what it was. Either way, it was like adding sweetener to bad milk--didn't help and just made the whole thing so much worse. I tried everything I could to salvage it--adding fish sauce, more coconut milk, other spices, mixing it with rice to mellow out the bizarre flavor... nothing could save it. Finally I had to just dump the entire contents of my saucepan into the trash. Total waste of money.<br /><br />I'll be sticking with Mae Ploy curry pastes from now on, or Trader Joe's pre-made yellow curry sauce if I really need it all ready to go in a jar.

review/text: I was making vegetable curry for my sister who had never tried curry before, and just before I add the sauce I tasted it.  Ugg!<br />Thankfully I had a jar of fresh and easy curry in the cupboard to save the meal.  The Kikkoman sauce would have killed any hope of her trying curry again.<br />Now imagine me speaking with an Indian accent "Kikkoman, you make very bad curry, very bad indeed."

review/text: I agree with the previous reviews. I bought this believing Kikkoman to be a reliable brand name and was horrifically wrong. It smelled like a mustard sauce as soon as I opened it and I too thought that cooking it would alter/improve the flavor. This product is nothing like any curry I have ever tried and I have tried many. Stick with what you know - avoid this product if you don't want to be disappointed.

review/summary: My favorite decaf kcup--full bodied and delicious!
review/text: In my 40s, I became highly sensitive to caffeine and could no longer drink "real" coffee or colas. Fifteen years ago, decaf coffee was pretty nasty, so I didn't drink much coffee except occasionally after dinner in a restaurant. This past year, I started enjoying a cup of decaf coffee at a friend's house regularly, so I decided to buy a Keurig so that I could have a cup of coffee at home when I wanted it.<br /><br />I'd tried Timothy's Decaf Colombian at my brother's house last year, which was my first time using a Keurig. I immediately became a fan of both the coffeemaker and Timothy's coffee so, when I got my own Keurig, I ordered a box of these kcups. I had my first few cups of it this week and it took me right back to a year ago standing in my brother's kitchen in Indiana and him showing me how to use the Keurig.<br /><br />Granted, it's been 15 years since I've been able to enjoy caffeinated coffee, but I think that Timothy's Decaf Colombian tastes as good as the real thing.  It has a rich, full-bodied flavor. It is not TOO strong (I don't like coffee super strong), but it is rich enough to have great depth of flavor. The box I received indicates that this is a medium roast coffee and contained 18 kcups--all Timothy's decaf Colombian. The expiration date is 12/29/12.<br /><br />I give the coffee itself 5 stars, but if I could, I would take off 1/2 star for these 2 reasons:<br /><br />1. The box I received has no resemblance--either in size or decoration--to the box shown in the product image here on Amazon. The image used on Amazon makes the box look larger than it is. When a customer is comparing different products and trying to make a decision among them, it is unnecessarily confusing to have a product image that doesn't match the product you'll receive. False advertising is a pet peeve of mine, so perhaps this bothered me more than it would most people.<br /><br />2. The box I received was crushed on one corner. I dropped one kcup while transferring it from the box to my kcup holder; it broke open and spilled coffee all over the floor. I wonder whether the kcup was damaged in transit because I don't think a lightweight plastic cup would usually bust open that easily. So far, I haven't found any other damaged kcups, but I have only used a couple so far.<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommended coffee!

The beef flavor is his favorite. I tried the newest version that doesn't use any grain ingredients. The texture is quite different, more dry, and my dog doesn't care for it as much as he likes the original version.

The company was giving out free samples, and when I told them I had a picky "treat-snob" dog, they handed me a pack of liver chop treats. Well, the company was correct - my dog couldn't resist these liver treats.<br /><br />What I like about this product: it's made in the USA, has no additives, fillers, coloring, or preservatives, and they are extremely palatable. The ingredients are simple to understand - just one: Pure beef liver.<br /><br />These treats are perfect for puppy obedience training for that dog who isn't food motivated - even he (or she) will sit for these!

I try to cut down the serving portion to about 12 pieces. Anyways, this flavor was new to me so I decided to give it a try. It was better than I was expecting it to be. It is sweet, but it has a hot kick to it. If you have ever had Mae Ploy sweet and spicy sauce, you will be reminded of that flavor. The sweetness might catch up to you however, and by about 12 or so, you will not want anymore. I think that they are good for an occasional snack.

I give him a<br />bone for 10 minutes after his evening meal and I credit these bones in good part for maintaining clean bright<br />teeth on him.  I had been buying these at Sam's Club for just under $13.00 a bag, but Sam's were out of them<br />for a period of time and so I ordered them thru Amazon at about $20.00 per bag, because I didn't want a lapse<br />in having them.  That's a huge difference in price!  Right after I got these from the Amazon vendor our local<br />Sam's got them in stock........again at under $13.00 bag for exactly the same produce.  Moral of the story is<br />that the bones are great, Amazon is a great shopping medium, but due diligence is required as the vendors<br />using Amazon vary significantly in pricing.  (Note: Sam's club is a Wal-Mart entity.

The bones split into tiny pieces all over the dang carpet which obviously creates a HUGE mess and could potentially choke your dog.  MUCH better product in Beefeaters Natural Rawhide Rolls. Yes, they cost more but stay tight and do NOT splinter...and last longer. You can buy here or other sites- just do a search. I will be buying the Beefeaters again from now on. What a waste of money this purchase has been and, no, I have NO association with Beefeaters or sellers of their products...the above comments are the straight facts.

review/text: This product used to be made in Brazil and was of a higher quality.  My dog would chew these rawhide rolls for several days.  The bone is now made in China and lasts her less than an hour.  I will not purchase this product again.

review/text: We usually purchase these at Sams club, but could no longer find them there. This was more than 50% cheeper than Petco

review/summary: RIP OFF
review/text: My dog loves these and I have always bought them at Sams Club for $11. (Exact same package). I also buy them and donate them to the SPCA where I volunteer. They are a wonderful treat for the poor surrendered dogs there. However, the price increase from Sams Club .is ridiculous. I will not puchase them again. Hope this company will reconsider pricing and I am sure the volume increase in purchases would increase their profits, even at the lower costs.

review/text: Not every dog product is right for every dog.  I have a 12-month-old Doberman "puppy" that is a CHEWER.  Bones this size at another store can run $3 a piece, and they don't last very long.  I found these at Sam's Club and not only was it much cheaper per bone, but they last her a few days.  She actually devours them over the course of 2-3 days.  If you have a Doberman or a heavy chewer, you know what I mean.  These CAN leave a white residue around your dog's mouth or paws, so you might want to watch it a bit around nice furniture or your clothes.  But compared to keeping her from chewing our upholstery or shoes, that's okay by me!

review/text: Our two dogs love them...takes some time and they do not glup them down. When you live 100 miles from anything it is nice to be able to order them.

review/summary: Crumbles easily
review/text: My golden loves to chew and hence this was the first pack of raw hides I got to keep him busy. Although he loves them, they come apart too easy and the centre is very dry and in pieces. Hence after he finished off a part of the outside, it just fell apart and he was more interested in eating the parts that had fallen out than chew on the remaining. It was also rather messy and not only stuck to my carpet but also his legs and nose! Would prefer to not buy these again!
