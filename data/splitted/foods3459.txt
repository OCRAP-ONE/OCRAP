review/summary: The Boy Loves Them!
review/text: All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.5-ounce bag of Barbara's Shackimals Chocolate Chip animal crackers. I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Kids love them!
review/text: These cookies taste great, my kids love them! I feel good about giving them a healthier snack. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star is becuase each bag comes with 2 servings in it. This makes them a little less convenient to use while traveling, but with an extra bowl or baggie that problem is easily solved. Will definitely buy again!

review/summary: 5 Stars for Choc. Chip Flavor ONLY, Oatmeal deserves 2 stars...
review/text: Choc. Chip review: I wish I found these before the kids got out of school for the summer because they are a great school lunch item.  I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/summary: Great little snack for hubby and me
review/text: My husband and I enjoy a crunchy snack every now and then, and want it to be not only good tasting, but nutritious as well. I ordered a box of each flavor Snackimals, and we have not been disappointed. I just dump a small bag of each of the four flavors in a small cookie jar. We reach in for a few whenever we want, not worrying about getting one we don't like, since they all taste great. (But I must admit, we're both a little partial to the oatmeal.) Go ahead--what are you waiting for? Buy these!

review/summary: GREAT COOKIES
review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

review/text: These cookies are amazinggg. Theyre like 10 times tastier than the regular wheat animal crackers that come in the little boxes.<br />The animals they make are the elephant, the lion, the bear(my favorite), the zebra, a camel, a furry cat, a circus cart, something im pretty sure is a fox, a monkey and a hippo.<br />The cookies are a lovely snack and there is just the right amount in the bag. I will definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

review/text: These cookies didn't last very long in our household.  My young children enjoyed them very much including their friends.  It was convenient to have them in bags to take along on car rides, picnics, and for snack after swimming.

review/text: These cookies may be "wheat free", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients. Please note that I have not tried the cookies since they are not gluten free; therefore my rating is not indicative of the taste or quality of this product  - the site would not let me post this without giving a rating so I just chose the middle of the scale rating.

review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

review/text: So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/summary: An unfortunate pairing
review/text: Is it possible that culinary great Wolfgang Puck would lend his name to such a mediocre food product? If you buy this sauce, you'll find your answer and that answer is yes. I highly doubt that Wolfgang Puck actually tasted this sauce before he signed the contract to attach his name and likeness to this insipid product but with the other Wolfgang Puck food products I've tried lately I'm starting to see a trend. If you're going to buy this sauce anyway, just go to the local market and buy one jar to try it out.

review/text: I buy this vodka sauce when my store is out of the much more flavorful Bertolli Vodka Sauce. Wolfgang Puck's version of creamy vodka sauce is a more bland-tasting sauce that doesn't add much kick to pasta dishes. I find myself having to add my own touch (seasoning) to it. In a bind, this vodka sauce will do; I'm just a little curious as to why this sauce doesn't have any punch. It more or less tastes like spaghetti sauce. Is it really a creamy spaghetti sauce? Not to mention the price is higher than a lot of sauces out there. Avoid this sauce if you can.

Considering the marketing practically saying the very high price is buying something special to help with weight loss I would say this product is a total rip off.  I gave it two stars instead of one because it did make tea.

My diabetic dog had very poor regulation of blood sugar, even on the home made (Dr. Pitcairn) diet, until we discovered Blue Buffalo Wilderness, which is grain free.  This is quality food, high protein and helps not only with blood sugar regulation, but with the allergies of the other dog.  And, my fussy eater loves it.  It doesn't get any better than Amazon shipping it free and selling it at a decent price (cheaper than my pet store).  If you have a diabetic dog, you should really try this!

I have fed a Wellness equivalent that gets about the same reaction.  What this provides is an option to shop different brands for the best price, and I can be reasonably sure the dog will eat it.

review/summary: My dogs enjoy the taste, I enjoy their health!
review/text: When my oldest dog developed diabetes, my vet suggested we go on a prescription diet plan through them that was another well-known brand.  I went home and did some reading and research and found that I would prefer a grain-free diet for my dogs-and for that matter, my cat as well.  The prescription diet was filled with grain fillers and I didn't want to pay the premium price for crap dog food.  I tried them on several brands of grain-free dog food, from the most expensive to the cheaper brands (if any grain free can be considered cheap).<br /><br />I finally settled on Blue Buffalo for the simple fact that it has greater availability in my home town area in case I ran out before I had a chance to order from Amazon.  I purchase both Wilderness dry and canned for my dogs and cats so they have some variety.  My younger, more picky dog did not have one problem switching to this brand.  The taste was enough for her to switch quickly.  Within a few weeks, both dogs started looking healthier.  My diabetic dog gained back a lot of her energy (granted, she was also put on insulin and that might have contributed as well) and my younger dog actually gained weight (she was underweight and we had a hard time keeping her at healthy weight).  Both their coats started becoming fuller and shinier and I got many compliments on them from people visiting my house about how well they were doing.<br /><br />The added benefit of less waste in our yard alone has been worth the cost of switching to grain free and I would suggest any pet owner to seriously consider the health of your animals and switch them to a diet appropriate to them.  For me, I won't ever have a dog or cat that is on anything but grain-free and Blue Buffalo is my diet of choice for them all.

review/summary: A Tasty Additive
review/text: Torani has a wonderful Italian sound to it, although it's made in South San Francisco. It's pretty ubiquitous here in the Bay Area,, found in many grocery stores, and especially coffee bars and cafes.  At the very least, it's a good sweetener, and, at best, it actually imparts the promised flavor.<br /><br />THe peppermint delivers.  I'd rank it with the Hazelnut, and both of these far above the musty old taste of the Almond. THe more Torani Peppermint you add, the more peppermint flavor you'll get.  It's a nice non-alcoholic additive for hot chocolate, coffee (!), desserts, and steamed milk.<br /><br />Ingredients and Nutritional Information.<br /><br />One ounce of this syrup (there are 25.4 such servings in a 750 ml bottle)<br /><br />contains 80 calories, no fat, 20 grams of carbohydrates, and 19 grams of sugar (no wonder it's sweet!). The presence of actua peppermint is slightly suspect: THe listed ingredients are "pure cane sugar, water, natural flavors (natural flavors of WHAT?), sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate(these are preservatives), and citric acid.<br /><br />One More Hint:  Close it tightly, because ants just love this stuff!

review/text: My dog has a picky stomach.  She's also a doberman.  I put these chews in the freezer and it's always a show stopper.  She's busy with these for at least half an hour.  That is a miracle given her powerful jaws.  She also doesn't get sick later, which happens with many treats she eats.  These are at an affordable price and I believe they are of great quality, or at least a kind my dog and her stomach enjoys.

review/summary: Dog liked first order, but does not chew second order
review/text: I have ordered these twice.  My dog loved the first order. He shows zero interest in the second order.  I can tell you why.  The first order was very smelly ... I intentionally did not buy the "deodorized" version.  The second order, which I ordered precisely the same product as the first order, even checking the UPC, does not have the strong odor, or much odor at all.  I suspect the company tired of getting complaints from those who objected to strong odor, and have simply stopped shipping them even when specifically ordered.  I plan to get my money back or an exchange. I gave it one-star, only because that is the lowest rating.  Otherwise, it would receive zero from me.

review/summary: Too Expensive
review/text: I bought this to use with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TYBWIG">Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker</a><br /><br />It arrived yesterday, and with my amazon prime, shipped really fast (two days).  This morning I got it out, and discovered that the "recipe" requires using the entire bag (along with a cup of water).  Certainly simple enough, but because the Flipside makes a very large (7 inch) waffle, I got something like 2 and 3/4 waffles from the batch.  At about $7 to buy this, almost $2 per waffle is rather pricey, especially for those on a fixed income.<br /><br />Taste wise, they were okay.... in fact, pretty nice, as I like the crunch of the pecans, but frankly, I can buy my own chopped pecans at the market and make my own batter.<br /><br />If you're wanting to gift someone a new waffle maker, this would make a nice addition due to the packaging in a "cloth" bag, but for everyday use....... not for me.

review/text: I love these bars, especially this one...the roasted mixed nut bar.  It has three nuts in it: almond, peanut and cashew; and, the nut butter on the bottom is very flavorful.  I also like the peanut version, but the almond and cashew varieties seem overly sweet.  Don't know why.  They are very crispy and crunchy.  They arrived in perfect condition.

review/text: These Nature valley sweet and salty nut bars, were really a surprise.  I usually purchase the cashew flavor, but thought I would give them a try.  As with the cashew flavor, I love the sweet side underneath and these bars are full of nuts, which I love.  I will be ordering these in the future, because sometimes I don't feel like cooking, or I'm on the go and can't eat right then.  I have chronic pain and anyone in that possition, knows that you have to eat something before taking your medication.  These bars are perfect for times like those, or when you just want something to go with a cup of coffee.  I highly recommend them, and the subscribe and save feature is great.  It keeps you from running out!
