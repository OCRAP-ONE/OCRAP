review/summary: The brown rice flavor is very strong
review/text: I love Mochi.  Love, love love it.  I've never had brown rice mochi, but I thought it would be fun to try it.  I couldn't finish the pack because the brown rice flavor was so different from the white rice mochi that I love.  And when I cooked it up, it was a bit chewy, but if I cooked it longer, it became very hard and difficult to bite.  I wish Amazon had white rice mochi available because it is a long drive to our nearest Asian store.

review/summary: Dreams of Orange Chocolate Perfection
review/text: If a little dreaming is dangerous, the cure for it is not to dream less but to dream more, to dream all the time. ~Marcel Proust<br /><br />Imagine you are drinking coffee or a chai tea and your mouth is warm from the heat of your beverage. You then take the smallest bite of an Orange Napolitain and suddenly your mouth is filled with the exotic flavor of melting dark chocolate busting with the flavor of orange. It is similar to the flavor of a candied orange peel so you have the flavor of orange zest mysteriously escaping from what could only be described as the silkiest dark chocolate in the world.<br /><br />Definitely an Indulgence that reveals culinary genius! Each piece is individually wrapped in a beautiful orange wrapping displaying the shield of the Greek warrior Leonidas, King of Sparta. The chocolates are actually named after the founder Leonidas Kestekidis who immigrated to the United States and then moved to Belgium.<br /><br />I first tasted Leonidas chocolates while in Brussels, Belgium. Since then, I have wondered about where I could purchase these delicious chocolates without having to fly to Belgium. I must say that once you taste a Leonidas praline filled chocolate, you will remember the taste for life! Since reviewing at Amazon, I discovered chocolates in gold boxes that resembled the boxes I remembered from Belgium. Enlightenment!<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />If you wish to try all the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. If you prefer milk chocolates, look for the Milk Chocolate Assortment. They also have a dark, white and milk chocolate assortment. The chocolates can also be ordered in smaller party favor boxes and they will definitely impress your guests.<br /><br />If you have been dreaming of the most delicious orange flavored chocolates in the world, you have to try these chocolates. You can nibble on them while drinking hot chocolate, chai tea or coffee. If you fall in love with the orange flavor, wait until you taste the cinnamon Napolitains.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I love these for so many reasons...<br /><br />Of course, they're awesome for fresh breath AND they're sugar free.<br /><br />They also, at least to me, make an amazing cough suppressant when I'm having an allergy attack (dust, pollen...).  Way better (and faster) than popping an antihistamine.  I also tend to get a bit queasy on the winding roads in our area.  Popping a few of these somehow alleviate that feeling. Oddly, the large sugary Altoids don't seem to pack enough punch to accomplish either of these.  There's just something about the little ones.<br /><br />The smaller size of the mints and their tins are also much easier to carry along than original Altoids.  They take up very little room in my purse and nightstand.  I'll wait on a box of these from Amazon before I'd buy a few tins of the original Altoids now!

review/summary: I used to like these...
review/text: I used to eat a pack of these every few days.  I like the small form factor for the tin, and the smaller concentrated mints helped me not to smell so much like a cigarettes butthole.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I quit smoking, and my ability to taste things returned.  These taste like a cross between burning hair and peppermint.  Absolutely terrible.  I was hoping it was just a bad batch, but a can purchased at a different store and at a later date exhibited that same foul burning hair taste.<br /><br />There's a good chance you won't notice it.  Maybe you'll like these mints.  If so, game on.<br /><br />I'm clearly in the minority here.  I'm not trying to tell you whether you should or should not like this product.<br /><br />I'm just sharing my own experience.  That experience being the flavor of concentrated burnt hair.

A horrified La Tienda employee contacted me and told me to throw away the cheeses when they arrived and the store would replace the cheeses and ship them at the higher postage rate so they would arrive fresh--ALL FOR NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.<br /><br />  In this day of indifferent customer service, it was so refreshing to actually speak with someone who cared. From now on I will deal directly with the store.

review/text: I grew up drinking Robertsons juices in the UK and was so happy to find it here in the US. Although it may seem expensive per bottle, it works out to be very cost effective. Of course it is cheaper in the UK - it has to be imported. However, you only use a small amount per drink so it goes a long way -it is very concentrated. I like to dilute it in club soda. It is the best carbonated drink out there and so healthy compared to colas etc. I make sure to keep a few bottles in my pantry because this particular flavor goes out of stock a lot and it is my favorite. The blackcurrant version is good too and the original lemon of course. I love the orange but cannot seem to find it well priced. Try them all.....you'll love them!!!

review/summary: No cinnamon flavor
review/text: I thought that I had gotten a bad batch of cinnamon sticks when I got my order.  There was absolutely no cinnamon flavor when I brewed a stick in a cup of hot tea.  Then I tried to grind it in my spice grinder and got pieces that wouldn't get any smaller.  I had to sift out the bigger pieces to get a very small amount of powder.  And still there was no flavor.  I called the company and asked about this problem and was told that that is the nature of Ceylon cinnamon .. it's a very mild taste compared to regular cinnamon.  I relayed my displeasure with these cinnamon sticks and was graciously sent a packet of their powdered Ceylon cinnamon instead.  I didn't have to return the cinnamon sticks, and they are still sitting on my shelf.  I do use the powdered cinnamon they sent me, but I have to use more of it to get any flavor.  I prefer cinnamomum verum, or true cinnamon, which is sold at my local health food store and which I normally buy.<br /><br />I gave this product 2 stars because it's organic and does come from Ceylon.

How can this be true?  Okay, maybe it's acceptable to put "pieces" (taste like stale floor sweepings) into Halloween-sized very small bars, but, please, NOT into the larger candy bars that earned Hershey's such a great brand name!

review/summary: Safe for small dogs
review/text: I read a few reviews on here as well as on other customer review sites that said that EVO was meant for working dogs only and that small dogs don't do well on it because of the high protein level which could lead to kidney problems. I have 3 yorkies doing very well on EVO, but I emailed Innova with these concerns anyway. This was the reply:<br /><br />"Dear pet lover,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting us about our products. In long-term feeding studies, EVO has performed extremely well and no adverse conditions have been detected. Further, there have been a number of myths promulgated regarding links between protein and kidney failure, aging, and other health related issues. Repeated research studies have simply not been able to substantiate these myths: Quite the opposite. Much of this work has led us to a better understanding of the role that high quality proteins have on health, disease prevention, and even recovery. The EVO is perfectly safe for smaller breed dogs as well as being suitable for puppies.<br /><br />Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information or if you have any questions.<br /><br />Veronica Moreno<br />Natura Pet Products<br />800-532-7261"<br /><br />My advice: Feed the Evo. I did the research and there is no better food.

review/text: I have an elderly Afghan Hound with colitis. The vet suggested that I feed him Science Diet Light for the excess fiber content. Well, I absolutely refuse to feed him any of their products, so I did some investigating on my own. He now gets the Innova EVO with Benefiber added, and he loves it! His hair coat is coming back and has finally put on some weight. He will actually finish his dinner when I set it down. I started my toy poodles on it. They love it as well. Innova EVO may be difficult to find, but is worth looking for. It is also a little pricey. I have been extremely satisfied with this product. I have recommended it to several people over the last 3 months I have been using it.

review/summary: another dog with kidney problems here
review/text: innova products are great but, the EVO line IS too high in the protein range. we have 3 dogs and switched them to EVO light after feeding them regular innova. taking one of my dogs to the vet, we discovered he had a tooth infection. the vet needed to do bloodwork to determine if he would be ok for the proceedure. the vet also was concerned when we told her we were feeding him EVO- stating it was TOO HIGH in proteins for the average dog. upon the return of the bloodwork we found that my 4 year old dog had ABNORMALLY high protein levels. we then discovered that the EVO light is 52.5% protein and double the phospherous. we have since switched back to the standard evo light (18.7%) and all is back to normal. this particular dog HAS NEVER had an allergy or illness in his life. we only switched to innova when the big dog food poison scare was going on last year (2007).<br /><br />there are even stores in the L.A. area that will no longer stock the EVO line. innova is great and WE FEED IT TO ALL OF OUR DOGS! but , the EVO line can be very dangerous to your dogs kidneys. google around the info isn't too hard to find.

He has much more energy than when he was on his previous food. And he eats about 1/2 as much as before per serving.  One bag (28.6 lbs) easily lasts him over a month. He only eats what he needs and never gorges himself.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than regular dog food but because it doesn't have the grain and fillers, you get what you pay for.  And besides, our boy is worth the very best.<br /><br />All in all, we are VERY satisfied with this product and we'll be ordering again soon.

review/summary: Miracle food for pets with skin conditions
review/text: I cannot say enough good about this dogfood - it is nothing short of miraculous.  We have a Westie with the classic bad skin, itchy, hot spots.  We have tried untold types of medication for month on end from the vet.  We even tried lamb food, garlic tablets, brewers yeast - everything under the sun.<br /><br />It was so bad that she carried her right foot up off the ground and hopped on 3 feet, she slept a lot and didn't interact with us much.  In desperation, my husband bought this food.  Thank goodness, because I know I wouldn't have.  I wouldn't have believed that just switching her diet could make such a dramatic change.<br /><br />Before we made it through the first bag, the hair was growing back on her foot, she was running and playing with her buddy, and "talking" to use again.<br /><br />She is a different dog after 2 bags - I've never seen anything like it, and I tell everyone about this food.<br /><br />If you have a pet with those coat conditions, just try it - its cheaper than the meds from the vet!

review/summary: Itchy skin/goopy eyes/hyperactivity...GONE
review/text: My poodle always seemed to have some kind of allergic reaction going on...his skin itched and his eyes were always tearing and would frequently crust over. He was also seriously hyperactive with a definitive ADHD-type component to his personality. My vet wasn't a lot of help, and suggested a different breed was the answer!<br /><br />Well, as someone who bought a poodle because of her own allergies, I knew what it took for me to stay symptom-free. And with ADHD among my nieces and nephews, I knew that food allergies and food preservatives and high carbs were a problem for them.<br /><br />On a hunch, I looked around for a food that was all-natural, with meat and vegetables and fruit instead of grain-carbohydrates and fillers.<br /><br />After a couple of mis-fires, I tried the Innova Evo. Oh what a difference! My poodle never again got the eye crusties. His skin and haircoat improved dramatically. And best of all, he has a much better attention span and more directed energy. He even earned his first AKC Agility Title in only two weekends of trialing...this from a dog that was so hyperactive before that he kept flunking beginner agility!<br /><br />I can't say enough good about this food. And he eats so little of it that he doesn't have nearly as much stool in the yard. He also doesn't need to go out nearly so often.

I switched the pom from Nutro to Innova Evo slowly and he was fine for about a month, all I noticed were slightly looser stools, but unless I mix his food with some plain rice, he get's very sick and doesn't stop having diarrhea. I adopted my schnauzer more recently and she can't handle the high amount of protein in this food AT ALL. They both get sick on and off so unfortunately I'm going to have to discontinue feeding my dogs this food. I strongly do not recommend Innova EVO for smaller breeds.

review/summary: Best, dogfood, ever!
review/text: This is my ONLY choice for any present or future dog that I will have! I have a 10-year-old Pomeranian, which is a rescue. I got him when he was 2-years-old. He was raised on Diamond, which isn't the best of pet quality. At the time, one of the best foods was Nutro Max, even then I never seen a dog puke [diarrhea too] so much on his food. I used to think it was the fact he scarfed it down too fast, but if I knew then what I knew now about them. :[<br /><br />I had gotten a rescue chihuahua, and he was the cutest little guy! Of course he was a rescue too. Over the course of two years, he developed some major skin issues. It was too the point where he was self-mutilating, and all he wanted to do is hide in his crate. We had switched foods over to Natural Balance, thinking that was the best option. While we went from vet to vet to vet, with no results to his issues. Immune blocking medications didn't work, steroid shots helped temporarily. While on N.B, my Pomeranian got huge from all of the potato content. He had portion control, but could hardly walk because of his loose kneecaps were aggravated by that high-carb food. With dogs, even with an allergy food you have to feed them the exact same things, or they will try to each other's food. Dogs are just as bad as toddlers.<br /><br />It was the recall of 2007, that opened my eyes to proper pet nutrition. My chihuahua was put down that summer as well, was it due to the poor food brands over the years, was it genetic? I will never know. The vets couldn't figure anything out.<br /><br />Toward the end of that time I found out N.B was of course part of the list for food recall. They had formulated the ingredients without telling the customers, they were using a rice protein that of course was imported from China. At first that was denied by the company, but they finally fessed up about it. I was totally appalled by this brand that I trusted and used for about 5 years.<br /><br />Now, comes the point of EVO. I did my research, and found this to be a great high-protein, no-filler dog food. The only reason why I didn't know about it before, was the fact distribution around here with the brand, there's not many places this is really carried at. Even though, now that has improved greatly. Even though my chihuahua got this towards the last season of his life. His skin never improved, but he was a tad feistier. My Pomeranian that could barley walk [yelped when he did], now runs around, and jumps with ease onto the high couch. His BMI is back to normal, and his energy for a 10-year-old is still amazingly puppy-like. He wrestles with our Persian, and places with his toys. The kibble is small and round, which is easy for smallest of dogs to chew. My Pomeranian treats the food like it's a steak. So, I won't ever plan on changing his brand ever again. When he's gone, I plan on using this for other future dogs. I highly recommend this and the cat version [for the cat owners of course].

review/summary: Great concept but my dog won't touch it! :-(
review/text: I love the idea of this food and I thoroughly believe in the EVO concept. I wish I could support them by continuing to buy their food. The problem is that my dog will not touch it with a 10 foot pole. Admittedly, she can be a little fussy, but honestly I've never seen her dislike any food this much - seems she'd rather starve. Usually if she doesn't like a food, she'll just ignore it until she becomes too hungry and then she'll eat it. With this food, she won't touch it no matter how hungry she gets. The only thing she likes less than this food is the EVO biscuits. Normally if she doesn't care for a treat she does this funny thing where she carries it around in her mouth for quite awhile and eventually hides it somewhere. With the EVO biscuits, she won't even carry it in her mouth - she just drops it immediately. Sigh. I had such high hopes for this great-sounding food. I'm sure it's fabulous, health-wise, if your dog likes it, but based on my experience I can't really recommend it, unfortunately.

review/summary: If your dog can handle the protein, this is a fantastic food
review/text: The good news:  If your dog's stomach can handle the protein, is preferably a performance/working dog, and if your dog doesn't have kidney problems, this is a fantastic dog food.  My two shetland sheepdogs love the flavor and inhale it as fast as they can.  Great ingredients, there's nothing questionable in it and there's no "junk food" ingredients in it either.<br /><br />The bad news:  Both of my dogs couldn't handle the protein, even though they got only 1/4 cup of it a day.  (The rest of their meals are raw turkey necks and veggies, and their stomachs handle those meals just fine.)  This kibble would give them liquid poo, I kid you not.  To finish up the rest of the bag I had to do a 50/50 mix with a 34% protein grain free dog food by another brand, and that worked fine, no runny poo problems then.  So, I'll be sticking with the 34% protein kibble from now on, although I might buy small bags of this Evo Turkey & Chicken small bites to blend into the lower protein kibble again, just to give the furry kids a taste of something different.

review/summary: Excellent diet for any dog -- no cheap stuff here
review/text: I've been feeding my dogs EVO for 4 years and will never change... until my dogs become seniors and need the senior food.  My American Eskimo used to be on the cheap food and her health was poor.  She shedded a lot, had horrible breath, and not very energetic.  Since she's been on EVO, she has been more active, sheds lest, and I have to say her poop is much less than before.  Every vet she's been to has been very impressed with her age (she's going on 9 years old) and health and when they ask what food she's on, they're very pleased.<br /><br />Of course, we do get picked on because we spend more than 40 bucks a bag on dogfood versus the $15 many owners like to spend for crappy quality.<br /><br />I love this dogfood and did a ton of research before I initially chose it.  I am very happy with it.

review/summary: My pet's food of choice
review/text: I used to feed my dog the usual dry food from the store. He barely used to eat and when he did it was very reluctantly. I decided that something had to change and about a year ago switched to Innova. I haven't looked back since. My 2 year old aussie husky<br />just loves this thing. He is healthier, happier and has a softer coat.<br /><br />The only snag is that I never buy this from Amazon. I am a prime member and just don't believe in paying close to $20 for shipping. Once this gets on Amazon prime, I will always buy from Amazon. Until then, its a better deal for me to drive to a distributor near my house and then buy it.

review/summary: I'd give this food 10 stars if I could
review/text: I adopted a prison program dog Nov 22, 2006.  She is a Lab/Poodle mix. (we won't go there with "Labradoodle") When I got her, she was 7 1/2 months old and was considered a light eater.  She weighed 37 LB.  I took her to the vet in December, 2006 to get the rest of her puppy shots and a micro chip and she had already gained about 6 LB.  As an adult dog, she is right around 61-62 LB.  She is lean, muscular and quite athletic.  I put her on Innova EVO as soon as I adopted her and learned that "light eater" must translate to: she eats with the lights on.  For a dog her age and size, she eats around 2 cups a day (1 cup for breakfast and another for dinner).  The food might appear to "cost more" but you feed less because there isn't a bunch of toxic filler in it to make the dog hungry.  Ever notice how junk food is yummy but it doesn't fill you up quite like a nutritious meal?  You can equate that to dog food.  Most commercial brands have their main ingredient as "corn" and it goes downhill from there.  Seriously...when have you seen a pack of carnivores attack a field of corn when they got hungry?  This is what dog food is supposed to be...grain free and based on a RAW diet, exactly like the way their ancestral wolves dined.  Also...because the dog is eating less quantity and digesting more of its food...you'll have less waste in the yard.

review/summary: Best kibble money can buy!
review/text: Finally, a dog food our dog will eat AND it's good for him, too!  No grain, which is helpful during these times of "tainted pet food" in the news each day.  Our dog is very picky when it comes to food or treats, but he loves his EVO (and we love feeding it to him because we know it's good for him).<br /><br />Our dog was a "rescue" dog and he was very malnourished when we got him.  We tried a few different dog foods, but he was not interested.  A local pet shop recommended the Innova line of products & our baby has been doing great ever since -- he has even put on a few healthy pounds!  This stuff is the best & I would recommend it to anyone & everyone, especially if you have had trouble getting your dog to eat dry food in the past.

review/summary: Best dog food I've ever tried
review/text: I've been feeding my three cocker spaniels evo turkey for about five years. I wouldn't trade for anything.  Their fur is so soft. They rarely have diarrhea or loose stools.  I used to be like the average dog owner buying grocery store brands.  The dogs, especially one scratched all the time.  Loose stools,  mucous bloody stools were the norm.  The vet thought the itchy dog was allergic to house molds. And the other dog was thought to have severe Autoimmune colitis.  Evo  cured them.  No more expensive vet visits.

review/summary: 4 paws up from my 2 dogs
review/text: I got this item surprisingly fast. My two dogs, a Morkie and a Chihuahua, absolutely love this food. So much so, it is hard to keep up with buying the smaller bags. They used to hate dog food. My morkie hates dog food that is round shaped and big. This is just the right size and shape for him. Their coat is so much shinier and healthier.<br /><br />The protein content is higher than most other dog foods but it fills my dogs up quicker with less dog food. I do not think the protein is an issue unless a dog is overfed the food. Go with the recommended serving for your dog's weight. Do not skip out on using a cup measure and set meal times so you know how much is eaten. Scheduled meal times are better for potty training too. Great deal for the price. This nearly 30 lb bag is much more economical than buying the smaller ones. It is not available in most pet supply stores like petco and petsmart.<br /><br />I wish amazon sold it directly so it would be eligible for super saving shipping. Other than that, great!

review/text: I have to say I love EVO-- my yorkie use to poop 3-5 times a day-- he is a small dog so you would think he wouldn't poop that much. I wasn't overfeeding him, that is for sure..  My dog trainer recommended EVO-- I resisted because of the added cost but my husband kept telling me to buy it. I finally gave in to keep peace in the family and I swear within days my dog stopped pooping as much-- now we are down to about 2 times a day sometimes 3.  It's a great product and my dog really loves the food-- I would recommend it -

review/summary: Fabulous food for sensitive tummies
review/text: I started my dogs on this when Canidae switched their ingredient profile and we discovered that my Boston Terrier had severe allergies to Barley and allergies to a variety of other grains.  She had had a 'sensitive' stomach since I brought her home 6 months prior as an adult rescue, with runny stools, gas and such, it turned out she actually had a milder food allergy to rice as well.  After trialing 5 other dog foods with no success, she has had no issues since starting her on Evo!  Stools are normal, no more gas, her coat has gotten even shinier, her energy level increased, and she's just a happier dog.  Since she's a 'food stealer', I started my Miniature Pinscher on it as well, he, always a picky eater and thin, cleans his bowl now and wants more!  He competes in agility and since the food switch, I now do not have a problem keeping his weight on, wheras before I was always trying to stuff him with higher fat foods.  Though it is on the expensive side, it's nothing compared to the vet bills I accumulated as a result of the food allergies!  I'll spend more $ on their food to avoid the issues I had before and have a happier, healthier dog.

review/summary: Too high protein - Kidney problems
review/text: Fed my Great Dane+Rottweiler mix dog this food for 1 year. During that time, she would eat grass all the time, fart a lot, be hungry all the time, beg a lot, poop a lot and have diahorrea occasionally. My dog is a very high energy dog that plays fetch everyday for an hour and a walk for an hour. She started urinating in the house involuntarily and I took her to the vet. Vet said the protein levels are too high in the blood, kidneys are under a lot of pressure and asked me to stop feeding this food. My rationale: If 42% protein in this food is not for a high energy and athletic dog like mine, then what kind of a dog is this suitable for! Although the ingredients are good, protein levels are too high for any dog and most of it is not digestible. So this food is not good. Reviews from people who fed their dogs this food for more than 8 months have not been good. So please use the brain cells you got and analyse and stay away from this food.

review/summary: Acute renal failure in 3 year old dog after 3 months on EVO!  Protein WAY too high at 40% I thought I was giving him the best...
review/text: About 3 months ago I researched all the different foods and finally decided to purchase EVO because I thought it was what was best for my dog.  He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now.<br />UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.  No other underlying condition was found and my vet feels that the extremely high protein content in EVO is what shut his kidneys down.  RIP Ollie... :-(

review/summary: German Shepherd with intermittent diarrhea CURED!
review/text: My adopted German Shepherd is absolutely gorgeous, sweet and smart - but came to our house from the shelter with a VERY sensitive digestive tract.  Recently, she had a very, long-lasting bout of diarrhea and I had a few days worth of Pro-Pectalin from the vet - but she still wasn't completely recovered.  So, I went to our local alternative pet food store and they told me about this product.  This stuff is amazing!  You only need a little bit (even for a 69 lb dog) and it worked better than the stuff from the vet the first time I gave it to her.  It's a green powder and doesn't look like something a dog would eat, but once you mix it in the food with a little water or chicken broth - she gobbled it right up.  I think the slippery elm in it soothes the irritated intestines.  Anyway, it works great.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great Oatmeal
review/text: This stuff is great. My family can not tell the difference between this, McCainns and Honeyville Farms. All three taste great. 10 pounds will fill a coffee can sized container and a gallon bag.<br /><br />Bring 3.5 cups water plus pinch of salt in pan to rolling boil. Before you go to bed, add 1 cups oat groats plus two rounded tablespoons pecan meal to the water. Stir. Turn off the burner / remove from heat when it almost foams to the edge. Cover and lit sit on the stove overnight. In the morning, heat individual bowls in the microwave. I add a bit of milk and one tablespoon brown sugar. We prefer our oatmeal thicker than standard porridge and this is more than enough for 4. The thickest I have made it is 3.5 cups water to 1.25 cups oat groats.<br /><br />The pecan meal adds nutty flavor. You can make meal using your blender to process nuts.

review/summary: Made My Daughter's Birthday Fantastic!
review/text: My daughter is an ice cream lover. So, decided to make ice creams for her birthday party. We have made sherbets many times, but never done ice cream before. Purchased this mix and made ice creams with all five flavors. The whole experience of ice cream making with my daughter was hilarious. She really enjoyed making ice cream and we had "Delight" time while ice creams were brewing in the ice cream maker. The taste was rich and flavorful. The texture was softly dense. Among the five flavors, Mocha Coffee was the best treat to my taste buds and my daughter loved Belgium Chocolate the most. We prepared a variety of toppings- freshly sliced strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, some nuts, chocolate & Oreo chips and sprinkles for the home-made ice creams on the party day. Our topping collection was better than local Froyo store.^^ The party was a big success!! Especially, kids loved the ice creams with the toppings. This is our new dessert for my daughter's B-day & summer party from now on.<br /><br />Pros: All Natural or Organic, Cute Packaging Design, Easy to Prepare, Premium quality, Various flavors,<br />Cons: Strawberry has sour taste a bit stronger than other company's strawberry product, but more sugar made the taste more sweet than sour.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I ordered this because I could no longer find black walnut flavoring in my area. This tastes just like the flavor I remember from years ago. I had tried another brand and it did not taste even near the black walnut flavor! I will definitely order from here again! I had very fast service and the product was very well packaged!Thanks sooo much!

review/summary: Finally, I have found my black walnut flavoring!
review/text: McCormick discontinued their black walnut flavoring years ago, to my and my mother and my grandmother's dismay.  Was please to find this product.  It is good quality, and there is so much of it that it will take me 20 years to use it all, even with giving a good portion to my grandmother so she can continue to bake her mother's black walnut oatmeal cookies.

review/summary: Teriyaki Sprouted Sunflower Seeds
review/text: The teriyaki flavor was too strong for my taste. I ended up giving them to someone. I had several people try them until I found one person who actually liked them and would eat them. I like the idea behind the product and will probably try the other flavors.

review/summary: Raw, Organic and Addictive!
review/text: t's always a good idea to have some healthy raw snacks on hand and though I love bars, it's nice to have variety.  Kaia Foods offers just that, a variety.  I'm totally hooked on their Teriyaki Sprouted Sunflower Seeds. They have the perfect blend of salty, sweet, savory and crunchy--YUM.  I've tried almost all of their flavors and snacks and like everything I've tried but those sunflower seeds...they are so satisfying!<br /><br />These would be awesome on the plane, and to just keep on hand for those times you want a snack and don't have time to go through all the soaking and sprouting. Kaia donates a percentage of their profits to help end world hunger, nice company to support.

review/text: Chocolate chocolate chocolate!  And at the end of munching, a nice pail for whatever: pencils, paintbrushes, dried lotus blossoms, your choosing. The presentation is very nice stuffed with chocolates and I wouldn't hesitate to send another as a gift to a friend or business associate.

review/summary: Not the package shown
review/text: The product really was 24 Superballs.  However, they weren't the ones pictured.  The new version of Superball is smaller and doesn't bounce as well as even the previous iteration.  These are fine if you need a moderate-bounce ball that doesn't translate spin into directional energy with much efficiency.  Excellent seller; too bad the product changed.
