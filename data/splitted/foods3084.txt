review/summary: Run for your LIFE!
review/text: I'd been looking for an apple preserve and Harvest Song seemed to fit the bill. They've got a wonderfully idyllic print marketing campaign so I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />As it turns out, the aluminum lid on the jar has no protective liner. My first 1/8 of a teaspoon was filled with metal! The acid in the jam had corroded the interior of the lid, producing scratch marks that looked like someone scratched it with the tines of a fork.<br /><br />I'm calling Amazon to see if they'll refund on defective food. Really people... run for your lives.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I felt a little sick from this product but it cleared up in about 12 hours. When I felt better I called Amazon (through the Contact Us link near the bottom of the page) and received a full refund. Thanks for the great customer service Amazon.

review/summary: really helped my lawn
review/text: this really works. I have a 100+lbs dog & his urine kills the grass. Now after using this product there are less patches in my grass. Just rake up the dead grass & re-seed or there will be a patch of weeds. I also started him slowly on the treats because I did not want to upset his stomach & I wanted his body to get used to them. So I did one a day for a week, then two a day and so on. Also, keep using this product through the winter or the urine will go through to snow & defeat the purpose. I cut down his dosage in the winter because of the snow & rain. His urine will be diluted a bit.<br />Also these smell really bad but my dog loves them.

review/summary: Love these! Yummy!
review/text: My son is allergic to corn so no corn syrup. It is surprisingly difficult to find candy made with sugar! I bought these to decorate our Christmas tree so that he could enjoy them. We all loved them. There is something more pure about the taste. I had another regular corn syrup candy cane and it had a funny after taste to me.  The only negative comment I heard from my kids was that the color wasn't as vibrant as "regular" candy canes. Didn't stop them from eating the 6 boxes we had on the tree! Highly recommend!

review/text: These are the same brand that they sell in Whole Foods - and if you do the subscribe and save, you definitely save a lot! I love these candy canes because they taste natural, are not overpowering, and do not leave that nasty aftertaste like the artificial ones.  Plus, for all you all-natural folks out there, these fit the bill. Oh, and they are also gluten-free and vegan.

review/summary: Better than Jelly Belly!!!!
review/text: I was skeptic about this purchase because I had bought 3lbs of the Jelly Belly Cotton Candy jelly beans and needed to make up the difference to fill up a cylinder vase for a candy buffet.  Not only is Gimbal better tasting than Jelly Belly, they are actually  less expensive! The jelly bean exploded with flavor and color versus the Jelly Belly brand.  The jelly  beans were nicely packed in two separate 5lbs, seal-tight bags that had me jumping with joy with the freshness and quality of the candy!  I would absolutely buy from Gimbal again, and never think twice about Jelly Belly.

review/text: Planters Five Alarm Chili Peanuts are some of the best Ive ever had.  Planters Peanuts products are some of the best in general, and they did not disappoint with these.  Most other hot peanuts leave you asking "Wheres the heat?"  These at least give some vague representation of heat, though I wouldn't call them hot.  Thats saying something, since Habaneros aren't very hot to me.  The flavor is great, so if your looking for a little heat and good flavor, give these a try.  You likely will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Purest form, oh nose not a sneeze !
review/text: If you don't have a grinder and white pepper seeds laying around, no problem if your local dollar store, grocery and probably a health foods place will feature this ground white pepper powder in its purest form. A clear plastic bottle that is recyclable (yey !) features a label with upc barcode, classification number, address of distributor, and one single ingredient: white finely pulverized ground pepper !<br /><br />The net weight, 2ounces or 56.7grams will yield three months worth of use depending on how fiery hot you want your food and how often. It lasts around this household nearly five months and stays dry because of the location in the kitchen: near window but out of direct sunlight or heat from stove. It is a durable spice, plays nice with others, that is the simple condiment with a very pungent odor that causes me to sneeze. Thats proof for me and since the color is what you'd expect: pale tan, I am proud to say this product is dye-free, safe, natural and in its purest form !<br /><br />Can be enjoyed on poultry, beef, pasta, vegetables especially eggplant and gourds because this being so intense, soups and casseroles get kicked up to the next level of yum ! Oh and it is rather inexpensive ranging from .50c to $2.oo separately purchased.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and<br /><br />Enjoy !

review/summary: This is definitely a cereal that will agree with the palate of everyone in the family from your toddler to grandma!
review/text: To be honest with you, I got tired of eating the same old "wholesome" breakfast diet I've been eating forever and decided to spring for Annie's Cocoa & Vanilla bunnies for a change of pace.  Oatmeal is nice, but  . . .  you know how bland that can get.  I ended up loving the candy taste without the calories, excess sugar, or unknown additives found in some cereals.  This is definitely a cereal that will agree with the palate of everyone in the family from your toddler to grandma.  Your youngster will like the bunny shapes and you can bring this cereal along as a snack for your toddler when you go out.<br /><br />For me the ingredients were the key.  Personally, I was interested in the fact that it was low fat and "totally natural." Others may be looking for something else altogether.  One cautionary note listed is that it is "made on shared equipment that also processes milk, soy, tree nuts, and wheat."  Here's the scoop on this tasty cereal:<br /><br />* Made with Whole Oats<br /><br />* Low Fat<br /><br />* 0g Trans Fat & 0g Saturated Fat<br /><br />* No Cholesterol<br /><br />* Vegan<br /><br />* Grown & Processed without GMOs<br /><br />Nutritional Facts (abbreviated)<br />Serving Size 3/4 cup (30g)<br />8 Servings Per Container<br /><br />Calories ......................................... 120<br />Calories from Fat ..........................  5<br /><br />Total Fat 0.5g ................................  0%<br />Saturated Fat 0g .............................  0%<br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg .............................  0%<br />Sodium 180mg ...............................  8%<br />Total Carb, 26g ...............................  9%<br />Dietary Fiber 1g ..............................  4%<br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 2g<br /><br />Naturally, this cereal will not be suited for everyone, but I liked enough things about it to try it.  I will be buying it again when I need a break from the oatmeal. As much as I like this cereal, it's probably going to be a long break!

review/summary: Great cereal, perfect amount of sweet
review/text: This is cereal is really good. It's not as sweet as something like Coco Puffs but still sweet enough. The chocolate flavor is much more natural tasting than other cereals. It holds up well in milk but tastes great dry too. I have been trying to cut back on cookies, candy, etc and this cereal makes a great alternative. The best part is no high fructose corn syrup or artificial colors! If you have kids who are always begging for sweet cereals this would be a very good compromise. I was worried about ordering 4 boxes at once but the cereal arrived very fresh and the expiration date is well over a year from now.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I confess my kids eat cold cereal for breakfast...everyday. After years of trying to get them to eat something else, something "healthier" I have thrown in the towel. Sugar is sugar, whatever form it comes in but I think if you deprive your kids they will just overload on it later. I bought this cereal as a compromise and it worked. It is perfect. Just the right balance of chocolate and vanilla. It is sweet but not enough that my kids are bouncing off the walls. The milk leftover is still milk with a hint of chocolate not a "bonus" cup of chocolate milk. My only complaint? I wish the box was bigger. With 4 kids we go through almost a box a day.

review/summary: I like them, but subtle taste not for sugar lovers.
review/text: Bulk subscribe & save is the way to go for these, but before you get four boxes you might want to consider the following.<br /><br />Pros<br />-I enjoy the subtle chocolate flavor. They have the vanilla bunnies heavily outweigh the chocolate due to the strong flavor of cocoa, and I think they got the balance pretty well.<br />-Much healthier than traditional sugar cereals, but still satisfies my sweet tooth early in the morning. (I do not drink caffeine, so sugar is my wake-up)<br />-I am a fan of Annie's products across the board, so I feel safe getting any of their products even before I try them first.<br /><br />Cons<br />-The sweet flavor only lasts for the first mouthful or so. After that, your taste buds will quickly acclimate. I am sure this will differ with people, however. Our taste buds are pretty overwhelmed much of the time, and subtle flavors can be easily lost. So...this might not be a con of the cereal as much as it is a con against my own desire for sugar. I have been slowly adopting my palette to healthier foods over the past 15 years, so I feel like I am better than most, but... For reference to try to gauge my palette, I have been a pesco, lacto-ovo vegetarian since 1997. I do not eat fast food. I do not drink soda. I water down my fruit juices 50%. I also now watch labels much more carefully for processed ingredients and try to avoid high fructose corn syrup.<br />-Cost. Even bulk subscribe & save only goes so far. Better than the alternatives, though.<br /><br />In the end, I only gave them four stars because I just can't get myself to rank five when I don't "love" them. They are very satisfactory, and I will continue to buy them, but they just aren't five. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would.

review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/summary: As a person who has never really liked tea
review/text: this is my drink of choice.  I'm addicted.  I drink 3-4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good.  I've tried other chai-spice teas; none of them compare.  The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it, raising the prices.  You should try it, it's good.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!

This is a very smooth tea and will never produce a bitter taste.  It is like liquid pumpkin pie with real whipped cream.  A major part to my mouth and serenity to my senses.  I HIGHLY recommend.

review/summary: Stash Brand Earl Grey Tea
review/text: To my taste, the Stash brand of Earl Grey Black Tea (in tea bags) is the best I have found. After trying Twinings, Bigelow and a few others, I discovered Stash and found it to have a fresher, cleaner taste with a more pronounced bergamot fragrance. It costs slightly more than the others but seems well worth it to me. Also, buying it in quantity through Amazon brings the cost down significantly as compared to local grocery chains.

review/summary: stash peach
review/text: I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say "wow what smells so delicious?". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!

review/summary: Earl Grey of Earl Grey +++
review/text: I already liked regular Stash Earl Grey and so dared to try this doubled bergamot variant. This Earl Grey variant is the best I have tried out of many. There may be ones stronger in both aspects of the black tea and bergamot or more balanced -- but I only know that this "Double Bergamot Earl Grey" is a very balanced rich black tea with bergamot -- and it is organic like other Stash teas. This doubled bergamot Earl Grey is great hot with milk and brown sugar -- or icy with just a tad lemon or lime to add to the bergamot -- or without such additions. Also it is so rich someone can add it to other plain, even modest, black tea [bags one-for-one] for a more mellow bergamot tea. I even found it interesting with black mint tea [bags one-for-one] as this variant is not overwhelmed by other teas +++

review/summary: A Favorite Morning Beverage
review/text: I was introduced to Stash a few years ago when I sampled their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG89Y">peppermint tea</a>, which was so powerful you could smell it through the packaging. It was so delicious I decided to get a box of each of their tea samplers, including black.<br /><br />Now I have another Stash favorite. After running out while on vacation I had to try a number of different Earl Grey teas (Bigelow, Twinings, Generic Grocery Store brand), and though adequate, they lacked the extra bergamot kick I'd grown to love. With Stash you get a fragrant, excellent quality tea, and they know how to package it for freshness.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite morning hot drinks when I want to start my day with a nice jolt. And if you have a sweet tooth like me, serve hot with sweetened condensed milk.

I can't tolerate so much as the scent of coffee, and I never was a morning Mountain Dew person, but this gets me moving in the AM.  I've cut back in that I don't brew two bags in a mug for 20 minutes at a time like I did a decade ago with Earl Grey.<br /><br />Super Target used to carry it around here, D/FW, but I think I may have singlehandedly cleaned them out over the course of the past year.<br /><br />The great thing about Amazon is, not only can I buy six+ months worth at once but there is no tax & free shipping.  Between those extras and not having to go anywhere to purchase it, it costs well below what it does at the store.

review/summary: Tasty Tea
review/text: I used to spend a fortune on good Chai Tea at the coffee shop.  Then, I discovered the double-spice tea.  We both loved the stronger flavor of the spices.  To my dismay, on my next trip to the grocery store, the double-spice tea was nowhere to be found!  It was one of those items that apparently wasn't on their regular ordering schedule.  I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!  This tea is great with a "sweetener of choice" (I generally use stevia or agave in mine) and some milk or cream, hot or cold.  My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his "pre-sleep" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a "foil" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!  It IS black tea and contains caffeine!  If this is a problem, try the Good Earth Original Caffeine-Free tea.  Also available on Amazaon, it is a delicious, slightly sweet, cinnamon-y tea!

The Double Bergamot added to the Earl Gray is even more superior!  Bergamot is also relaxing.  This is a wonderful blend and very difficult to find in stores.

review/text: What can get me out of a cat-warmed bed on a chilly morning?  A pot of Stash Double Spice Chai tea.  The spices are enticing and warm up you up down to your toes.  I find the best way to drink it is with a splash of vanilla soy milk in the bottom of the mug, then pour in the tea.  The vanilla soy adds just enough sweetness to counteract the bitterness of the tea (I like to brew it strong), but not so sweet that it overpowers the spices.  Yum!

review/text: Stash 'double bergamot' Earl Grey tea absolutely is the best Earl Grey I've found, and I've tasted quite a few of them both here in the US, and while traveling in Europe.  The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.  I highly recommend both, and if you are curious like I was, treat yourself to one or both of these, and you will probably never want to purchase any other brand.<br /><br />I'm not sure the reason, but the other brands I've tried just do not taste as good.  Whatever Stash is doing with this tea recipe, it works.

This is a winner among Earl Grey teas.  No one does it better than Stash.<br />I'm tempted to try their Chai Spice Tea.  Celestial Seasonings Vanilla Honey is my favorite.  If Stash makes it better I'm in heaven.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Didn't find a big difference between the Double and Premium Earl Grey.  Still love them.  Tried their Chai Spice--OK, but still love Celest. Seas. better.

review/summary: Revitalizing
review/text: Although I have sampled numerous Earl Grey teas, I always come back to Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea. I agree that it is not for the faint-hearted or those with a hypersensitive palate. Unlike teas such as jasmine green tea or chamomile which are soothing and relaxing, this tea is revitalizing and vivifying. So, if you want a bold and full flavored tea experience, this is the perfect tea for you.

review/summary: Unique Earl Grey
review/text: I've tried a variety of Earl Grey blends, and this one wins the prize for being the most unique. The citrus flavor is noticeably different from other Earl Greys. The box says that in addition to bergamont, other citrus flavors have been added. Personally, I taste a touch of grapefruit in the mix, which makes this tea a bit more lively than your typical blend. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my goto is Bigelow's. I find Twinings to be too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I am so glad that Amazon sells this tea as it is very difficult to find. This is the best Earl Grey because of the double Bergamot and we prefer it over any other Earl Grey. This is a full bodied, very flavorful tea and some dishwater blend. I hope Amazon will continue to carry it.

review/summary: The Best Earl Grey Tea Ever
review/text: I have been a long time drinker of Earl Grey Tea. No, not just because Captain Picard drank it (ok maybe a little) but because I drank coffee for years. Anyway, Earl Grey lovers will really like this tea... the citrus "bergamot" flavor is doubled - as the label states.<br /><br />This tea is strong enough (black tea) to wake you up in the morning yet a perfect tea for the evening if you so want.<br /><br />Not recommended for those of you who like a weaker tasting tea. Earl Grey fans - don't wait, get this now!

review/text: Stash's Peach Black Tea has the perfect balance of peach and strong black tea flavor for a very refreshing summer drink.  I usually use one or two peach tea bags along with 2 family sized black tea bags of the grocery store variety.  This makes 2 quarts of great iced tea, with just a hint of peach.  When I want something special I will use only the peach black tea and serve with a slice of peach.  Summer is coming so I just stocked up!

review/text: I love this tea. I love the smooth feel of the individually sealed envelopes, I love the red of the box, I love the fragrance as it steeps, and I REALLY love the taste. It is just amazingly good, definitely worth the stained teeth.<br /><br />Occasionally I will warm up some milk in my mug (filled about halfway, I'd say) and let the teabag steep while the water is getting hot. Once I take the teabag out I just add some sugar and am ready to go.<br /><br />If you love tea, if you love gently but wonderfully spiced foods - try this. I am very glad that I found it.

review/summary: Delicious Spiced Tea (Chai)
review/text: Compared to other bagged teas, this is delicious and highly aromatic blend of chai.<br /><br />Right from the opening you will smell the wonderful cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg notes.<br /><br />Although I enjoy it all alone, this probably tastes just as good with milk/sugar but I haven't had to use them to enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Once this cools down a bit, the flavors are more distinct and mellow to my taste.<br /><br />I try not to go past 2.5 minutes while brewing and so far this is working for me. I haven't had any issues with bitterness, etc.<br /><br />Go ahead and play around with brewing length since it can vary based on water temperature and quality.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant since I've already tried the Jasmine Blossom Green tea from Stash, but this was surprisingly good and is a refreshing alternative to other teas.<br /><br />Give this a shot, you might love it!<br /><br />* * * * * 5 / 5 * * * * *

review/summary: Not fond of smell or taste
review/text: I purchased 3 different flavors of Stash tea when it was on sale at Sprouts after seeing the great reviews on Amazon.  I must say, Stash makes mediocre tea.  There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses.  Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey.  I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash.  Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel).  Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing.

review/text: Not familiar with what "chai" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.

review/summary: You Really Should Try this if You Like Chai!
review/text: I happen to love chai tea, but am not fond of some of the ingredients that are in some store products.  This is by far the best chai I have found.  It is much stronger than you would think, so I actually make more than one serving at a time, and mix it with plain black tea (use your favorite; I know lots of teas, and use Assam -- a very strong black tea -- in combination).  You can drink it with or without milk and sweetening, but remember that most chai teas you buy in tea and coffee shops have both milk and sweetening in them.  It can be served either hot or chilled.<br />The price is excellent, and I can get it in quantity so I don't (Heaven forbid!) run out.  If the taste is a little TOO strong for you, they also have the chai spiced black tea in the Stash brand, which has fewer non-tea additives.<br />I even have friends who "don't care for tea" who have gotten hooked on this stuff, so it must be pretty good!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQC064">Stash Premium Double Spice Chai Black Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I bought this because I thought it actually had organic ingredients- as the description stated.  It does not.  It's quite good Chai tea, but I'd rather drink organic Allegro chai tea (available at Whole Foods for close to this price) than buy this stuff.  The good news is that unlike some teas on Amazon, this one is very fresh and has a good sell-by date.  I ordered it only a few weeks ago, and it is good until 11/2012.  So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.  I really like Allegro chai- it tastes more balanced to me, and I was hoping the Stash would be like that, but it's not.

There is a subtle difference between the two and it's a personal thing with me, but I do hope the Lipton has not been discontinued.  If so, I will certainly buy this again.  I would also compare this to Constant Comment (Bigelow).  If you've tasted and enjoyed that brand, you will like this one.  All in all, a very good product!

review/text: I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this!

review/text: This is one of the best chai blends available on grocery store shelves, a perfect  cominbation of spicy clove, cardamom, and other spices with just the right amount of cinammon for sweetening. The refreshing aroma wafting from my cup is so delightful that it's almost a shame to drink it; I really could just sit there inhaling the vapors. My preferred brewing method is to steep for about 5 minutes, then add a touch of honey. The only thing that could make this tea better is a hint of vanilla, although you could add some of your own if you were so inclined. Of all the teas I've tried, this one is my second favorite, eclipsed only by Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai (which does have that natural vanilla flavoring).
