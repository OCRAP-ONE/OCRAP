review/summary: Too Dry and Powdery
review/text: These nuts while supposedly delectably chocolate came across too dry and powdery for me to appreciate the dark rich smell and taste of the chocolate.  A big fan of almonds, pralines, and almost anything nutty mixed with chocolate flavors, the powdery after taste kept me from wanting to eat more.<br /><br />Not really interested in the health benefits of the product. So that may have askewed my opinion since all appeal for them was lost when I didn't enjoy the taste or texture.

review/text: Great almond and chocolate taste without the salt and added fat from the usual chocolate coating that you find.  These are both gourmet and healthy e.g., 25 mg sodium is 9 times less than the 230 mg sodium in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4AIC">Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Almonds, 11-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a>.  I prefer these to the Dry Roasted flavor.  If you are a true dilettante they make a perfect desert together with a couple of squares of the delicious <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUFGYG">Sorbee Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bars, 2.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/text: These Cocoa Roast almonds combine both the great taste of chocolate and the high protein fat burning elements found in almonds. Remember, these almonds are flavored with natural dark chocolate which is an anti-oxidant. All in all, I don't think you can find a healthier snack. They're great! I will say that a four pack is not nearly enough if you have a family. The kids love them as well and tend to eat them like popcorn. One word - "YUM!"

The subtle chocolate flavor is wonderful.  The chocolate is roasted onto the almonds and is dry to the touch.  Can't melt and create a mess as milk chocolate does.  A box of 4 canisters didn't last as long as I thought they would.  Amazon has apparently has sold out!  Arghhh!  Do me a favor and buy 300 calorie chocolate bars and leave more of these for me!

review/text: I love these because they're not coated with sugar and dairy - just plain old dark cocoa powder.

review/text: I found these nuts to be a tad bland.  The chocolate was not very flavorful and did nothing to enhance the experience.  It seemed like two flavors that did not blend.  These seemed a halfway measure of dipping in chocolate and eating the almonds straight.  I would prefer either of those ways to these.  I was left with the impression of diet food - not quite what you really want, but a poor substitution.

review/summary: Not My Favorite Snack, To Be Sure
review/text: I love almonds and eat many different varieties for snacks. These Cocoa Roast Almonds from Emerald *sounded* terrific, so I ordered them right away. The first two or three tasted pretty good, though not as good as I had expected, but soon after, the cocoa left a really unpleasant, bitter aftertaste that I could've gone all day without experiencing. I'm not sure what it is because, on paper, these should be great, but in execution ... they're just not.

review/summary: Cocoa powder coated almonds.  Subtle, crunchy, delicious.
review/text: I think what I had in mind when we opened the canister was either the soft chocolate layer you might find in Raisinets, or the layer covered by a shell in M&Ms.  Instead, we found almonds that had just been powder coated in a fine layer of cocoa.  We found this a positive, in the sense that we could see the size and quality of the nuts, and that they took the center stage, with the cocoa as a subtle backdrop.<br /><br />I am not a chocolate fan, but loved these.  The cocoa is a secondary taste layer that doesn't build cumulatively the more of these you eat.  The end result is a terrific almond snacking option, with enough variation from other approaches to keep your taste buds thinking.  The almonds are crisp and of high quality.  Emerald has done a fantastic job of selecting premium quality, enough so that even Alton Brown might consider going back on his rule of only buying nuts in clear containers that you can see.<br /><br />With reasonable evidence to suggest that almonds represent some measure of improvement to cholesterol health, we can even toss a few of these back relatively guilt-free.  Will be buying again.

review/text: Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are quite tasty, but be advised that the description is accurate: They carry no more than a hint of cocoa flavor. If you're looking for rich chocolate flavor, you may need to go to a candy store. However, they make a nice, light, and somewhat addictive snack, particularly if you're watching your calories, as there's only 150 per serving.

review/summary: A Decent Almond Snack, but It Pales to Marconas
review/text: These are good nuts, my whole family was impressed with them.  That is, until we picked up Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4).  It was amazing, we would give these to guests and everyone said these were pretty good. Then we'd give them some Marconas and their faces would light up and say, "The Cocoa almonds were good, but these are very good."<br /><br />The Cocoa nuts have a nice rich chocolate flavor and crisp nuttiness. All in all they were good, but they didn't hold a light to the Marcona nuts. Maybe Emerald should make cocoa marconas.<br /><br />Once the Marconas were gone, our six year old made fairly regular covert trips to the kitchen to grab one of these.  So they were hit with him, although since his mom horded the Marconas to herself, he didn't know what he was missing.<br /><br />Definitely was a five star product before Marconas.

review/text: When I got this, I was impressed with the sturdy, ergonomically-designed canister that fit easily in my handbag. On quick glance when ordering, I thought I ordered chocolate-covered almonds. So on first bite, they disappointed just a little. But once I realized they what they were, I thought they were quite good for a healthy snack.<br /><br />Then I was impressed with how fresh tasting these almonds were. Snacking on them, I didn't get any sugar high and didn't feel guilty about some overly sweet chocolate indulgence. My children and husband ate them happily as snacks, seeing the word 'chocolate' and just being happen to munch on them.<br /><br />If you're looking for a slightly sweet, nutritious, low-carb or low-sugar treat, then these should fit the bill perfectly. Good for on-the-go or at home.

review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed these almonds.  They were not sweet, so I could really taste the chocolate.  The best way to describe it is almonds lightly dusted with high quality bakers chocolate powder, but not as bitter as that would be.<br /><br />This is NOT a typical "chocolate covered" nut product.  The dusting of chocolate is very light.  If you're expecting a lot of sweet chocolate with a little nut inside you will be disappointed.  However, I have to say that this product is exactly what I've been looking for; a reasonable healthy source of both almonds and chocolate.

review/text: These are chocolate dusted, not 'coated', hence they are a bit drier than I would have liked. I have noticed that other people like these, most particularly my Filipino relatives. The taste is good - it's the consistency of the almond that didn't appeal to me. They are a bit tougher than what I am used to, therefore they are a bit hard to snack on. However, if you are intent on loosing weight this would appear to be the combination for you. They are not extremely salty, which makes for nice, trim ankles, and the chocolate is of the kind that does not contribute to FAT (which I have too much of thank you very much). So they are worth a try :)

review/text: If you expect these to taste like chocolate covered almonds, you will be disappointed. However, if you want a tasty snack with a subtle chocolate flavor, Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds might be just right.<br /><br />Nuts are one of my favorite snacks, although I usually eat raw almonds or pecans rather than roasted nuts. The dry roasting gives these almonds a nice toasty flavor and extra crunch, and the cocoa powder adds just a hint of chocolate. A small handful of almonds make a nice between-meals snack to take the edge off any hunger pangs.<br /><br />Do have a glass of water handy while eating these. The dry roasting and dusting of cocoa powder make them especially dry, and you will want something to drink with them.<br /><br />I liked these so much I have already bought more. I plan to keep a supply on hand for those mid-afternoon munchies. A handful of cocoa roast almonds make a more healthful snack than a candy bar or chips.

Not to mention that you avoid consuming the saturated fat present in regular chocolate covered almonds.<br /><br />I am hooked, and will keep consuming this product for as long as I can find it!

review/summary: The Perfect Topping for Summer Treats
review/text: Sure, anyone can have a bowl of ice cream or a plain-jane ice cream cone.  However, you can turn a good treat into a great treat by getting a little creative!  That is where these Cocoa Roast Almonds come into play -- they are the perfect "summertime topper treat"!<br /><br />Now I'm not like most people, and don't like eating nuts just "plain" -- I prefer them to be mixed in with something.  Now that summer is here ice cream and cool treats are the order of the day, and as I found out a bowl of vanilla ice cream with a scoop of these Cocoa Almonds is one of summer's finer pleasures!<br /><br />These almonds are absolutely delicious and just a tad bit on the salty side at times (or so I think), which makes them a good addition to other foods.  Have you ever tried a pecan pie with almonds on top?  How about cookies with almonds?  Brownies?  You don't know what you are missing!<br /><br />The convenient cannister lets you use and store these easily (another plus) since if you are using them for toppings you won't be going through the whole jar at once.  I found that even 3 weeks later they still retained their freshness and taste.<br /><br />So this summer indulge a little.. and let the creative person hiding inside you spice up those summer treats!

I do know that the bowl was empty before the night was over, and more than a few people wrote down the name to pick them up the next time they're at the supermarket (or trolling on Amazon.)<br /><br />An interesting, unusual take on an old favorite, I can't recommend them highly enough!

review/text: Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are most definitely a quality, worthwhile snack item for the almond lover. My main concern with this product is that these do not have much, if any, "cocoa" or "dark chocolate" flavor like they advertise. It's just a very light dusting of powder on each almond, and the taste really doesn't stand out. The almonds themselves are fine, and I've never had any real issues with any of Emerald's line of canned nuts. So if you're looking for a relatively healthy snack item, these would satisfy your cravings. Just don't expect a burst of chocolate flavor.

review/text: I liked how the almonds were dusted with chocolate and didn't have that plastic-like sheen of cheap chocolate that so many chocolate almonds have. These were true to their description with the cocoa roast. I loved them and based on how quickly they disappeared, so did everyone else.

review/summary: Thes things grow on you...
review/text: When I bit into my first chocolate covered almond I was a bit surprised. The baked in chocolate reminds me as if the nuts were dipped in Nestles chocolate powder. I wasn't' ready for that. I actually didn't really like the texture, and the taste wasn't that great... but I kept reaching back into the can for more. Now I really like them. The almonds are nice and fresh and the subtle chocolate taste just adds to the enjoyment. They are NOT chocolate covered in the traditional sense - if you want candy, these won't do. But for an interesting snack, these will satisfy your chocolate cravings,as well as let you have a great snack without a lot of calories, get some cocoa roast almonds today!

review/summary: Double Your Pleasure
review/text: Remember that old Double Mint gum ad- double your pleasure, double your fun?<br />That is exactly what you get with Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds. The richness of the almonds, and the smooth taste of chocolate powder. Who'da thought to put these two together? A genius. One you start eating it is difficult to maintain control, but I did it.  I took the recommended amount for one serving and used this as my treat for the evening.<br /><br />These cocoa powdered almonds  will be a part of my diet from hence forth.<br />Highly recommended. prisrob 06-12-08

review/summary: Fantastic and healthy snack!
review/text: Almonds are a very healthy snack, but I have to admit that most almonds taste a little like cardboard to me. These, however, were a notable exception. The dusting of cocoa was a perfect complement to the taste of the almonds without being overwhelming or cloyingly sweet. In addition, the chocolate was about as healthy as chocolate can be with very little added fat or sugar.<br /><br />Yes, the chocolate taste is subtle, and if you are having a serious craving for chocolate you would be far better off with a chocolate bar. But, these nuts are healthier and better for you! I, personally, liked the combination. But, I suspect this is a matter of your personal likes and dislikes. I tend to like my almonds roasted, and my chocolate dark and with very little sugar, so for me the resulting flavor pairing was perfect. I have tried almonds with a heavier milk chocolate coating and I have never liked them, nor wanted to eat more than one or two. My family finished an entire 11 ounce canister in one sitting and I (I am embarrased to admit) could have finished the entire thing myself.<br /><br />Some of the almonds DID taste a little on the burnt side, but this is pretty typical of roasted almonds in general. The price, however, is rather high. By my estimate, these would run abour $7-8 a pound, which is rather steep for roasted almonds even when you add the cost of the chocolate. The price alone is what would keep me from buying them on a regular basis.

review/summary: Taste good, pretty healthy, but something is off
review/text: I think Emerald is a better brand than Planter and Diamond. They keep the nuts very fresh and have many different flavors. I buy Emrald's dry roasted almonds regularly. And no one seems to tire of it. I also buy the flavored ones when we have guests and always receive accolades.<br /><br />But the cocoa roast almonds are still left in the jar after 3 weeks. Initially everyone said it tasted good and it is very healthy with almost no sugar. But then no one wants to eat much of it afterwards. They went for the dry roast or the barbecue ones.

review/summary: Dry, Crunchy, Not Sweet, Not Bad
review/text: If you get this expecting dry roasted almonds--emphasis on dry, crunchy--rather than regular almonds, it is a fine snack in a casual group. A pleasant surprise was that although it is dusted with cocoa powder, they are really not sweet.. Although I personally found the after-taste not very appealing,,  I served them to ten other people. One didn't like them at all, but the others gave them either 4 or 5 stars--particularly enjoying the smallness, crispness and lack of sweetness.  I probably wouldn't get them again for myself, but defnitely could put a bowl out for guests, as a casual alternative to greasier and sweeter snack foods.

review/summary: Wonderful!!
review/text: I'm a big nut eater; I make my own peanut butter every couple of days, experimenting with a variety of nuts to combine with the main course, peanuts. Regular almonds are notoriously hard and can even be a little hard on the grinder. But not Emerald's Marcona Almonds.<br /><br />Emerald's cocoa nuts are just a tad harder, but still not as hard as almonds you get in bins or even packaged. The chocolate dusting is just the right amount to give you the cocoa flavor without losing the nut taste, as is the case with some coated versions.<br /><br />I'll probably not make peanut butter out of this flavor but as a healthy snack for the heart - eight to ten nuts a couple times a day - they are perfect.

review/summary: Tasty, if a little too sweet
review/text: The combination of cocoa and almonds is good, making this a tasty snack. Unfortunately, they felt compelled to make it sweeter, so they added sucralose, also known by the brand name Splenda. If you're trying to avoid this artificial sweetener, then don't get this snack. But if you want some cocoa almonds, these are pretty good.

review/text: These fantastic dry-roasted almonds offer up all the chocolate-y taste of dipped almonds, thanks to their generous dusting of cocoa powder, without any of the higher-fat guilt.  Nice crunch with a hint of salty-sweetness (or would that be sweet-saltiness?)  We recently served them at a dinner party and everybody couldn't stop talking about how great they were.

Even my wife who doesn't like chocolate likes these quite a bit.

review/summary: Great little snack
review/text: This product wasn't exactly what I thought it would be when I ordered it -- these are not "chocolate covered almonds," they are "cocoa powder dusted almonds."  Woe is me!  That said, I found that I enjoyed the more subtle flavor.<br /><br />Celiac and other allergy notes: Made with modified potato starch.  However, the product is processed on equipment that is also used to process wheat, soy, other types of nuts, and milk.<br /><br />A lot of thought went into product and packaging design.  This is a clean snack to eat, as the cocoa powder stays on the nut and doesn't get all over your hands.  The cannister is designed to fit in a car's drink holder (though at over 1500 calories per can, it's probably a REALLY bad idea to drive around with this so easily at hand), and the lid holds one serving's worth of nuts.  One serving is a satisfying little treat, but the tempation to keep filling the lid back up is nearly irresistible.

review/summary: Good On The Go Snack
review/text: Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds make a great on the go snack. I especially like the container as it fits nicely in the cup holder of my car and stroller. It makes a nice take-along snack during the day when running around and not having time for a meal always. The almonds have a hint of dark chocolate flavor. By the time you realize there's chocolate flavor, poof it's gone and you're onto the almond taste. For a person who enjoys almonds and the dark chocolate flavor is a bonus-this is still a nice snack. If you are purchasing this thinking it will be more dark chocolate and less almond, then you will likely be disappointed. I did not give 5-stars only because when I gave the almonds to my children who normally eat plain almonds and other nuts, they did not care for the dark chocolate roast. Hey what do kids know!

review/text: I am a lover of nuts in general and almonds in particular. My tastes are also strongly in favor of chocolate, so the combination is one that I like very much. Even better, the chocolate is in the form of very lightly sweetened cocoa powder. As someone who has a slight blood sugar problem, this feature is also one that I applaud. I received the package in the mail and by the end of the next day, I had consumed every nut. They are very good.

review/text: Almonds may be the healthiest nut there is.  Indeed, famed psychic Edgar Cayce stated that eating 5 almonds a day will prevent cancer.  So, eating them is a nice, healthy & tasty insurance policy--hard to beat.  Adding the  cocoa makes them far tastier too.  Not overly chocolatie, sweet without being cloying, they satisfy my sometime craving for a sweet.  They go well with some fruit (I tried fresh apricots)--but CAUTION, like a certain potato chip they're hard to stop eating.  I went through half the container before stopping.  I don't think they'll last too long on my shelf.  On the other hand, if you have a big sweet tooth (or maybe all of them are sweet--if you have any left after eating tons of chocolate), they may not be sweet or chocolatie enough for you.  They are for me.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Get Set for a Nutty Surprise
review/text: It occurred to me that sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. I didn't feel like a nut when I sat down to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, but my wife did and so we started undressing the beast.<br /><br />I undid the top of the plastic wrap, she unscrewed the cap, and then I finished the job by peeling off the airtight barrier that sealed the top of the container.<br /><br />And that's when it happened.<br /><br />My wife grabbed the first almond and popped it in her mouth. I could actually hear the crunch of her first bite. She's tough to please and especially cynical about packaged foods that try to appear "new and different."<br /><br />Her eyes lit up. "Whoa, this is good."<br /><br />I grabbed an almond. She was right.<br /><br />She reached for another, and then two or three more. I popped about five in my mouth and went for the full chew. Then she did the same.<br /><br />When we came up for air, we talked about how surprised we were. The almonds were dry roasted and really crunchy. We expected something closer to soggy, like almonds sometimes get. The cocoa coating gave just the slightest hint of dark chocolate, and the sweetness didn't come through until we ate more than one at a time.<br /><br />Maybe best of all was that there was no discernible salty taste.<br /><br />My wife said, "I think they have a winner here." I took another handful before I decided I agreed.<br /><br />In the end, it's just a nut. But, boy, what a nut.

review/text: This is a very tasty and very good snack.  I absolutely love these.  I am a fan of almonds anyway so it wasn't a stretch when you combine almonds with another one of my favorites, dark chocolate, and you have a winner.<br /><br />The almonds taste fresh and as always they are meaty and filling.  I can enjoy these at about 7 or 8 at a serving which seems to me to be about the serving size at � cup.<br /><br />Although these aren't unhealthy in the sense that there is a lot of junk added they certainly are not a weight loss tool.  At 150 calories per serving and 110 of that from fat you would be in serious trouble if this replaced baby carrots on your menu.<br /><br />All in all a very tasty treat.  I give it four stars instead of five only because of the high fat content even if it is healthier fats.

They're sort of the inverse of a chocolate bar with almonds: instead of a lot of chocolate and few almonds, you get a lot of almonds and a little chocolate flavor.

Also, and unlike conventional chocolate-covered nuts, these will not turn into a lumpy, gooey, mess if you leave them in the car this time of year.

I had no idea they made such a gourmet treat as these Cocoa Roast Almonds but I'm certainly glad they do.  I was wondering if the coating of cocoa powder could be inhaled and cause choking (I've choked on dry cocoa powder dusted on the top of other foods) but they've added some potato start to make the coating stay put.  The dry roasted almonds are of a nice size and quality and the flavor is very good.  I think maybe they could be a bit less sweet and more dark-chocolately but still they're good and once you start eating them it's hard to stop so beware there.  These go great with a glass of Yellow Tail Cabernet Sauvignon.

The chocolate is dry covering and baked into the almond. The dark choc doesn't up the calories or fat, infact it is lower than others.<br /><br />These are a great source of protein and fiber. The only warning I would give is to measure out a 1 serving size and put the container away or you may be in trouble, they are hard to stop once you get started.<br /><br />I plan on chopping some and sprinkling over fat free ice cream for a real treat without the guilt.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with these almonds, if you love dark chocolate or any chocolate for that matter give these a try.<br /><br />Amazon has the best deal on them also. Take these to the beach and on vacation this year instead of unhealthy chips and candy..they fill both cravings, sweet and salty.

The thin coating gives off an unknown, slightly muddy flavor that is not unpleasant, but if you're looking for a strong, true chocolate taste, skip these nuts.  (I think they would taste better without the coating.)<br /><br />There are 11 servings in a jar, each with 150 calories, and the lid measures one serving perfectly.

review/summary: Healthy chocolate snack.  Can it be?
review/text: This is a great little snack for those chocolate lovers who want something healthy and a little bonus for their sweet tooth.  The almonds are just lightly coated with cocoa powder. So, it's not the same as having a creamy candy bar. But, you can snack on these for the same amount of calories you'd get with a handful of almonds instead of having a big old fat candy bar.  And, you get all the nutrition of nuts and their good fats with only 1 gram of saturated fat per serving.<br /><br />I'm a chocaholic and true chocaholics don't like their chocolate overly sweet.  These have a hint of a dark chocolate flavor and just a hint of sweetness.  The almonds are nice and crunchy since they are roasted.<br /><br />I gave these four stars out of five.  Some might miss the creaminess of a chocolate bar and these won't completely take the place a of a good piece of dark chocolate.  But,they are great to have around when you just need something to take the edge off of that chocolate craving.

review/summary: Nuts About Nuts
review/text: If you're a nut lover this may be just what you are looking for. After all, once you get beyond proper roasting, there isn't a whole lot you can say about nuts other than what you add to them. If you bury them in salt, or immerse them in chocolate, you are getting more flavor, but the trade off is unwanted cane sugar, and/or salt; so these make a pleasant bridge.<br />Extra added flavor with the thin coat of dark chocolate cocoa powder (that doesn't get on your fingers by the way), while only ingesting 25mg of sodium in a single 1/4 cup serving.<br />When I first started to eat them, I thought the dry unsweetened cocoa powder didn't add anything desirable to the flavor, but as I progressed to finishing about a 1/4 cups worth, I began to realize that this could very well become a strongly acquired taste.<br />If I had to be critical of the entire presentation, I would note that the plastic "jar" has a threaded top with 2 half circle single threads partially overlapping each other that results in a not so very snug closure. With very little effort you can snug them at closure and skip right past snug to loose again, so much so that if you dropped the container the lid may pop off, spilling the contents.<br />I am not commenting on the way they are sealed though, they did an outstanding job of that. You have to pop open the plastic seal over the top of the lid edge, just to remove the screw on top, and then once open, there is an internal air tight seal to keep the contents fresh, and they are. Overall highly recommended, especially if you are nuts about nuts.

review/summary: Chocolate-Flavored Nuts- But Not Really
review/text: Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are almonds roasted with cocoa rather than covered with chocolate, which makes them healthier and less fattening than traditional chocolate-covered almonds. This is is an advantage if you don't want to have to wear clothing made in Indonesia, a highly laudable goal considering that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist. What's more, they taste excellent, too. In fact, these are chocolate-flavored nuts for people who care about watching their weight.

review/summary: Tasty healthy snack
review/text: The dark chocolate flavor of these airy almonds makes this snack something to look forward to.<br /><br />The flavor is mild. Just enough chocolaty flavor for chocolate lovers but not too overpowering or sweet.  The texture of the almonds seem airy. They are lighter than what I'm used to. It's a nice touch to the flavor. Not too heavy.<br /><br />One 11 oz container holds 11 servings. Each serving approximately 1/4 cup.  For 150 calories per serving this snack also packs 6g protein, 8% iron and an impressive 35% Vitamin E.<br /><br />Overall, my entire family enjoyed this snack and I plan to stash one in my office at work as well as in my tote bag.<br /><br />Excellent snack!

review/summary: That's a tasty little sucker!
review/text: Don't be fooled by appearances--the chocolate taste on these nuts is very subtle. They look to be coated in melted chocolate, but it's more of a delicate dusting, so if you're looking for chocolate-coated candy, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a lighter, nutty pick-me-up, you can't go wrong with these.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Delicious twist on traditionally salted almonds
review/text: I wouldn't normally buy a product like this, but I had an opportunity to try this product out and I was pleasantly surprised.  The almonds are roasted with a light layer of dark chocolate powder.  The chocolate lends a subtly  pleasant taste to the almonds and is a welcome alternative to salt.  It is not overpowering for the almond and leaves a sweet aftertaste.  Delicious.<br /><br />The chocolate is roasted on in such a way that it does not leave you fingers covered in chocolate.<br /><br />The packaging is also nicely done.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: As  a dedicated chocolate and almond lover this is exactly the sort of thing that would appeal to me.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The fresh, crisp almonds are beautifully complimented by their coating of cocoa.  They're lightly sweet, too.  Just enough to give you the full flavor of both chocolate and nut.  The only problem I have with them is that they're sweetened with sucralose, which is an artificial sweetener, and which may or may not be good for us.  There doesn't appear to be a great deal of it in the mix -- it's the last listed ingredient -- but for some it might be a problem.<br /><br />As with the Marcona almonds I tried earlier, these nuts have persuaded me to think of Emerald as a better brand than I originally thought.  They have some interesting offerings, and the quality of the ones I've tried has been consistently high.<br /><br />If the flavor combination appeals to you, and you don't mind a bit of sucralose, then by all means give  these nuts a try.

review/summary: Attention Chocoholics!
review/text: Emerald Dark Chocolate Almonds has just enough dark cocoa to soothe your cravings.  Roasted into the almonds, the cocoa power is not the messy treat that other brands offer.  These are clean eating, delicious nuts.<br /><br />But don't kid yourself.  There's not enough cocoa in these almonds to provide much in the way of antioxidant power.  Eat them simply because they're good, although they are a good source of Vitamin E and potassium.<br /><br />On the down side, these almonds are sweetened with sucrolose (Splenda), so if you're staying away from artificial sweeteners, avoid these almonds.  Hint to Emerald:  Try Stevia as the sweetener.<br /><br />Taste:  Five Stars<br /><br />Artificial Sweetner:  One Star<br /><br />Average: Three Stars

review/summary: Addictively Good
review/text: This snack product is very addictive!  The first few bites actually come across a little strongly, with the "roasted" taste definitely the first thing you'll notice.  However, the cocoa taste, while more subtle, soon overtakes the initial burst and it's almost as though you've got a small candy bar in your mouth.  My eldest daughter wasn't sure at first if she actually liked them, but once she ate a few, she quickly took off with the rest of the jar.  If you love almonds, you will love these bite-sized bits of flavor!

review/summary: EVEN THE WIFE WAS HAPPY
review/text: The Other Brother and I realized the other day that we've somehow been posting these reviews for ten years already.  Suffice it to say, The Wife has long since lost any sense of excitement she may ever have felt at the piles of free books that have come our way.  At this point, each thud of a package dropped on our front porch produces at best a cringe, at worst a snarl.  Best, that is, until the other day, when we received samples -- through the Amazon Vine program -- of two new nuts from Emerald: Cocoa Roast Almonds and Marcona Almonds.  I like the Marconas, which taste kind of like Macadamias, but don't have the almost soapy texture that has rendered them inedible to me since childhood.  She loves the dark chocolate one, which, "satisfies both the salty and the sweet urge in one snack."  These latter are most notable because they manage to leave a pleasant chocolate aftertaste--not always the case in flavored foods.  Big thumbs up!

review/summary: Lots of Nut, Little Chocolate; Mixed Results
review/text: I was particularly excited to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds when they arrived in the mail today as I love chocolate and I love nuts.<br /><br />Five individuals ranging in age from 2 to 50 tried these together and shared feedback. A few common threads emerged.<br /><br />1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute.<br /><br />2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones.<br /><br />3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting "burnt" or "too roasted".<br /><br />4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts -  in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum.<br /><br />Other observations<br />The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products.<br /><br />The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here.

review/text: If you're like me, sometimes you might just crave the taste of chocolate, despite the fact that you really know you shouldn't eat any (assuming it's not on your eating plan)!<br /><br />Well, if that's the case, than these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds will alleviate those cravings while providing a healthy snack chock full of protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />I only ate 5 of these almonds and was completely satisfied. The cocoa has a subtle, yet tasty, chocolaty flavor and the almonds tasted fresh.<br /><br />My son, though, really enjoys these nuts and eats 'em by the handful.  This is a good product I'd completely recommend.

review/text: I have started eating almonds as a healthy alternative to fatty or high-carb snacks, but wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth on occasion. These Cocoa Roast almonds fit the bill nicely. They just have a dusting of cocoa, so there's no more fat or unhealthy stuff than you would find in regular almonds, but you still get a nice chocolate taste. They are just a little bit sweeter than I really want (I like dark chocolate, semisweet or bittersweet) but still a great once-in-awhile snack!

review/summary: Fabulous. Just Fabulous.
review/text: Almonds are popular because of their antioxidant capacity. The almond is rich in the antioxidant vitamin E. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and slow down the aging process (hasn't helped me in that area). The magnesium in almonds helps strengthen bones and plays a role in different enzyme processes in our body. Almonds are, like all nuts, rich in unsaturated fat.<br /><br />The nutritional value of almonds is well documented. Some time ago I read an article in a Sunday paper magazines about the health benefits of almonds and have since been eating a daily handful of these tasty, nutritious nuts. Examine the label of any almond product and you'll see that almonds are good sources of Vitamin E, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin and folate. Munch some almonds, and you'll also get a bit of calcium, magnesium, copper, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. Like other nuts, almonds are calorie intense and must be eaten in moderation. After all, too much of a good thing can result in negative consequences.<br /><br />Do some study and you'll see that almonds are almost universally touted for their health benefits. The antioxidants in almonds are said to help in preventing the aging process, lowering the risk of gallstones, lowering blood pressure and lessening the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. No, munching a daily mouthful of almonds won't guarantee longevity or good health, but it's certainly a step in the right direction and most certainly is more beneficial than a mouthful of sugar-laden candy. I like that almonds are good for me and that they help me maintain my chiseled physique, but mostly I eat these crunchy wonders because they are so delicious and satisfying.<br /><br />Of all the varieties and brands of almonds I have ever eaten these are now my all time and present favorite. The chocolate coating is not what I had imagined. Instead of the milk chocolate candy coating I'd anticipated, the chocolate coating on these almonds is dry and powdery. The taste is subtle but dynamic and satisfying at the same time. Instead of an overwhelming candy sensation, one gets a complementary chocolate taste that heightens and accentuates the almond taste. I like that the dry chocolate coating doesn't insidiously stick to one hands and everything a snacker might touch. It's safe to read your favorite book or the latest edition of the Almondac while snacking on these Cocoa Roast Almonds.<br /><br />Eating these delicious nuts is an almond joy made even more delightful by playing some Almond Brothers music in the background . These nuts are so delicious that one can easily get carried away and eat too many. It's best to set aside a portion first and then seal the container.

review/summary: Bad taste
review/text: I was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out. I love almonds and I love chocolate. And most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both, without the extra sugar.<br />Well there's definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing - it tastes pretty bad to me. And I was quite shocked. I guess I need at least a little more sweet. But I'm shocked because I'm not THAT much of a sweet tooth. It's the bitter after-taste that really bothers me with this product. I really couldn't take it.<br />So just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond. Think again! This is really just cocoa and almond, and, for me, that left a very bad taste.

review/text: I'm a person that really loves nuts, especially flavored nuts.  When I go the local farmer's market, I always look for the nut stand so I can buy some kind of cinnamon, honey, jalape&ntilde;o, or whatever-flavor strikes me.<br /><br />When I was offered a chance to try the cocoa almonds, I was pretty thrilled.<br /><br />These nuts just "okay".  They're not spectacular.  As another reviewer noted, they aren't very chocolately.  If you have a chocolate craving, this will just make it worse.  They're also very dry (as are most almonds) and you'll need something to wash down every handful.<br /><br />The almonds are high-quality, and it's a good cocoa taste, but don't expect to be blown away by this.  It just won't happen.<br /><br />The container is probably what impressed me the most.  It's sturdy, resuable, handy to hold, and the screw-top keeps the product fresh.<br /><br />If you're looking for almonds with a subtle cocoa (not milk chocolate) hint then this is for you.  But have a drink handy.

review/text: I try to eat a lot of almonds because they are really good for you. Studies say you should eat about an ounce and a half a day. This product is a tasty way to do that. The cocoa dust on them gives a sweet dark chocolate taste to the almonds without the fat of dipping them in chocolate. Cocoa is good for you, too, reportedly having similar benefits to drinking a glass of red wine every day. The two together here are a real treat that you can feel good about eating. The canister they're in is a good size for sharing or portioning them out over time because it's reclosable. My family loved them and I know we'll be buying these regularly.

review/text: I started eating almonds regularly after going on the South Beach Diet. I find them quite delicious . . . so delicious that I have to remind myself that I'm only supposed to eat 15 or so a day.  Oh, well.<br /><br />I could easily eat a handful . . . and still wouldn't feel like I had gotten enough flavor.<br /><br />I had no idea what a cocoa roast almond would taste like, but I was pleasantly surprised that the taste was superb. It reminded me a little of eating a high quality fudge with lots of nuts in it.<br /><br />But the nice surprise was that the cocoa taste lingered in my mouth so that I continued to enjoy the flavor long after the almonds were eaten. Even though the cocoa roasting adds some calories and some fat, I would be satisfied after eating far fewer of these almonds. I plan to buy and eat these on a regular basis.<br /><br />Try them. I think you'll like them!

review/text: I wasn't entirely sure what I would be getting when I ordered these, but I'm glad I did. There's just the right balance of salty and sweet -- the chocolate flavoring is perfect.  Plus, the container is great for stowing in a desk drawer or even in the car for an on-the-go treat.

review/summary: Two Great Tastes Come Together In A Healthy Snack
review/text: The front of the label for these almonds from Emerald mentions two things that I am fond of:  almonds and dark chocolate.  I went in with hopes that combining two good things together would result in something better than the two separately.  In this case the result is pretty good.  While this is only mentioned on the product page (and not the actual container itself), the lid doubles as a measuring cup for a single serving.  After having these over the last few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />While I like the taste (a lot!), it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  When I think of dark chocolate, I'm expecting a taste similar to a piece of Dove Dark Chocolate miniatures.  It is a taste that is rich with a very mild sweetness.  The coating on these almonds is a little bit sweeter than that.  It's nowhere near milk chocolate, but like I said it wasn't exactly what I expected.  That said these are still really good.  The almonds themselves are great with only a minute amount of salt.  With the chocolate and the natural flavor of almonds this is a sweet treat.<br /><br />Who It's For:  Disciplined people looking for a sweet, but healthy snack.<br /><br />Suggested Use:  A single serving makes a great between meals snack.  If your stomach starts to rumble around 10 a.m., this will bridge the gap to lunch.  I have the canister in a desk drawer at work.  Regardless of when/where/how you use them as snack, discipline and moderation are key.<br /><br />Potential Improvements:  The one thing that bugs me on these is that the 11 oz package does not divide evenly into 1.5 oz servings.  It would seem like a 12 oz canister would have been easy enough.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a great tasting, healthy snack to enjoy in moderation.

review/summary: Healthy Chocolate-like Almonds
review/text: This is an innovative concept.  Dust and roast the almonds in chocolate powder so you get the light taste of chocolate, without a heavy candy-coating of chocolate full of calories and sugar.  These almonds are crunchy, non-salted, and not too sweet with a hint of dark chocolate taste.  Only 1 gram of sugar per serving, with 3 g of dietary fiber.  So it meets the South Beach diet criteria.  6% Calcium, 8% Iron and 35% Vitamin E.  My family loved them and these disappeared too quickly.

review/summary: Chocolate coated almonds, but not in the normal way...
review/text: Most "chocolate covered" nuts tend to be a nut with a full coating of chocolate wrapped around it, that can be even slipped off and eaten separately ot licked off, etc.<br />Not so with these Cocoa Roast almonds -- what we have here are full sized almonds with their skin still on given a slight bit of dark chocolate powder over them as flavor.<br />And it works fantastically. Another review mentioned that they may not be sweet enough for soda drinkers, but I disagree. They are nuts, they aren't candy. They are easy to suck the flavor off, or just eat normally. And while the skin is still on them, they don't make a mess like normal almonds do -- perhaps it's the cocoa coating or perhaps they are just processed a certain way.<br />Not only do they taste wonderful, but the added flavor doesn't mean less healthy.<br />Really, a four and a half star product. While it's a fantastically unique taste, the packaging has a really SILLY warning that it "CONTAINS ALMONDS" right under the ingredients list. And $6 a cannister means it's not something everyone can just buy many of and have whenever they want.

review/summary: Less guilty then a real chocolate coated nut.
review/text: For those people who enjoy eating chocolate w/ nuts, this is a great product that gives you a little bit of that taste w/ a lot less guilt.  I enjoyed the product as did my Toddler. The nuts are dry w/ a dusting of chocolate that isn't too sweet to the taste.<br /><br />It's good that it gives only hint of the chocolate. I wouldn't say it is addictive as some of the other flavors like the standard smoked seasoned ones, but it is enjoyable. The coating is pretty dry and doesn't come off on your fingers either, so eating it w/ your fingers is pretty mess free.

review/summary: Superb Snack - but artificial flavor added
review/text: I am torn: 4 stars or 5 stars? I decided on 5 stars:<br /><br />- The taste is great! If you are Coke or Pepsi drinker, then they may not be sweet enough for you. I am not, hence I and my entire family enjoyed their subtle chocolaty flavor.<br /><br />- The nutritional content is not bad at all, except artificial flavoring, which I would never notice on my taste buds if it was not written.<br /><br />All-in-all -- absolutely delicious and filling snack!

review/summary: I'm coo-coo for coca nuts!
review/text: The almonds are crispy and delicious, and cocoa powder gives a nice chocolate flavor without being all thick and gummy like the nuts with an actual chocolate coating.<br /><br />So the taste is good, the crunchiness is nice, and apparently they're just about as good for you as normal almonds.<br /><br />I'd get them again.

review/summary: a tasty, not too sweet snack
review/text: If you are looking for a nutty snack that is not too sweet, this might be for you.  My husband and I both tried them.  He thinks this is more of a 5 star item.  He liked the fresh nuts with just a bit of a cocoa taste, and though I liked them, I would say they are maybe in the three star category, because I was hoping for something slightly sweeter.  We both liked that the coating was not a "come off in your hand" kind of variety that makes you look for something to wipe your hands on.<br /><br />We both enjoyed them though I don't know that I would purchase them for myself again.  Nothing wrong with them, just not sweet enough for me.  I would however purchase for my husband.<br /><br />As with any nut product, they are high in fiber and the good kind of fat, but you don't want to dip into too many if you are dieting as they run 150 calories for 1/4 cup, so portion accordingly.

review/summary: Not sweet enough the first time, but it got better
review/text: I like almonds, and I loooove chocolate!  Even dark chocolate.  The problem is that putting the two together doesn't create an especially healthy or low-calorie snack.  But these almonds aren't dipped in melted chocolate, they are dusted with a dark chocolate cocoa powder.  In theory, that sounds like the best of both worlds...<br /><br />... but to me, it tasted kinda like they were covered in dirt.  Well, maybe not dirt, but not exactly sweetness either.  And that may not quite satisfy those of us with a BIG sweet tooth.  But after subsequent servings I grew to like them much more.  I passed some around the office and the reception was much more positive than my initial taste test (of course, it might have just been because it was free food...).  And once I decided to share them with the kids all I had left was an empty container.<br /><br />So, as I sniff the pleasant aroma of roasted almonds and dark chocolate from an empty container, I must admit it makes a good snack for the office, although 4 stars is a bit generous.  Even a small serving is mostly satisfying and low-calorie enough that I don't have to feel guilty.  My biggest complaint, however, is with the lid.  It just won't screw on tight.  Every time I tighten it, the threads slip and it's loose again.  Maybe the next container will be better...

review/summary: I was surprised.
review/text: I really thought I would love these.  I like all kinds of nuts, roasted and otherwise.  I like all kinds of chocolate, really like dark chocolate.  Heck, I even love mocha roast coffees and dark beers described as nutty. But I don't love this product.  Maybe it's just me.  I understand it's not cocoa in the sense of a creamy coating, but rather it's a dry dusting that is not unhealthy.  I understand it's dark cocoa.  But I didn't like the taste.  I will end up mixing these in with other trail mixtures.<br /><br />If you havn't tried them, I'd maybe find a way to get a nibble somewhere before buying a four pack.  You might love em.  Or like me, you might be surprised.

review/summary: An easy decision
review/text: Diamond Foods is the company that for nearly 90 years has been ubiquitously marketing its quality packaged nuts throughout the world. The Emerald product line was started by the company in 2003 to market their products to a more upscale consumer segment, where Emerald trades on the particular hipster, dinner-party image that their products sometime bring to mind.<br /><br />Emerald roasted almonds come packaged in durable 11-ounce canisters with screw-on tops to help keep the product fresh (and, it should be noted, indented sides so that one's hands can easily grasp the container even if one has previously imbibed a few cocktails). Sampling the contents, I was not disappointed; I found the almonds to be as flavorful and addictive as they can be. Interestingly, Emerald also chose to provide a variety of flavoring options such as dark chocolate to help keep things interesting for us. Bravo!<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you like almonds, buying the Emerald product should be an easy decision for you to make. Highly recommended!

review/summary: I like Almonds and I like Dark Chocolate . . .
review/text: but I guess I don't really love them together. The chocolate is not sweet at all (they also have no other flavor to them), which means I can only eat about three before I feel like their getting bitter.  It may be that their just too dark for me and they will not be too strong for someone else.  they would probably be good in a trail mix of some kind to give your taste buds some flavor variety.

review/summary: Not as good as other Emerald nuts
review/text: I'm not a huge almond fan but I can like them.  I am a huge dark chocolate fan so when I saw this product I thought "Great".  One serving is approximately 25-27 almonds I measured and contains little "bad fat" and lots of protein and fiber for the amount.  The cocoa appears to be baked on and not merely sprinkled or the nuts rolled in it because it clings really well to the product.  The almonds are nice and big, well roasted, and taste just like you'd expect from an almond.  There in lay my greatest complaint: the cocoa wasn't very noticeable.  Was it dark cocoa?  Maybe but because the taste was subtle it was a bit difficult for me to tell.  In a world where we need to be eating healthier I know that we might have to change how we eat chocolate but unless almonds are one of your favorite nuts, try one of the many other brands of cocoa-covered or yogurt-covered varieties all in easy to open and reseal containers.  So far, the cocoa-dusted walnuts are my favorite.

review/summary: dangerously addicting
review/text: The almonds are fresh and the addition of the dark chocolate flavor makes for an addicting taste. Almonds in limited quantities as opposed to finishing the entire container can be quite healthy. The problem with these is that it is near impossible to stop eating them. Please note that these are not chocolate covered almonds but rather almonds with a covering of dark chocolate powder. They are healthy and quite delicious.

review/summary: Addictive New Snack
review/text: I think I made a big mistake getting a container of these Cocoa Roast Almonds, because I cannot stop eating them. Everyone I've shared them with (shared 1 or 2 almonds, I'm keeping the rest for me!) gives me a look like they are willing to wrestle me to the ground to get the rest of the container.<br /><br />Very subtle chocolate flavor (I got the Dark Chocolate) that vaguely makes you think of brownies. Not overly sweet, but definitely not bitter the way one worries about [dark chocolate] cocoa powder.<br /><br />I'd give six stars if Amazon had them.<br /><br />The cap of the container is supposed to be used for determining a single serving, but I treated the entire 11 ounce container as a single serving.

review/summary: A really good snack!!
review/text: Pros<br />Excellent tasting<br />Fresh<br />Nice hint of chocolate flavoring<br /><br />Cons<br />Package slightly hard to open. Had to tear wrapping from the top then tear it completely off the top before I could open it.<br />Inner seal was a little hard to remove with my fingers.<br />Not vacuum packed as I thought it might be.<br /><br />Review<br />A pleasent surprise on my first tasting. Cocoa flavoring is not overpowering. Nuts are firm and easy to chew. The 11 oz package is a good size plus the shape is very good. I like the large indentations on two sides which make the outer container easy to hold with one hand. Seems to be one of those "can't stop eating it" kinds of foods. It's really that good. The serving size according to the package is 11 however I expect to finish the product in 3 to 4 servings. The handy screw top is nice too and would seem to keep this item fresh between servings. This is something I would order fairly often and keep in my house to share with anyone who drops by for a visit. I also found the product information on the back easy to read against a light green background.

review/summary: Not what I expected -- but in a good way
review/text: When I opened this plastic jar of roasted almonds, I expected something like chocolate-covered peanuts a la almond.  Nope, that's not what happened.  It turned out that these are almonds that are dusted in cocoa.  The chocolate flavor is really rich, mainly because it's dark chocolate.  I like these as a treat, and I realized that they'd go really well with a cup of coffee.  They aren't snack food, unless the snacker has really odd sense of taste.  I found that they're best if you just eat about two or three of them at a time, with or without coffee.  Come to think of it, I'll likely brew me up a cup of a rich French or African roast, just because that cup of java would go well with this treat.  Be careful, however, when opening the container because the pungent flavor might make you sneeze.  More than three dusted almonds will also likely dry out your mouth.

review/summary: Good Almonds
review/text: I like a good nut, and these Emerald Cocoa Roast nuts are pretty good nuts.  As I am also a chocoholic, though, my opinion may be biased.  :-)<br /><br />Not that these are overly chocolate-flavored.  This is not a chocolate covered almond.  Instead, these are almonds coated in cocoa powder.  It's not even glazed--just dusted, stuck on with oil.  Because the cocoa powder isn't strongly sweetened, you get a good mix of nut flavor with a chocolate chaser.  They're subtle, and good for a little munching ... but not for prolonged snacking; I found that after five or six nuts, they sort of lost flavor in my mouth until I cleansed my palette with a drink.<br /><br />All in all, these nuts are a nice change of pace from typical salted fare, without bringing the heavy sweetness of a honey raost to the party.  I would definitely buy them again.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the Cocoa Roast almonds. They are not dipped in chocolate like a candy, but dusted with a slightly sweet cocoa powder that does not overpower the natural taste of the almonds. It is enough to make a person who does not usually snack on almonds (me) keep reaching for more. They're totally healthy, and totally addictive. A+.
