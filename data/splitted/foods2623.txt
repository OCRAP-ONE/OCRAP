review/summary: Great Ricotta and Zesty Sauce!
review/text: This stuff is pretty darned good for what it is...not supposed to be great for you but beats a big burger and fries. If you pair this up with a dark green salad and maybe a slice of garlic toast, you're good to go! I put red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese on top of mine and zipped it up a little. These Compleats meals are iffy--some are better than others. This one happens to be pretty good. I do wish they'd have made it with meat sauce, but as it is, it's good enough for me to recommend it to you. My kindergartener was licking her fork! So...

review/summary: PDQ Italian...Fantastico!
review/text: This manicotti dish by Hormel was surprisingly good! For a shelf-stable product, it was as close to home cookin' as it gets. The pasta was tasty and tender, without being mushy. The marinara-style sauce was sweet and zesty, while not being too acidic. It was further flavored by some smallish pieces of Italian sausage...a nice touch. The ricotta cheese was plentiful and delicious. Spread some grated parmesan and/or romano cheeses across the top, and you've got a meal that is first rate and 'sticks to yer ribs'. All in all, this is a rare find, especially amongst the Compleats line!

review/summary: A good shelf-stable lunch to keep handy at work!
review/text: This was a good lunch. It heated quickly in the microwave (less than 2 minutes), and I was pleased that it wasn't too salty, which has been a problem for me in the past with some other Hormel brand microwaveable meals.<br /><br />There was plenty of sauce, although it wasn't really that meaty (a few chunks of what purported to be ground beef), but it had a nice spice to it (not spicy as in hot, just flavorful and pleasing), with some chunks of tomato and onion that gave it nice texture. The manicotti were decent sized and had a good amount of the cheese filling.<br /><br />This filled me up, but if you're extra hungry, add a piece of fruit, or a salad, and something to drink and this would certainly be an adequate lunch.<br /><br />The outer cardboard packaging that held the 6-pack of trays was sturdy and held up well in the mail, and the meals arrived with an expiration date that's about 8 months out from the time of purchase, so I'm sure I'll be able to enjoy all 6 of them before then.<br /><br />For being a shelf-stable product, I was pretty impressed!

review/summary: What do you expect?
review/text: First, I'm going to give a review about the taste of the product and then I'm going to list the nutrition and ingredient information that Amazon should already have listed but they don't (shame on you, Amazon).  I know people have allergies, some of which can be serious, so I will list the ingredients EXACTLY as they appear on the package.<br /><br />First, the taste.  It's certainly not Grandma's manicotti but if you're looking for a quick lunch and aren't super picky, this is a great choice, as it literally takes 1 minute in the microwave and 1 minute to cool down.  Like previous reviewers have mentioned, there are three decent sized manicotti in the package with a slightly spicy tomato sauce and some pieces of ground beef.  Please be aware, this is NOT a vegetarian food.  There is a slight chemical taste but it's not bad.  One of the things I was surprised about, though, was the amount of cheese in the manicotti.  Very satisfying.  Long story short, it's not the best manicotti I've had but what do you expect from something that comes in plastic and doesn't need to be refrigerated?<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />1 serving, 290 calories, 80 calories from fat<br />Total Fat 9.0 grams (14%)  Saturated Fat 4.5 grams (23%)  Trans Fats 0 grams<br />Cholesterol 25 mg (8%)  Sodium 990 mg (41%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 42 grams (14%)  Dietary Fiber 4 grams (16%)  Sugars 10 grams<br />Protein 10 grams<br />Vitamin A 15%  Vitamin C 2%  Calcium 15%  Iron 8%<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water, Manicotti (DOUGH: Semolina [wheat flour, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, niacin, iron, folic acid], water, egg whites  FILLING: Ricotta [fresh whey, pasteurized part-skim milk, cream, vinegar, salt], bread crumbs [wheat flour, sugar, yeast, salt], Parmesan Cheese [pasteurized part-skim milk, cultures, enzymes, salt], sodium metabisulfate, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices) Tomatoes, Cooked pork crumbles (pork, water, textured vegetable protein [soy flour, soy protein isolate], seasonings [spices, garlic powder, dextrose, monosodium glutamate] salt, sugar, sodium phosphate), Concentrated crushed tomatoes, onions, modified cornstarch, contains 2% or less of flavoring, sugar, parmesan cheese (part-skim cow's milk, cheese culture, salt, enzymes), salt, disodium inosinate, and disodium guanylate, spices, citric acid, hydrolyzed corn protein, yeast extract, oleoresin of paprika<br /><br />Hope this information can help some people!!!

review/text: Surprised me.....This one is really good.  Flavor, texture is excellent.  It's hard to find food that is so easy and fast.  I rely on meals like this because I'm disabled and some days I just don't have the energy to roll in the kitchen and fix something.  I actually enjoy eating this as opposed to eating something just because it's easy and I need to eat something.  i think some garlic bread would make this a fantastic meal.

review/summary: These are Okay, I'd Probably Buy Again
review/text: I was surprised at these; I expected them to be awful and for there to be a sparse amount of actual food in the container.  They have three smallish but very filling manicottis, with what appears to be a meat tomato sauce (not the usual marinara).  The pasta of course is basically too soft, and the sauce has that pasteurized quality; but overall these were fine; they didn't taste chemically or too weird.  The package looks rather small, but I was stuffed after eating it.  It only takes 1 minute in the microwave to heat up, and the tray was reasonably easy to handle removing from the microwave and carrying and eating out of etc.

review/text: I'm usually not a fan of instant pasta, however, this one is great as far as I'm concerned.  It cooks fast in the container it is packaged in, is easy to eat with one fork, cleans up easily.  The sauce is great -- tangy hearty marinara that isn't too sweet and not too acidic.  I've tried many other shelf type past meals, and this sauce is the best.  The manicotti is tasty and fresh as well.  I keep one in my drawer at work as a back-up if I don't happen to get out for lunch during the day.  Sometimes though, I prefer this over many of the other food options nearby.  I notice that AMAZON is currently out of stock -- hope it doesn't stay that way!

review/summary: Better than I expected, not bad, fairly tasty. High sodium, though.
review/text: This is one of the better "Compleats" meals (I don't care for most of them)and makes a pretty tasty, quick lunch.  It's high in sodium (990 mg) as are all of these types of meals, so don't eat too often, but fine for an occasional meal. Has 290 calories (80 from fat) which isn't too bad for this type of thing.  Main thing is it's very quick to make, tastes pretty good, is filling and satisfying, and keeps without refrigeration for a long time on the shelf (over a year).<br /><br />The manicotti are fairly good (cheese is very mild as is usual for processed meals), sauce is pretty good, and there are bits of "sausage" (really textured vegetable protein flavored with "pork crumbles" but hey it gives the right accent/effect, so OK).  You get a decent amount of manicotti and lots of tasty sauce.  This with a slice of bread or another side makes a decent meal.<br /><br />Not bad. I'd rate most of these meals as 2 to 3 stars, but this one is a 4.<br /><br />(The other Compleats meal I liked is the Salisbury Steak here:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52XIC">Hormel Compleats Salisbury Steak with Sliced Potatoes & Gravy, 10-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>.)

review/summary: Artificial Ingredients
review/text: Allergic to soy flour, & MSG, or SULFITE ?  Avoid THIS. It is loaded with MSG...listed in a way which disguises it.  MSG is an appetite STIMULENT. MSG  is listed  on small print label ...as "vegetable protein (soy)",  "SOY protein,"  "texturized vegetable protein",  "Monosodium Glutamate," and "Monosodium Glutamate;hydrolyzed corn protein, and yeast extract."  This is not a misprint. Each time it is listed on label, at least EIGHT times--indicates another DOSE of MSG. It is in the sauce, in the manicotti, in the filling of the manicotti, and in the "meat" which also contains "PORK crumbles," which probably accounts for some of the sodium metabiSULFITE.<br /><br />Sulfite is a preservative, and chemically a "salt," so it is bad for people w/ heart trouble; hypertension; OR SULFITE ALLERGY ( triggers severe dangerous  asthma attacks in allergic persons, including children). It triggers migraine headaches in a large percentage of people also (Chinese Restaurant Syndrome). The product also contains two other preservatives (also "salts") , and table salt. Wow, ladies....wonder why you "retain fluid?"<br /><br />ASK an M.D.-- all the above is pretty accurate.<br /><br />This is a fairly large group of folks who shouldn't eat this product...and I bought a couple cases- and gave them away because I have SULFITE allergy, and MSG allergy. I wish I had been able to read the ingredinets online-- I wouldn't have bought any.<br /><br /> Monosodium glutamate (so-called flavor enhancer is a chemical/DRUG  which crosses blood/brain barrier and stimulates appetite! ( Just what we need to sabotage weight control in a fat nation).<br /><br />Even with loads of MSG --the sauce is very acidic. I think the manufacturers know it is inferior, or else WHY all the MSG?<br />Their Dinty Moore stew tastes better, and isn't a chemical cocktail.<br /><br />I wish I could have said this was a great product. Over a period of years, what happens to all the chemicals we have consumed? Please, Amazon, copy the ingredients and post it somewhere-- so we know what we are buying. I am usually happy w/ items purchased... not this stuff.

review/summary: Great Tast + Filling too!
review/text: I started buying Hormel Compleats as a cheap and quick alternative lunch for my husband, to save on eat out lunches, or skipped lunches as he had no time to eat. I also bought them for my daughter who is trying to keep her weight down and also has little time for lunch. Then I tried them because I was tired of taking sandwiches to work.  WOW!  This particular one is REALLY filling and has great taste and sauce.  Not only are they great for lunch, when I come home tired I make a salad, steam some asparagus or green beans, and pop a manicotti in the microwave.  Perfect dinner:  inexpensive, low calories, quick and satisfying.  I would especially recommend this to one and all.  I would also suggest if the idea appeals to you try them all...for lunch or dinner with a salad and a veggie.  They are great!

review/summary: Good Halloween candy
review/text: You need to be careful of the source as the quality depends a lot on the shipper.  I usually order these by the mini-case.  Shippers will not guaratee against breakage if you order single boxes.  Mini-cases usually have special packing (I order from Bulk Foods and have never had trouble with breakage).  The better shippers will also ship with blue ice packs for an added charge (the blue ice packs can be reused).  Prices vary depending on the source.  Ordering by the mini-case, you can usually get a discounted price and free shipping, but you have to check around among the sources.<br /><br />The candy sticks themselves are the best variety that I have found.  The individual wrappers are all marked with the flavors.  Flavors are comparable with candy sticks from other manufacturers.  You can order specific flavors (orange, bubble gum, cotton candy, etc., depending on the source).  Orange is a good color for Halloween, or you can order red (cherry) and green (lime) for Christmas colors, or possibly the barber pole peppermint sticks.<br /><br />A mini-case may sound like a lot, but friends can combine orders.  Personally, I had about 400 trick or treaters last Halloween, and two sticks per child gives them a little variety and makes a good treat.  I ordered a mini-case of 12 boxes, gave one box to a merchant friend for her store, and had a few left for Christmas (they are colorful and can be used in stockings, gift bags, or added as ornaments to wrappings).

The "burn" wasn't so that bad that I "paid" for it later, if you know what I mean. If you like spicy sauces with heat like the habanero variety of the Tabasco brand, then this is your sauce. (It's hotter than the original tabasco.) This should be in every grocery store for risk-takers and lovers of spicy peppers. It's not salty or sweet but balanced with spices, heat, garlic and onion-delicious. It's a treat to me.

They're also great for cooking, not that I really do much of that, but I've seen many cookie recipes that incorporate these chewy little guys.<p>Probably the most famous advertising campaign I can think of for this candy is one that asked, "Do you love anyone enough to give them your last Rolo?" I could think of very few that I would...<p>You get 36 packages, or rolls, in a box, and each package contain eight delightful nubs, buttons, or whatever you want to call them.  That's 288 Rolos...288 chances to make love to your taste buds with creamy chocolate ecstasy...plus I like the foil used in packaging the candy as it's very shiny and almost hypnotic...<p>Cookieman108

review/summary: Delicious and hydrogenated oil free
review/text: I bought these because I had a lot of recipes that involved peanut butter chips, but could not find any other brand that was hydrogenated oil free.  This brand is, but still tastes even better than the more conventional brands.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows:<br />Evaporated cane juice, palm kernel oil, whey powder, partially defatted peanut flour, Maranatha� Peanut Butter (peanuts, salt), whole milk solids, soy lecithin (a non-GMO emulsifier) and salt.<br /><br />What I like about these chips is that combine the meltability of chocolate chips with an intense peanut buttery flavor of peanut butter.  These have a very clean, true peanut butter flavor and do not taste waxy or oily at all.  I've had great success using them in everything from cookies to waffles to ice cream.  My boyfriend's favorite way to eat them, however, is straight out of the bag.<br /><br />Overall I cannot say enough good things about these chips.  I love that Sunspire was able to make them without hydrogenated oils and make them taste 100% peanut buttery to boot.  Now if they only had a vegan version so I could use them in the vegan goodies I share with my dairy-free friends.

review/summary: Wonderful Taste
review/text: I've been looking for a premium grade herbal tea that would be a good substitute for caffeinated black tea (my favorite has been English breakfast tea)and was pleasantly surprised when I tried this organic tea from Numi. I created my first cup with one tea bag, half-cup mineral water/half-cup organic 2% milk and it had a very pleasing taste.  Its the closest I've come in herbal teas to something that resembles black tea. Coming from the mountains of South Africa, I wondered what unique flavors the terroir in that region lended itself to this tea blend.  The packaging notes that it has vanilla notes, a universally appealing flavor, however, after savoring my first few sips, I detected a slightly fruity, woodsy taste, with a hint of tree bark or cedar.  After traveling over to a website to study this region, I was surprised to find that this mountain is known for its cedar trees.  The region this tea is from is called cedarberg so perhaps that is basis for its western name (I am sure there is a native South African name for this region as well, I just couldn't find it anywhere).  I was so impressed that I went over to Numi's website and found a very interesting story about the brother/sister team who created this company, very inspiring and a fantastic antidote to the major coffee chain stores we now see around every corner.

review/summary: One of 2 teas Numi struck out on for us
review/text: I drink tons of tea. I constantly have at least 100 kinds, from herbal teas to pu'erhs of all ages to Silk Road prize teas to Celestial seasonings ones on occasion... and frankly, for getting the best flavor our of Rooibos tea, I'd say go get the Celestial Seasonings Pomegranate Red tea...<br /><br />Having worked with loads of loose rooibos and being all too acquainted with the local importer/purveyor of the highest # of teas in this nation... well... Numi's is pretty mediocre... this and their honey bush are both pretty gross to drink, and that's a consistent report from so many guests of different backgrounds (I host a lot of travelers) that I eventually chucked it since it's better not to drink tea at all than to drink something grotesque.<br /><br />Numi ordinarily makes great stuff--their Aged Earl Grey is the only EG I'll touch most days, their Moroccan Mint is sublime... and that lemon chamomile myrtle... oh man, it's the best of the best... but they really bombed here in my opinion. That's probably why I got it for so cheap when I did... they just don't sell well, and with good reason--too many other great teas to try and too many better rooibos varieties. Theirs doesn't even have much tint, a sign of either old or poor quality tea.

review/summary: Wonderful Rooibos---The "Miracle Tea"!
review/text: *****<br /><br />Red Mellow Bush is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea (caffeine-free) is certified organic and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Grown in the high desert regions of the Cederberg Mountains, the shoots of Rooibos have been hand gathered by South Africans for generations. It is prepared like a traditional tea, undergoing meticulous drying (oxidation) and cutting. Organic Red Mellow Bush has an earthy vanilla taste and pleasing orange color with hints of autumn straw. With an anti-oxidant level comparable to green tea, Rooibos has no caffeine, is rich in minerals, very low in tannin, and is relaxing to the nerves. No wonder they call it the miracle tea. Discover the wonders of Rooibos!" What an invitation!<br /><br />It is my husband's favorite tea, and is pure premium rooibos. If you haven't tasted rooibos before, it is a pleasant, earthy, herbal flavor that most people like.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love rooibos, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: A good way to prepare and store your SACO milk
review/text: I decided to switch from grocery store milk to SACO's powder for mathematical reasons. As a single lady who uses milk primarily for my tea, I rarely finish a one-gallon bottle before it sours (hate that race to use it all!), and buying half gallon containers absolutely bugs me, as it costs five bucks for two (purchased one at a time) instead of three skins for a single gallon. Plus, there's the inconvenience of schlepping to the store every few days for another half-gallon. I'm a "stock up and go shopping as infrequently as possible" type.<br /><br />Here's my solution for mixing and storing SACO milk.<br /><br />1.) Buy two plastic half gallons of store milk and rinse the bottles out thoroughly when they're empty.<br /><br />2.) Mix up a quart of SACO in a large Pyrex (glass) handled measuring cup and use its convenient spout to pour the milk into an empty grocery bottle. Repeat the process. (Note: having the Pyrex device clearly marked off in red sure makes measuring the powder easy. Just start with 8 oz. of SACO, then add water to the quart line.)<br /><br />3.) Put the cap on the filled bottle and vigorously shake this half-gallon to assure all the SACO has dissolved. Refrigerate. (A bottom shelf is best, as it's colder.)<br /><br />4.) When you get down near to the last of that bottle, mix up a second one and refrigerate it. This way, you'll always have a supply of milk on hand. Rinse out the first container when it's empty and leave the cap off. Give it a quick rinse just before re-using.<br /><br />I chose grocery bottles for storage as it satisfies a life-long habit of pouring milk from one. Since I'm no longer buying one gallon jugs, lifting and pouring from these smaller bottles is much less of a strain, and I have YET to throw away any milk mixed from powder because the half-gallon spoiled before I could finish it all.<br /><br />If you've never before experimented with instant non-fat milk but are thinking along the lines of this review's first paragraph, give SACO a shot. Those two half-gallon bottles I suggested just may be the last milk you'll ever lug home from the market.

review/summary: Best tasting powdered milk
review/text: Powdered milk doesn't really taste like fresh milk, so don't expect it to. This is the best tasting powdered milk I've found, though--the closest to fresh. Most of them taste cardboard-y; this one just tastes kind of cooked. I have a toddler, and I leave a pre-measured amount in a sippy cup in the car, so that I just have to add water if we're out and have a milk "emergency." My favorite use for it is camping, where weight and refrigeration are really issues.<br /><br />A word to the wise, though--don't buy this to save money on milk. It works out to about 40 cents more per gallon than I'm currently paying for fresh skim milk.

review/summary: Agree with all 5-star review here plus...
review/text: I started looking for a new source of dry milk when my local supermarket chain went from offering a convenient 20-quart box for about $17.99 to their new 'largest size' 8-quart box at $9.99.  A total rip-off that I was not about to reward.  Thank goodness I found this wonderful Saco 40-quart version for a very reasonable price!  Apart from having milk for baking, cereal, drinking, etc, the thing I really like is that 1) I'm not lugging large cartons of heavy liquid back home from the supermarket (I don't have a car, so I walk or ride my bike - and Amazon is, of course, delivering to my door, so this time I don't even have to lug a big box of powdered milk from the store!) and 2) I'm not constantly contributing to the garbage, either plastic (the worst) or even paper every time I finish another carton of milk.  I have a nice old-fashioned milk pitcher in my fridge and there sits as little or as much as I decide I need on a given day.  So convenient, so smart and so good!  Highly recommended!

review/text: This is the milk we use all the time.  It is superior to other milks that we tried because it has the added vitamins and minerals like the milk in the refrigerator section.  The taste of the milk is good for drinking.  My kids have no complaints about it.  We do take special care to make the milk well in advance of drinking it so it is cold.  This milk froths nicely when using it for making cappuccinos.  It is good for use in cooking though I have not used it as a dry ingredient in baking but I can assume it would be good that way also.

review/summary: Very good nonfat dry milk
review/text: Has a better, creamier flavor than the Safeway Lucerne and Albertsons store brands.<br /><br />The Saco doesn't dissolve quite as quickly as those two, but it does fully dissolve if you wait a few minutes or make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge overnight as the instructions suggest. One reviewer said it wouldn't dissolve "even in boiling water", but boiling water cooks the proteins and makes them lumpy, same as if you boil regular milk, and once that's happened, it'll never dissolve.<br /><br />With Super Saver free shipping, the Amazon price is currently only a little less than Safeway, but the milk is slighly better, and I can get a larger quantity from Amazon than the few little boxes the local Safeway keeps stocked on its powdered milk shelf at any one time.<br /><br />The box in which Amazon shipped my 2-box order would, I think, have held exactly 3 of the Saco boxes.

That said, it's very easy to mix (it seems to take less than a minute to get a great consistency), easy to store (the box is large, but not gigantic), and very handy for times when you run out or otherwise can't quickly obtain a gallon of the "already liquid" kind.<br /><br />I also like that I can mix it with filtered water.

I mix it a little on the strong side for puddings though 'cause I found the weaker version makes for runny pudding.  But for drinking, I find I prefer it on the lite side.  Matter of taste.

I was unsure about buying a food product untried and untested, especially spending over 30 dollars for it. -And especially a powdered milk product. Most powdered milk is just horrible. -But this turned out to be WONDERFUL. I have to say, it mixes far better and tastes even better than the Sanalac, which we had felt was the best option out there. True to its name, you can simply mix it and drink it, and it is leagues above the other powdered milks. If you have never been brave enough to try powdered milk as a beverage (as opposed to just a recipe ingredient), this is a milk worth trying. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL PRODUCT! Personally, I use even less than the recommended quantity of powder per quart of water, and it still turns out rich and delicious. MY FAMILY LOVES IT. A DEFINITE 5-STAR ITEM.

review/summary: Dissolves instantly in hot or cold water!
review/text: I would love Saco Mix 'n Drink even more if only it were organic (grass fed, non-drugged cows), but I called the 800 number on the box, and was told that they had not yet reached that level of purity. I still use it in spite of that little fault, putting it directly from the box into my tea, and into any recipes calling for milk. I always add more of it than the recipe calls for (ie: recipe calls for 1/2 c. milk - I add twice as much powder to the water. What I like best: it dissolves instantly, with no lumps!

review/summary: My favorite powdered milk product...
review/text: it arrived double boxed. the saco milk box has a plastic bag full of powdered milk in it. i have a plastic 1 cup scoop that i put with mine for quick measuring. i mix mine up in water and put it in the fridge to cool down real good or sometimes i use cold water to mix it with. i also put it in protein shakes. it is very good tasting. if i want it to taste richer i can add more powder and maybe a couple artificial sweeteners to it. it mixes easily. it tastes very good. now i crave the taste and have it every day. it's worth a try!<br /><br />update june 16 2011: i have gotten used to the taste of this saco milk and it is delicious. i make it every day and i drink about two quarts of it a day. i use it in protein shakes and other things. it has many uses as it says on the box. i look forward to drinking this every day. i do add a little bit more powder to make my milk richer. it has a long shelf life also.

review/summary: Good taste, good price
review/text: I've used powdered milk for years, mostly because I find it convenient. In this economy, though, price has become a big factor, and I live in New York City, where even powdered milk is expensive.  I recently stumbled on Saco.  The packaging is, um, very basic, and I'd never heard of this brand, but it was SO MUCH cheaper than the brands they carry in my local store, it was worth trying. I am delighted--Saco clearly keeps marketing costs down, without seeming to skimp on the quality. Saco mixes very easily--none of the occasional clumps I've found with other brands (really, who wants clumps in their milk?). Most importantly,the taste is good; fresh milk with some fat content may be hard to beat, but I find that Saco has a richer feel than fresh skim, which is often watery. I'm now ordering my second box.

review/text: How we use milk powder:<br />We use this milk powder in our coffee instead of artificial creamers; cold milk typically makes coffee.. well... cold!<br /><br />Milk powder is great for low-fat / non-fat baking when the ingredient calls for milk but oil has already been substituted for apple sauce; cuts back on the liquid.<br /><br />Protein shakes! Many low-carb protein powders can be converted into creamy meal replacements with 1/4cup of milk powder!<br /><br />Many more ways to use it...<br /><br />This brand is the best price on the net and beats the taste of Walmart 2:1.

review/text: I started buying powdered milk to reduce the amount of packaging discarded with regular milk.  It also reduces the amount of heavy milk you have to lug into your house.  Our four children go through ALOT of milk so the weight and waste is a huge issue.  This milk tastes great - none of the chalky milk taste I remember from childhood.

review/summary: pretty decent way to have milk without any going bad
review/text: howdy y'all,<br /><br />this is pretty decent stuff. i used to really dislike dry milk cuz of the odd odor and rather unpleasant flavor. the odor - something similar to milk on the verge of going bad - doesn't seem to be there any more, thank goodness. i've become accustomed to the flavor. [*grin*] i don't drink it straight, tho. it's used for cereal, anti-weight-loss drinks and cooking.<br /><br />the price works out well. i use a tad more than the recommended amount to mix a pitcher of milk since i like the flavor a tad more that way. plus, of course, it never goes bad on me since i make only just enuf in each batch to last a few days.<br /><br />rated a THREE cuz it does what i expect and nothing more.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/text: I am so happy that we found this. We are living in a small village on the North Slope in Alaska. It is waaaaay too expensive to buy regular milk and my kids can't stand the shelf stable milk. We tried Saco and the girls loved it. Just don't drink it warm...ugh. Once it is chilled, it tastes just like skim milk. My girls drink it by the glass and use it on their cereal every day. We just mix up a batch in a pitcher at night and by the morning, we are good to go!

review/text: This milk is such a great value to have on hand, less expensive than milk from store and lasts so much longer.  I haven't used it for baking yet.  It does dissolve a lot more easily than other powders I have used.  The flavor is not quite as desirable as others I have tried for drinking, though when I mix it with equal portions of Nido whole milk, it tastes great.

When mixed, it doesn't have that watery taste that milk from powder did when we were kids.  I don't even buy fresh milk anymore.  Tired of it going sour before it is used up.  On cereal or used in cooking, this works great for me.  Hope Amazon doesn't stop carrying it.

review/text: I used this item to prepare a hot chocolate blend. It has a good taste, however, it tends to lump up. Not when mixed with liquid, but the powder congeals. I have prepared about 5 gallons of dry powder mix and there is not a possibility of moisture entering my container, but it still balls up. On it's own, I think it would be fine, but if you're mixing this with other dry ingredients, you might want to seek another option.

These cakes are less expensive than the ones I was buying previously, and they seem to be a bit harder, so they discourage the grackles at least a little, while still attracting the woodpeckers and wrens.

review/text: I miss Milk Duds.  You can hardly buy them here in Australia, but I buy them each time I'm in the States or at specialty stores here.  It's sometimes hard to get through a whole box at a time because your jaw hurts from all the chewing, yet the caramel is amazing.  I can't hold one in my mouth without resisting the temptation to begin chewing, and when you do, the flavour is great.  Once the chocolate on the outside has melted, the caramel comes through and one Dud can keep you chewing for a few minutes as you try to get it out of some teeth.<br />Overall, I definately feel these are a candy for someone with a sweet tooth.  They are addictive and unlike any other confectionary I've had.  This is a good size pack to take to the movies without ruining your appetite, and very very enjoyable.

review/summary: NOT DUDS AT ALL
review/text: They seem a bit smaller than they were a few years back when I first discovered them at a candy counter before a Saturday matinee.  Perhaps it's just because I'm bigger than I was then.  Nonetheless,  the years have not dimmed their sweetness nor their ability to tug at fillings.  (Caution: best to avoid if you have a temporary crown).<br /><br /> The appeal of Milk Duds does not lie in their appearance.  Actually, they resemble small irregular lumps of brown coal.  They're completely covered in milk chocolate without sparkle or icing.  Ah, but what chewy caramel delight lies beneath that dull, drab tasty milk chocolate surface.<br /><br /> The miniature box is quite attractive in tones of gold and brown.  Each little box holds four candies, and there are 24 boxes in a bag.  Just think - 96 Milk Duds for only $21.95.  Consider the hours of rewarding chewing involved.<br /><br /> Life is good, and so are Milk Duds.

review/text: While the food is good quality, it doesn't always arrive in great shape due to insufficient packaging. The shipping box is large enough, but there is never enough tape on it to keep it from opening up due to the heavy weight of the product. Every box I have ever received of this, and I have gotten about 4-5 of them, has been partially, sometimes mostly open and ripped. One bag of the food actually came with a rip in the food bag that someone then taped up with packing tape before mailing. That is totally unacceptable for a food item. I will be buying this from a nearby pet store from now on even though it is more expensive and a 25 minutes drive. Having to take a heavy package like this to the post office to return just isn't worth it.

I lived on these...and then I moved from NY to Florida...and can't find these anywhere. What luck! Hope they are fresh...I will be back to let you know and hopefully buy more. The price is just right...and free super saver shipping...couldn't have gotten any better! I bought the 30 pack mushroom for $34.95 and also the 15 pack shrimp for $17.95

review/summary: they saved many a day for me !!!
review/text: Certs breath mints have been around for ages--and that's proof that these little breath mints work wonders! It practically makes no difference what you've just eaten--onions, garlic or anything else--a Certs peppermint breath mint makes your breath nice and minty as it hides unpleasant odors.<br /><br />The peppermint mints come in small wrapped tubes. Just peel off the paper label and thin foil wrap to pop one in your mouth. Use two (one at a time) if you really want to be extra sure that your breath will be its freshest.<br /><br />Good job, Certs!

review/summary: Tongue Scrapers Just Right
review/text: For some reason the rigid plastic tongue scrapers are hard to find in stores.  The flexible tongue cleaners are not in my view satisfactory.  Glad to find a source for the old kind.  Prompt attention to the order.  No problems.

review/text: I received a pound of Buffalo Bill's hickory pieces as a gift, and enjoyed the size of the pieces and the consistency of the beef's tenderness and flavor. The box happened to come with a couple of samples courtesy of Choo Choo snacks, one of which were a few pieces of the maple pepper beef jerky. After finishing the hickory I went ahead and opened up the maple, and ate it all in maybe 30 seconds. This jerky is so unique and borderline mouthwatering, I actually broke down and bought a pound of it. It's just ever so slightly spicy, and the smell and taste of the maple syrup hits you at the start then lingers after you've finished it. I don't profess to be some sort of food critic, but I figured something this tasty deserved a review with a few big words. So if you like eating healthy and are looking for a nice treat, I really recommend this!

review/text: The taste is OK. Not too tuff, not too sweet or too hot. It just looks like something I would not eat! I did finish the package but not to sure I will reorder any. Not because of the taste.

review/summary: Comfort food with a twist
review/text: When I was growing up, one of my favorite meals was a stack of my mom's hot pancakes with lots of maple syrup flowing over them. The Buffalo Bills Premium Maple Pepper Beef Jerky gives me that great maple syrup taste with a twist.  The classic smokey Buffalo Bills Premium jerky paired with the delicious warm sweetness of maple sugar and the robust taste of cracked black pepper all come together to create a wonderful treat. There is a good balance between the maple sugar and black pepper; both are strong flavors but neither overpowers the taste of this jerky. The size of the Maple Pepper Beef Jerky pieces make it easy to enjoy this treat any time. I'm glad the people at Choo Choo R Snacks are quick with the shipping; they make it so easy to enjoy my favorite jerky.

review/summary: Sit in the ballpark at home
review/text: This is the REAL thing! I love hot dogs! It's the great American food to eat at baseball games. But what do you do when you're at home instead of the ballpark? Use Stadium Mustard with your favorite frankfurter, that's what! This is GOOD mustard, and adds the true, honest to goodness ballpark taste to your dogs! Yum! In some places, it's hard to find, but I can't live without it myself. That's why I order it by the carton. Try it - you'll like it!

review/summary: Very Unique Tasty
review/text: This is just plain great hotdog mustard.  It has a very unique vinegar flavor.  As a kid I'd smother the hotdogs at the old stadium with this stuff.  Roving vendors didn't even have ketchup  as an option at the stadium this mustard was so popular and delicious.

review/summary: At long last; a canned pepper that's not soggy!
review/text: I was born & raised in AZ, my father is a Mexican national (Naturalized). He set the bar pretty high when I was growing up for good quality Mexican food and peppers. When I was a teen, he found a Mexican brand of jalapeno's named Faro. They were great, but you had to buy the big restaurant size cans. The peppers were firm and had a crunch. Then they stopped importing them and for decades we didn't run across any good peppers. All the brands I've tried are soggy. At best, you may find 1/3-1/2 the can has some peppers with some firmness. The rest are soft and/or slimy. We have a family recipe of stuffed jalapenos, using pickled (canned). It requires the peppers to be firm enough to be sliced in half, stuffed with a cheese mixture; and them to support the contents when you pick it up and eat it. Most canned jalapenos turn to mush somewhere in this process; usually at the beginning.<br /><br />To note, I've tried La Costena, Herdez, La Preferida, Casa Fiesta, La Victoria and Ortega. I also tried Trappeys, which comes in a bottle. Their texture is fantastic, but it's not a traditional Mexican pickling. I did buy them for a while for this recipe and they did work great; then Giant Eagle stopped carrying them (I live in Ohio now). Then I was at a small Mexican grocer here and thought I'd pick up the hunt again so I could make the recipe. I grabbed some La Costena, because they're everywhere, and typically you can get a few firm ones in each can. I also grabbed a can of San Marcos, because I couldn't remember if I'd tried them.<br /><br />Let me tell you, these are as good or better than the Faro's my dad used to buy! Every one was firm and fresh, very crunchy for canned jalapenos. And the flavor is fantastic. Being from Mexico, they're canned with the traditional spices, as well as carrot pieces and some onion. My dad likes the carrots, I can't stand them; but they do add to the jalapeno flavor. Hint though. Don't buy them here. Shipping is more than the cost of the product! Just Google your city's name with the words Mexican Market. If I can find them in Akron, OH, you can probably find them in your town.<br /><br />I can't keep these in the house. I eat them with hot dogs, burgers, and sometimes I'll just smear some refried beans on a tortilla with some cheese and throw it in the micro for a minute, just so I can have a quick bean burrito to go along with my craving for these amazing peppers.<br /><br />For something different, try their Serrano peppers as well. Slight different flavor, and slightly hotter. Same texture. Enjoy!
