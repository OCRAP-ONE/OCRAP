review/summary: Can't live without it
review/text: Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively "tested" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back.<br />I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night  to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to "testing" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom.

review/text: As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe. This will add about 4 grams of total sugar to the recipe.

review/summary: Most of the sweet, none of the yuk
review/text: I can taste artificial sweeteners from across the street.  Hate the stuff.  In a restaurant I sent a Coke back three times because they kept bringing me Diet, assuring me it was the real thing.  After the third time I suggested they check their hoses.  Sure enough, they were switched.  Hate the stuff. One sip and my mouth says, "Yuk!" for hours.  This doesn't even get into the fact that aspertame isn't fit for human consumption.<br /><br />Enter Xylitol.  I bought a box of packets to use at the office where I drink coffee.  I find I need two Xylitol packs to replace one sugar.  No matter.  It tastes fine.  I detect no aftertaste.  And it's actually good for my teeth and blood sugar level.  This is something I can like!<br /><br />My only complaint was the shipping packaging.  The box of packets was stuffed into an envelope which, of course, arrived flattened.  Packets were all over the inside.  I reformed the box and reloaded it. No biggie, but putting a rectangular cardboard box in an envelope isn't the best idea.

review/summary: Natural Sweetener
review/text: Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in "Xylichew" chewing gums.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It is commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This "NOW" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates.<br /><br />Each teaspoon contains:<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Sugar Alcohol 4g<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Protein 0g<br /><br />"Now" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes.<br /><br />When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great, but...
review/text: So this stuff taste great. It feels a lot better mentally knowing that it's a natural product and has roughly the same consistency/viscosity as real sugar/sugar crystals. There is one caveat with this product, you will likely have diarrhea until you get used to it. If you use this for coffee like myself and you like to have that coffee before work or something, i would advise you to use it when you won't have issues with that. Supposedly this will stop once you develop some kind of tolerance, but i can't vouch for that since i've used it for the last few days. Other than that i think this is a great alternative to real sugar and the chemicals in other artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Taste Like sugar
review/text: This Xylitol is derived from Non-GMO corn from China.If you haven't used xylitol before you won't really notice a big change in taste compared to regular sugar. It looks like sugar, taste like sugar and sweetens like sugar, This xylitol does not leave a funny after taste like most sugar substitutes and the granules are fine like regular sugar. I find that they dissolve fast especially in hot liquids. It comes in a zip lock type bag which is great. If you have never used xylitol before you may experience bloating/gas till your body gets used to it.<br /><br />There are many health benefits to Xylitol here are a few ,"natural insulin stabilizer, therefore it doesn't cause a spike in blood sugar and actually helps reduce sugar and carbohydrate cravings,counteracts harmful intestine bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, aids in better dental health,lower calories and it has no known toxic levels to humans but it will harm dogs.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Teaspoon (4 g)<br />Servings Per Container: 283<br /><br />Calories  10<br />Calories from Fat  0<br />Total Fat  0 g<br />Total Carbohydrate 4 g<br />Sugars  0 g<br />Xylitol  4 g<br />Sodium  0 mg<br />Protein  0 g<br /><br />Glycemic Index:<br />* Xylitol 7<br />* Agave Nectar 15<br />* Barley Malt Syrup 42<br />* Maple Syrup 54<br />* Backstrap Molasses 55<br />* Honey 62<br />* White Sugar 68<br />* High Fructose Corn Syrup 100<br />* Glucose 100

review/text: I have been using xylitol (natural sugar from birch trees) for about a year.  Other brands were about 75% as sweet as cane sugar, but this brand is perfectly matched, teaspoon for teaspoon.  Without the blood sugar spikes as when using regular sugar, I can't imagine ever going back.  There is simply no downside whatsoever.  Highly recommend this product.

review/summary: xylitol
review/text: I really like xylitol, it doesn't have a bad after taste like other sugar substitutes. I've tried just about all of them, even Stevia - can't stand the taste of it. The only drawback with zylitol is it doesn't mix in cold drinks - but I found a way around that. Put the zylitol in water, heat it up till it dissolves, and then put it in your drink - tried it in tea this way and it worked perfectly. It can give you gas and diarreah if you use too much - just use a small amount till you see how you react to it. This brand seems to be really good - never have had problems with it. As an added benefit it is good for your teeth.

review/summary: Great sugar substitute!
review/text: This is a great sugar substitute that is almost identical to sugar. I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry. I have had no negative reactions though by using this product. I am very happy to discover Xylitol which came from other people's reviews.

review/summary: It's not exactly what I expected
review/text: Recently I switched my bad eating habits to good ones.  Part of that change was finding a sweentner which would not interfere with blood glucose levels much, and tasted good.  I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.  I finally tried it on some plain cereal.  I expected something like the flavor of Splenda, or maybe Equal.  At first, it was sweet like sugar and it was noticable, but it did have an aftertaste.  It was like the old articifial sweeteners.  I tried using less another time, but the result was the same.  I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad.  So, overall, it takes some getting used to.  It's not bad for being healthier than regular sugar but don't expect to be "wowed."

review/summary: Xylitol tastes good. Erythritol doesn't.
review/text: Yeah, don't feed it to dogs. Ok, since I'm human and I don't own dogs and if I did I wouldn't be feeding them sweetened things anyway because dogs are carnivorous, I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the plastic bag my Xylitol came in (I bought the 1 lb size) had a very strong chemical odor. I moved the Xylitol to a metal bowl for storage. NOW should use packaging that doesn't have such a strong plastic off-gassing.<br /><br />Work your way into eating Xylitol (gradually increase consumption over a period of weeks) to avoid gastrointestinal issues. Also be careful of eating too much inulin and other products that can cause a laxative/bloating/gas effect.<br /><br />This tastes good unlike NOW Erythritol which tastes rather horrid, except when making bitter chocolate.

Have to be careful when you are a new user of Xylitol because the side effect of diarhea is real.  My son got it bad from putting it in his coffee the first time.

review/summary: Value!
review/text: This is a huge bag of xylitol.  We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea. I was not loving the sugar, though! My husband is diabetic and I was worried about my son having all that sugar. Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage. The large, good quality, food storage containers are expensive, but it a one time cost. We also have a smaller container for general family use that we re-fill from the larger one.<br /><br />Overall:  I will definitely buy this again!

review/summary: Better than xylitol gum.
review/text: Highly recommended for table sugar. I purchased xylitol gum for dental protection also.  But I think that putting a quarter teaspoon xylitol into my mouth and holding it there reaches far higher molar/molal (pun intended) concentrations, far higher than using gum as the delivery method.  15 pounds seemed like maybe too much until it arrived, when it seemed like not enough after giving a pickle jar full to grandpa and grandma, a jam jar full to work, several jars full to the kids, and using for most sugar uses. Feels slightly different than sugar in the mouth, seems to get very slightly cold when dissolving, tastes every bit as good as table sugar, to me a little better.

review/text: My local health food store charges over $16.00 for a 2.5 Lb bag! To use in iced drinks I put it in a little water then microwave it and pour it into beverage. If you use too much it will cause a problem as the first person (from Maine) mentioned. Three heaping spoons in 16 oz would be too much if you drank the whole thing in one sitting. Two heaping spoons in 12 oz and your okay. Tastes great!

I bake with the more unconventional flours (almond, coconut, sometimes soy) in order to maintain my low carb way of eating. I love the flavor of these baked goods, but I found that I do not like the after-taste I get from the splenda. Xylitol, although more costly, seems to be my answer. I find that I do not need to use as much of it as most recipes call for either. This is a great product, worth the price.

review/text: I am not into sugar substitutes because of the potential health risks so when I use sugar it is sugar not a substitute, when I found out that this really was a natural thing I tried it and loved it. It looks like cane sugar, it tastes like cane sugar and it really sweetens twice as much  (or more) as cane sugar. I have been using for a year now and are very happy. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Diabetics will love it.

review/text: I brought some of these packets with me today so that I could sweeten my tea at work and realized that I made too much coffee for the amount of Xylitol that I had originally put into it before I took off for my commute.<br /><br />The packaging has to be 'special' because Xlyitol is pretty 'humid', in that regular paper packaging would not be optimal.<br /><br />I write this because, although it's perfect for on the go, and the packaging is pretty much 'unavoidable' in regards to properly storing and transporting it, it was a pain in the butt to open one to two packets whilst driving (I had to wait for the next stoplight or I would've veered off of the road in my struggle to open the dang things!).<br /><br />All-in-all a great product. Even after having a 'sweetened' cup of coffee, I don't have a 'fuzzy' mouth, like sugar would normally do!

review/summary: My second bag from here.
review/text: It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body. In contrast to sucrose, or table sugar, whose glycemic index is 100, xylitol's glycemic index is just six.The key to xylitol's benefits is that it helps to break down biofilms. Brushing with xylitol , chewing xylitol gum, or sucking on a xylitol pastille several times a day has an anti-biofilm effect, according to researchers. Without the protective biofilm, bacteria just can't adhere to the enamel and release corrosive substances that cause cavities. Additionally, the bacteria that cause periodontal disease have no place to hide in the gum recesses.

review/summary: Xylitol is good but Z Sweet has fewer side effects
review/text: Xylitol was recommended by my doctor to help combat a familial tendency towards diabetes. It is very much like sugar in taste and form - and offered a terrific way to deal with my preference for sweetened tea and coffee. (Several of my doctors specifically recommended that I do not use Splenda or any other artificial sweetners.)There are some gastrointestinal side effects to Xylitol however.<br /><br />A product called "Z Sweet" was introduced to me as an alternative to Xylitol ... Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo. If memory serves, Z Sweet/Erythritol is not dangerous to dogs.<br /><br />If you find Xylitol useful in your life, as I do, you might want to know about Eryithritol (or Z Sweet) in addition.

review/summary: Premium Edge Senior Dog Food Lamb and Rice
review/text: I have fed my last two dogs Premium Edge Senior dog food with lamb being the protein.  I am currently mixing it with Premium Edge large breed puppy chow which is a 27/16 protein/fat.  Typically German Shepherd's are fed<br />large breed puppy chow through 15 months.  My GS has Panoesteitis (Long Bone Disease) and I needed to reduce the protein without any additional growth components while still feeding her the necessary requirements.  She eats Premium Edge Large Breed Puppy Chow Lamb based and I substitute one of her four cups a day with the Senior Light.  I discontinued her vitamins due to the excess protein and I feed her as mentioned above.  I think the added supplements for seniors helped with her limp and strengthened her bones overall.  She is 13m months old and almost done with the Panoestetis; it is a self-limiting disease and generally heals by 18mo - 2 yrs.  I am not advocating that protein causes Panoesteitis - its just one of the mentioned possible causes.<br />I would recommend Premium Edge which is made by Diamond foods.  Google Diamond Foods and you will see all the brands they supply.

review/text: I cannot say enough good stuff about this dog food.  I've been using this dog food for over 10 years and it has been difficult at best to find.  I'm so glad to see it on amazon!<br /><br />My 8 yo 50 lb. mutt was showing signs of age, sleeping a lot, and basically not much else.  My vet asked what I fed him and I told him Science Diet.  He said - well that's a good food.  I was then turned onto this food (for my 65+ lb lab) and I noticed an enormous difference in my mutt.  He became the fun active dog I'd always known him to be and basically stayed that way till he died at 15.5 years old.  I totally attribute his activity and long life to this food.<br /><br />My lab was always active so in all honesty I did not notice any changes in her.  The food is dosed with glucosamine and chondroitin for healthy joints - which is a nice to have when you have larger breed dogs that sometimes have joint problems.

review/summary: vet recommended
review/text: My Boston is 12 yrs old. Two years ago, he developed a skin condition characterized by flaking, excessive itching and bald spots on his coat. The vet prescribed methazolamide and Omega -3 fish oil: the former was toxic to his system, the latter, alone, didn't improve the condition. She then suggested Premium Edge in combination with the fish oil. I started out with the salmon (blue bag) which he's been up until this month. This time I ordered the lamb and he gobbles it up despite the fact that it's never a good idea to change your pet's diet, taste-wise anyway. Since he's been on Premium Edge, his coat has returned to normal and he no longer suffers itching. Whether or not the cessation of symptoms can be attributed wholly to Premium Edge may be coincidental but I wouldn't feed him anything else, either. I order the 35-lb bag because, for an elder 24 lb dog, it lasts months. Also, I no longer add fish oil. This food seems to provide all the nutritional requirements for a soon-to-be 13 yr old terrier.

review/summary: I love this coffee!
review/text: I'm not a huge coffee drinker; however I do LOVE this coffee. I'm the kind of person who usually has a little coffee with their creamer (if you know what I mean) but with this coffee I can put 1/2 to a full serving of creamer and be totally fine without having to grit my teeth and swallow. I bought my first sample bag of this at target they had little 2oz bags and I loved it. I went all over the city looking for bigger bags and couldn't find them anywhere! I checked all the grocery stores, targets, and Wal-Mart's. I also looked for the Kahlua French Vanilla k-cups but evidentially they don't exist. I've got a Kurig machine so with this coffee I just fill the my-k-cup attachment with the ground coffee and it works great.

review/summary: coffee for people who don't like coffee
review/text: I tried this coffee because of the great reviews.  While it isn't terrible, it just doesn't taste like coffee to me.  If you are a person who needs to put cream and sugar in your coffee, it might be just your thing.  I thought the vanilla taste was just to fake for me.  I have added a piece of vanilla bean to my ground starbucks coffee just before brewing and have gotten much better results.<br />Basically, a coffee for people who don't like coffee.  But then, why not drink tea instead?

review/summary: Whisky Of The Year 2012
review/text: This is Jim Murray's call for whisky of the year in the 2012 Whisky Bible. He gave it a 97.5/100 points. I must say that it is a great whisky. Amazing craftsmanship it hits on all cylinders from nose to finish. Murray's professional skills pull more out of the nose and palate than I ever could, but there is a lot of wonderful malty, vanilla'd barley, citrus, fresh apples, briney complexity going on for sure. Very smooth and balanced all the way through, a touch of salt on the finish, then a beautiful wave of light oil.  Really nice and highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty treat!
review/text: I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!

review/summary: Not the same
review/text: Apparently there are two kinds of the happy hippos by kinder. Although these are good, I defintely the prefer the ones with the darker chocolate.  These pretty much look the same and if this was all I have had, they would probably get five stars, but I know the other one and it is so much better I can't give these more than three.  Also the ordering experience on these wasn't up to par.  I've ordered hippos many times and when I saw 91% off I jumped on the deal, skeptical but still got them.  They were anything but 91% off.  If anything they were more expensive than usual.  Euromart drastically inflated the price, said you were getting a case of them when all you got was a package of 5.  A case is 10 packages of 5 and that wouldve been a great deal and right about 91% off from what I paid for 10 packages of five.  Instead I got way less than I expected and pain a lot more for what I got.  That in and of itself made these less satisfactory.

review/text: These are some of the most delicious store bought treats that I have ever eaten. I cannot eat chocolate, and am always on the lookout for delicious alternatives. My daughter found a packet of Happy Hippos in a store in England, and when we tried them we were delighted. My daughter can eat chocolate, but said that these were easily as good as any chocolate candy she had ever had. They have a creamy hazelnut filling and a crunchy wafer shell-the hippo's body. They are delicious.

review/summary: LifeSavers bring back good memories
review/text: I love these...when we were poor and first married, we'd buy one roll for 5 cents and drive around sharing the candies and enjoying scenery in Germany (where we were stationed). Since then I have bought them from time to time...until a few years ago I found they make great throat lozenges.<br /><br />Now, at my advanced age, I keep a roll by my bed & know just how to get another LifeSaver during the night if my throat gets scratchy. And a roll in my purse for the same reason.<br /><br />So from 5 cents a roll to $40 for 60 rolls, these LifeSavers have always been a bargain.

review/summary: Lifesavers
review/text: PHENOMENAL PRODUCT!!  Had been buying these from Nationwide Candy and paying as much for freight as for the product.  That made the cost per roll right at $1.00.  With the amazon Super Saver shipping, the cost per roll is reduced to $.62!!  Now for the best part!!!...the rolls from Nationwide are .90 Ounces, and the rolls from Amazon are 1.14 Ounces!! Probably 3 to 4 more Lifesavers per roll.<br /><br />I buy these for my 93 year old mother who is in a nursing home and goes through about 5 - 6 rolls per week.  This was a great find (these are next to impossible to find in any stores...lots of Lifesaver products, but NOT the 5 flavor rolls).<br /><br />I will recommend this to anyone that will listen. And...even with the Super Saver shipping, the shipping was incredibly fast.  Absolutely thrilled with this transaction

Bags of gummies or individually wrapped hard Life Savers do not.  (Gummies do not do the trick - in any flavor.)<br /><br />Keep the hard candy roll format!

review/summary: Great quality food!  Even picky dogs love it!
review/text: I can't say enough good things about the Lotus Wholesome Chicken dog food... we recently discovered this brand through our local pet store/groomer/doggy day care, which is known for carrying high quality and mostly natural/holistic brands of food.  We have a very hard time with one of our dogs, he is the pickiest little guy and will skip a meal or two because he gets bored with his food and refuses to eat it.  I have tried just about every high quality brand out there, always wanting the best for my four legged kids, and some of them, he won't even give the time of day.  This is THE FIRST food where he actually jumps up and down when it's dinner time!!!  He loves it, and I love that we're feeding such a high quality food.  The thing that sets Lotus apart from almost every other dog food out there is that it's baked, which helps in retaining a lot of the nutrients and protein, as well as the flavor.  It's packed with lots of high quality meat, grains, fruits and veggies, and everything is sourced in the U.S. and Canada(in the Chicken recipe... the Lamb is from New Zealand).<br /><br />One thing I have noticed, compared to other foods, is that it also has a much milder smell to it.  It just smells like something freshly baked(like tiny little cookies for dogs!).  Some other foods, which are very good, high quality foods, have an overpowering odor.  I think that might be part of the reason our dog turns his nose up at them, because it's too smelly.<br /><br />Luckily Lotus does offer a Small Bites formula in Chicken, Lamb, and Grain-Free Duck, because the regular adult formulas do have a pretty large-sized kibble that might be hard for smaller dogs(like mine).<br /><br />I hope my review helps spread the good word about Lotus and that other doggy parents will give it a try, your dogs will love you for it! :)

review/text: These oysters are small, about the size of the first pinky joint. The texture is firm and meaty, but smoke flavor is not at all strong. The cottonseed oil in here probably masked it. I don't get much smoky or oystery flavor. The ring pull top makes it easy to open.<br /><br />Some slight food safety concerns due to this being a product of China. Normally I read labels carefully before buying, but in my rush, I bought this. I will not purchase this product again and will choose more delicious smoked oysters from countries I feel safer about.

The Lingonberries are an excellent cross between cranberries and strawberries.  Not too sweet not too tart.  Wish the price was a little better otherwise highly recommend.

The only bad thing about this product is it a but to tough for my 4 pound chihuahua, but I guess that helps clean tartar off his teeth so it's okay, it's just a bit hard and I wish it was a tad more soft. Haha now my dogs are following me and are being all good hopping to get another!  Overall very excellent product. I do reccomend this for  small dogs who enjoy meaty treats and are good chewers.

review/text: Thanks to another user's review, I tried these because I could not get organic dates in my local grocery store. What a treat! I don't have to leave my home and these consistently fabulous dates arrive on my doorstep! They do have pits, but completely worth the picking it out to have the soft, sweet, and healthy snack. I have never gotten a bad batch, so the quality control seems to be superb! I love them, and you will too! By the way....these are a much better deal $$$ than what you will pay in the stores for less in the bag!

review/summary: Decline in quality
review/text: The last two batches I received were moldy and inedible. I used to rely on Bergin Nut Company's dates for a sweet pick-me-up, but their quality has declined considerably. I will not be purchasing dates from this company again.

review/summary: Processed in a facility that processes wheat
review/text: These were good. I noticed that they had a statement on them that said they were processed in a facility that processes wheat which is a problem for me. I wish that was advertised. The picture looks like it just says may contain traces of tree nuts. Also, as a heads up to people, these are not pitted, but when you put them in the food processor, the pits come out, but don't grind up - so that's nice. You can just pick them out.

review/text: One you've had Medjool you never go back. They are the softest sweetest dates. I'm a vegan stay away from processed foods and sugars I but still have a sweet tooth. These are a staple in my diet. Incredibly healthy. They are a wonderful candy replacement! Sometimes (if you can find pitted ones) you can stick an almond in the center of a few.

review/summary: very tastey
review/text: I found these are a bit more expensive than my local health food store but they are less moist so I guess I am getting more date and less water?  Whatever I enjoy them and the fact they are organically grown.
