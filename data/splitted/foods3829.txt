review/summary: A Worthy Alternative to Salted Seeds
review/text: I bought these seeds after tiring of the gum pain that comes with continuous mouthfuls of salted sunflower seeds.  I was a bit hesitant at first, but I love eating seeds and decided this was the best alternative.  At first I was put off by the seeming lack of taste of the seeds.  However after a few days I grew accustomed to them and barely notice the difference anymore.  Also I find these seeds to be bigger than the typical store bought sunflower seed brands.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who, like me, tired of the gum pain brought on by mouthfuls of the salty seeds but wants to keep enjoying eating sunflower seeds (not to mention they are much healthier).

review/summary: smooth, soft and tasty
review/text: I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/summary: Brought my dog back to life
review/text: When I first adopted my dog from the local Seattle animal rescue, he had no hair on his back and he had lots of grey/white hairs around his eyes. My vet recommended Natural Balance since it looked like my new dog might be suffering from allergies. We mixed Natural Balance with canned "beef only" dog food. Within a month we noticed the hair was growing back in very nicely and full on his back. Within 6 months, it was hard to believe he ever had a problem. He now has beautiful, long, black wavy hair on his back and most of the gray/white hairs around his eyes have given in to black hair. Natural Balance, mixed with a good, canned dog food, serves your dog the nutrition it needs. I'm sure it would serve just as well for dogs who do not have allergies.<br /><br />Of course, this is expensive dog food, but my dog is worth it.

review/text: Loved it. Hot hot hot (and I love hot, but this sauce is on the "very hot" side of the spectrum even for me - which is a definite plus!!!), with a pleasant smoky flavor so characteristic of the "regular" Sriracha in a bottle. And then there are pleasant, very subtle garlic undertones - in my experience, bottled/canned products with garlic can quite often be very stinky, so I was initially weary of buying this product. But Huey Fong did not disappoint! Garlic here is very pleasing, does not overpower and blends nicely with the smokiness of the base... Buy it - you won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: They're LIFESAVERS, by golly, so everybody KNOWS they taste good already. Here are a few of the finer points. These are sugar free, so people worried about sugar for any of a number of health reasons need not worry about these. They are also individually wrapped. Big deal, you say, so what? Well, you can toss a few in your pocket on the way out to lunch, which is great because they don't give out fancy breath mints at the burger and chili joint drive through. This feature also means that you don't have to throw the tape dispensor at coworkers who thoughtlessly plunge their grubby unwashed hands into your candy supply, should you choose to keep some at the office. They ARE more expensive than those that do NOT come individually wrapped, however, buying by the case helps defray the cost, and it's worth the small added expense for the convenience and to spare the lives of your office mates.

review/text: I was delighted that this was sugar free for the same price as sugared version. I was getting 12 packs in each box and wondered why the boxes [ i bought 2] was so small on arrival. I have been buying the sugared version for over a year and the boxes were always larger. To my surprise instead of 44 pieces each bag has 22. I give these away free at work and thought about thier teeth. Anyway, they are going to have to worry about their own teeth because I am going back to the sugared type. i have them so much longer that way!

review/summary: AWESOME hot sauce at an AWESOME PRICE!!!!
review/text: HOW GOOD A DEAL IS THIS?  The math:  I paid $62.09 for this gallon of hot sauce, all said-and-done with shipping.  A gallon is 128 ounces.  The small bottles of the same sauce are 5 ounces.  So there are 128/5 = 25.6 small bottles in this gallon bottle.  The best price I could find for the small bottles was $7 at a local grocery store (exorbitant, yes, but cheaper than on Amazon!).  So if you bought a gallon of this sauce in separate 5-ounce bottles it would cost you 25.6 * 7 = $179.20.  That's about THREE TIMES the price of this gallon.  What a DEAL!!!  I go through a *lot* of hot sauce -- I love it on eggs, which I have almost every morning.  And I douse them with hot sauce!  But, the relevant question is:<br /><br />HOW GOOD IS THE SAUCE?  Full disclosure: I don't care for regular Tabasco sauce.  I find it watery and kind of bland.  But I LOVE good hot sauce and I LOVE HOT FOOD.  And I mean *actually* hot, not what you get at, say, chain restaurants that say "hot" (for example, I've eaten lots of different kinds  of peppers.  That includes serranos, jalapenos, anaheim, Thai and habanero -- all raw with nothing else.  Some where from a garden, picked right off the plant.  WOW some of them are hot!  I've also eaten a ghost chili, dried, that I bought on Amazon.  It was rough.  I made a video of it that perhaps will someday see the light of day.  I didn't react like you see on YouTube, people rolling on the floor for hours and so on.  I was a little more "prepared," perhaps, due to all of the actually hot food I eat.  But it was still the hottest thing I've ever eaten.  I also like the beer "Ghost Faced Killah" by Twisted Pine brewery.  It's made with ghost chilies.  It's *really* hot but delicious and totally enjoyable).  Anyway, I've also tried lots of different brands of hot sauce -- one by one I've tried all of the small company, artisinal sauces I can find locally.  There are a lot here in the Front Range (Colorado) and many of them are pretty pricey.  Some of my favorite hot sauce ever is a friend's family recipe handed down through the generations in Louisiana, made fresh from peppers grown in their garden.  Given all of this information, I was really skeptical when I bought my first bottle of Tabasco Habanero hot sauce.  I thought, "how good can it really be?  I don't like ordinary Tabasco, and it's a huge company.  Can they make a good hot sauce on a large scale?"  I mean, every huge brewery whose beer I've tried I hate.  Needless to say I was totally shocked at how good this Tabasco Habanero sauce is.  It's actually the best commercially-produced hot sauce I've ever had.  It's absolutely DELICIOUS, and it's got quite a kick too!  It's not for people who can't handle even modestly hot food.  But if you like your hot sauce hot and flavorful, give this a try.  I used to spend like $10-$15 a week on hot sauce (a few bottles of small-company, craft hot sauce).  But this Tabasco flavor is better and WAY cheaper.  They've saved me a ton of money on a product I actually love -- how awesome is that?!  If you've already tried this sauce and like it, then buy this gallon.  If you haven't tried this sauce, get a small bottle locally or online before you buy the big one perhaps (I could only find it locally at a Whole Foods -- none of the "regular" grocery stores carry this flavor in my area).

review/summary: a winning brand extension, but I wish the packaging were nicer
review/text: Tabasco Habanero is similar to regular Tabasco sauce, but more picante. If you haven't tried it, you should try a smaller bottle first before committing yourself to a gallon of the stuff. See, for example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNC8VW">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce 5oz.</a><br /><br />As others have noted, you'll want to have a funnel and a smaller bottle to transfer the sauce into for daily use. I have one at home and another at the office.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that the one gallon jug lacks pinache. A plastic cap? Customers loyal enough to buy this thing probably want to show it off, but to my eye, this jug looks cheap.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I think "Restful Don" covered it all in his review, but I just wanted to wholeheartedly agree. :-)<br /><br />I have been a lifelong fan of hot sauce, and though I like to occasionally test my limits with the super hot stuff, Habanero Tabasco is my absolute favorite for daily use.<br /><br />It's sufficiently hot, but also has great flavor. I use a "Frank's Red Hot" bottle (re-labeled, as suggested) to dispense it, and use a small funnel to refill it whenever I need to.<br /><br />The small bottles at the grocery store will cost you about a dollar an ounce - buying the whole gallon will cost you almost half that.<br /><br />Also, you'll save yourself the hassle of the store being sold out - my gallon lasted me almost an entire year!

review/summary: The ultimate hot sauce!
review/text: I love hot sauce.  Always have.  Tried a lot of 'em.  Most are too lame heat-wise and others are just off the chart, taking the pleasure out of the meal.  But Tabasco's Habanero is their best and simply kick-***!  It's hard to find it in the small bottles at any grocery store and when you do it is way overpriced.  I buy the gallon container and just refill my small bottles.  If using bottles other than Tabasco make sure you label it as "XXX hot!"  You'll love the heat and the taste.  It is my standby and I even keep a bottle on my Harley for wherever I go.

review/summary: The Best...
review/text: I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HO0F1Q">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon</a> and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco.

review/summary: Boo I say.  Tabasco lies.
review/text: First off, allow me quote the label.  "Tabasco Habanero Sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper."  What?!  That's funny, I don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients.  How is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim?<br /><br />False advertising aside, I bought a bottle for thirty-five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled.  The moment came and I shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig..and...nothing.  Minutes later, another big swig; a third of the bottle now gone.  I waited patiently to no avail.  Maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin, but not me.  So, thankfully I didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment.  Maybe ithe positive reviewers drank a whole gallon and that's where I went wrong.  Yes, I am a SHU snob, and if you need to look up what "SHU" is, then this sauce is for you.  Even Tabasco's website, which doesn't require a recall to correct, is loaded with inaccurate [read deceitful] claims.  I've had hotter jalapenos from Domino's pizza than Tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce.  Stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream Tabasco; you're way out of your league.<br /><br />That said, this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids.  Certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast.<br /><br />But hey, this is just my opinion.  Much like Tabasco's opinion on "the world's hottest pepper"; no real merit.<br /><br />Worth noting, this is only the second time I've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which I have little of to share my opinion.

Finally thought to look on Amazon, and not only are they just like I remembered, they're WAY cheaper buying in bulk!<br /><br />Actually, not just like I remembered - these are way more moist and tasty than when I used to buy them.  I assume the ones in the store were probably old and stale which is why they were more like leather in their consistency, while these are like thick fruit rollups.<br /><br />Will definitely be buying these again!

My son (age 17) and I tried this fruit leather for the first time.  He thought the grape tasted like plastic.  I thought it tasted better than plastic, but that it could use a stronger fruit flavor.  He rated it 1, and I would rate it 3.  The flavor of the tropical fruit is much better than that of the grape.

I must admit, however, that the aftertaste - so common to all sugar substitutes - is very very remote. As a result, these cinnamon candies are the ONLY non-sugar-sweetened item in my widely varied, daily intake. Share my experience, have some! Fifty mints to the box, that's plenty for sharing, too!

review/summary: Dentyne Fire Mints, Spicy Cinnamon
review/text: I was very happy that I found these mints here on Amazon.com!! I have not been able to find them anywhere But here. I even called the Co. that makes and distributes them, where I can find them in my area and every place that they told me they were sold does not even sell them. I talk to between 1500 and 2000 poeple a day and these mints are the only ones that work for me! For what I paid for them, the cost for a single pack is about a $1.63 at amazon, where as the places I used to by them was $1.99 per pack, almost $2.20 with tax. As long as amazon can keep them in stock, I will buy them.<br /><br />Ken Hafter

review/summary: Must be the bean counters decision ...
review/text: I understand this product is unavailable now... I thought it was excellent because of the way it added to my meats flavor as a sauce OVER  the seasonings. I used Chipole as an ingredient in my rub, so the sauce was a nice counterpoint to the overall flavorings. I am sorry now that I used the last of this sauce, but, sooner or later I had to, I guess :( I hope I can find some of this sauce somewhere before summer. One more (probable) case of letting bean counters rule, (sales of) it must not have crossed the threshold required to keep it on the market....

The addition of the almond not only ruined what was best about this candy (biting into one expecting the lovely dark chocolate ball in the center only to find a foul tasting nut in the center was not a very pleasant experience), but it put the one ingredient I'm allergic to as the centerpiece.

review/summary: Highly recommended for white teeth and clean mouth
review/text: Everyone, including the vets, comments on my small Munsterlander's gleaming white teeth and clean mouth.  I give Pedigree DentaStix all the credit.  Brushing my dog's teeth didn't sound like something I wanted tackle, but the thought of my dog having dental problems that he couldn't tell me about was out of the question.  So my dog has had DentaStix every single day since he came into our lives (at the age of nine weeks).  My dog thinks they are wonderful treats, and he doesn't have to put up with having his teeth brushed or scaled.  It's a win-win situation.

review/text: The list price shows $44.90, the shipping weight shows 4.4 pounds, even a previous review mentioned getting a whole display box of these 7oz packages, so that's what I assumed I was getting...Not true! I paid $4.79 + $5.99 shipping for ONE 7oz pack.... I could have purchased these at the grocery store for about the same price, and I wouldn't have had to wait for them to ship.  The product by Pedigree is great, my dog loves them, and she has the best doggy breath around, and her teeth are always clean. I recommend the product itself, but purchase it elsewhere because PetCo will rip you off.

review/summary: I like to try different things and found this in a Mexican grocery
review/text: A few years ago, I took my friend to a Mexican grocery for her to pick up something they made for her and while there, I spotted and bought a package of this and cooked it without using the caramel packet.  Since you cook it almost like regular Jello pudding, I was surprised at the baked custard texture and flavor, almost like homemade.  The packet you cook in milk has pretty yellow granules.  As usual I'm wondering what else I might be able to do with it.  Anyway, I was just at the regular store and was surprised to see this so I picked up a box.  Meant to get two.  Oh well.  I get home and excited to try it right away so it can cool overnight.  Well, I hope I didn't ruin it but it boiled over, so I shoved it off the burner and spilled a bunch on top of the stove making a mess.  Cleaned that up and poured into prepared glass bowls.  So if it doesn't set right, I'll get a couple more and try it again in a 3-quart pot.  The reason it boiled over is I thought it would never boil at medium and was getting impatient and turned the burner up too high.  Once it starts to boil, it goes fast.  I do recommend a heavy aluminum pot and stir constantly especially as it gets hotter.  I don't know if this will scorch, but cornstarch pudding and lemon pie filling sure will, and I just hate it when burnt pieces get scraped up into whatever it is I'm cooking.  That didn't happen with this.

review/text: This product is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I started buying them in a natural foods market however they don't always have them in stock.  When I could not find them I gave my dog a different biscuit that she turned her nose up to.  I then went on line and ordered a case of them.  Our dog has seen tremendous improvement in her mobility.  Our vet could not diagnose what was causing our dogs mobility problems and was ordering more and more costly tests.  We decided to go the homeopathic route and are so glad we found these.  I have recommended these to my family and friends and hope they have as much success as we have had.  Gods blessings to you and your special friends.

review/summary: Vet is amazed
review/text: I originally bought this product because it was Michigan made and my mother swore by cherry juice. We have had our Mahlah (Bernase mix) on them for several years now and they have made all the difference in the world. Three years ago they told us she needed hip replacements, but they were concerned her heart might not be strong enough to make it through the surgery. They took x-rays--I saw them--virtually no cartilage (I am a RN). I asked how she could even be walking, leave alone running, the vet didn't know. We give her 2-3 treats daily. The last time I took her to the vet-- the vet was amazed. He told me whatever I am doing keep doing it--to me that means keep giving her hip bones and encouraging her to stretch those ligaments--run after a squirrel or two daily. I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those with large dogs.
