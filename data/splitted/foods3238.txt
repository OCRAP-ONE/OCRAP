review/text: Just be forewarned it is a bit "moist."  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it.<br /><br />However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!<br /><br />My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well :-)

review/summary: Try every flavor in singles before buying in bulk.
review/text: I've tried almost all the flavors, and my favorites are Teriyaki and Thai Peanut (both are sweet and savory).  For about 100 calories and 10 grams of protein, this makes a great snack.  I hadn't eaten these in a couple of years, but when I got pregnant I started craving the Teriyaki again so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon in bulk.

review/summary: Yummy, even to an carni/omnivore
review/text: I'm an avowed omnivore.  I love me some jerky, too.  Meat in all forms, really.  An exchange with an old girlfriend summed it up quite well... "You know, you don't have to eat meat every day," she said. My response was stunned silence.  The point?  These are darned tasty to a meat-lover like myself.  Not just these, but the entire line (that I've tried so far).<br /><br />No, you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat-like, despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it, anyway?!).  However, it does have a satisfying chew, and unlike real jerky, you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky, these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh, they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.  And they do a pretty good job on the flavoring, too!<br /><br />Bottom line: it ain't meat, but it's amazing for a plant!

review/summary: Great taste and texture
review/text: The teriyaki seitan strips have great smoky/sweet barbecue taste and a nice stringy, "pulled" texture. They're full of protein and 100 calories each (I wish it were even a little less), which makes for a great snack. They dont't taste like beef jerky, but it's not supposed to. They're isolated soy-free (there's a little soy from the soy sauce in it), as the base is vital wheat gluten. I carry one in my purse all the time just in case I get hungry.

review/summary: Decent, but a little odd
review/text: I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.

review/summary: AMAZING
review/text: This is just simply delicious! I have so far tried the Texas BBQ and the Mesquite Lime and I can't describe how tasty it is! I've never had real beef jerky before so the only way I could see someone giving this a bad review, is if it doesn't taste how someone would expect but whatever it taste like believe me, it's delicious! The jerky is not dry, because they seal in the perfect amount of sauce so its not wet, but moist!<br /><br />The particular packages I tried however looked different than the picture amazon has here so I'm not sure if Primal Spirit has changed their marketing recently and these are old pictures, or if when you order it, it will actually look like the picture shown. If you go to their website, the pictures on the website are exactly what I purchased from Whole Foods. I'd love to buy them online for the convenience but, I'd like to be sure they are the same packaging and not an older version<br /><br />Anyway, great product! Hope to try all the flavors soon!

I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.  A lot come in a box and they are a great snack to carry with you!

review/summary: A Very Satisfying Snack
review/text: I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!

review/summary: Really terrible! Try another flavor. Don't waste your money!
review/text: I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The "lime" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer.

review/text: This is the only veggie jerquee my local grocery store carries and is a good substitute for when I don't feel like ordering my favorite(stonewalls) online.<br />I like the flavor and the texture but I always need scissors to open the package and I hate the thought of my germy scissors touching my food.<br />Once you finally open it, it's hard to really get a good bite because it is very stringy and full of sauce, you usually end up with half the product in one bite just so you don't get sauce all over your hands and mouth.<br />I often get it stuck in my teeth too, which is annoying when I'm at work without dental floss.<br />I think they are redesigning the package so hopefully it will be easier to eat soon. They could work on the price too, $1.29 at the store for 2 bites is a bit ridiculous!

review/summary: Good flavor, but a wet mess
review/text: I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.

review/summary: Very tasty and healthy jerky snack!
review/text: Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.

That said, I think all the spicy Stonewall's jerky varieties and peppered Tofurky Jerky are a superior jerky.

review/summary: The Best I've Found So Far
review/text: Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!

review/text: SO GOOD.<br />Just in case anyone was wondering. I know every vegan/vegetarian says this, but even my carnivorous brother liked it. He's the crazy outdoors type though- savage all the way, carving things out of wood, building shelters in the woods, survival stuff. So I trust his meat-comparison ratings. Most veggie people, when it comes to fake meat, tend to say "it's all about the sauce". While this is true, this also has the texture. It's more of the soft slim-jim texture I remember (though we can argue- is that really meat? hah)- moist and moderately chewy. I'm curious if sticking these in a dehydrator will make them more jerky like. Anyway I like the mesquite lime. It's not too sweet, tangy and just delicious. I recommend!

review/summary: Spirited Jerky Product
review/text: The package arrived promptly and all contents in excellent condition. The product is very tasty, though it is a slight bit too peppery for my taste. I have tried all their varieties, and I like this one and Texas BBQ best. The mesquite is also good, and much milder. They have the texture just right--you wouldn't know it wasn't meat if it were a blind taste test. It is a little wet as a jerky, which makes it a tad messy. Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet. Ideal for camping, keeping in the car glovebox,in a briefcase or bag, etc. for those times when you need a boost. But for the pepper, I would have given 5 stars, so I rate this 4 stars. Enjoy!

However, the mesquite lime (green packaging) is so good that it makes me say phrases that I never say (bomb diggity) and praise its deliciousness here so that all may come to know the little bit of tongue heaven that it is. Strong, bold flavor and perfect chewy texture. The only down side is that once you're done, you want more. Hence, get the pack of 24. The mesquite lime flavor is so good that I dare not try the other flavors any time soon and taint my Primal Strip food-gasmic journey.

review/summary: My Favorite Snack
review/text: Bought one stick of this at a health food store and loved it!  I often crave a jerky like food.  This completely satisfied my craving.  The health food store was selling them for 2bucks each so it was a no brainer to just order a box.  I got the hickory smoked.<br /><br />I have also tried the Teriyaki flavor, but didn't like it much.

review/text: I haven't tried the other flavors because they don't sound as appealing as Thai Peanut, which my whole family loves.  I don't know if "jerky" is quite the word, as it obviously throws off some people who only call the hard, dry stuff jerky. But this is a yummy, flavorful snack with a nice, chewy texture and just a touch of that tough-to-bite-off feel.  A great toss-in-the-bag snack for when we go out that satisfies the craving for something savory.

review/text: I ordered a box of the Mesquite Lime after finding the Texas BBQ at my local organic grocery store. I love both flavors but am glad I got a bulk of the lime. It's delicious! I love that its only 75 calories and yet so high in protein. It's hard for me (as a vegetarian) to get enough protein while still keeping my carbs low. The standard protein bar usually has way too much sugar for my liking. These are a great afternoon snack and perfect after an intense workout.

review/summary: Good texture, bad taste
review/text: I'm not a vegetarian, but I have trouble finding decent jerky and decided to try the Texas BBQ flavor. I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture, but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums, but that's true with all meat. Besides texture, it also tasted like meat. However, it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet, and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though, so they're not completely wasted.

review/summary: Surprising
review/text: And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato-y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.  I can't wait to try more flavors!

review/summary: Yummy - even for non-vegetarians!
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat-like.<br />I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!

review/text: I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!<br /><br />But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat. Was flavored nicely, a little mosit, and it left me wanting more!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought only one as I think I could have eaten several :)<br /><br />Also, love the fact its only 81 Calories, with 1g of Fat but still has 10g's of Protein!!

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less "saucy", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a "stringy" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line.

The Hickory Smoked variety is very flavorful with a little bit of a spicy kick.

I would say that of all the varieties of Primal Strips, this is currently my favorite.

review/text: I've tried all flavors of Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky and the Mesquite Lime is my personal favorite, but it depends on your taste. If you're a fan of limes as I am, you'll love this flavor. Its a bit tart. It is also a very tender texture as compared with the others. The Hot and Spicy flavor is my second favorite. It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!

A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.

review/text: This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems: the inner packaging isn't that easy to deal with, a knife is needed to cut it open.  So not a great on-the-go food.  Also, there is not a lot of volume for the 400 calories, so it's not a good food if you are watching your weight.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious soup! And organic too!
review/text: I strongly disagree with the review that said that this soup was horribly bland.  I found this soup to be absolutely delicious! Plain black bean soup can be very earthy tasting, but this soup was the perfect blend of the black beans and a variety of organic vegetables, including onions, carrots, celery, leeks, potatoes and corn. It's high in protein and fiber, *extremely* low in fat, and the sodium level is not as bad as a lot of other soups. It is such a delight to be able to find a canned soup that is not only fresh-tasting and delicious, but also totally organic.<br /><br />I plan to buy a case of this soup...Amazon's price ends up being $1.72 per can for the case of 12 cans, with no tax or shipping charges. Our local grocery stores charge $2.19 per can + sales tax, so buying it by the case at Amazon saves me $6.00 for the 12 cans.<br /><br />You should buy a single can of this soup first (in your local grocery store) to try it. Then if you love it as much as I do, you can buy the case (of 12 cans) at Amazon and save yourself some money.

review/text: I am a huge organic products enthusiast, and I am a fan of Amy's products. I bought this soup in hopes of it having some sort of pizzaz. I was sorely disappointed.<br />After having heated it up, I tasted it and was shocked with how bland it was. It was a meek soup, almost as if they created a black bean base, tossed some veggies in and left it at that. Uh...where are the spices?! The herbs?! The excitement!<br />Only after adding some hot sauce, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, and sour cream did the soup become worthy to be eaten with the rest of my lunch.<br />If you are a fan of more mild soups, this could be for you. If you're just a fan of plain veggie soups, this certainly could be for you. But if you like a little jazz in your soup, don't buy this unless you're ready to dump a jar of salsa in.

First of all, I was expecting there to actually be black beans in it but it was more like a black bean puree. But thats the least of problems with this soup. It had a very distinct, and to me, disgusting flavor that I cannot pinpoint. Possibly the leeks? Or maybe the spice combination was off. I could not even finish eating it. I brought it to work to have for lunch and ended up throwing it out and getting some peanut butter sandwich crakers from the vending machine instead.

This is more like the texture of split pea soup, but I also like split pea soup, so that was not a minus at all.<br /><br />The black beans form a creamy, hearty base, with carrots, corn, potatoes, onions, and best of all (at least to me) leeks! I can't quite describe what the leeks add to this soup, except that they smell amazing and they bring a piquant flavor that's similar to but different from the onions and garlic. Only, you'd better really like leeks before eating this soup, because you're going to be tasting them for a while after.

I saute a few carrots, half an onion, and a few stalks of celery and then add them to a couple cans of the simmering soup. I'm not a vegetarian so I also add a bit of cooked meat (whatever I have in the fridge .. usually ground pork or chicken, or chopped chicken breast). This is a huge favorite of every person in my family. Cooked this way it makes a hearty and delicious meal which can be served over whole grain rice or with a slice of whole grain bread. Yum!

It hardly tasted like black bean soup, it was so sweet and bitter at the same time... tangy, but not in a good way. After I forced myself to finish most of it, I suffered from really bad heartburn afterwards. Some people may like the taste, but I definitely did NOT enjoy it. Like the other user said, the only reason this soup deserves 2 stars is because it is healthy.<br /><br />I tried McDougall's Black Bean & Lime soup before and I thought it tasted pretty good; definitely a good alternative to Amy's black bean vegetable.<br /><br />Dr. McDougall's Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup, 3.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 12)

review/summary: horribly bland; worst black bean soup I've had
review/text: While the ingredients may be organic and healthy, the soup is bland and impossible to eat without having to basically re-make it. It has no flavor at all, except perhaps a nagging sweetness from the corn. If you are interested in a savory treat or something healthy AND delicious, then find something else, or be ready to whip out your pot and start over. I'll never buy this again. The only reason it gets an extra star is because it's good for you, but that is its Only redeeming quality.

review/text: Do not buy this soup!

ONly buy soups that are sold in TETRA PAK they are safe!

review/text: My god, I am generally no fan of canned food of any type, but being a horrific cook and having little or no time, without checking it prior, I decided to try this black bean soup, otherwise one of my favorite dishes when it's done properly; but this watered down gibberish is so tasteless that I'd gave up on it after three or four spoonfuls...Organic and vegan or even vegetarian doesn't have to mean 'tasteless' or at least it shouldn't be defined/perceived as such. Even crazy vegans deserve a heartier stew!

I love the packaging and all that...and the quality of Stash Teas.... so when I was looking for lemon tea I decided to try this.<br /><br />As usual this tea looks great with its wonderful lemony color . Very pure looking...and wonderful. Unfortunately--I am not crazy about the taste of this particular blend and I do not LOVE it. I need to LOVE my teas. There is something in this tea --maybe the blossoms. It dosen't taste bad---just not exactly how I would want it to taste.<br /><br />I would still suggest that you try this tea.You may enjoy it more  than I...but the next time I'm looking for lemon tea---I will try another brand ! I want a straight lemon taste and thats all. Nothing else !

review/text: The flavor of this tea is not as good as other Golden Monkey teas that I've had.  It is kind of weak.  Also where the other Golden Monkey teas have a very nice buttery, honey kind of flavor (reminds me of butterbeer in the Harry Potter books), this tea has a hint of that, but really to me more of a soapy taste.  It's not horrible, so I'm giving it two stars instead of one.  I've been much happier with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPEWO">The Tao of Tea, Golden Monkey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and I think I'll go back to that.

review/summary: THE JOYS OF FINDING SOMETHING NEW!
review/text: Got turned on to the idea of "Manuka Honey" (originally, from Hawaian Bees feasting on the Manuka Plant/Flower) while reading about it after sampling 42 Below Vodka, and trying to find their Manuka Honey Vodka (seems none of the liquor stores in my region want to stock it), so with my curiosity peaked, I ordered the "Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 12+ from Amazon. And as secrets unfold, it seems it is often used in the manufacture of some medications. After a week of using it, taking a teaspoon a day before breakfast, I must say, it is doing something to my body! And I like! The flavor and aroma is quite strong, and unless your pockets are lined with gold, it is a tad expensive to use as a sweetner, but honestly it may be worth doing so.<br /><br />It was well packed, and promptly arrived by some Air Express delivery service. First used it to sweeten a cup of Green Tea, though on the second day, I read the label and ingested it alone before my first meal of the day, according to the suggested instructions on the label. Hey, I'm no Scientist, but there's definitely something to it, and unless you have an allergy to Bees, I'd recommend trying it...  GBJ

review/text: The taste is all right, consistency thicker than supermarket honey. Bought it for assistance with my rabid GERD, alas, so far no progress with this or the other health irritations I hope to at least somewhat get a relief from. Nonetheless, one lives on hope and I already ordered a second jar just to give it a real try. I take a heaping teaspoon in the morning on empty stomach, and one or two follow ups during the day or at night before sleep. But as I've already said, no relief yet, have not been able to go without Zantac even though I've added two additional natural remedies against vicious heartburn.<br />The honey is expensive, and that the jar is plastic, disturbs me. For the price they could have used glass!

review/summary: Wonder Healing
review/text: After reading lots of online reviews searching for an alternate remedy to cure a deep hurt on my horse's hoof, I decided to buy this product and what had been an open wound for 4 months healed in 10 days. The hurt was always close to manure and exposed to constant infection. With this honey, no infection would get to the wound, as no bacteria survive in honey. The speed of the healing effect was amazing. My Doberman also swallowed a hairband and had to have 6 inches of his intestine removed. I gave him the honey to eat and also put it on his wound. The effect of healing was amazing again and his wound was completely dry and closed in 3 days. After these two examples, I basically use this honey on any wounds, rashes, etc. A scratch heals in one day and does not leave any scars. I would recommend 3 days straight use with bandages for the effect to be 100%, changing bandages and reapplying the honey 3 times a day. When you think nothing would cure a wound, this product will better than antibiotic ointments!

review/text: This is my second time ordering Active 12+ Manuka Honey.  I like the honey so there's no issue there.  However, either Amazon or H20 Health Solutions is incorrectly packaging the honey.  I ordered two jars of the 17.6oz (500g) product and instead received two jars of the 8.8oz (250g) honey.<br /><br />The Honey comes wrapped in a clear plastic wrapper, which has a barcode label on it.  Even this label is incorrect, stating the contents are "X00070JBX1 Manuka Honey Active 12+ (500g) 17.6 - Ounce Jar" even when the label on the jar clearly states it contains 8.8oz (250g)<br /><br />Amazon was excellent and prompt at providing a refund for the difference. However, I'd like to order the larger jars since it is cheaper per ounce. So I hope Amazon or H20 gets this fixed in their fulfillment center.

It's pure crap. For starters, the K-Cup doesn't even feel like there is anything inside it. When you brew, a brown liquid (I can't call this coffee) comes out for a second or two, then nothing but water. I have to choke it down. Easily the worst coffee I've had in a long time. I'm throwing the box away. No sense in drinking this drek when I have good stuff in my cabinet.

review/text: This is pretty awful.  It absolutely tastes like instant coffee as others have posted.  I have shared this with two of my coworkers who both came to the same conclusion.  Do not waste your money on this.  If you have a Keurig then spend the extra money and get real K-cups from any other company.

review/text: This syrup has a sweet, peach flavor that makes for great peach iced tea or poured over vanilla ice cream. I look forward to trying other flavors from this company.

review/summary: Great peach flavor!
review/text: Monin Peach Flavored Syrup tastes great!  I was looking for a syrup to imitate the flavor of the peach iced tea at our favorite restaurant and this is it.  It's also great in mixed drinks!  I'm going to order more flavors!

review/summary: Great flavor, but
review/text: This gum has a great flavor, but it doesn't last long (and when I say long I mean more than 2 minutes).  I do like that it is vegan and doesn't animal fats and things of that sort like many other gums do.  I would still buy this because even though it doesn't last long the flavor is tasty and strong for a few seconds then slowly goes away within a couple of minutes.  One other thing I'm not too fond of is it's stickiness.  It has an odd consistancy.  If I try to remove it from my mouth it stays trapped in my teeth and carries a long sting of gum as I pull it away.

review/text: Doesn't taste like lemon-lime to me but it's still a nice flavor and it's refreshing. The flavor lasts 3-5 minutes.

review/summary: amazing gum!
review/text: Great taste, no cancer causing ingredients (e.g. artificial sweeteners, coloring, preservatives). What else can you ask for?<br /><br />The only thing is, the flavor goes away quick. I wish it'd last a bit longer but otherwise no complaints.

review/summary: Really juicy and flavorful
review/text: I love this gum. It arrived fresh and it tastes better than the Chiclets I had in my youth - plus it's healthy! Sweetened with Xylitol means that it's good for your teeth. Very nice gum.
