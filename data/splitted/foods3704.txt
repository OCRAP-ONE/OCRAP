review/summary: Zukes HipAction for Dogs - Works
review/text: I have a 12 year old Corgi that has been having problems going up and down stairs, has had no interest in playing with toys over the last year.  Went to the Vet and they gave him Rimadyl.  This helped some but still was having issues, and having to carry him up and down stairs.<br /><br />Started giving him the Zukes on a whim after seeing it in the local pet store.  This stuff WORKS I am sold.  He is playing with other dogs now, goes up and down the stairs, brings toys for us to play with him again.  He is like his old self again.

review/summary: Really a great beneficial bar that tastes phenomenal
review/text: I have had this bar before and decided to buy it in more of a mass quantity because its cheaper. They are expensive but they are expensive for a reason. The quality of what goes into it instead of poor/non nutritional supplements. This bar is low in calories and is high in benefits. The taste of it is excellent and it curbs my sweet tooth. For me to even write about a bar is huge. That's how because i think its a good product. I hate bars that tote they are healthy and have poor ingredients. Why eat it? because its great for weight loss? Read the ingredients! If you cant understand the ingredients don't buy it just because you think it will help curb your appetite or make you lose weight. Their are sooo many artificial enhanced chemicals out there that we are exposed to enough. Try putting something purer in your body and you will notice a difference.

review/summary: Baconnaise
review/text: Who would have thought? This is great stuff! Vegetarian mayo that tastes like bacon. It works well on burgers, sandwiches, in salads (egg salad, etc), or just by itself as a dip. My only complaints are the jar is small at 12 ounces, and even though the sodium content is relatively low, it tastes on the saltier side. I actually take the Baconnaise and mix it with regular mayo. This cuts back on the saltiness, and makes the smaller jar last longer.

review/text: Absolutely delicious. My only quibble is that it's a little saltier than I'd prefer so I use sparingly. A little goes a long way. It has no pork in it, which is great for vegetarians. Check out the blog on their website, it's got a lot of tasty uses and recipes. It doesn't seem to be widely available in stores so Amazon's 3 bottle price with free super saver shipping is a good deal.

Give it a try and have fun coming up with ways to use it.

That same site put Baconnaise on sale and I couldn't resist scooping up a jar. If you love the TASTE of bacon but hate the THOUGHT of it, this stuff is for you.

review/summary: Doesn't Really Taste Like Bacon, But Is A Delicious Treat None-the-less
review/text: Ordered this after reading a review on the AV Club.<br /><br />Right off the bat, it doesn't taste like spreadable bacon mixed with mayonnaise.  It reminds one of bacon, and goes great with items that you'd pair bacon with, such as burgers, eggs, etc.  However, the flavor is much better described as smokey seasoned mayonnaise. It's a little on the salty side, but that didn't bother me or most of my friends.<br /><br />This is to say that it's delicious, and again works well on just about everything you put it on. It's also vegetarian, and fun at a party or office pot luck.  Most of my coworkers were scared of it at first, but enjoyed it after they had a taste.

review/text: As a true bacon lover I looked forward to this with taste-buds a-tingling only to be disappointed. The bacon flavoring apparently comes from a lab in New Jersey. Has a heavy chemical taste, and especially after-taste. As a party favor or gag gift it's fine, but if you're really looking for something to add pizzazz to your food, just make it yourself or hope some other company comes up with a better tasting version.

I don't use it every morning as it adds an additional 80 fat-laden calories per slice.  Spreading it on your bacon is the meat lovers equivalent of the popular chocolate donut with chocolate icing... crumble some pork rinds over the top and you have the equivalent of chocolate sprinkles.

This hell-spawned abomination has no bacon in it at all.Not even hateful turkey bacon. No bacon. Only chemicals. It would be a fair approximation for bacon, I suppose, if I had never had bacon, but had merely had it described to me by a severely brain-damaged transient who had also never had bacon, but had read about it on wikipedia. Suitable only for the filthiest of hippies, and haters of bacon.

review/summary: Tragically disappointing.
review/text: My girl surprised me with a jar of Baconnaise this week after I'd gazed wishfully at the jar in a couple of fancy food stores over the last year. I was delighted to receive it, since I'm a fan of all kinds of smoky flavors, bacon and otherwise. I've had vegetarian "bacon strips" and vegan bacon bits that were tasty, and I think even turkey bacon is okay if you cook it right, so the bar was not set too high at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Baconnaise can't even reach that Bac-Os level of fake bacon flavor. One small dab for each of us, and we recoiled and put the lid back on. If the label hadn't told me to expect it to taste like bacon, I have no idea what I would have thought it tasted like, but it would not have been bacon. Or mayonnaise, for that matter. Its flavor is complex, and I could see someone developing a taste for it, as with other products with flavors derived from yeast or other kinds of fermentation.<br /><br />That someone will not be me, though. I offered some to our three bacon-loving cats as a kind of second (or third, fourth and fifth) opinion. They couldn't get away from it fast enough either, and one of them even steals the vegan "jerky" I buy from time to time. So the Baconnaise ended up in the garbage bin. For now, if I want to add bacon flavor to something without adding bacon, I'll stick with the bright red facon bits.<br /><br />Maybe it's just an individual preference thing. I see a wide range of opinions in the reviews to date. I may still try J&D's other products -- they have a version of Bacon Salt that's free of MSG, for example -- but for me, Baconnaise doesn't live up to the hype, the promise, or even its own label.

review/text: It's not real bacon, it's basically bacon bit flavored. But that's not a bad thing. This tastes great on grilled foods, and is a hit with my friends. Noone believes it's kosher dairy after eating it.

review/summary: Baconnaise
review/text: if you have tried and like the various flavors of Bacon Salt, you will also like Baconnaise...or if you are not a big fan of mayonnaise, you should try this instead...bacon flavored mayonnaise is awesome.<br /><br />I have put it on turkey, ham and roast beef sandwiches, Arby's Roast Beef, Wendy's Hamburgers, made chicken salad with it, and will be trying potato salad made with Baconnaise instead of mayo this week.<br /><br />for lunch today to take to work, I am making a wrap by spreading Baconnaise on a tortilla, adding Dietz and Watson Homestyle Turkey that is chipped instead of sliced, American cheese, shredded lettuce, and diced Bread and Butter pickles. Not only will the Baconnaise add flavor and moisture, it will also help to seal the wrap, and keep it together.

review/text: As a dabbler who enjoys spanning the entire spectrum of taste, I am more than willing to try anything once.  Both as a food aficionado and a lover of bacon, I just had to pick this up.  One taste caused me to throw out my sandwich, and subsequently throw out the entire jar of unused mayonnaise.<br /><br />I would give this less than 1 star, if I could.<br /><br />Steer clear from this unless you're a major tool who has no sensibility past buying bacon-everything.

review/text: I love bacon and mayo.  I thought this would be fun and interesting.  Well, it does not taste good.  It tastes too artificial.  I ended up throwing away the mayo after using it a few times.  I just couldn't make myself like it.  Maybe I'm too much of a foodie and can pick out the artificial flavors.  I definitely don't recommend buying the bacon spread.  I guess I'll just cook bacon.

review/text: I am not a picky eater. I love mayonnaise and I love bacon. Naturally I had to buy this when I saw it. After tasting I am baffled at how the company that makes it could have messed it up so bad. It literally tastes what I imagine a bacon flavored dog snack would taste like. I forced myself to try it on a turkey sandwich and could barely stomach it. I can't imagine how anyone could enjoy this.

It is salty beyond compare. I mean, it is inedibly salty. And it has that fake bacon taste that just doesn't cut it. It's also outrageously expensive, which I wouldn't mind if it tasted good.

review/text: After accidentally getting the "Lite" baconnaise, which tasted just awful, I ordered the original, and boy is it good! It's just what I hoped it would taste like: mayo with a rich baconny flavor. I put it on just about everything! Although it's probably taking several years off my life, it's well worth it! I've decided that I don't want to live to be 100 eating like a rabbit. I'd rather live to be 68-ish eating whatever the hell I want. And baconnaise is definitely one of those things I want!<br /><br />Highly recommended, just don't get the "Lite"-- (I wouldn't wish the "Lite" version on my worst enemy.) My only real gripe is the thin, cheapy plastic jar....

review/text: I like bacon on burgers and BLT's and was hopeful that this would give the bacon taste without the health concerns of bacon.  Big disappointment.  Smells like the Bac'n Bite dog treats I give my dog, probably tastes similar also.  Imagine a cheap store brand Mayo with liquid smoke and salt added you'll get the idea.  Full of artificial ingredients and chemical additives. Too salty and fake tasting.  I'll just stick with a good Mayo and skip the bacon.

The only thing I don't like about this is that it's way too salty, so use it sparingly because a little will go a long way.

review/text: Bought this on a whim, great Amazon pricing, by the way.  A lot less than buying from the Baconnaise website.  Now, my husband is hooked on this product!  He likes to use it as his main condiment now.  It really does taste just like bacon, as everyone has said, with no meat products in it.  Good on sandwiches, french fries, hot dogs, etc.  It does have almost as many calories as mayonnaise, though, so you might not want to use it as liberally as my husband has!  Get the 3 pack and if you decide you don't like it, it would be a cool thing to put into a food gift basket for a holiday present.  Hubby likes it so much, he even became a fan of Baconnaise on Facebook!

review/text: Purchased three of the plastic jars for $11 plus shipping.  The consistency is about like regular mayo, maybe a little less viscous.  Have tried it on sandwiches, hot dogs and a few other items.  If you are looking for a big bacon flavor, don't buy this item.  The flavor is very mild and sometimes undetectable on sandwiches with other strong flavors.  It's an OK substitute for mayo, but for the price vs quantity, will probably just buy mayo in the future.

review/text: After reading no less than fifty-four reviews of J&D's Baconnaise Bacon-Flavored Spread, I decided to pick up a 3-pack. Could it be as good as some proclaimed, or as bad others protested? Well, I tried it, and after a number of tastes, I came to a conclusion that should settle the matter once for all. The conclusion?<br /><br />Baconnaise Bacon-Flavored Spread is actually caesar salad dressing.<br /><br />Can I really be the first person to notice this? Here are the key ingredients listed on the label: egg yolk, garlic, onion, oil, salt, sugar, plus the usual batch of chemicals like gluconic acid that take the place of the lemon juice, vinegar, and worcestershire sauce that you'd use to make the dressing at home. I also see paprika present, which would help account for the orangish color.<br /><br />So in summary, if you like caesar salad dressing, you will enjoy J&D's Baconnaise.

review/summary: Disappointment of the century
review/text: I love bacon, I love mayonnaise, and I have an affinity to highly processed foods.  In short, I'm your ideal Baconnaise consumer and when I heard this product existed I was in disbelief.  When I brought up the Amazon product page, my mouth was literally watering as I ordered a 3-pack.<br /><br />After a grueling 2-day wait (courtesy of Amazon Prime), my baconnaise arrived and I slathered it onto a ham sandwich and sunk my teeth into it with high expectations.  What followed was the letdown of the century.  It doesn't taste good - it's hard to explain, but to me it tastes overly artificially flavoured (tastes like a big jar of anchovies or something, like a stank and overly fishy Caesar dressing).<br /><br />One star, and if I could give zero I would.  To add insult to injury, Amazon (as far as I can tell) only offers this in three packs, so I was stuck with three jars of it.  I tried unsuccessfully to pawn this garbage off on my friends and coworkers, but to no avail.  I ended up throwing it in the garbage - In the process I probably violated some environmental regs against throwing hazardous waste into the regular garbage.<br /><br />Don't bother with this stuff, or better yet if you are as curious as I was try and sucker one of your friends into buying it and try it on a sandwich before buying.

review/text: Look, its salty and creamy and on a sandwich esp a BLT it will perk it up but taste it on its own and meh.  I love the spirit of the company after going to their website and appreciate the effort in making this vegan but I think as a product it would be much better with some eggs and real bacon flavor in there, imho.  I have a regular jar of mayo here and I just added some cooled bacon fat and some bacon crumbles and its way better even if its not shelf stable and therein for me lies the problem.  If you have the time to make real bacon once a week and mix it with some mayo, its way better.  If you don't and you like the idea well, here it is.<br /><br />To reiterate, this is a brilliant concept but unless I was a vegan I would just DIY.

I will not limit myself to the occasional delight of this smooth bacon flavor.<br /><br />Just warm in a heat proof dish in the microwave for approximately 10 to 15 seconds, you want it to be slightly above body temperature. Enjoy drizzled on top of any ice cream or gelato flavor my favorites are Guinness (reminds me of happy hour), coffee (like breakfast for dessert), and rum raison (because everything is better with raisons). Following the same warming instructions above gets you a unique love potion that can really spice things up. And applied to the skin either warm or straight out of the fridge will endure you to a crowd of admirers you would never have attracted before. Heck even vegans cannot resist that certain allure that only bacon provides.

In fact, more americans DIE every year from Salmonela poisoning than from swine flu, lightning strikes and roadside bombs combined!  Look it up!  I can't wait to be President so we can outlaw mayonnaise and put the criminals who make it behind bars where they belong and in this instance, THE DEATH PENALTY for wasting perfectly good bacon!!!

review/summary: Where's the mouse?
review/text: I don't have much time.  I am a cat being held prisoner somewhere in Southern California.  The dog is watching, but he is easily fooled. I told him I'm playing the piano, he is a moron.  While I am not "mistreated" in the usual sense of the word, I must escape before I go mad.  The large, hairless two-legged creatures who hold me prisoner are well-meaning, I think, but so unevolved, they are almost to be pitied if I did not hate them so.<br /><br />They feed me this pasty food in a can. Me. Cat.  I am a hunter, a living weapon.  I crave blood, fresh warm meat between my teeth.  I yearn for crunchy bones filled with hot marrow.  Not Chicken and Tuna shreds in sauce. Last month I almost caught a moth. Ahh, the chase. First, my lethal approach...subtle yet as perilously accurate as an arrow.  Inch by inch I crept up to my prey, every muscle alive, every sense at it's peak, yet as silent as death.  The juicy moth just sat there, never sensing my presence.  I came close, very close, paused and then -- I pounced!  If the fools had a shorter table I would never have overshot the mark and hit the wall.  Damn them forever.  My ear, my beautiful ear...a precision instrument and objet d'art all in one, was bent.  Yes, bent.<br /><br />And what did the two legs do? They punished ME. Yes, As punishment I was taken to a place called The Vet, where other two-legged monsters did unspeakable things like shaving my beautiful fur and putting strips of white fabric over my beautiful head. Then they forced a megaphone over my head.  This trip was far less horrifying than my last visit, however.  You wouldn't believe what they did to me. You Would Not Believe It.  I can hardly believe it myself except when I look down and...well, never mind, but it's worse than you could ever imagine. Ever.<br /><br />Finally The Vet creatures returned me to my captors...but they would not remove The Cone of Humiliation from off my head.  "Two more weeks, Beebo, you need to wear it for two more weeks and then you'll be fine, azza bwave Beebo, bwave bwave boy."  That's the sentence they handed down.  The Cone of Humiliation is designed to break me.  It will not, even though the dog now laughs at me.  At ME.<br /><br />Let him laugh.  I have plans for him.  Yes indeedy. I have plans.<br /><br />The Two-Legs call me Beebo.  "Izzee my baby Beebo. Izze wanna skwatchie skwatchie ittle Beebo, come to Mommy, Mommy wuv Beebo" they say. To Me. Me, the Warrior King.  I am not a cocker spaniel.  I am a living weapon, a Cat.  Were it not for the ear-scratching, head-scratching, special pillow near the fireplace and opportunities to torment the dog, I would dispose of the two-leggers and escape.  I do not wish to harm two such well-meaning but stupid creatures, but I must have meat.  I would eat the dog, but I've seen what he eats, and quite frankly, I'm appalled.<br /><br />Please, if anyone is out there, help me.  Send meat...a box of mice...fat and juicy ones...would make a life of captivity almost livable.  Also, since you are putting the package together, I could do with another Feather on a String, two boxes of Fishy Treatz (not the liver, mind you), oh, and one more thing...a chicken bone. A nice, easily-shattered, sharp edged chicken bone...with a nice little piece of bacon to wrap it in. A gift for a friend, shall we say...<br /><br />Act fast. Please.

review/text: Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY... He always thinks it's one of these... Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. So whenever I have soup or whatever, I give him one of these. This is the only kind of food that I KNOW he likes. And it keeps him healthy. I can tell when cat food isn't that good for him.

review/summary: It's okay, but a little chewy
review/text: I used to buy this for my meat and potatoes male Persian, until his teeth went haywire. After having most of his teeth removed, he can no longer chew these hunks of meat, which are at least 1/2 inch long in some cases.  They're great on flavor, contain a lot of rich gravy, but if your cat cannot chew, there's no way they can manage with this one unless they swallow it whole. I have to resort to the shreds, which he LOVES, but he liked these for a change once in awhile.  I heat them up too before serving them since the older cats get, they can sometimes lose their sense of smell. Works like a charm if yours isn't eating.  Recommend based on past experience, but the are other varieties that appear to be more tasty for the cats.  Particularly their shreds.

As soon as I opened the can, he came running and did not walk away after a few minutes as he usually does with other brands.  He ate the entire can!!  WOW!  He LOVES this food!  I plan to set up a subscribe and save order as I finally found a canned food my cat likes to eat.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Water sufficient for processing, liver, wheat gluten, and meat by-products. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Good Deal....Fresh And Fun
review/text: This is a really good deal on cat nip here on Amazon.  Catnip isn't something that is usually that expensive, and a little of it goes a long ways.  But I have seen some difference in varieties and brands in the past.  (0ne of my worst being the more expensive organic stuff that didn't work on getting my cats silly at all).  This Cosmic brand I have had excellent results with.  It seems really strong, and my two cats have a ball with it.  Just sprinkle a little about one of their play toys, outside, or on a newspaper and watch your kitty roll around and get drunk on it.  I get best results with this and most catnip brands by exposing them to just a little bit of it, and then waiting at least 2 hours when the affect will be fresh on them.  But that's a real minimum.  I usually use this a couple of times a week to make it last and get maximum fun with it for me, and my cats.  Catnip is totally harmless to your cat, they love it, and you and your family will have a lot of fun watching your pet roll around and luxuriate in it.  This Cosmic brand is a good deal for some really fresh catnip and I highly recommend it...
