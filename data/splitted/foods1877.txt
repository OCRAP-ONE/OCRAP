review/summary: The Best so Far
review/text: I really like this starter. I tried a different brand and it turned my yogurt sour and it was very soft. This one produces a good flavour in cow and goat milk. Although, my goat milk yogurt never sets up, it has an outstanding flavour- my daughter loves it this way. She adds about 1 Tbs. of Honey and some thawed raspberries and it is like a little smoothie.<br /><br /> We add a little honey and some raspberries and it is soooo much better than anything you could ever find in a store. Also, with the recommendation of Elain Gottschall in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0969276818">Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet</a>, we let our yogurt "cook" for 24 hours, which produces the best yogurt you could ever eat. Why 24 hours? Because you get Billions and Billions of the right kinds of bacteria, instead of only millions that you get in commercial yogurt; not to mention all of the sugar and artificial flavours that commercial yogurt contains. *NOTE: If you don't like or can't eat honey, Agave Nectar is pretty good in homemade yogurt also.

review/summary: Better Have It Shipped Refrigerated!
review/text: This stuff works fine until it doesn't.  Then a call to the company reveals that you should have kept it refrigerated or else it can "bloom" and lose its potency.  However, it is not SOLD or SHIPPED under refrigeration, so what gives?  Use prepared yogurt instead for consistent results.

review/summary: Great Yogurt Culture
review/text: I use the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Starter to make my yogurt with the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker YM100. It makes a great yogurt. My only suggestion is that you stir the culture into the milk very well, as I found it a bit difficult to dissolve. I now take some of the prepared milk into a separate container, add the culture and stir to blend extremely well, then add it back into the entire prepared milk. This assures that the culture was dissolved properly and gets evenly distributed.

review/summary: Reliable starter
review/text: This product works exactly as advertised and dissolves easily, producing somewhat tart yogurt in about 7hours.  The resulting yogurt can be used as a starter if frozen and stored for later defrost.  I would argue however that buying plain yogurt allows you to decide what taste you want and works just as well.  If you live 50 mile from a supermarket, buy this but if you want to experiment, buy as many store yogurts as you can find and use the brand whose taste you like as a starter.

review/summary: Perfect thick yogurt
review/text: I have the Euro Cuisine yogurt maker and have used store bought natural yogurt as a starter, but the results were not always as thick as I would have liked, however, when I used this product, I got thick, beautiful, tangy yogurt.<br /><br />My only problem with it is if you freeze it then defrost it, the defrosted yogurt is as runny as water and using it as a starter left my fresh yogurt runny too.<br /><br />I'd rather keep buying culture than deal with runny yogurt.<br /><br />3/26/2012 UPDATE: I'm starting to find it too expensive to buy the yogurt starters. I found a nice alternative in Dannon Oikos Greek Yogurt - plain. It's 1 dollar at our local walmart (cheaper if you have a coupon) and works just as well. Just make sure to use a stick blender to distribute the store bought yogurt culture evenly through your homemade product. It does yield a yogurt with more whey, so I like to strain the end product a little through cheesecloth to get a thicker, firmer yogurt.

review/summary: First time using this starter
review/text: It's been years since I've made homemade yogurt.  I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017YS1GI">Waring Pro YM350 Professional Yogurt Maker</a> and decided to try this product.  The last time I made yogurt, I had used plain Breyer's yogurt and knew it works fine.<br /><br />This starter works very well, and, although I'm still in the experimenting stages, I was quite pleased with the results.  I've made two batches so far, the first with this starter, the second using yogurt from my first batch.  I'm going to make some in the future using some store bought yogurt for a starter and see which I prefer.  I've also got to figure out the best time to leave the yogurt in the maker, as my first batch was quite tart; the second was in less time and wasn't quite so tart.<br /><br />Will I continue to use this product?  I'm not sure, I guess part of that decision depends on how long I can keep using my yogurt as a starter.  I intend to keep some of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EONEU0">Euro Cuisine Yogurt Starter</a> around though.  It would certainly be more handy than running to the store to by a small container of yogurt to start a new batch.<br /><br />Also, the shipping was excellent on this.  I got it 3 days after I placed my order and that was 2 or 3 days earlier than expected.<br /><br />Buy some and try it.  I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

review/summary: a bit too expensive
review/text: I'm a newcomer in the world of home yogurt-making. Just bought [ASIN:B000EX16RY Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker.]] Decided to start with "professional" yogurt cultures rather then buying organic yogurt in the store to use as a starter. Girmi worked perfectly and gave me very silky and tasty yogurt. However, I had a couple things in mind: 1) to make a yogurt for my family where I know what I added and not some "yellow 34, red 5 and aspartame sweetener identical to natural". 2) lower cost - paying $1.19 for a small container of Greek yogurt is a bit annoying. With Girmi starter going around $2.50 per packet to make 7 6-oz jars of yogurt (plus milk, plus yogurt machine) it'll be a long time before I "break even". You can "reuse" Girmi cultures probably just once - i.e. use one 1 jar from the first batch as a yogurt starter for another. I ended up buying a jar of yogurt starter at WholeFoods (about $34, should last me through 30 quarts of yogurt making).

review/text: i used this to make yogurt and it worked to well, (or maybe i processed too long) but i got lots of whey and a cheesy yogurt that with a little more time would be ricotta cheese.  the stuff was very active.  i will try to make cheese the next time.  seems a little pricey as you can get a good greek yogurt to start your process for around a buck.  i will try a smaller amount of starter to see if it can be more cost effective.

I let it cook a bit longer than recommended, but half an hour shouldn't be enough to make it sour.  To be fair, I added zero sugar, and I usually put a couple tablespoons in each batch, so that may be the cause of the minor edge.  Will add to this if adding sugar resolves that concern.<br /><br />Overall very pleased with the product and firmness of the yogurt it makes.

Better than the store variety any day!

review/text: Well, the good news is, it does what it's supposed to, making yogurt thicken to the consistency we tend to like it.  The bad news is, it's not much more than just simply super expensive powdered milk.  I remember long ago when dry milk was a staple that was given out at food banks, etc., and was a super cheap commodity.  Now, it's hard to find and extremely costly, but at least you get a lot of it when you do buy a box of it.  This starter is teeny tiny and makes one batch, more than doubling the cost of the yogurt.  Next time around, I tried a little gelatin, and it worked exactly the same way.

review/text: Absolutely! It is by far the nicest tasting granola I have ever had. It is not the same texture as most granola. It isn't extremely hard and crunchy. It is a bit softer in texture, but this doesn't mean that it sops up milk like a sponge if you choose to eat it more like a cereal. It remains the same lovely texture, not too hard, and definitely not mushy.<br /><br />As for its flavour, it's a bit nutty tasting. The cranberries in it are a splendid bit of tart-sweetness, and the sunflower seeds are gorgeous as well. I generally mix a bit of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola in with my Crispix. It's a scrummy touch to the Crispix, and makes the 12 ounce bag of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola last a lot longer. (I tend to have this for breakfast and at least one snack a day.)<br /><br />I give Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola five stars for its taste, texture, and nutrition.

review/summary: breakfast everyday!
review/text: My husband has this for breakfast everyday.  It has a good balance of protein to carbs to sugar.  Many of the other high protein cereals have a high amount of sugar and this does not, so this is the only one he will eat.  I was buying it all the time from the grocery store and it was getting expensive and we alwyas ran out before i could go buy more, so I decided to try the automatic shipment plan from amazon.  So great!  We get an automatic shipment of 6 bags of cereal once a month and it costs less than at the grocery store. Plus, I don't have to worry about running out of it. I am getting other things also from the auto delivery program and it is so easy and really works out well.  You can cancel a shipment at any time and/or change the frequency at any time..  There is no commitment which is so surprising and terrific!

review/summary: Fabulous and Non-Existent
review/text: By far the best granola I've ever tasted: crunchy, crisp, not too sweet, not mushy, not cloyingly filled with heavy spices, perfect.  I like it with yogurt and fresh fruit and it is over the top.  Correction:  "I used to liked it with yogurt and fresh fruit and it used to be over the top."  The problem: it does not appear to exist anymore.  I've checked all the local stores, asked the purchasing manager at one, and none of them know why they can't get any.  They've been stocking other Bear Naked products (a very vanilla, sweet brand called Fit Almond Vanilla Crunch) in place of Peak Protein. It is not in stock at Amazon or any of the other net sites, and it is not in stock at Bear Naked's home web page, but there is no explanation by Bear Naked about why and the Bear Naked Faq says nothing about it.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Kellogg's had taken over Bear Naked.  If that is the case, perhaps they are reformulating Peak Protein, improving what was already perfect, like Coca Cola did when it brought out "New Coke."; at least Coke gave Cokeheads a forewarning, allowing them to stack up on the old stuff before it was pulled off the market.

review/summary: It's different now.
review/text: I don't think it's my imagination or just two bad bags; Peak Protein has been changed.  I bought 2 bags from 2 different stores and there was almost no fruit in the granola.  My daughter has always wanted the cranberries from my granola because they were better than ones I could buy separately.  First the cranberries changed to not as good quality and then in the bags I bought around June or July the fruit almost entirely disappeared.  There were about 6 cranberries in the entire bag!<br /><br />I miss the real Peak Protein.  No other granola for sale is as good.  I've started making my own granola because I wanted something as good as Peak Protein used to be.  Turns out it's not that hard -- not to mention far less expensive.

review/summary: I am addicted to this delicious cereal
review/text: I love the cinnamon taste and the crunch. My only quibbles are that it can be very hit and miss when it comes to how much fruit you get in the bag and how many clusters. Sometimes you get wonderful big chunks of granola clusters, and other times it is fragmented down to the last oat and sunflower seed. Also, as someone pointed out, the protein is soy based and this cereal is not organic. Frankly, for the price, it should be!  Naturally, anyone allergic to nuts should steer clear of this product. One other point to keep in mind is that the serving size is a quarter of a cup, so this can be a high calorie and high priced breakfast compared to a simply hardboiled egg. Don't let the high protein claim on the front fool you.<br /><br />Having said all that, it keeps me full and cuts down on my sugar cravings so if you want to use it as meal or snack any time of the day, it is  delicious.

review/text: I've been consuming this product for a few years & have never been  disappointed by its quality. Sometimes I'll grab a handful & chow down to relieve a hunger pang or provide an energy jump-start. But I normally use Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola in my protein shake mid-day or shortly after a work out. It adds great flavor, a moderate amount of protein & (bulk) substance to what would otherwise be a plain smoothie. It's hard not to get hooked and devourer half a bag at a sitting. But just like most foods, eat in moderation. Bear Naked Granola also has fat & sugar content that should be closely monitored.

review/text: I have tried all the flavors by Bear Naked and I admit they do taste terrific.  I'm not too fond of the Banana cereal but the rest are pretty good.  The granola is done just right...not too hard, not sweet at all, and nice and chunky!<br /><br />My only gripe is that after it goes down, it lays very heavily on my stomach causing a terrible heartburn that lingers for hours.  I thought it was just my body but my son has been eating it too and just this morning he asked me if it makes me feel sick.  I said "not sick, but I do have indigestion."  He said that must be what he is feeling.<br /><br />We both say it tastes great but I think it's good to use just a few tablespoons at a time, like just add it to yogurt,  not to eat as a bowl of cereal.  It's just too heavy.<br /><br />If it weren't for that awful feeling afterwards, I would definitely have given this product five stars based on taste and excellent granola-type consistency.

I prepared it on the stove and I was really annoyed to find out that the cheese packet powder is WHITE, and not ORANGE like they advertise on the box. I hate when the cheese is white, it looks so unappetizing. The taste isn't horrible but it's nothing special at all. My husband tried it and refused to take more than a bite, and he'll eat anything. All these positive reviews are just buying into the Natural gimmick.

There are two things that make it easier to make.  First use a pot watcher, this will prevent boiling over - read about it in Wikipedia.  Second, make the sauce in the pot before putting the macaroni back in.  Let the butter or margarine melt, add the milk, and then the cheese mix. Mix it up and then put the macaroni back it.

review/text: I've had this licorice many times over the years, although this is the first time I've bought it on Amazon.  The flavor is authentic and strong, since it contains real licorice root extract and molasses.  The texture is very soft and chewy, and it will stick to your teeth somewhat.  But I prefer it over artificially flavored, plasticky  American licorice like Twizzlers. Real licorice has health benefits, too!  It's high in iron, it's soothing to ulcers and coughs, it works as a mild laxative, and it has been proven to have anti-bacterial and anti-viral qualities.<br /><br />It's not a candy you can sit and eat mindlessly - four large pieces contains 140 calories, 19 grams of sugar and 31 grams of carbs. Plus re-read the laxative part above.  But with licorice this rich and delicious, a couple of pieces is enough.  I think of Kookaburra licorice as candy for adults.

There are no ingredients needed besides the mix, ice, and fresh fruit.  Jet Smoothies do not disappoint.  There are many flavors to choose from and I am writing this here because this review is one of the more memorable flavors.  However, it is worthy to note that my favorite smoothie was Green Apple Strawberry and it used the Green Apple mix with fresh strawberries.  I am sure you could make a wide variety of delicious smoothies with this mix.  It is great for parties or great for cafeterias.  The only problem I see is with the price.  I wish they sold them individually.  I am sure you can make similar smoothies to Jamba's popular "Strawberries Wild" flavor if your into that too.

review/summary: Being Naked Is Good!
review/text: I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.<br /><br />Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.<br /><br />The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.<br /><br />Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly.

review/summary: Great Granola, Not fresh from Amazon
review/text: This granola is really good, but the stuff from Amazon is not fresh.  The whole bag is a solid brick of granola when you receive it.  It is pretty stale.  I've gotten it several times, and my experience has been consistent.

review/text: Guess what I'm eating right now?<br /><br />You guessed it...Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola!<br /><br />I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)<br /><br />I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!<br /><br />It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt.<br /><br />There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:<br /><br />140 calories (60 from fat)<br /><br />Total Fat 7 g (10% DV)<br /><br />NO Trans Fat<br /><br />NO Cholesterol<br /><br />5 mg sodium<br /><br />17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)<br /><br />3 g protein<br /><br />If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.<br /><br />(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!)

review/summary: Good enough to start eating breakfast again!
review/text: This stuff is awesome. A great-tasting mix of all-natural granola, WHOLE almonds & walnuts, and banana chips that make breakfast the best meal of my day! I'm not a huge banana fan, but the flavor here is perfect: the bananas don't overpower the nuts and vice-versa. What I like the most is that every mouthful is a little different, depending on the mix of banana, granola, and nuts you happen to get. Great with milk or as a snack. Even though the bag looks small in comparison with the boxes of cereal on the grocer's shelf, you get nearly the same amount of stuff, and the quality is 1000% better than any other granola on the market (just compare the list of ingredients and you'll see what I'm talking about.) Highly recommended, also try the Apple Cinnamon and Fruit & Nut varieties.

review/summary: Not bad ...
review/text: I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ...  I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite.  The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?).  Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store.  Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it.

I was recently forced to go on a low-sodium diet due to congenital high blood pressure, and finding things with little to no sodium that actually taste good has been REALLY hard.  I picked the Bear Naked All-Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut last night and it is wonderful.  Its pleasantly sweet-not bland, and leaves a great aftertaste, unlike other natural granolas.  the fruit and nuts in it are fresh, even without preservatives.  Better yet, it has 0 (zero, none, nada) sodium!!  A little Bear Naked and some soy milk in the morning and I'm set.  I definitely will recommend this to all my family and friends.  Thanks Bear Naked!

review/text: I really like Granola, and have tried many different kinds.  Most of them are just too sweet, more like candy than a nutritious treat with grains and fruit.  These are perfect, I like the Fruit and Nut, it has big whole nuts, so big in fact, I have to pick them out before giving them to my two year old Great Niece that I watch.  My husband prefers the Peak Protien, which has very little fruit because he doesn't like dried fruit.  Those are the only two I have tried but plan on trying them all.

I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best....and this granola REALLY is.  Less fat, sodium (and all the other stuff you don't want) than other boxed brands I've tried, but tons of flavor you might not expect from a "natural food".  Hats off to the two who started this company.  The banana nut granola DOES taste great!  And I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it again :)...now I just have to get the rest of my family in line...

Bear Naked items tend to be expensive in local supermarkets, and the prices are a little better at stores such as Costco.  Costco tends to be out of stock or does not hav the flavor we want.  Purchasing through Amazon was cheaper then the supermarket, cheaper then Costco, and the shipping was prompt and free.

Whole almonds and raisins, cranberries, etc.  But for the price, I was a little disappointed, I expected much more.  The vitamins and minerals are a little on the short side of this product, but mostly beat anything comparable in the grocery aisle.  Like another reviewer, I could also smell a "plastic" odor in the package, but the granola did not have a bad taste nor a bad smell.  The resealable bags are nice, especially to keep the product fresh.

review/text: I found this brand in a local health food store, and more recently in the Targets in my area. It's wonderful stuff. I've yet to eat it as a cereal for breakfast, though. I just pop open the bag and eat it by the handful as a snack. Not too sweet, just enough to taste good. I was recently disappointed in the Vanilla Almond Crunch variety, it tasted too strongly of oil to me. The banana nut has never disappointed. I recommend that you find it locally if you can, to try the flavors, then come to Amazon to buy the ones you like best. The price here is almost $1 off per bag compared to Target.

I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt.  When I went off of refined sugar I was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added.  Bear Naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup.  My favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut, plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture.  I recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat.

Of course, like all granola, they seem to think that 1/4 cup is one serving...yeah...right; I've watched my husband sit down with the whole bag and a spoon while watching television! I don't eat it that often (calories, doncha know!), because I can't seem to limit myself to 1/4 cup either! This flavor is his favorite (the ones with added protein have an additional flavor that he finds objectionable), which is why we buy it in bulk from Amazon.com.

I asked the Bear Naked company if this cereal was involved in the recall. They said no<br />it was not. I still did not open the cereal. Then 3 weeks later I actually found it on the recall list. Then they<br />listed it on their site. I inquired again and asked for a refund. Sent several emails and received no response.<br />They do not back their own products. They were apparently using crappy peanuts in there own cereal and did not even know the source of the peanuts. Can't trust them on any of there items. I never got a refund. This company cannot be trusted. Stay away.

I admit that it mostly stands true to its claim and, more importantly, whole grain oats are fairly chewable and like that fact that it retains its natural texture too. As other reviewer has pointed out, taste is very well balanced, neither too sweet nor too bland. It comes with nice ziplock bag with all those printed claims that gives impression as if its a sole survivor of past 'age of raw food' and boasts of not having ingredients that any unprocessed food should not have. Neverthless, it keeps granola fresh. May not be able to convince GMO-free community since label has no mention of it (I am sure these guys would put it in billboard fonts if it were ;D).

review/text: This is a very good tasting granola. The almonds in the "banana nut" flavor are very hard, so if this is not a problem go for it and try it out! The cost is high for such a small amount of granola and it doesn't last long even buying it in bulk packages of pack of six in 12 ounce packs. It's all natural which is good, but for the cost I think it would be worth the time to buy the ingredients yourself to save some money.

The walnuts and almonds are big and pack a punch of flavor.  I could care less for the raisins, but I am not a big fan of them in any setting.<br /><br />My favorite preparations are over some plain vanilla yogurt (especially if you add fresh berries), or simply as is for a light snack.  I also like to add some other dried fruit to make it last longer.<br /><br />This is a great item for those with dietary restrictions.  When I fast for Lent or other Orthodox fasts, I always grab a bag as a filling snack.<br /><br />I could not be happier.  This product is simple, good, and versatile.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Best granola going! I eat it every morning with vanilla or plain yogurt. Who says you have to have a pop tart or a doughnut to get a quick breakfast! This has healthy whole grain, healthy nuts (whole, not tiny bits) and healthy fruits. LOVE IT!
