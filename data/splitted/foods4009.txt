review/summary: Cats Like it
review/text: I have been feeding my cats dry food that is supposed to be minimally processed. I have found that they have been much healthier. Recently I took in my moms cats that are geriatric. I was looking for something minus all the by product and fillers that was a soft food for them. Newmans seemed to be it but at Wal-Mart it was 1.35 a can. I was able to get it here for about 1.00 a can with free shipping with Prime which made a small savings buying by the 24. The cats like it and as I have found with the other dry food they tend to eat less and go longer between feedings before they get hungry again. I am happy with the product and will definately continue to buy in the future.

review/text: This canned cat food is my cat's favorite, and I'm happy to be able to feed it to her. Given what I have read about non-organic cat food, I hope this continues to be available.  She also likes the Newman's organic turkey canned cat food, but that's just her second-favorite.

review/summary: Why the fillers and guar gum? Sigh
review/text: Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand. I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors. To balance my concern that perhaps there are too many carbs in their diet, I insure that the dry food I purchase is low in carbs such as Before Grain dry food.

review/summary: Pets deserve good food too.
review/text: Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious?  I recently switched to a top quality dry cat food which I give to our 3 cats daily, but I supplement that with canned "wet" food every 2nd or 3rd day.  The cats have adjusted to this new feeding method and really like their new foods.  Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Wild Rice is a fine product and I've ordered it through Amazon's subscription program so that it is sent to me on the interval that works best, and shipping is free.  A very great deal all around.

review/summary: Great Deal, Great Product, but Confused About Auto-Ship Ordering
review/text: I put my OCD to efficient use in researching the best organic cat food at the best price and this is what I found, and with which I am utterly delighted, BUT for one thing (there's always a thing) -- when I signed up for this auto-ship service it stated that I would be able to change the frequency and duration of my auto-ship order at any time.<br /><br />I LOVE the auto-ship service as it saves 15% and you receive free shipping but I DON'T love doing errands. At all. And especially in these cruel and seemingly-endless winters. It's a fabulous idea and saves running to the bodega in the scary 'hood at midnight when I realize that my princely master (I have learned that the adage -- 'people have dogs and cats have people' is all-too-true, though I am struggling to remain in charge) is out of food. I also seem to really love parenthetical asides, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Anywho,(here's *that* thing) when I received my first shipment and realized that this was far more than my cat (this is my first cat, a stray whom I had no choice but to take in -- so I am new at cat-ism, previously being a dog person) would eat in a month, I immediately logged in to change the frequency and/or amount of the auto-ship order and it seems my only option is to cancel. This is pesky and bothersome because that leaves me with two choices, as I see it; cancel the auto-ship, or, let the cat food pile up till I have enough cat food to last a year and then cancel. So I give the product 5 stars because my finicky little Prince Wonderfluff loves it and it is healthy and free of the chemicals which are all-too-present in food in this country, but I think Amazon needs to fix the auto-ship options so that when you click on the impending subsequent shipment, you can make such changes to frequency and amount. There may be an existing way to do this but I can't figure it out and I make web sites for a living so I can generally figure out how to do such things.<br /><br />I suppose a third option is to contact Amazon Customer Service but that's not a quick and easy task and I am busy trying to maintain order and earn a living.

review/summary: one cat loves it, the other...not so much
review/text: I bought this as a gold-box deal, so I got a good price for this cat food; I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise, since it's a tad bit on the expensive side. I try to buy healthier food for my cats. Since they both liked the liver and beef food from science diet, I figured they'd like this too. It turns out that only one of my cats like it, but the other won't touch it. I'm glad that at least one of them will eat it, otherwise, this would've been a waste of money. Other than that, this product seems to be good, and I like the fact that it's organic.

review/summary: Kitty approved
review/text: I have a senior cat (18 years old) and her teeth are not in great shape.  I switched her to an all wet food diet about 2 years ago, and Newman's is the best wet food that I've found on the market.  She is also fairly finicky, and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods, some more costly than Newman's, and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free, the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: Following a year with my adopted 8 year old Persian mix and his incredibly loose stool, three weeks after adding Mr. Newman's to his diet he has a firm stool. We tried Science Diet IM and WD a combination of wet  and dry.  I continue to  feed him the WD dry with a 1/3 of a can Newman's twice a day. Not that this cat is a picky eater but he cleans the bowl with Newmans and he always left a bit behind with ID. My cat is happier and I am  so happy that his obligatory butt cleaning scoots have ended.

review/summary: all three cats love it
review/text: My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.  But my cats have only been fed higher quality food--most recently before trying Newman's Own they were exclusively eating Doctors Foster and Smith foods.  Even though Foster's is completely natural, it is not organic which is why I've switched.  It's a good feeling to know that I'm doing everything I can to give my cats health and long lives (my Siamese is 21).

review/text: We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.

I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.

review/summary: Newman's Own
review/text: My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.  He said the it was low in carbohidrates and all natural. Within months she began bleeding.  I took her to the vet who recommended that I start feeding her plain canned turkey cat food until they could find out what was going on, which I did.  That episode costs me $600.00.  After a course of antibiotics I went back to Orijen and she immediately started bleeding again so I threw the Orijen out.  I started with Newman's Own six months ago and have never looked back.  My cat is happy with the food and there is no sign of blood anywhere.  I recommend Newman's Own.

My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away.

When we opened this new one from Amazon, it didn't smell the same as the last batch, this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.

review/summary: I wish this worked with our little darlings!
review/text: I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.

review/summary: Almost a 5
review/text: I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.

review/summary: Cats like it
review/text: I have two Siamese kittens who are on a mostly all canned food diet. The Chicken & Salmon formula is one of the foods in their current rotation. They seem to really enjoy eating it, although I wouldn't say it's their favorite food. You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.

review/summary: I loved that it was organic! My cat- not so much...
review/text: I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..

review/text: I thought I was getting something special for my babies. It was marked down and I thought I was getting a steal. But I had second thoughts as soon as I opened the can. It looks like something you would spackle a wall with. Seriously, it has the consistency of paste. Thankfully, I have one cat that is my little garbage can and I know when he's really hungry that I can get rid of one of these Newman's Own Organic Beef cat food cans.

review/summary: Best Choice for my Cats
review/text: I tried literally everything, from high end to low end, before settling on Newman's Own.  The reason?  All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.

review/summary: Super Finicky Cat Loves It!
review/text: This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.

review/summary: Good product, great deal!
review/text: Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date, I've only opened one can that was "watery"-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received, including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months, I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box, packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous, but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact, but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment, if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall, I would buy this product from Amazon, again.

review/summary: Totally disgusting!
review/text: I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.

The "meal" bars are larger and are 200 calories, but the meal bars are not nearly as yummy.  On a diet or not, I would recommend these if you don't mind the candy bar likeness.  They have even replaced my granola bars.  They are my "granola" bars, my "snack" bars, my "gotta have chocolate now" bars, my "still 2 hours until dinner" bars and my "don't have time for breakfast" bars:)  LOL, I love 'em.<br />P.S.  I am the mom of the pickiest little girl ever and SHE eats these!

review/summary: Very filling, not what I was expecting.
review/text: To start off, when I ordered these I thought I was ordering the meal bars. My bad. So, they came in the mail and I decided to try them. Now, these are definitely not as tasty as the double chocolate meal bars, but they are still very good...these are a bit chewier. But for 1 tiny bar, it was a PERFECT in-between meal filler if I needed it. It was especially useful for my lunch-dinner snack. Not too happy with the after-taste though. Otherwise, it's awesome. My wife also finds this a good alternative to the meal bar if the meal bar is too much for you.

review/text: Beware how tiny these are.  I didn't read that part and was stunned how small and light when I received them.  I had to eat 3 to satisfy my snack craving and by then, the sugar and carb count went through the roof. These are not healthy bars and not great for you.  Sure, they have a little protein but what else?  Sugar, carbs, virtually no fiber..find your health bar somewhere else.  They taste good but don't assume these things even compare in size to any snack bar out there.  The smallness makes these more expensive as well.

review/summary: The best laid plans ...
review/text: At first glance, $24.30 seems like a lot of money for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P09RJ0">Kellogg's Special K Protein Snack Bars, Chocolate Delight, 5.5-Ounce, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, but since there are six boxes with six protein-snack bars per box, that's roughly sixty-seven cents each. That's less than a candy bar and much healthier, so I decided to try them.<br /><br />I must admit they're truly a "chocolate delight," as the package states. Like other reviewers, though, I find them a tad too sweet for my taste. The good news is that they're only 110 calories per bar, have twelve grams of sugar and only eighty mg of sodium. Although that's less sugar than a candy bar, it's still a little more than I think is healthy for me. But since I plan to ration them to the times when I have a humongous chocolate attack--which seems to occur every other day--all will be well. An additional benefit to my plan is that they'll last longer too.<br /><br />And, yes, I do have that kind of rationing will-power, especially when there's a good supply of fruit in the house. As much as I love these bars for an occasional snack, I love fruit more. You can't improve on Mother Nature.<br /><br />Oops, the teen grandkids are coming this week and if they see MY snack bars, these yummy little treats won't last as long as I thought. Should I order another box or two? "The best laid plans of mice and men ..." LOL

review/summary: New pantry item to always have on hand.
review/text: As I've kind of moved ahead in my cooking I am finding that I use stock a lot more in my cooking. I use it all the time for things like risotto, as a substitute for water on regular rice for more flavor, in sauces and stir fry's, etc. It felt like every time I was making a trip to the grocery store I had to remember to pick up more stock, particularly chicken stock since I seem to go through it much faster than other types of stock. This stock is great tasting with good ingredients. The packaging is good and convenient to use. The size is just about perfect for most things and you can refrigerate what you don't use for a couple of days. The quantities that a standard order contain don't overwhelm you with too much of it, but is enough that I just order a couple of these every few months and keep some in storage.<br /><br />Buy it if you use stock in your cooking on a regular or semi-regular basis (and you might find you use it a lot more if you have it on hand).<br />Don't buy it if you don't cook that much or are a vegetarian or something.

review/summary: Great decaf to allow you the satisfaction of drinking coffee without the caffeine!
review/text: As my wife and I got older we had to reduce our caffeine consumption.  Our little self-indulgence is to mix 3 portions of caffeine free coffee with 1 portion of regular roast coffee for our morning breakfast.  We get the satisfaction of drinking our coffee but we have reduced our caffeine intake by well over 75% for the day.  (We watch other caffeinated items also)<br /><br />This coffee taste good and my wife and I enjoy it every morning.  This is a good product.  My only comment is that when we buy it at the store on sale we pay over 80% less than the price of three cans and shipping here.

review/summary: If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash
review/text: Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.

review/summary: Best. Candy. Ever.
review/text: It's true.  This has got to be the best candy ever.  The chocolate version isn't bad, but it's so different they should have just called it something else.  This version of the Happy Hippo is completely filled with that delicious hazelnut cream that is inside the Bueno bar.  A friend of mine and I found a store that had 3 cases of these.  We each bought one and agreed to split the third.  I think we ate them all within two weeks.  That's 10 boxes of 5 pieces each times 3.  That's 150 pieces of candy in less than two weeks...and we wanted more.  Once you start eating these, you can't stop, and you don't care.  They're that good.  The only problem with this candy is that i can't buy it any time i want.  They are near IMPOSSIBLE to find here in the US.  My kingdom for a single hazelnut hippo.

I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These are pretty tasty; I just prefer the chocolate.

review/summary: Gold standard...Years of research on my part...
review/text: When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my "baby" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE "health" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept "treating" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and "cured" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.

review/summary: No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food
review/text: Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell "dog food".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.

review/summary: My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago
review/text: My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!

review/summary: Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.

review/summary: Must have been a contaminated batch
review/text: We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

review/summary: Perfect Dog Food
review/text: My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.

review/summary: The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....
review/text: I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.

review/summary: Newman's Own pet food
review/text: I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: Unlike the other reviewer's dog, mine loves "Newman's Own" canned food.  I gotta believe that if a dog won't touch this, the dog is not only extremely fussy, but not very hungry as well.  Having this delivered to my door cheaper than I can buy it at my local supermarket sure is handy.
