review/summary: LOVE THESE MUSHROOMS
review/text: Yes, we're very pleased with the flavor and size of these mushrooms, but even  more amazing is the cost!  16 oz. of Shitake mushroom caps costs 7 times this at our favorite grocery....yes, seven times!<br /><br />  True the mushroom caps in our local grocery had  all the stems removed and there are some stems in  this package, but gracious!  For the difference in price I'll gladly remove stems if we  don't want them there.  (And hum happily while doing it)<br /><br />  Further the order arrived in only 3 days without expedited shipping, and it was extremely well packaged so there was absolutely no crushing of the product.<br /><br />  You can bet we'll be buying our Shitakes here from now on!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: great price for very good product
review/text: If the price is too good to believe, well it's not.............  these Shitake are superior to supermarket brands at about half the price (which includes shipping).  Cap sizes are in the 1.25 to 1.75" range and are very uniform in shape.  Trust me, a pound of dried mushrooms is a LOT and at this price you can use them in just about anything; hint, save the soaking water, filter thru a paper towel or coffee filter in a strainer and use like wine, stock or water in soups, braises or reduction sautes.  Great flavor and can be substituted for porcini or cepes when you don't want to break the bank, though they're really best suited to asian dishes.  The reason they're so much cheaper is that they're cultivated where porcini/ceps are gathered in the wild; kind of like the difference between wild salmon and farm raised.<br /><br />10/28/11<br /><br />Please be advised that this product may or may not be the same as I purchased at the time of my review.  The vendor is entirely different and I have no confidence the product is from the same source or is in any way similar other than  by weight. I also question amazon's policy of using my review to promote a different vendor and likely different sourced product from that which I shared my experience with.<br /><br />*************<br /><br />After I posted the above revision amazon added back in the original vendor which I had experience with.  I don't know if this was coincidental or a result of my additional comment, but to ensure this doesn't become a continual issue, let me state that my purchase was made from JR Mushrooms & Specialties and that I stand by the review of the product they provided.  Any other vendor is likely to source this product differently and therefore my review should only be considered when purchasing from JR.

Otherwise, no complaints. They're delicious after soaking them for about 20 minutes in cold water. I love them in gravies and over potatoes and pasta.

review/summary: Great Value for Shiitake and Great Quality
review/text: Since these Shiitake mushrooms seemed a great value, I thought I would stock up and ordered two pounds.  Well,that turns out to be a lot of mushrooms,  One pound equals about 5+ quarts of dried mushrooms, packed tight but not broken.<br /><br />The shiitake's range from medium to large size, with some larger than I expected.  All in all it was a good selection of various size and they all look quite nice.<br /><br />They come packed in a sealed plastic bag that shipped well, so I'm not quite sure what the concern related to pachaging by a previous reviewer was based upon.  You could not re seal the original bag, and I would not expect to do so, but transfering to zip lock bags or quart jars as I did works well.  I store other mushrooms in  glass quart jars as well and this method keeps them dry on your pantry shelf.  I would suggest you order these if you enjoy Shiitake Mushrooms in your stir fry and soups.<br />Great Value

review/summary: Poor Delivery Method~
review/text: Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....

review/text: That's how you pronounce the name of this bean that originates the Santa Maria area of coastal California. This area has the tradition of ranch BBQs featuring tri-tip and these beans. The whole idea sounds good, so I have been looking for these. Unfortunately, I looked at supermarkets, two high-end specialty grocers, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods and could not find them in any form, canned or dry.<br /><br />They are available on-line in dry form, but the shipping is silly. Amazon actually sells a 12-pack and ships Prime. I figure S&W can cook beans and they do add a few ingredients that I would add anyway, so there we are.<br /><br />These are small, round pea-sized pink beans. Cooked they turn bean brown. S&W cooks them just right, fully cooked but still firm so that when you reheat them they don't turn to mush. Very good consistency. The spices and chiles that are added are good and compliment the beans, but are not cloying or overwhelming like you get from Bush and others much of the time.<br /><br />I had the first can straight and was very impressed. Next time I might add onion, more garlic, hotter chiles just because I can.<br /><br />They will be a side dish this Thanksgiving.<br /><br />12 cans may seem like overkill, but heck a can of beans a month and they are all gone before you know it. And the price is very right with Prime shipping.<br /><br />The Pinquito Bean Association, or whatever, should do some promoting and get these on the shelves.<br /><br />BTW, I noticed no, er, musical effects from these at all. Might be the beans DNA or how S&W processed them, but there you are, another good thing.

review/text: I consider myself a Chai connoisseur.  I have been enjoying a Tazo Chai Latte nearly every day since 2001.  I am very picky and really only enjoy a limited selection of Chai brands.  My favorite is Tazo, especially when prepared by a Starbucks barista without water.  I was hesitant to purchase the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte k-cups in fear of it not meeting my high expectations; however, at first sip, I was hooked.  Although it has a slightly different taste than Tazo, it has a sweet aroma, full of spice with the perfect amount of creaminess.  I look forward to drinking this Chai Latte in the afternoon as a treat or pick-me-up. It is the perfect comfort item for me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AOH5Y2">Cafe Escapes 96 Chai Latte K-Cups</a>

review/summary: Tasty Mix But May Be Too Sweet for Some Tastes.  70 Calories/Serving.
review/text: This is an instant Chai Latte Mix in a k-cup.  It is tasty and has a nice amount of spiciness and creaminess.  It may be a little heavy on the sugar and/or cardamon for some, but as a mid-morning, mid-afternoon & evening drink, it is a nice, pleasant drink.<br /><br />However, before purchasing, you should know what you are drinking.  The ingredient list is:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, CREAMER (HYDROGENATED COCONUT OIL, GLUCOSE SYRUP, SODIUM CASEINATE (FROM MILK), SODIUM POLYPHOSPHATE, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM STEAROYL-2-LACTYLATE, SILICON DIOXIDE), NONFAT DRY MILK, INSTANT TEA, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, SALT, SUCRALOSE.<br />CONTAINS: MILK, SOY, TREE NUTS<br /><br />and:<br /><br />70 Calories<br />Total Fat 2.8g / Saturated Fat 2.8g<br />Sodium 133mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 9g / Sugars 9g<br /><br />Overall, I like this k-cup despite the fact that it is a little heavy on sugar.  For me, the spiciness is a nice combination, but I like cardamon, cinnamon, ginger & cloves.  For those who are pickier or prefer a different combination of spices, there are Chai Latte Mix recipes on popular recipe sites.  It you have the inclination, you could probably come up with your own mix t suit your own tastes & dietary requirements.

review/text: This is very comparable to Starbucks, Panera, etc.  I bought a Keurig just for this product, as I already have a Tassimo but their chai latte is disgusting.  Sounds extravagant, but will pay for itself in a little over a month vs going to one of the aforementioned shops every morning.

review/summary: Very disappointing!!
review/text: I just purchased a Keurig and was excited by the idea of being able to have a chai latte at home. I'm a Starbucks regular (I could have bought a car for all that I have spent there over the years :) and was happy to see that some of the previous reviews indicated that this was a great product.<br /><br />So I ordered the Cafe Escapes K-Cups and was very, very disappointed. I didn't even finish the first cup and won't be using the remainder of the box. It's nothing like a Starbucks, nor was it like any of the other brands that are commonly used in coffee shops and cafes. I can't remember a time in the past decade that I haven't finished a chai - there's some brands that I like better than others but the fact that I would rather give or throw away the 15 remaining K-cups speaks volumes. It tastes artificial and there was a definite aftertaste.<br /><br />In short, chai drinkers beware!! I'd recommend purchasing a sampler pack so you can try this one out without getting stuck with the full box.<br /><br />If anyone has recommendations for a different brand that tastes better, please let us all know!!

review/summary: Great Taste,  NOT for the lactose intolerant
review/text: Chai tea is my FAVORITE hot drink.  So I was excited when I got my Keurig this week (hint-buy the square trade warranty via Amazon to hedge your bet against Keurigs unreliabity...I'm covered carte blanche for 4 years!!)and the first thing I bought was this Chai latte.<br />Great taste- 4.5 stars. My problem arose after.  I'm lactose intolerant but have no problem with chai lattes from Starbucks and other coffee to go places.  Anyway, I've had this K-cup Chai more than once now and it must be whatever milk solids this company uses.  Each time it gives me problems.  I'm sad to say that I'll have to switch from this k-cup chai to my own recipe for Chai as found on allrecipes.com.  That is a complete combo of mixed spices and powdered creamers and I have no problem with that.  But that's okay, my machine came with a "My K-cup" so I'll probably save money anyway.<br />If I had no problems I would rate it 5 stars.

review/summary: Misses the mark!
review/text: After reading previous reviews, I was excited to enjoy this product.  I'm a big fan of Tazo chai made at Starbucks or at home using Tazo concentrate.  I've experimented with various home made recipes and those have come up short.  While Cafe Escapes Chai is creamy, it's missing the peppery notes of Tazo.  Also, it left an unpleasant aftertaste similar to artificial sweeteners.  I actually checked the label, but didn't find any listed.  I'm happy that there are only 16 in the box as I won't have as many to use.  Back to Tazo concentrate for me!

review/text: I love this Chai Latte, I have one every morning! I like it better than TAZO for its perfect sweetness. I like mine better when I add 1 cup of milk and choose the medium size. It is perfect to take in my thermos to work. The milk makes it a little creamier, that is what I miss in this chai, hence the 4 stars.

review/text: As a previous poster mentioned this chai flavor is quite watered down but it is still pretty good. I like a lot of sugar in my regular coffee. And I like that this is sweet enough that sugar is unnecessary. It has a great flavor I just wish it was a little bit stronger. For that reason I gave it four stars instead of five. But I will purchase it again. It is unfortunate though that there are not many more chai k-cups to choose from. If you anyone knows of any other chai tea cup brands please let me know :)

review/text: They're pretty expensive for a K-cup... but theyre VERY good, so its a trade-off. I've also found that they leave a residual taste in the next cup of coffee, so its very important to follow the directions and run a cycle of just water after using this if the next cup isnt chai.

review/summary: I am now a chai addict.
review/text: My friend bought be me a Keurig Mini machine for Christmas and I was so excited to try all of coffees and teas. I saw these chai tea lattes at Bed Bath and Beyond and wanted to try them. They are great iced but after trying one hot I am totally addicted to chai. Now I have to start my day with one of these or it's just not the same. I know these do contain artificial sweeteners but I don't think there's a bad after taste. All I taste is heaven in my mug. I've already used up so many that I have to buy a new box (or two) today so I won't run out. If you like chai lattes then definitely try these out. They are my favorite k-cup!

review/summary: Started out decent, ended horribly.
review/text: I'm a big fan of chai, and usually opt for the Oregon or Tazo variety.  I saw this and had to try it, as the convenience of a single serve chai made in 45 seconds seemed to good to pass up.  My expectations were pretty high, as k-cups are usually pretty delicious, and the prices are steep.  I sampled this one on the 7.25 oz. setting on my machine, and it smelled wonderful as it brewed/mixed.  As it poured into the cup, I took some time to read the ingredients.  I noticed that this k-cup is nothing more than and instant chai powder mix with powdered milk creamer and sugar.  Actually, the first ingredient isn't even tea, it's creamer.  I didn't get too hung up on the details and tried the drink.  It tasted OK until the end.  The after taste was terrible, and very unpleasant.  It's hard to describe, but I didn't like it.  The overall taste of the drink was on the watery side, and lacked the creaminess that I'm used to with a good chai latte.  It also had a very artificial flavor to it.  I don't expect a k-cup to deliver what my local coffee shop can, but this one definitely fell short.

review/text: I was a bit apprehensive to try the chai, mainly because it's my favorite and I was hoping it would live up to my expectations. I tried my first cup of it this morning and it was unbelievably amazing! My favorite type of chai is Tazo, and I think this might be even better. The chai came out frothy, spicy and yummy. It was perfect. I read some of the other reviews and was a bit apprehensive to try it, but I didn't have any weird aftertaste at all. I think I might have found my newest morning addiction!!

review/text: In case anyone doesn't know, eating foods with hydrogenated oil is like injecting tar into your arteries. I was so excited when the pods came -- the flavor sounded so good and even smelled good, and I'm sure it tastes delicious, but before taking a sip, for some reason I read the ingredients right after brewing. I think because it came out all creamy which made me wonder what was in it apart from the spices, etc. I had to throw the rest of the unused pods out because I wouldn't want to give them to anyone else. Anyway, my own fault for not thinking to look into the ingredients. Hopefully this helps someone else not make the same mistake. Only reason I'm even giving this 1 star is that zero is not an option.

review/summary: Creamy, sweet, spicy, and aromatic from start to finish.
review/text: I assess my warm beverages in a series of steps. This was my experience with Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which was brewed as a larger 9 1/4 oz. serving in my Keurig B40:<br /><br />Step 1 - Blow steam off the top of the freshly brewed chai tea latte, inhale deeply. The thick aroma of sugar and spice is promising and surprisingly flavorful. (I had seen a lot of water pouring out of the Keurig and into my mug during the brewing process!) It's so disappointing to get a whiff of something delicious, only to taste a watered-down version of it when I take a sip, so I hope that I won't be let down this time!<br /><br />Step 2 - Sip gingerly with my eyes closed. Hooray for follow-through! Even when brewed in a large mug, I would say that this chai is as flavorful as its aroma promises. It has a perfect balance of sweetness and spiciness. Also (at least when brewed in a large mug,) it wouldn't be too harsh on the palates of those who aren't fans of spicy chai drinks. Moreover, although this chai is creamy, it isn't so rich that it would be a chore to drink it from start to finish.<br /><br />Step 3 - Wait for aftertaste, or lack thereof. I am happy to report that this chai tea latte doesn't have that thick, sour, curdled milk aftertaste that I sometimes experience with chai tea lattes.<br /><br />From start to finish, this chai was exactly what I was hoping it would be. However, if you want your chai on the spicy side, you may want to try brewing a more concentrated 7 1/4 oz. version of it, or look for another brand.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: I recently moved my daughter into a dorm in college, and we got a Keurig for her room, figuring she will be drinking coffee, to help with the late nights.  Well we had some coffee, I got her hot chocholate, and offered to buy some of the Chai Lattee's as I like them.  Her reply, "Mom, I don't really like tea",  I sent 4 for her to try when she wanted to.  The first morning in the dorms she tried it, I got a text message, "the Chai tea is amazing, can you get me more?".  Thankfully, we had not already headed back home 6 hours away, and dropped some off a few days later befor heading home.  Best place to get them, that I have found is Bed Bath and Beyond, using my 20% off.

review/summary: Chai Latte Tea is Excellent
review/text: Chai Latte is Excellent. My husband loves this product and we just can't seem to keep enough of this product in our home.  It's gone before I know it and time to restock the item.  It smells so good and the taste is wonderful. Especially on cold winter days.  Please keep this tea in stock as I will be ordering it often.  I wish it came in a larger sized box. Maybe it could come in a 24 size box.  Thank you for stocking this tea, it is sometimes very difficult to find.

review/summary: not really coffee
review/text: When I bought this product, I had no idea of the ingredients.  The first ingredient is sugar and the second is some kind of hydrogenated oil.  I hadn't read the ingredients until after I made it.  Honestly it is delicious but I knew this was way more than just coffee!  I gave it away to t he friend who had recommended it to me!  It is only 70 calories she said!~

review/summary: Rock Candy for Birthday Party Favors
review/text: I bought this product to use as party favors for my sons 8th Geology themed birthday party. I chose these for the price because they are cheaper than buying the rock candy on the sticks. The rocks are bigger than I expected but they were in pretty bad shape. Most of the rocks were fused together and you cannot even see the strings on most of them. I cannot even tell if they all have strings in them. Most of the strings were broken into small pieces. Besides the size of the individual rocks themselves I was not very happy with this product.

review/summary: Like a tiny beacon of sunlight...
review/text: Silky smooth and oatfully delicious, this chewy morsel makes for a wonderful breakfast or a hold-me-over snack that hits all the right notes of savory and sweet, utilizing the honey and oats to perfection.  I know there is a lot of hyperbole here, but it's deserved.  The bars a tad small, and so they may not be entirely filling for a meal, but the sharp sweetness that comes from this bar is probably too sharp for a larger bar.  As it is, this is the perfect bite (more like four) and for that I'm happy to munch away between lunch and dinner.

review/text: My sixteen year old border collie loves this food.  She's was used to dry dog food so I started out mixing this with the dry which she eats heartily, but she really woofs it up when I give it to her plain. Usually I give it to her mixed with the dry food.  It is definitely doggie friendly as well as nutritionally excelent.

review/summary: human grade ingredients, yummy for dogs
review/text: I occasionally buy canned food to tempt my 17 year old dog to eat a bit more-- she enjoys this product.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. I'm really careful to keep on top of the literature about pet foods, and so I'm confident that this food meets a high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, no indigestible corn or wheat, a wide variety of wholesome and varied vegetable ingredients and several probiotics to promote healthy digestion and absorption of nutrients.  On top of that, this is a very palatable food.<br /><br />I came across this food at the local Tractor supply (I was there to buy chicken feed!). I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but after some research I can say that I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo food for my cat, too.

review/summary: First food my dog eats consistently!
review/text: When we transitioned our dog from puppy food to adult dog food, we switched him from wellness puppy to this food.  This is the first food he has eaten consistently.  With other foods, he'd be interested in it for the first few meals and then would refuse to eat it a few cans in.  He'd wait to eat the other stuff until he was starving. He eats this food almost right away and doesn't leave any behind!<br /><br />The couple of small cons are<br />1) his poo stinks to high heaven now<br />2) I don't think there's fish oil in this food (I didn't see it listed)<br /><br />Sometimes the cans arrive dented from Amazon, but we've been able to send them back for a refund when there are major dents.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br />My dog has developed tear stains since starting this food, but i'm not sure if it's the food or because he's now an adult and his body is different from when he was a puppy.  I'm going to switch him to another food and see if they resolve.  But he does really love this food.<br /><br />Edited again to add:<br />I don't believe the food caused my dogs tear stains.  He had a parasite and when we treated him, the tearing stopped and hasn't returned after several months.  He has however, become bored of this food and won't eat it unless we mix a little sweet potato in.

It's not the first time I've had a problem with seller or product, but in the many purchases, this is a first! I recieved one can of dog food for $11.00. Oh, the arrival was quick , packaging fine but not what I expected from the purchase information. The number of one stars I've given over the years are to few to count. This left a very bad taste in my mouth. By the way the information seemed to say I'd be sent a case of 12 cans.

review/summary: Nope...not even close.
review/text: For someone who loves the taste of bourbon and whiskey but can't have alcohol any longer, I thought the concept Arkay has was a huge deal.  I mean, come on..All the taste without a hangover...the beauty is in the marketing!  So, I bought a bottle. And that my friends, is where this slippery slope of my happiness endeavor crashed landed into a bank of trees. I saw a You Tube video where this bar tender said...it's weak...but good. I read the reviews where it smelled like shoe polish and tastes worse...(who drinks shoe polish?) Still, I had to try this incredible idea. I purchased it on a Thursday and had it delivered to my door step on Monday...so far...so good. It was packaged nicely and unscathed from its long journey across the state. I opened the bottle and waited....waited for the fresh aroma of whiskey...(It's not scotch...) to fill the air around me. This, my friends did not happen...I could not place the smell but it was very medicine like. I poured a bit in a glass and took a sip. Immediately...my mind went back to when our border collie tried to eat our living room rug. We bought this spray that was supposed to be so god awful bad that when you spray it on something, your own dog won't touch it. At that point in my life, I put some on my finger thinking it couldn't be as bad as advertised. That drop of "dog eating your rug repellent" was the only thing I could taste for three days...Not much different than my first sip of this "whiskey". I couldn't figure it out. I was like Vicks mixed with cough syrup and Listerine. I did the old, "this tastes terrible...try it thing" to my wife only after I filled the entire glass with Coke. She was brave...but could not place the taste as well. After walking around with this "whiskey" taste in my mouth for about an hour, I figured it out. In the medicine drawer in our bathroom, there are two expired products that not only taste, but smell like this Arkay product. Orajel cold sore medication and Orajel tooth ache pain reliever. The only difference is the numbing affect. So there is your review. If you want to sample this product before you buy it...take a drive to your local drug store first.

review/summary: Pillsbury cranberry bread is my favorite
review/text: I have been making Pillsbury bread mixes for at least five years.  They taste good and are easy to make, even for someone like me with no previous baking experience.  Cranberry is definitely my favorite.  I substitute three tablespoons of apple sauce for the oil in order to minimize the fat content, and I use three egg whites in place of the two whole eggs.  I also like to add extra dried cranberries to the mix, one-third of a 4.2 oz. package, which is 1.4 oz by weight.  I use a glass loaf "pan" and bake it for 50 to 55 minutes at 375�F.  (Note: The only ingredients needed are the bread mix, eggs, apple sauce or oil, water, and optionally extra dried cranberries.)  I recommend adding the extra cranberries for improved flavor.

review/text: When I have my occasional martini, I include dinner in the form of olives. Everybody knows how good fish is for you, so naturally, I supplement my martini with healthy olives with anchovies! I spear several--sometimes I mix blue cheese stuffed lives with the anchovy for the extra nutrition, of course. Recently, to my horror, BevMo was out of my favorite olives so in desperation I ordered these. Why the lurid name, I can't guess; what's sexy about anchovy stuffed olives? The olives arrived in a timely manner but there had been some leakage in the box, so I hope I don't die when I get around to using them.
