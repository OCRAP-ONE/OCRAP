review/summary: Very good but not great
review/text: The Almond Trail Mix bars aren't exactly what I expected but they are still pretty tasty.  Extremely dense and chewy, they're definitely a filling snack.  However, it has a lot of calories for such a little package if that's something you care about ... I was hoping for a slightly bigger bar to share with my wife but it's not really large enough to split.  The trail mix flavor is *definitely* the prevalent flavor here instead of almond, which was also a little bit disappointing since I love almonds.<br /><br />Minor quibbles aside, this is a tasty and healthy snack item.  I'd order it again if it went on sale.

review/text: I placed the order based on the good reviews here. Generally speaking, I like it especially the texture. It contains the right amount of moisture, not to dry, not to moist. However, I do believe it contains too much almond extract. It's too dominant in the smell and in the taste. It's hard to miss once you open the plastic wrap of the bar.

review/summary: My all-time favorite seasoning!!
review/text: One day my husband came home with this little bottle of spice....Okay, says I...I'll try it.  All I can say is Wow! It has been a couple of years now, and I am STILL not bored with it. It is still my favorite spice to reach for. My favorite combo being a dash of celtic sea salt, and a big shake of Bragg Sprinkles!<br /><br />The grind size is just right...not so fine that it is like tiny "sand". Rather, it's just large enough that you can actually get little tastes of various flavors....rosemary, thyme, sweet basil, a smidge of dill, oregano, etc. Even though it contains about 25 different spices, it doesn't blend away to "anonymous" when it hits your mouth. You're gonna love it!<br /><br />Oh, and we usually have it right on the table, for that last sprinkle on top, right before we eat it. Mmmmmmmmmm.

review/text: I've been cooking for well over three decades and have tried many different "no salt" seasoning combos. Recently I received a sample of Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning and tried it on chicken I was roasting. It was truly the best seasoning I've ever used, and my husband raved about it, asking me to purchase it. It's not spicy, not sweet, and not one spice in the mixture overpowers the others. I'll be using it in soups, stews, hamburgers....So--here I am, and might purchase the 12-pack. :)

review/text: I originally tried this as a free sample. It was really good especially when I would bake my fish. So I had to buy more of it. It lasted me a pretty good while because I didn't use it for everything so as to not get tired of the flavor. I ran out of that so now I ordered it from amazon. It came nicely packaged and in a glass jar instead of the plastic that I had before. I have yet to use this one but it smells good and looks good so I'm expecting what I had before. It has a healthy fresh taste which makes anything more special like from a restaurant or chef.

review/text: I love tea - all kinds of teas. I don't usually like fruity black teas, though... so ordering this was a risk. But this tea is really pleasant and pairs perfectly with sweetener and cream or milk, if you prefer. I did not really like it black (plain); the flavor was a bit too strong, but milk and sweetener balance it out perfectly. The subtle sweetness and tartness of the plum combined with the warmth of the cinnamon make a very nice flavor. If you like chai, you will probably like this tea.

review/summary: This thing works.....
review/text: Picked up a set of 2 at the local home improvement store for ~$11.  The design of this trap seems to count on the animal pushing dirt in front of him and the dirt is what sets off the trap.  In these instances, the gopher will likely be caught behind the neck or shoulders.  I see a lot of holes on our property where the hole is not plugged and plenty of sign that he has been out scampering around.  In these cases, he'll get caught in the hip area with his nose up against where the trigger plate would be set.  This just makes it a little more awkward in emptying the trap.  The cinch type trap looks to be just as effective but much easier to empty.  The cinch trap will cost up to 2-3 times more, though.  I might get one or two cinch traps, but 9/10 will be the 610 type.<br /><br />I have read at least one review where the sweep of the jaws could be an issue, preventing the trap from being seated in small holes and from closing effectively.  This is really easy to work around.  I first thought to shorten the jaws, but decided to just make the hole bigger when setting it.  I learned that gophers are not shy of these traps or your activity around the hole.  In very short order you can excavate the hole to a size that allows the trap to operate freely...and the gopher will come...especially if you notice fresh activity around the hole.<br /><br />Much of the literature on setting traps recommends digging back from the plugged hole to access the main tunnel and then set the traps in pairs so the gopher has to enter a trap from either direction in order to replug the hole.  I have found this is not really necessary.  If the hole I am working was freshly plugged, one trap in the hole works every time.<br /><br />I also noticed that a small plug doesn't necessarily mean a small gopher.  In one instance, I almost passed on setting a trap in what I thought was just going to be wasted effort.  I cleared dirt from a plug the size of a 50 cent piece and it opened up into a tunnel about 2 1/2 inches!  The gopher I got out of that hole was a normal sized gopher!<br /><br />I also read that a 3 degree difference in the gopher's comfort zone in the burrow is enough to cause him to do something about it.  The fact that light appears at a point he previously plugged is also enough for him to quickly come back and see what happened.  One the first day I used these, I set one, then walked about 30 yards away and set another.  I checked the first one on the way back a few minutes later and found it had been tripped and completely covered.  I had to dig it out and found the little bugger had pushed a rock the size of a bird's egg into it!  My first catch was a rock!  A Bill Murray moment flashed through my mind.  That gopher is now history, by the way.<br /><br />I am working with only 2 traps at the moment and secure them with a piece of butcher twine to my tunnel probe or a 12" piece of 1/4 in re-bar.  This size hardware is probably overkill.  You can probably tie the traps to those marking flags on wire type stems available at your local home improvement store, especially if you are setting a lot of traps.  They may not need to be secured at all.  When that gopher's body in in the trap, he isn't really going anywhere.  If he can go anywhere with it, it might be best to let THAT gopher keep it as a souvenir!<br /><br />If you are not having any success at all with these traps, it would be a good idea to re-examine how and where the traps are being set.  I have never used these things before and only bought this set after 4 years of poison pellets simply didn't work.  Look for FRESH activity and don't be shy about providing enough room for these traps to work.  So far, have set these only at holes that have been plugged, but will set the next time where there is fresh sign but no plug.  I don't bait mine and the trigger plate can ALWAYS be seen from above after I set them...easier to check them.  From all the mounds on our 2 acres, am guessing we have at least 40 gophers or more.  These traps will be busy and I'll be keeping score.<br /><br />I give the trap 5 stars for effectiveness and 4 stars for the emptying issue.  From my experience, no need to spend a lot of money....these things work.

The 0610 gopher trap is easy to set and works  with great success. Also, remember to use a wire attached to the trap and  tie it to a steak to prevent gophers from dragging the trap further into  their hole once they are caught. I hope you find this product as easy to  use as i did, Good luck.

review/summary: Gopher Hunter
review/text: Gophers were ruining my yard. Actually my dogs were ruining it chasing the gophers. I'd come home to 3-4ft trenches dug. I tried everything else, gasers, poision, sonic noises, and cat hair. I didn't think I could use the traps because I don't enjoy killing animals. I guess they pushed me to far cause I bought a set and I really enjoy hunting them. It took a couple days. I had some big suckers for living in southern california. They'd push so much dirt they would set off the trap but be far enough back to escape. I kept with it digging out the trap and resetting it. Then BAM, got my first two today. They were still alive and they were pissed. Chompin their teeth as I was pulling them out. Glad I wired the traps, wouldn't want to stick my hand in there. Easiest way to kill them I found is to get a 5gal bucket, fill it with water and throw them in with the trap and all. They sink to the bottom and die pretty quick. Other gophers will eventually use the tunnels and I get them too. Kind of excited for the next one.

I decided to film my own instructions to show you how to do it. I think after watching you will see it is easy to set these traps.

review/summary: Better then the gopher repelling devices
review/text: I purchased a set (two) of these at my local home store for about $11.00.  I purchased a gopher repelling device which advertised that the gopher would be repelled by the beeping noise.  Only when I got home and read the packaging did I learn that the device would not repell the gopher for 2-3 weeks.  My gopher was eating about three plants and herbs a day.  Doing the math and realizing I would have no plants left in 2-3 weeks I purchased these traps.  They were a little tricky to set up but once you figure it out it is easy.  I set the trap where I knew there had been recent gopher activity.  I dug up a mound of dirt and found the tunnels and cleared out the dirt.  When the hole was refilled I knew it was active.  I took out the dirt and placed the traps in the tunnels as the direction indicated.  I checked it an hour later and the gopher was history. Not the easiest to empty but you can use a screwdriver to push down on the device to release the gopher.

I found the Sweeney very difficult to use, due to wire construction that flexed while being set, and both Sweeney tripped without snagging the critters.<br /><br />I set the Victor in the same tunnel that the first Sweeney had been in, and caught a gopher within 10 minutes. I then replaced the second Sweeney, which had been tripped (but no gopher caught) with the Victor 0610, within twenty minutes another gopher had been snagged. I then placed the Victor in a third tunnel and again snagged a gopher within 20 minutes.<br /><br /> The other model has been relegated to the tool shed and I have ordered two more of the Victor 0610.

review/summary: UPDATE TO "Caught one on the first try!"
review/text: OK...so I wrote my review too early.  Since the initial 'capture', I have bagged a couple more of the furry garden  terrorists.  Unfortunately, their relatives continue to excavate in and around my garden.  The problem: the trip mechanism is not sensitive enough (as I suspected and wrote in my initial post).  My catch rate is less than 10%, and I usually find the unsuccessful sets filled with dirt and untripped.  I just ordered 6 Macabee traps and will post a review there after a few days of using them.<br /><br />Initial post: "I have pocket gophers running amuck in and near my vegetable garden.  Tried the smoke bombs without success.  After watching a number of videos on You Tube about trapping gophers, I decided to take a whack at it.  At two different sites, I found new mounds, probed for the main trench, excavated, set traps in each direction, wired the traps to a stake, and replaced the sod.  18 hours later, the first set had caught a gopher BY THE TAIL!  One clunk on the head with a shovel and I was on the board! The other set, I presume, was not placed deep enough in the hole as the gopher simply pushed dirt up into my trap.  The only drawback that I perceive about the product is that the bump plate requires a pretty hard 'bump' to spring the trap.  But, with one gopher in the bag after the first 18 hours, I am willing to keep using!"

review/summary: Trigger is not sensitive.  Waste of money
review/text: Mine did not work well at all. As another person said, the gopher can push a set trap out of tunnel and not spring the trap because the trigger is not sensative enough. I recommend Maccabee traps. They cost a little more, but I have had a lot better luck. I don't even waste my time setting the easy set traps. Avoid!

review/summary: find the instructions online; needle-nose pliers helps; still no luck
review/text: Instructions for setting the Victor 0610 gopher trap can be found online, but it would have been helpful to include them with the trap, or a link to the *.pdf file. Instructions say to use 2 traps side-by-side (trigger pans facing one another), laid parallel to the ground in the gopher's horizontal tunnel, on each side of a fresh vertical gopher hole. Leave the tunnel open since the gopher will come back to fill it with soil.  After several failed attempts to set the trap (my thumb on the lever was in the way), the easiest way for me was lying it on a table with the jaw end hanging off the table top. A pair of needle-nose pliers to hold the jaws open helps too.  You don't need to bait the trap, but I am trying a bit of peanut butter. You also use a stake and piece of rope tied to the trap/stake to keep the gopher from dragging the trap along the tunnel.  So far the gopher has sprung the trap several times, but got away.  I rated it as 3, but am waiting to see if I can catch the critter. Leather gloves were also helpful. Update: After a few months we caught no gophers in the traps.  Next we bought gopher repellent in the form of castor oil pellets to form a linear barrier.  Finally, we were able to send the gophers away from our house for now.  For us it was the pellets that worked.

review/summary: Woodstream Gopher Trap 0610
review/text: This is a poor excuse for a gopher trap. I have lots of gophers and have used other traps. I recently bought 8 (four sets) of these traps. They are ill designed. The gophers are able to trip them without getting caught and have even managed to push the set trap out of the hole. The problem is the sweep of the pincers is too wide and the mechanism too easily clogged with sand or dirt. Don't bother with these traps.

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I ordered the Victor 0610 Easy Set Gopher Trap after exhausting all other methods of trapping and killing a sneaky little gopher.<br /><br />We received the trap before the expected delivery date, so the shipping was very prompt.  I was disappointed after opening the box because there were no instructions included, though.  I searched for instructions online only to come up with hard to see diagrams with small print.  After playing with it for several minutes I was able to figure out how to set the trap.  Our crafty little gopher didn't mound up for several days after receiving the trap so we couldn't use it immediately.  When the shifty little creature finally did mound up my husband cleaned out the hole to make it slightly larger, set the trap and then secured the trap so that the gopher couldn't run off with it.  He decided to cover the mound with a wagon so that light wouldn't enter the hole.  When I went outside to check the trap a few hours later we had trapped the guileful gopher.  The gopher was still alive when we pulled it of the hole but he was quickly eliminated.  This gopher had managed to destroy a large portion of my yard and evaded us for 3 months.<br /><br />I wish I had found the Victor 0610 Easy Set Gopher Trap before I spent more than $50 on the other methods that didn't work.  I highly reccomend this product.

review/summary: It works!
review/text: I actually use this trap to catch moles and it works fine.  It is simple to use and set up.  You just have to dig with shovel to find the the tunnel and place it carefully.  I don't bother tying string to it with stake anymore because I look at it as a disposable trap (I just find it too disgusting to dislodge the dead mole from the trap, and I also don't want to bother digging it back out again).  I have used it enough now where I know it works, and I don't feel the need to check it.

review/summary: Poor packing
review/text: The product was shipped in a plastic bag placed into an express mail envelop. As the envelops are designed for documents packing a bag of nuts results in the envelop being stuffed. There is no protection for the nuts so as the envelop is thrown around in transit and as other packages are thrown on top of the envelop the nuts are crushed resulting in well over 50% of the pecan halves arriving as pecan pieces. Also the bag is loaded with pecan dust from all the breakage in transit. I do not understand why this shipper would ship what is sold as a premium product in packaging that results in delivery of an inferior product. I purchased and paid for Fancy Mammoth Pecan Halves not pecan pieces.

review/summary: I LOVE Pumpkin Seeds
review/text: I love pumpkin seeds and they have good nutritional value, but most commercial seeds are covered with more that a day's supply of salt.  I always eat them shells and all so the salt is...BAD.  I've been looking for unsalted pumpkin seeds in stores for years with no luck, so I decided to try these raw seeds.  They arrived very quickly.  The seeds are huge compared to other pumpkin seeds and they taste like they need a little salt (LOL)  Actually, they taste like I just pulled them out of a jack-o-lantern and baked them in the oven without salt...A nostalgic taste.  I like them and feel good about eating them without salt.  Getting my daily supply of fiber.  I will buy them again.  YUM.

review/summary: Labor intensive to find any flavor
review/text: Yes, they are very large, but for me completely inedible straight out of the bag. The shells are like soft cardboard, and there's no taste. It would be nice if the company would include preparation suggestions with the seeds. I've been experimenting with mine and have had partial success in making them palatable. First I soaked them in mineral spring water overnight with sea salt and smoked salt. Then I drained and dehydrated them for 24 hours. They were getting closer to crunchy and even had a bit more pumpkin seed flavor. Next I took 1/4 cup of the dehydrated ones, put them in a skilled with a sprinkle of olive oil and roasted them just to a light brown, then sprinkled on seaweed and brewer's yeast. (Lots of options for seasonings.) They're pretty good that way, but I doubt I will purchase again. Maybe I'll just start buying a fresh pumpkin every time I want to eat the seeds. It would be less trouble and much tastier.

review/summary: Rum me over with a truckload of this fudge :)
review/text: This fudge was very good.<br /><br />A friend brought it back from a Cruise.  Lucky her got to taste test I'm sure many other varieties of Tortuga fudge.<br /><br />The fudge has a good consistency.  It's appearance is like a brick of hard chocholate but it has a perfect fudge texture.  It's not too hard nor too soft.  It's the type that flakes if forced.  The flavor - amazing.  I read someone complaining it tasting like cheap rum.  I disagree.  I've drank cheap rum before and that's a taste you can't forget.  The rum flavor is heavenly divine. It's saturated in the stuff which makes it a real treat above the other fudges you may have ever had.  The price is not bad at all - considering where it's imported and all.  Generally with other fudges you are paying for quantity and- not quality.  However in this case you are paying for quality, quantity, and a rum filled experience. mmmmm :) boy it's good.  BUY IT, I'm going to. Too bad it doesn't have a subscribe and save option, ha-ha.  My hips I guess are grateful for that.

review/summary: Sent as a Gift
review/text: Usually I send my male friend, age 86, Pisttachios for Christmas. This year I did not as I had been out to his home in Late November and he seemed to have two full cannisters sitting on his counter. Turns out I was not wrong, it is just that he and his pre-Christmas and Christmas guests like Pistacios very well.<br /><br />When I went to visit at New Years, They were gone and he told me they had been eaten. A couple of weeks later, this conversation resounded with me and I ordered these for him, but had no way to denote they were a gift, so just sent them on and forgot about it.<br /><br />Then in about another two weeks, I received a note from my friend. "Cindy, he asked, did you send these. I bet so. They are from Amazon, arriving at my front door uninvited by me, but, well liked." He stated also "These are the niecest and the freshest Pistachios that I have received all year." "Thank you."<br /><br />Other things that my friend routinely receives from Amazon from me so he was good at guessing who sent them:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XJGJLO">Pilgrim 18506 Anvil Fatwood Holder</a> (He does not routinely get a holder, only the Fatwood, But he did receive one holder.)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O1UZVY">Plink Garbage Disposal Cleaner and Deodorizer, Multi Scent Pack, Value Pack of 30</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E37158">Summit Brands DP06N-PB 4-Pack Disposer Care Garbage Disposal Cleaner</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P3QPMK">Monogrammed Cocktail Napkins - Box of 90</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VI3RZO">Monogram Absorbent Coasters & Cocktail Napkins Gift Set -F</a>Old World Cross Bell Decor Chime Music Wind WindchimeAmazing Grace Windchime (different wind chimes for his arbor which is right outside his kitchen door)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55YU">Emerald Nuts Whole Cashews, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a> Cashews so the guests might leave the Pistachos alone.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYEE">Traverse Bay Fruit Co.

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky that I've tried
review/text: I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness. Too much sweetness for me.

It tastes so good that once I open the package, I eat the whole thing. It has a sweet taste that I can understand might be overwhelming to some, but for me, it's perfect. I plan on keeping this on subscription. Try it. You won't be disappointed!

review/text: I prefer beef jerky and if this weren't on sale than I probably wouldnt have bought it (horray for amazon lightning deals) Anyways, the taste is fine, but you have to enjoy turkey. I definitely prefer beef jerky over turkey jerky but if you really like turkey go ahead and buy it. But you really might be better off just getting 1 pack at the store.. I can eat an entire pack as a quick snack because there is not much in there..

review/summary: Good, had better though
review/text: Having had Jack Links jerky for a while I picked up this brand during one of Amazon's deals to try it out. While it is nice and the smokey flavour works well, there is a much sweeter flavour to it than Jack Links brand. Personally this puts me off this brand a little although others in my house do like the sweeter flavour.<br /><br />So it really depends what you want in your Teriyaki jerky and if you like it sweet or not.<br /><br />The jerky pieces are a good size though, they definitely give you some big jerky.

review/text: I wasn't expecting much when I got these on a lightning deal. They are suppose to be healthy so I was expecting some cut backs on the flavor. However, it amazed me. The meat seems to be good quality and the flavor was good. If you pick it up on sale like I did, I think it's worth 5 stars. On the original price, probably a 4 star item.

review/summary: Taste-tested by a wine maker
review/text: I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.

review/summary: Not all natural as expected
review/text: I expected that this would be all natural cinnamon oil, as was the clove oil purchased from the same company.  The ingredients label said it contains natural & artificial cinnamon flavors.  I was disappointed in the artificial flavors, but it did produce satisfactory watermelon pickles.<br /><br />Then, I found a two pack of the exact same product from the same company at Walmart locally for only $2.17 versus the $2.74 for only one dram bottle and felt scrooged.  I understand this is because of their "free shipping," but could have paid much less.<br /><br />Overall, I wish the description had said it contained artificial flavors. (and yes, I have heard that they are identical in chemical composition and are perfectly safe.  I would just prefer all natural for the price)

I spotted that it was available through Amazon and found most were selling the 1.75 oz box which has 5 bags x .35 oz. The problem here is that this vendor is selling the 1.75 oz box and showing the 3.5 oz which has 10 bags x .35oz per box, instead. The picture is what brought me to this seller since I knew what I am looking for. People that are unfamiliar with the product sizes can be easily fooled by this type of deceptive advertising. It is my hope that they read this before committing to the purchase.

review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: Huge hit or slight miss
review/text: I want to say I love this candy.  I am a huge sour candy fanatic.  However, I had to leave a less than perfect review for a few reasons.  I just opened a 2oz bag of assorted Warheads and the flavors are very poorly dispersed.  I have always noticed this but I will list out the flavor count in my bag:<br /><br />3 - Lemon<br />4 - Blueberry<br />7 - Black Cherry<br />4 - Watermelon<br />0 - Sour Apple<br /><br />That's right, ZERO sour Apple. I mean, what is the quality control like here? It is not hard to have an equal distribution of flavors during the bagging process. I mean, the candy is usually great, unless they have been allowed to melt and then they lose their sour properties and stick to the wrapper.  I must say, sour apple is my favorite and not having any in this larger size bag was pretty disappointing. Disappointing enough to push me to get on Amazon and vent.

review/text: I bought this product because the only place I could buy unsalted nuts was at a drug store who carried stale nuts, mostly almounds.  When I opened the can from Superior Nuts, I thought there were no almounds, but soon found that they wiped the outer layer off.  This was good, because i could tell which were fresh without biting into them.  While this was convenient, I would prefer that this be done before canning.  I particulaly enjoyed the amount of Brazil nuts that were included; if the amount of walnuts/pecans were similar to the brazils this would change my rating to 6-STARS.

It's the only reasonably priced cat food with quality ingredients and no corn products. We also have no need to supplement him with wet food.

review/summary: Best Comfort Food!!!
review/text: I have always loved Little Debbie food items, like moon pies, but Honey Buns have always been a preference.<br /><br />Very taste, but I have always wanted more in a single box... It's like a breakfast roll, but just honey glazed.<br /><br />If you are considering buying, don't hesitate!

review/summary: Earth's Best Yogurt Smoothies
review/text: My 23 month-old son loves these yogurt packets.  I love that they are organic!  We keep a variety of flavors of these, as well as the Happy Tot brand, in the refrigerator for a once or twice-a-day treat.  I like that it incorporates a serving of fruit and dairy, although the sugar content is approximately 15 grams (I think...going from memory).  These are very convenient to pack for travel or going out to dinner.  The other brand that I mentioned also incorporates a vegetable in some of the flavors, FYI.

review/summary: My daughter loves these smoothies
review/text: My 19-month old really loves fruit and adores these smoothies.  It's a great way to get fruit & yogurt to her and I love that they are organic.  It's also great that they portable and NO MESS!  Great snack for on the go or when you don't feel like changing their outfit after they feed themselves (i.e. applesauce).  The subscribe & save is a good deal compared with the price at local stores.  Peach Banana is her favorite flavor so far.  We also tried Apple Blueberry and Mixed Berry (aka "Big Bir" and Grova" flavors).  All have been a success.

review/summary: Great Portable Snack for Infants & Toddlers!
review/text: We started buying these pouches when our daughter was 8 months old. At that point we would spoon feed her the contents. Now she is 15 months and has been eating the smoothies straight from the pouch, using the opening as a straw. They are so incredibly convenient and portable, and best of all - the ingredients are organic and there isn't anything in these pouches that you cannot pronounce. I feel great giving these to my daughter, and she sure loves getting them!! They are a diaper bag NECESSITY! I am sure we will be buying these for several years to come.

review/summary: Organic, wholesome and great source of Calcium
review/text: My little one LOVES these smoothies and I feel great about offering them.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />1) Made from certified organic ingredients<br />2) Contains Calcium and Vitamin D<br />3) Large size-- each pouch contains over 4 ounces<br />4) Perfect container for toddlers and on-the-go... kiddos can hold it and feed themselves easily<br />5) No artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, or anything scary.<br /><br />A few reviewers have commented on the "yogurt" smell... well, this is exactly as described right on the pouch: YOGURT Smoothie. It is not disguised with artificial flavors. It is a healthy snack with pure, simple ingredients. If you are looking for something more sugary/less "yogurty", then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I have offered this to my little one and his friends on many occasions, and every child has liked it.

review/summary: my 1 year old daughter loves it!
review/text: I first ordered two boxes when packing for an international trip with my baby daughter. It tastes great and is very convenient for traveling. I could not imagine my baby daughter flying internationally without having one smoothie at hand. After we returned home, I subsribed it for monthly delivery. Now I always have one or two pouch in the diaper bag.

review/summary: SOOOO YUMMY!!
review/text: I originally bought a couple of these from babies-R-us for my 16month old daughter to have as a snack when we went to sea world. I figured it was healthy and something she can hold onto and feed herself, since ya know at this age they are getting oh so independent and want to do everything for themselves!! She loves them! We now buy them by the case from amazon because buying them individually from babies-r-us is just a little expensive, and here you get a pack of 12 for $17! Being a first time mom I have tried and failed with a lot of things for her snacks so now I actually taste everything that I give her and hey even I would eat these as a snack!!
