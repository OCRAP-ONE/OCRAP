review/summary: Best Hot Sauce On The Market Besides Frank's Original!!!!
review/text: I had been wanting to try this hot sauce for about the last two years.  The problem was that no Grocery Store around here sales it anymore.  I happened upon it one day while researching it.  The price of it with shipping and all was like $7 I think.  But the wait and the price was well worth it.  I love it!!!!! When I get the money - I will have a whole case of it.  It does have a hard kick to it - but it's good to eat on Fries, Chicken, Fish, whatever. It's especially good to cook with too!!! I would recommend this to anyone who is a hot sauce lover.

review/text: I keep quite a few types of hot sauce around so I can tailor the flavors to whatever I'm making.  This is my favorite for wings.  The lime gives the sauce a nice tang, and it's not too hot for most folks.  I serve the wings with a bottle of regular Frank's and some crushed red peppers so real heat freaks can spike them up a little.

Instead of continuing to argue while I am holding my stained invoice in my hand, I will just choose to no longer order anthing from this site ever again and warn others of my misfortune and the poor customer service I received.

review/summary: A very under-rated olive oil
review/text: OK - we all love olive oil. You cannot call yourself a "foodie" and not appreciate. France produces less than 5% of the world's olive oil. Most don't think about France as an olive oil producer BUT...... some of the best, in my opinion are made in small quantities in the hill towns of Provence following artisnal methods created generations ago. The light, sweet Nicolas Alziari is probably the best known French premium olive oil - pricey but always a treat. HOWEVER - Puget - a Marseille-based food company produces a very good, lighter-style olive oil as well, when compared to Italian and Spanish olive oils in the moderate price range. Not made exclusively from French olives but the end result is what one could expect from much higher priced oils - French or from elsewhere. Puget has always been a staple in this household. Un saveur qui vaut le prix.

review/text: This is the only K-Cup my mother will drink. Her actual home brewer preference is Folgers 100% Columbian medium-dark roast from the can. They don't use that actual blend in K-Cups. My mother has Neuropathy, her fingers are becoming numb and nerves have a stinging sensation. Keurig is her easiest way to make a cup of coffee without going through all the stages to make a home brewed batch.<br /><br />SamsClub.com pricing as of this review...<br />Newman's Special Blend EXTRA BOLD Keurig K-Cups 80 ct.<br />$36.88 box<br />$5.94 shipping (Go to the club to save on shipping)<br /><br />I bought three boxes.<br /><br />If you don't have a Sam's Club account, you can still buy but add 10% premium to cost of product.

review/summary: Real good cup of medium to bold coffee
review/text: I like the Newman's Special Blend, and would give it a 4.5 on the 1 to 5 star review range.  It is a little bitter as most stronger coffees are, but not too too bitter.  I would say it leans towards strong on the medium to strong scale, but it's not overwhelming.  If you like a nice normal blend with some kick, and are an advocate of organic initiatives, this is a great pick.<br /><br />I also like to say that I always look to buy the good Newman's Own brands when I can based on the fact that the Newman's Own Foundation continues Paul Newman's commitment to donate all profits to charity.  A fantastic American non-profit company.  You are not forgotten Mr. Paul Newman - RIP.

review/summary: A Newbie Speaks
review/text: I got this as a sample with my new Mr. Coffee keurig machine.  I usually only drink one cup here and there fairly inconsistently and I am absolutely loving how k-cups work.  That being said, this k-cup made the best coffee I have ever had, hands down.  It isn't bitter at all and has a nice bold flavor that sends a warmth of delight radiating out from your taste buds. It seems a bit bold for a medium roast, so keep that in mind. It does say "extra bold/very intense" on the cup after all.  However, it is perfect for someone who enjoys a strong and fairly intense cup. I will continue to try other k-cups but I have a feeling this will become my staple, go-to brand for some time to come.  I always liked coffee but would not consider myself a "coffee lover".  Between this cup and my new machine to brew it with, I'm definitely heading in that direction.  Try some!

review/summary: Possibly the world's most perfect k-cup.
review/text: Typically, I like a lighter roast first thing in the morning such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TC7WN4">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewer</a> then switch to Newman's Special Blend for the last cup of the morning.  Newman's Special Blend is my hands down favorite in the evening or when I have guests and is consistently my guest's favorite as well.<br /><br />This is the one coffee I have purchased regularly after buying my Keurig.  I almost always buy one box of this, one box of a medium to lighter roast, and one other that I haven't tried.  This coffee has never disappointed, it is smooth, rich, and never bitter; the closest I've found to the "perfect cup of coffee".<br /><br />This is a coffee so well balanced and blended that everyone can enjoy it.

Newman's special blend Arabica coffee for me leaves nothing to be desired;  taste, aroma, boldness and ease of preparation make this a daily morning must have.  I would certainly recommend that if you are a coffee lover, that you give it a try.  I think it's the best thing since sliced bread.

review/summary: A Rich Cup
review/text: This coffee is good quality. It is a strong medium roast with slight acidity but not overwhelming acidity. The extra bold means that the K cup has more ground coffee in it. It does not refer to the type of roast but rather the amount of coffee in the k cup. The cups are almost completely full of coffee. It's a good wake up cup of coffee for the morning and it is organic too! I find that the 8 oz. setting on my brewer makes just the right cup. Those who like their coffee weaker might like a 10 oz. setting. I would recommend this coffee if you can get it at a reasonable price.

I've tried LOTS of different decaf K cups, but was never as satisfied as I wanted.  Then I thought, why not just get Newman's decaf?  So I gave it a try and sure enough - great flavor.  It's tastes very similar to the regular blend.  So - if you like the original Newman's, then you will also like the decaf.

review/text: I will continue to order Newman's Own Extra-bold again and again.  It's strong yet has no bitter taste.  I've tried so many other coffee...and like many of the Coffee People blends, but this is organic along with having such a wonderful flavor. Plus.... everyone in the family kept using up the Newman's K-cups and leaving all the other brands. So I gave up on having a variety and just order the Newman's.

review/summary: Coffee Connoisseur Alert, This is The Best.
review/text: Recently purchased the Keurig Single Cup Brewer. Love the convenience and no filter or pot to wash. Tried the sample K-cups included. All were good but the Newman's extra-bold was outstanding. I had been buying an organic blend that I thought was good until I tried this. I was hooked but this was almost like buying printer ink, very expensive. The 80 pk is about two pounds of coffee. Amazon pricing is $48 dollars which equals $24 dollars a pound. This is pricey, you are paying for the convenience. Other retailers mark this up even more making Amazon look cheap. I found this at BJ's wholesale club for $37 dollars. Not that much cheaper but it is a savings. Bottom Line: The Keurig Brewer is a fantastic coffee machine that works best with the K-cups. Newman's extra-bold is an organic coffee that is superlative to other brands and worth the money. My advise is to shop around for the best price.

There are others of course!  So order the Newman extra bold,  the Emeril big easy bold, and the sleepy time tea and you have the bases covered.  At least for my family, yer mileage will surely vary.

review/summary: Great cup of coffe; 5 cents more per cup that at Store
review/text: I really like this particular flavor -- always enjoyed the coffee grounds back when I had that kind of coffee maker.  This one is good too.  It tastes good either hot or iced.  The only downside is it's about 5 cents more per cup than if you buy at Walmart of Target where you can get 18 K-cups for $9.95 on sale sometimes.  Not too big a deal because it costs money in gas to get there so the price is on par and maybe better.<br /><br />The organic coffees just taste better and Newman's products are well made -- as if they really care about taste.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />With amazon prime, it's good because you only wait 2 days.

review/summary: Bold, strong, delicious
review/text: Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored.  Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, or just ordinary.  I feel like I found MY FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. The most popular coffee among keurig users seems to be the donut shop coffee. I tried this one and was among the few that thought it tasted bitter and burnt. I thought if so many like this and I don't, I will never find that coffee shop house blend.  I'm so glad I found "my donut shop coffee" :) Give Newmans Special Blend a chance, this will be my staple from now on. (Get it at Costco or SAMs for $33).

I was disappointed.  I'm not sure how they came up with "Extra Bold" in the name, but I found it relatively weak.  I ended up drinking a couple, saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker, smoother blends and gave the rest away.

The main thing I noticed is that I have to scrub the hell out of my mouth and tongue after drinking it, because the flavor really, really stays around. I never noticed having to do this with Tully's. It's a gross, smoky taste. It's like having smoker's breath without smoking.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish this box...

review/text: I recently ran out of GMCR's "Our Blend' and was forced to try Newman's Own.  It took my colleagues 20 minutes to convince me that I wasn't drinking urine.  It truly offended my taste buds.<br /><br />You can taste the lack of passion and pride in this blend.  Newman could take a lesson from "Our Blend" - show a little pride for your work.  Don't be afraid to think outside the box to create a coffee that doesn't taste like cow sweat. That's what makes "Our Blend" great - you can taste the uniqueness and creativity in the brew.<br /><br />My advice to Newman's Own: Step aside and let the artists behind "Our Blend" restore America's faith in coffee.

Newman's Own is bold without being too bold (I didn't care for the French roasts--too strong for me) and has that restaurant-brewed flavor that's so hard to find.  No bitter aftertaste. It's nutty and delicious with a bit of half and half and no sugar (the way I drink coffee). I purchased these at our local grocery store as the price was a bit better than Amazon (sorry Amazon!). If you like great tasting coffee without your socks being knocked off (by a super dark roast), then try Newman's.

review/summary: This is the only K Cup we buy!
review/text: As far as Keurig coffee goes, you have like, a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word "strong" or "dark" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.  I brew it in the afternoon, and it gives me that last-half-of-the-day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.  If you like strong coffee, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Best K-Cup out there if you like strong coffee
review/text: Has the richest flavor. Other K-Cup brands taste really bad after you try this one. Flavor might vary a bit between batches, but they are all good and strong. It is a waste to prepare a "large" cup with this, since it can easily handle a "large+small", which amounts to ~400ml of rich coffee. If you like espresso, go with small. Worth every penny, thank you Newman :)<br /><br />PS: Decaf is equally good.

review/summary: Nothing bold about this flavor
review/text: There is nothing "extra bold," or even "regular bold" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not "extra bold" at all.  If you want your coffee "slap your face" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example.

review/summary: Definitely not my favorite
review/text: I have tried quite a few K-Cup products and this one left me longing for something else. It kind of has a burnt taste to it. I have tried Newman's coffee via a McDonald's and it did not taste like this. Overall I was disappointed and have moved on to the likes of Wolfgang Puck. These tend to be a little more smooth.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is become my favorite blend of coffee in the K-cup.  My house used to live on the "Coffee People, Donut Shop" - (still a decent K-cup.)  I bought an 80 pack of Newmans Own, Special Blend at Sams Club for $40 just to try it, and we were hooked after our 1st cup.  This is a delicious balance of a darker roast that isnt too over powering.  I would recommend this to anyone - 5 stars.

review/summary: Definately not a Medium Roast Coffee! Too bold and bitter!
review/text: Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff.

review/summary: Not to my taste
review/text: A box of these was included with my new Keurig system. I fear and detest weak coffee, but a 10oz serving of this is still strong, with a satisfying body to it. Another positive is that it's not sour, like I found the Kona to be, nor it is especially bitter. But, though I'm fine with dark or French-roasted coffees, the Newmans Own Special Blend tastes flat-out burnt to me. Next job is to try a sampler pack to find my perfect K-cup.

review/summary: Really Good Coffee
review/text: Obviously, one's preference for coffee is a personal thing. I happen to like this particular coffee very much. It is strong enough, but not bitter. I bought two boxes on sale, but the regular price of the K-cups has been rising beyond the point that I will spend for a homemade cup of coffee. Instead, I have been using pods for the Senseo machines. I got an adaptor for the Keureg, and they work fine for less than half the price. I also have an adaptor for ground coffee, the cheapest alternative, so I always have lots of choices for coffee flavors.

review/text: I really like this blend.  I've had a hard time with Keurig flavors, but this one seems to fit the bill.<br />The taste is strong, nutty...but not bitter.  I like a good strong cup.  I find many of the Green Mountain varieties, especially the mild blends, lacking in the bite I enjoy.  This one is not like that.  I would recommend for those who like Starbucks.

review/summary: A nice addition to my K-cup repertoire
review/text: This is the fourth different type of coffee I have tried with my Keurig coffee maker. At this point, it is tied for my favorite with Starbuck's vanilla coffee (I use the attachment for ground coffee to brew this).<br /><br />Is this peoduct extra bold? It certainly has a smoother taste than that of some of the other coffees that I have tried. It does not have the acidic edge that another company's product manifests.<br /><br />One of the nice things about a Keurig machine is that--through outlets such as Amazon--one can experiment with a variety of brands and tastes to find what works best for one. And this Newman's Own K-cup is a highly successful experiment!

review/summary: VERY STRONG.
review/text: I should have known not to get the extra bold. This usually refers to the amount of coffee, but when I brewed it on the "tall" setting so that it is not so strong, it still was way too intense for my taste. I only ordered this blend because of the reviews, which I cannot really understand. I have to mix almost a half cup of almond milk to cut the bitterness. I will probably not buy this again.<br />Side Note: I only got this to use with my office keurig machine. At home, I use Equal Exchange Organic Coffee and it is WONDERFUL!

review/text: Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored. Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, acidic, or just ordinary. We have found OUR FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. Comes exactly as described by the seller, order promptly processed, arrives quickly. Can't beat it in our opinion. I can recommend this coffee and the seller with confidence.
