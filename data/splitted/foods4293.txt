review/summary: A Special Treat for Anyone, Especially for Dieters
review/text: Everyone has their own personal tastes, but to me this is a Wow. Why so? First I love the taste. It reminds me of the days when I was young drinking Boones Farm Apple wine on a Friday night. Some may prefer, or liken it to champagne.<br />I'm on a diet, lost the first 10 pounds in 12 days. It is a simple diet, eat as much natural fruit, and vegetables, and salads as I want, and limit my sandwiches at lunch to whole grain bread with lean meats, like chicken, fish, or Boka/Morning Star (soy) burgers, and the same type of meat entree at night for dinner on top of a pile of steamed veggies, and Olive Oil. Yeah lots of olive oil. (Not to excess though) My sandwiches, and dinner's meats/steamed veggies always enjoy piles of saut&eacute;ed onions, bell pepper, etc. to put on top of them. You could say that it is not a fast, but rather a feast. One of the key ingredients is I have all the fruit I want. At night time if I get hungry, I will eat a whole small jar of natural apple sauce. No sugar added. Oh, and I drink plenty of water. Eight glasses a day? Probably, I don't measure; I just walk around with a large plastic mug, filled with water, and sip all day long.<br />So what does all of this have to do with the IZZE sparkling apple? Namely this. It is a special treat.<br />I would not call it diet food, because in order for fruit to be dietetic, it must be in its natural state. It can be cut into chunks, and fresh frozen, and blended into smoothies, which is my preferred method; eliminates spoilage, and adds to the fun. But you have to avoid concentrating it, thereby increasing the sugar content. In this case, it is from concentrate, but then they add sparkling water. So it is kind of teetering on the fence. That is why I call it a special treat.<br />So for those who may not agree with my dieting methods, or the fact that I easily drop 20 pounds in the spring, and have been doing it for well over 25 years, (Yes I have lost over 500 pounds in my lifetime) and are more interested in having a good time, let's talk about the Wow factor.<br />This stuff tastes great. I quit drinking some 10 years ago, but this is an opportunity to live it up. Whenever I open a can of Izze, it is like a celebration. By the way, I am talking about the apple, and am curious about the other flavors as well. One thing is certain, I will be purchaing more of this when my current case runs out.<br />When dieting, the big enemy is cane sugar, which is fattening. Fruit sugar in its natural state is immediately absorbed by the body, and does not convert to fat readily the way cane sugar does. (All I know is when I eat cane sugar I immediately gain weight, and when I eat all the fruit I want, I lose it)<br />If you are looking to break the canned soda habit, Izze is the way to go. Canned soda has some ungodly amount of cane sugar in it.<br />Another interesting factoid, according to Dr Weil M.D., the nutritional, and natural healing guru, the main benefit from drinking wine is not in the alcohol, but in the grapes. By getting Izze apple, the primary ingredient is grape juice, then apple, etc. So help your heart, or arteries, or whatever they espouse about the benefits of drinking wine, and get some Izze. I'm sold. Once you taste it, many will be too.<br />I think the Izze people are really on to something here. Highly recommended.

review/summary: a better than soda option
review/text: OK here is the skinny (pun intended) of this "healthier" choice product...<br /><br />When I thought of this apple product I couldn't help but think of comparing this to Martinelli's Sparling Cider.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />Martinelli's 8.4oz bottle contains: Pasteurized 100% Pure Carbonated Apple Juice From U.S. Grown Fresh Apples, Vitamin C, No Water or Alcohol, No Concentrates, No Sweeteners or Preservatives.<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />---------------------------------------<br />Izze's Sparkling Apple Juice, 8.4oz can contains 70% pure juice (white grape, apple and lemon) concentrates, sparkling water, natural flavor, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinamide, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (vitamin B6)<br /><br />Calories: 90<br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />- Martinelli's is sweeter, whereas this is more of a tart apple flavor but it's good<br /><br />- Martinelli's is more heavily carbonated, whereas this is lighter almost to a fault, to where it taste flat if the drink isn't cold<br /><br />- 24, 8.4oz bottles of Martinelli's is approx $30, whereas this is 24, 8.4oz cans for around $22. I'm always excited about a cost savings.<br /><br />- I like being able to throw a can in my backpack vs. a bottle so I have something on-the-go. Also the can is lighter than bottle and I don't have to worry about finding broken glass in my backpack.<br /><br />- The vitamin content is only 10% of the recommended daily servers, per can. Thus, I'd rather take a multi-vitamin.<br /><br />- This is not an energy drink, but a sparking juice. So no substitute for that Starbuck's or Red Bull addiction<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />After reading a ton of books on health & fitness, watching the TV show "The Biggest Loser" and having trained for a triathlon. . .<br />This is a luxury vs. a need. You are better off drinking water and use those 90 calories to eat a couple of pieces of fruit, which is better for you and more satisfying.<br /><br />But, if you need an alternative to soda, this may be a good choice to ween yourself off the soda and eventually transition to water.

review/summary: Yummy Naturally Flavored Juice Beverage
review/text: This is a review for the apple flavor only.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this stuff.  I'm a sucker for apple flavoring in just about anything, so this was a real winner.  The taste of the drink is quite good, the mix of water and juice just right.  The taste on drinking is very good, subtly apple, but not overpowering; thankfully, this is not a liquid Jolly Rancher Apple drink.  The aftertaste is quite good, too, quiet and definitely apple-y.  I anticipated a slight metallic taste, which one sometimes finds with apple flavorings, but encountered none of that with this product, a definite plus.<br /><br />My biggest complaint: the small serving size.  At only 8.4 oz., there just isn't enough there to satisfy me, especially if actually thirsty.  Now, I understand why this is packaged this way.  As it stands, this small little package is pushing 90 calories.  At a regular 12 oz. size, it would be about 128 calories, which would be an awfully tough thing to market.  So, you've got to get your satisfaction in the space of eight and a half ounces, or open up another one and go for 17.<br /><br />The can's text has me wondering.  I'm told that it's made from pure fruit juice, but that there are other natural flavors and it's a naturally flavored juice beverage, from concentrate.  Huh?  Now, that's an awful lot of dissembling and non-clear information.  Is it pure or not?  Is it just juice and sparkling water or not?  Given all of the caveats on the packaging, I tend to think it's not nearly as clear as they'd like us to believe it is.  The ingredients tell us that it's apple, white grape and lemon juices at play here.  Interesting.<br /><br />But, and I stress this, I really could care less about all of this.  I'm not a rabid healthnik, and I really liked the taste.  I point this out for those who really care about sources and methods.<br /><br />My wife liked the product, and notes that it's quite good over ice with some vodka.  I preferred it mixed with a little bit of rum, which got somewhere close to German Appel.<br /><br />Both my kids liked it quite a bit, but both wished it came in a regular, 12 oz. size.<br /><br />The vitamin content is pretty good, with C, B6 and niacin.  The sugars (they note that there are no refined sugars in the product) count is up there, at 21g.  The sodium is very low, and there's no fat.  There is no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, clean and as far as I can tell just about as natural as you can get.  But it is not a diet drink.  It's good by itself, and it's a nice, simple mixer

review/summary: Delicious & Refreshing
review/text: After getting a case of apple-flavored Izze -- and enjoying it immensely -- I am eager to try the other flavors.  This stuff is good!  The apple flavor has a sour-apple thing going on... but it's not *too* sour.  It's also not too sweet -- which is another reason I love it.  You know how some carbonated beverages are full of corn syrup and other things that can make you feel like you're downing packets of sugar?  Izze doesn't make me feel that way.  If you like sparkling cider, and you don't mind a little sour apple kick, I bet you'll enjoy apple Izze.

review/summary: Impressive drink with real apple flavor
review/text: I think it's refreshing to find a soft drink that really tastes like fruit.  This is an apple-flavored "sparkling" beverage, which I take to mean light carbonation.  It is a blend of juices, not straight apple juice.  It does not contain added sugar or high fructose corn syrup, so it's not exactly calorie free.  The taste could be summarized with diluting apple juice with water and then adding fizz.  You'd really have to like apple juice to get into this flavor though.  It's a bit preschool-like for my tastes.  I incidentally saw this for sale at my neighborhood grocery store and it was much more expensive than the Amazon price.

review/summary: If You Like the Taste of Fake Apple...
review/text: ... then you will love this product.<br /><br />*this review is for the Apple flavored Izze*<br /><br />The concept is great and I am all on board with the fact that this product has no additives and it's simply just juice and sparkling water.  Woo Hoo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, instead of using just apple juice, they threw in a little white grape juice and some lemon juice and the result is that flavor you get when you eat apple flavored Jolly Ranchers, chew apple gum, or any other kind of apple candy; that fake apple taste that to me is nothing like the taste of real apples.  I happen to despise that flavor.<br /><br />I still like the product and while my son loved the flavor, I found it only tolerable.  But on those special occasions when he is allowed a pop, I much rather give him this sparkling juice that he THINKS is a pop.<br /><br />And for me, I am not a big pop OR juice drinker, but I love fizzy waters, and this is a nice change of pace.  I would buy this product and flavor, again,for my son, and purchase another flavor for me.<br /><br />My son says it is worth 5 stars because he loved it.  I think it is worth 3 stars because of the flavor, so I am compromising with a 4. :)<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, April 2008

review/summary: Ultimate Fruit Juice
review/text: I have thus far sampled three of Izze's All Natural Sparkling Juices : Apple, Clementine, and Grapefruit.  All of them feature their natural fruit flavor and lack of added sugar.  In each case, the result was much like having real fruit in liquid form and the natural juices had more than enough sweetness on their own to offset any desire for a "sweet fix".<br /><br />Oddly enough, the sparkling water altered the drink differently in each of the three cases.  I'm not sure if this indicates a difference in the water or the interaction with the different juices.  In the case of the clementine, it was very noticable - almost reaching orange soft drink status.  For the apple, it was more like sparkling cider.  It was barely noticable in the case of the grapefruit juiice.<br /><br />This might make the clementine more ideal for youngsters because of its affinity to Sunkist (although, in my opinion, far tastier and, one assumes, healthier) and the others more suitable for adult palates.  In any case, this mix of fruit juice flavor and "fizz" make it a good choice for hot summer days.

review/text: Since I don't allow my kids to drink soda, sometimes they want a treat. I've tried many sparking juices but none have hit the mark - until Izzy. It has an awesome fruity flavor and the fizziness of a soda, but without all the chemicals. We tried the apple, blackberry and orange sodas so far and all of them are delicious.<br /><br />I also like that Izzy has no added sugars or preservatives and that they are an Eco-friendly company.

review/summary: Sparkling Cider in a Can
review/text: Light and tasty, probably the best feature of this carbonated juice is that it does not have any added sugar. Apple Juice is sweet enough as it is. It also features some added vitamins but ultimately, I was taken by the slightly tart taste and the 90 calories per 8.4 ounce can. Very reasonable. So go ahead and get this product for your kids (and yourself). It beats soda, cool aid, and many so called juice drinks that are mostly sugar and water with 10% or so actual juice.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I first tried the Izze Sparkling Apple drink, but I was pleasantly surprised. The drink is carbonated, but the carbonation is just right, not too strong or too weak. Although the 8.4 oz drink has 90 calories and 21g of sugar, it does contain 70% fruit juice, which in the case of the apple flavor is a combination of white grape, apple, and lemon juice concentrates.<br /><br />This is a refreshing drink, and a nice size if you want something less than a regular 12 oz can. There is very little after taste, if any at all, and the beverage provides a refreshing light feeling apple juice inspired experience. Also, Izze drinks are best served cold!

review/summary: First Rate Thirst Quencher!
review/text: This sparkling apple drink by IZZE is, in a word, Aces! It's constructed from unsweetened fruit juices [70%], carbonated water [30%], and a few extra vitamins. The juices are apple, white grape, and acerola. I'm not familiar with the latter, but they're all workin' together, finestkind. The apple flavor comes through as fresh, sweet and tart, without a hint of aftertaste from the vitamins. For comparison purposes, if you like Martinelli's sparkling cider, then you'll luv this stuff! It's a bit pricey at a buck a pop for eight fluid ounces, but then again, look what fast-food is chargin' us for far less value.

review/summary: Fizzy Sweet Apple Juice
review/text: Like many Americans, I am addicted to soft drinks.  I have been on a quest to find alternatives to these unhealthy drinks, and find replacements that offer great taste and the carbonation that I enjoy.  I tried both the Apple and Blackberry flavors of the Izze Fortified Sparkling juice, and was very impressed with both.  I enjoyed the crisp, fresh apple taste of the drink and found that it had just the right amount of "fizz".  The taste could be compared to some other sparkling apple ciders that I have sampled in the past, but I feel that Izze offers more of a tart, green apple flavor. Of the two, the Blackberry flavor was my favorite.<br /><br />The juice has just the right amount of fizz, and is not overly sweet.  The only negative is that I wish the cans were larger...I enjoyed it that much!<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy alternative to soft drinks for you and your family, you might want to give these a try.  Enjoy!

The drink itself is pretty simple, 70% pure fruit juice with 30% sparkling water.  Great for those that like carbonated drinks but could do without all the sugar.

review/summary: My family loved it, I was more aware of the aftertaste
review/text: If you asked my boys, ages 13 and 10, for a review of this sparkling juice, they would probably give it about 15 stars!  They loved it, so much I had to guide a few cans so I could write a review.  They thought it had the perfect blend of tangy and sparkly, was just the right size for a great little pick-me-up drink and was much better than soda.  That alone is enough to really recommend it, as it's far better for the body that soda.  However, I wasn't quite as thrilled.  It's the fortified part that I didn't like.  I felt like the taste was a bit "vitaminy".  It was more an aftertaste--I felt like I had chewed a multivitamin after drinking one.  It did have a little bit of an apple taste, but not as much as I would have wished.<br /><br />The cans look cool----nice design---and I really did like the size.  A can of soda or a big juice bottle often is just too much, and you are left either drinking more than you need or feeling wasteful.  You could finish these!  The price would be a bit high, but if you didn't have boys that gulped them down in the house and were having one or two a day, it would not be bad at all.<br /><br />Overall, a good product.

review/summary: A lot of good things in a small can
review/text: It's difficult to write a detailed review on a carbonated soft drink, but there are a few things worthy of mention with the "Izze" range of drinks. The apple (reviewed here) is my particular favorite, it is light, refreshing, tasty without being too sweet and surprisingly versatile, as long as you "think outside the can".<br />A word of mention about HFCS or High Fructose Corn Syrup and the fact that this drink is COMPLETELY FREE of the stuff is also important. A simple web search will tell most anyone about the ongoing connection between HFCS and obesity, even high blood pressure and other health problems, and the fact that it is becoming used more and more in everyday drinks and food products. The main problem being that (unlike glucose) fructose is not easily metabolized in the body, and leads to high amounts being stored as fat. Izze relys on natural juice for it's flavor and taste, and one serving (one 8.4oz can) has 90 Calories, only 1% sodium, and 21g of sugar derived from natural White Grape, Apple and Lemon juice concentrates. In fact each can contains over 70% juice.<br />There has been a trend away from carbonated drinks over the last year or so toward purified and mineral bottle waters, flavored water, and even "protein" water. I assume this is to cut down on high amounts of sugar intake (or artificial sweeteners in diet drinks) especially in children, also dentists have long bemoaned the effects of carbonated drinks on teeth and gum health. I'm not suggesting that Izze is a perfect alternative, but in moderation it can be enjoyed for it's natural ingredients. Another good thing to remember about Izze is versatility - many people enjoy wine, or sparkling wine with a meal, and a lot of people today prefer it without alcohol. Izze can be decanted nicely into wine flutes for a sparkling alternative to other non alcoholic wines (most of which contain a lot of HFCS).<br />It's also a great mixer WITH alcohol, or simply as a long drink in itself over ice.<br />Why the small cans? - well I like to think that it's a reminder that we used to drink soda and other carbonated drinks in 9oz bottles, and only in recent years have we become overly indulgent to 20oz and even higher bottles and serving sizes.<br />Izze is not the cheapest fizzy fruit drink, but it's probably one of the tastiest, and despite the calorie and carb count (for those watching weight) it is a natural alternative to other mainstream products.<br />As if all this was not enough, Izze also partner with Global Education Fund to provide resources for needy children.

review/summary: Good alternative to unhealthy sodas
review/text: While I am not going to say that these are extremely healthy beverages, the Izze line of fortified sparkling juices does provide a healthier alternative to those of us who drink a little too much soda. As far as taste goes, do not try to drink these warm! Once they're chilled, however, they've got just the right combination of carbonation and tartness, along with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Definitely not too hard on the taste buds.<br /><br />The 8.4 ounce size of the cans is perfect for a single serving. The Apple flavor we tried does contain 90 calories and 21 grams of sugar, but when compared to the average soda on the market those totals are about 30% less per serving. There's also the added incentive of Vitamin C, Niacin, and B6 included as 10% of your daily value, similar to other drinks on the market.<br /><br />While it's not as healthy for you as 100% juice, Izze drinks do contain 70% fruit juice, and I would highly recommend the Apple flavor. I plan on purchasing the other flavors soon, as well.

review/summary: It's a juice that tastes like a soft drink
review/text: This product is made with 70% fruit juice concentrates (white grape, apple and lemon juice) and carbonated water to give it some zing. It has a lot more sweet "punch" to it than a regular serving of juice. It reminded me of a Sprite. If you were to compare it to the calorie count per ounce with a soft drink like Sprite, it has a little less. For me, this is an acceptable substitute for my daughter instead of a soft drink.<br /><br />The packaging boasts of having no refined sugars and being fortified with vitamins (looks like vitamins C, B6 and Niacin)

review/summary: Apple is great, grapefruit is very good,  but pomegranate is not pomegranate
review/text: Although  the apple one is not entirely made of apples - it has white grape juice and lemon juice- it has a refreshingly tart taste that captures the taste of a fresh, slight tart, sweet apple.  Very tasty.<br /><br />I like the apple and grapefruit varieties of this brand, which taste true to form. However, I was not too fond of the pomegranate one. I've been drinking alot of Odwalla pomegranate juice lately and this falls way short of tasting like pomegranate. In fact, pomegranate is not the main ingredient- apple, white grape, pineapple, and cranberry are!  Ounce for ounce, I believe I am not getting the bang for the buck. Maybe a teaspoon of actual pomegranate juice.

review/summary: Delicious, delicious, delicious!
review/text: The apple flavor is great for those who like the taste of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider. What's great about IZZE is their lack of added sugar. All of the sugar in this drink comes naturally from fruit juice. You won't find any artificial sugar like as high fructose corn syrup in IZZE. As a result, a word of caution for those who are used to indulging heavily-sweetened soft drinks like Coca-Cola, this drink is NOT super sweet, which is a health benefit.<br /><br />IZZE is a healthier alternative to mainstream soft drinks, and I highly recommend it to soda lovers that are health conscious.

review/text: Sparkling Apple is definitely IZZE's best flavor. It's at least as good as Martinelli's but a better deal. With Prime, I got a 24-pack for less than $1 per can. They taste better out of bottles but those are pricey. Just crack the can and pour over ice. I definitely recommend buying this drink. Also, there are no refined sugars (like the ubiquitous and malevolent high fructose corn syrup) or preservatives. Read the ingredients and you'll understand why it's so good: it's simply delicious.

review/text: I had heard about this product before, but never saw it at local retailers. I decided to give it a try through Amazon and was really surprised by how good of a product this is. I can only speak for the apple Izze Fortified, but it is Granny Smith apple juice with high/fine carbonation. If you get them ice cold, it is so bright and refreshing. If you enjoy the flavor of Granny Smith apples, you cannot go wrong with Izze Fortified. I originally had this scheduled for every two months, but had to go monthly on it. This is the ultimate apple soda, but it's only juice and water, so you can feel good about drinking them.

review/summary: A wonderful treat!
review/text: I got very attached to this flavor of Izze right off the bat when I picked up a 4-pack from my local Target on a whim. And then they stopped carrying it! So now I order a case every once in awhile as a treat for myself.<br /><br />It's best cold, right out of the fridge. It doesn't taste like your typical fruit-flavored soda, over-sugared and cloying, but light, crisp, just a touch sour and never too sweet-- appropriately, like a fresh green apple. The carbonation is never overpowering, giving it just enough tingle to be an interesting texture. This flavor also comes in bottles, but I've found the small cans are just the right size for a single serving.

review/summary: IZZE Sparkling Juice
review/text: My 7 year old loves the IZZE drinks and was buying them in school at lunch.  We found that we could save a lot of money buying them from Amazon on the subscription plan every month.  Also, they are just fruit juice and sparkling water, tastes a little like a fruity soda and we think they are a better alternative than the "boxed" or "packet" drinks that are so common.  I would recommend IZZE to any parent.

review/summary: A very nice drink . . .
review/text: I've tried two varieties of Izze's natural sparkling juice, including this one.  It's a great drink - refreshing, fresh-tasting and just the right amount of fizz and flavor.  It's best served over ice or as a mixer with alcohol.  I've made great apple/white wine spritzers with it.  I'm a big fan of Jones' Sodas green apple flavor, though it tends to be cloying and far too strong.  This gets the mix just right - plenty of apple flavor, but not too sweet.<br /><br />This product is 70% fruit juice with the bulk of the rest of its content being sparkling water, although there are some vitamins thrown in the mix.  So: no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup.  Unfortunately, the cans contain a scant 8.4 ounces of drink, and at about a buck a pop, they're pretty expensive.  I can't see myself drinking them by themselves, though I would (and will) certainly use them for mixed drinks.  Some mention should be made that some of the profits from sales go to charity, which is a worthy thing.

The fizziness made up for it not being soda, and since it's fruit juice I really felt like I was being healthy. The sugar content may be of concern to diabetics and those watching their glucose intake, but otherwise, a nice treat.

review/summary: Not your ordinary soft drink
review/text: I have two complaints about most sodas: 1) too fizzy, and 2) too sweet. This sparkling apple juice is neither -- it's got a natural, delicious taste, with just the right amount of bubbles. So far I have only tried the apple juice, but based on this one, I am definitely planning to sample the others. I served it at a party and it proved to be a great alternative to beer or wine for those who didn't want to drink alcohol. My only complaint is that the can is kind of narrow and awkward -- I wish it came in bottles instead. I think the idea is to make it look more like an energy drink (it is fortified with some vitamins, but this is NOT an energy drink), but I find the bottles that other specialty sodas, like GuS or Jones, use to be easier to handle.

The small size is perfect for a quick sip of something when thirst hits. Starbucks sells a number of these, so you know it's going to be good.

review/summary: Izze Apple Juice is as close to the experience of biting into a Granny Smith that an aluminum package can provide.
review/text: The first sip of Izze's sparkling apple juice was a bit of a shock, albeit a pleasant one.  It was bright and crisp, with an unexpectedly clear bite from the carbonation.  Tart enough that it really was a bit like taking a chunk out of a fresh Granny Smith.  Granted, some of this tartness comes from the other juices used in its creation, including but not necessarily limited to lemon and white grape.  Nonetheless, the flavor profile is all apple, and what's left (to borrow Izze's own tag line) is a "naturally delightful" and wholly refreshing vitamin-enriched (C, B6, and Niacin) beverage, delivered in a 8.4 fluid ounce slim can.<br /><br />We were impressed enough with the apple, that we went out and picked up bottles of blueberry, clementine, and peach.  Each provided similarly terrific tastes and experiences, although we did feel that the tartness that added to the apple juice 'realism' somewhat translated to less purely-blueberry (for example) profiles for some of the other flavors.  Nonetheless, we loved them all.<br /><br />Everyone's going to have different palettes and desires, but for a household that doesn't consume soft drinks, we found these to be a tasty and welcome diversion and alternative from our normal fare.  Izze has a new group of fans, and we're looking forward to trying more flavors.  Apple, at the very least, is going to be a staple around here.

review/summary: Fizzy fun
review/text: I must admit that I was initially turned off by the taste of the Sparkling Apple.  It reminded me of apple flavored hard candies.  However, as I experimented with adding the Izze to other fruit juices I started to appreciate how flexible it is.  I've added the Izze to passion fruit juice and I've added it to orange juice.  In both cases the combination is better than the Izze by itself.<br /><br />As a standalone product I'm finding that the combination of carbonization, lemon juice, and ascorbic acid are not particularly friendly to my stomach.  This is especially true if I drink it straight from the can.<br /><br />In short, I think this is a fun choice to experiment with as an additive to other fruit juices but I don't think it stands on its own very well.

review/text: Has a decent apple taste.  EXTREMELY fizzy and carbonated.  You're getting an eight ounce can, about 2/3 the size of a normal can of soda.  This is enough for a refreshing break, but if you are used to guzzling large quantities of drinks, you'll go through a case quickly.  I like it, but it isn't awesome.  The carbonation makes a refreshing change from straight apple juice, but it isn't remarkably better than normal apple juice.  It is a bit lower calorie than regular soda, but don't kid yourself that this is somehow a "low cal" drink.  There are claims for fortification with vitamins that I'm sure are accurate, but I can't test or vouch for them.

review/text: Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice comes in several flavors, and I chose the Apple when placing my order. Being neither a physician nor a connoisseur of fruit juices, I can't say much about the health aspects of this drink, only its taste.<br /><br />I suppose a juice made with an "all natural blend of pure fruit juice and sparkling water," that is also caffeine and sugar free, will reap greater benefits than a Coke or Pepsi, but I found this drink a little too acidid tasting for my liking. I was expecting, and would have preferred, something a little smoother. It seemed closer to Coke or Pepsi than it did to, say, orange or apple juice, and I think I'd just prefer to drink one of the latter than have an Izze again.<br /><br />Of course, that's my opinion, and when it comes to food products, well, we all like what we like, don't we?<br /><br />I didn't care for Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice. You, however, may find it to your liking.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks

Two, it is fruit juice with that extra punch of sparkling water, which to me is one healthy dose of carbonated water. I'm not one to (gasp) .....BURP, but this sure triggered that button. The taste is actually higher in carbonated liquid than apple juice.<br /><br />What is handy is the 8 oz size, easy to carry around, easy to finish. With 90 calories, I find it healthier than sodas or other sweeter drinks. But with the refined sugars, and artificial ingredients, I imagine it is not so pure!<br /><br />But for a quick refreshing alternative to soda, for a pick-up drink, light snack, easy on the stomach, this is a nice boost to beverage selections. ....

review/text: We don't drink a lot of soda at our house but if it's there it goes pretty fast, so this looked like a healthier alternative.  The taste of the apple drink is similar to Martinelli's, although a bit more tart than sweet.  The can says they "stay true to the fruit," and my wife's feeling was that it was perhaps a little *too true* to the fruit, but everyone liked it.  It is labeled as "all natural," being just fruit juice, carbonated water, and added vitamins, but it's still rather high in calories and sugar.  The apple drink is actually mostly white grape juice according to the ingredients listed.  My only complaint (which is perhaps too strong of a word) is the high price and the small size of the cans (about 8 oz), but the kids thought the skinny cans were cool.

review/summary: Sparkling Apple Izze is Tasty...
review/text: Izze fruit drinks are not sodas, instead they are carbonated ("sparkling") fruit drinks that come in 8.4 ounce cans. For someone who has an unnatural urge to drink something from a can, Izze proves that there are worse things to drink...<br /><br />The Izze Sparkling Apple drink actually does taste like apple juice. Its ingredients include:<br />* Pure juice made from white grape, apple and lemon juice concentrates;<br />* sparkling water,<br />* natural flavor (not sure what that means...)<br />* Vitamin C<br />* Vitamin B6<br /><br />When served cold, Izze Sparkling Apple goes down smooth and is refreshing. When served warm, it is not so smooth an d leaves a bad aftertaste. Served in 8.4 ounce cans, the portion is not quite as satisfying as a 12 ounce can. Finally, it is on the expensive side (24 8.4 Ounce cans sell for approximately $21.00). Still, I believe it is worth the price and is a quality alternative to soda.

review/text: Izze Soda is a nice alternative to regular sugary sodas, containing 70 percent fruit juice and sparkling water.  That's it.  No extra sugar, no preservatives, just natural ingredients.  The downside is that there isn't quite as much flavor as you would find in other sodas; it seems just a bit too watered down, at least in the apple version.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it; even with the lesser flavor, it's worth trying, although it does seem to be at it's best if you let it get extremely cold before drinking. The calorie conscious also might want to take note that even though there is no added sugar, one 8.4 ounce can still contains 90 calories.

review/text: I love to find non-soda pop drinks. And when I can find them out here in San Diego the Izze natural fruit sodas are among the best. Now Izze has outdone itself with its All Natural Sparkling Apple Juice. OK, so the cans are small cans -- much like energy drinks. 8.4 fluid ounces. But when you take a sip you get hooked by the flavor NOT the sugar. In fact, there is no caffeine, no refined sugar, no preservatives -- just fruit juice, sparkling water and extra vitamins. Nothing is excessive: not the sweeting and not the carbonation. And when you read the ingredients, you see they added white grape juice and lemon juice to flavor it. I have an entire case and will definitely be reordering it. Why? Because it's satisfying, absolutely delicious and low in calories -- only 90. This is one of the best sparkling Apple juices now on the market.

review/summary: A great substitute for soda! More healthy for you!
review/text: This apple flavor carries a slight woody aftertaste. It's not something that I'd have everyday, but it's not that bad. I notice that it only has 15mg of sodium compared to the typical 200mg-300mg found in most sodas. This makes it very great substitute for someone like me who is on a managed low-sodium diet. It also has only 90 calories, compared to the 300-500 that you'd find in most soda cans. It's a bit more filling than other sodas, but I don't quite clearly know why. It also has less sugar, but still 21g is still a lot. I also like the fact that it contains vitamins (10% Vitamin C, 10% Niacin, and 10% Vitamin B6) when most junk sodas don't have any at all. It's not exactly fruit juice but it's not really soda either. I think it's a rather fair compromise.

There are two vitamins in this drink (this flavor at least) and they're both only 10% of you're daily requirement.<br /><br />Drink this for the taste, not the health benefit.

review/text: I admit I did not like this at first (I ordered the Apple) It didnt have the strong tangy taste of apple juice that I was used to. It's also carbonated. Reading the label, I saw it also has lemon and grape juice added. But after a few tries, it has won me over. It's different than your regular apple juice, but I like it. Nice pick me up and not many calories. Keep in mind that it will taste different than your usual apple juice!

review/text: I have no doubt this beverage is healthier than most and a natural alternative to sodas.<br /><br />However, as an imitation of Soda it's a little like kissing your sister.  It's weak in intensity.  Of course, you could look at it the other way and say that Soda's are too strong and sugary and that would hit the mark as well.<br /><br />It provides a healthy altenative to soda, but it may take a while to adjust and get used to it as an alternative.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice</a> has a great apple flavor but it's only 70 percent juice and it's a mix of Apple, White Grape and Lemon juice. Now, with the added lemon juice, it leaves a bitter aftertaste. Since the flavor is apple, if the removed the lemon juice and replaced it with more apple, maybe there wouldn't be a bitter aftertaste. Anyways, It's a great apple taste but it could be better

review/summary: Put Some Izze in Your Wizze
review/text: When I first saw the name of this beverage I thought maybe they had hired Snoop Dogg as their spokesperson or to do their jingle.  I guess not.<br /><br />I have tried the Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice in the apple flavor.  The most attractive aspect of this beverage is it is made with real fruit juice and sparkling water so that gives it an advantage over other fruit flavored carbonated beverages, most of which are artificially flavored.  Plus it has no refined sugar or other artificial ingredients so it's a healthier carbonated beverage than most.<br /><br />For those of you who could give a whit about healthy soda-like beverages, like me, the taste is also very nice.  It has a strong but not overpowering apple flavor with the refreshing nature of a carbonated beverage.  It is definitely best served cold.  Warm it has a rather flat, less tasty nature.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Very good and goes down smooth
review/text: I don't drink a lot of soda, never really have.  That being said, I'm not a fan of carbonated beverages, so I approached this All Natural Sparkling Juice with a bit of caution.  I am happy to say though that this Izze All natural Sparkling Apple Juice is quite good and goes down pretty smooth as well.  The juice is also refreshing and tastes pretty good without being loaded with sugar and caffeine.  In those respects alone, this juice from Izze is a smashing success, but the only real downside is that if you aren't a drinker of carbonated beverages, this juice from Izze won't necessarily win you over.  That aside, this All Natural Sparkling Juice from Izze is good for what it is, and is worth a try at the very least.

review/summary: The granny apple-green can is awfully cute
review/text: (Note: This review is of the "Sparkling Apple" flavor.)<br /><br />First of all, what is IZZE Fortified and why is it available only in cans?<br /><br />The beverage was designed to provide 10% each of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of three vitamins, which are herein Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin. Why? According to the IZZE website, to be consistent with the recommendations for products sold for/to students and to make a healthy beverage - apple juice, in this case - even better. I guess you can fool Mother Nature at least some of the time.<br /><br />Again, according to the manufacturer's website, the product is only available in cans to distinguish it from the IZZE (non-fortified) sparkling juices sold in bottles. Moreover, the can is the primary package sold in schools. (After all, you can't have the little delinquents using bottles, with the necks broken off, as weapons.)<br /><br />Since I don't have nor will have children in school and am not politically correct by any standard, can't we just theorize IZZE Fortified was conceived to capture a lucrative market share? After all, if you think IZZE Beverages, Inc. is a nice, warm and fuzzy, family-owned, independent business, think again. It was sucked up by giant PepsiCo in 2006.<br /><br />To be accurate, let's note that the flavor "sparkling apple" is qualified; the labeling openly admits that the container "contains 70% fruit juice", which itself is a mixture of apple, grape and lemon.<br /><br />Those so interested might be gratified to observe the label statement that "We partner with Global Education Fund to help provide educational opportunities and resources to needy children around the world." A multinational corporation shouldn't pass up the opportunity for some good PR, especially as it also purveys those high-sugar and zero-nutrition soda pops to the already overweight masses.<br /><br />The tangential details aside, how does this product taste? It's acceptably good. The intensity of the apple flavor isn't as strong as in 100% apple juice, which would be expected because of the dilution factor. With 21g of (natural, i.e. no refined) sugars per 248 mL serving, it's moderately sweet. Certainly more sweet than a green granny apple, the fruit that's implied by the can's color. And the carbonation adds a certain pzazz.<br /><br />Is this drink as flavorful as the sparkling 100% apple juice available at your local trading post? Um .... no. To be fair, though, the IZZE has 40 calories and 12 grams of sugar less per serving than the pure juice, which also has 100% of the RDA's vitamin C.<br /><br />My wife contributed an idea. Why not just eat an apple and wash it down, along with a multivitamin tablet, with tap water from a reusable glass? That way, with no can to pitch, you're Green, which equals PC, and you're eating healthy. As I roar down the road in the national park in my giant SUV that gets 5 MPG, while eating the triple bacon cheeseburger - washed down with IZZE Fortified, of course - and flipping the fast-food carton out the window, it's hard to argue her point.<br /><br />Because of the convenient packaging for those school lunches cobbled together by the harried Mom's of the world, I'll award IZZE Fortified 4 stars, bumped up from three. Hey, kids, be sure and toss those cans into the Recycle bins!

review/summary: My daughter and I both loved it and we enjoy vastly different drinks
review/text: This drink is a bit tart, reflecting the natural flavors of white grape, apple and lemon juices. With 70% of the contents pure juice concentrates, a small can contains the equivalent of a lot of fruit juice. The drink contains no caffeine and most of the balance of the liquid is sparkling water. There are also no refined sugars or preservatives in the mixture.<br /> I found it very refreshing and in general I do not like tart drinks. The tartness is light; the sparkling water largely offsets it, giving it just enough fizz to give you a carbonation buzz. My daughter also enjoyed it; her favorite pop is sugared root beer, while mine is Diet Coke. If this drink can satisfy tastes on both ends of that spectrum, then most people will find it within their happy taste zone.

review/summary: Could be better, but we all deserve at least this much.
review/text: For health fanatics, IZZE represents less a solution than an amelioration of the guilt associated with colas and ultra-sugary drinks. Out of their line-up, pomegranate promises to be the most salutary because of its alleged antioxidant power and heart-friendly consequences.  How the antioxidant potency of a can of IZZE compares with unadulterated pomegranate juice (very $$$) is another question, but I prefer to imagine it's equal to a small bottle of POM (dream on).  The same question necessarily arises with IZZE apple, but in this case it's more of a challenge to rationalize chugging down an IZZE ahead of eating the once-forbidden fruit.  Besides malic acid, which is a key to making the mitochondria of the body's cells firing at their optimal best, apples are an undeniable source of some of the most essential vitamins and fiber that keep our bodies, uh, "on task" every day.<br /><br />I could like this better if one of the ingredients wasn't the omnipresent, practically inescapable, "grape juice" (it sullies practically every cranberry drink on the supermarket shelf).  But the taste is quite good (better than IZZE's pomegranate, though my wife insists that practically any IZZE tastes better in the glass bottle than in the can).  All the same, we all need at least one "reward" each day, and that's where an IZZE serves its purpose.  Fresh, raw apples, on the other hand, always seem less a pleasure than a duty.<br /><br />I don't recall the Bible explaining how or why the strictures surrounding the eating of apples were removed simply because our original parents ignored them--perhaps Providence deemed the removal of sanctions necessary to Newton's discovery of the earth's gravitational field.  Whatever the case, were they still forbidden, I have little doubt apples would still be highly desirable.

review/summary: Different strokes for different folks
review/text: This review will be for the Blackberry and Apple flavors of this product.<br /><br />Apple:<br /><br />Several people in my household have tried this flavor and as such there is a wide array of responses to it. One person really like it. Thought it was refreshing, flavorful, and an all around good drink. The opposite end someone thought it was very sour and they didn't like it at all. Me personally, I thought it was okay. For an apple flavor it seemed to taste a lot like a lemon-lime drink versus apple.<br /><br />Blackberry:<br /><br />By and large all of us didn't care nearly as much for this flavor. In fact the person who really liked the Apple flavor thought the Blackberry tasted like a cheap spimonti (sp) wine. I thought this flavor was a little on the tart side and if I am drinking something to be refreshed, tart is not the flavor I would want.<br /><br />I was disappointed in both flavors not tasting like what I expected. For 70% fruit juice I was expecting something that stayed more true to the fruit that was one the front of the can not a mixture of an asortment of different juices.<br /><br />The small cans are perfect for putting in a backpack, cooler etc. and at 90 calories they are relatively healthy as well.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a bad product and I can easily see where others may really like the flavors. Myself, I didn't care for them but I lean more towards being a picky eater anyway.

review/summary: Very Sparkling Apple Juice
review/text: I must say, I am an apple juice fan. My usual brand is Very Fine, which is your standard 100% apple juice, nothing fancy. I picked up Izze Sparkling Juice and can honestly say, I really liked it. It is carbonated, is "sparkling", which sets it apart from most other juices.<br /><br />At first, I wasn't completely taken with the carbonation/sparkling aspect. For one thing, it seemed particularily carbonated. I mean - WOW, bubbly! Once you get passed the inital surprise with a sparkling juice, the flavor really takes over.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the ingredients listed (in order) are : White Grape, Apple and Lemon Juice.<br /><br />I guess it's the White Grape and Lemon that give this drink it's little kick of flavor, which pushes it beyond your average apple juice.<br /><br />Because there is no extra refined sugar added, the calorie and sugar gram count come in below Very Fine, which is a good thing, and importantly, taste is not sacrificed.<br /><br />On a side note, and really kind of cool, the Izze company is very eco-friendly. Their offices are powered by the wind, they do the "bike to work" thing, and support recycling efforts. It's nice to see a Company giving something back and trying to make a difference in the world.

Put my faith in an item too soon since there was only one review that was positive when I ordered.<br /><br />However, after receiving my order, I'm finding more and more reviews pop up of how the item was not delivered as presented.<br />I agree, and that's why I checked back. I mean, I understand when the picture isn't the same, but a deceptive product description? C'mon!<br /><br />First off, I'm unsatisfied because I received my product broken up and smashed around in the box with all the brown confetti, rendering it ungiftable without effort.<br />If I wanted to exert effort, I would have gone to the store and gathered things myself & fashioned them into a basket.<br />They did, however, provide me with a "DeliDirect" catalogue, coupon, and random green tortes I didn't order (perhaps added as an apology)....<br /><br />Secondly, I really ordered this for the cheese, for a cheese lover.<br />BUT the cheeses DO NOT come in 4oz blocks as advertised (instead 2oz x 2ea flavor), and they are all PROCESSED CHEESE FOOD. Not cool.<br />This means we get to eat it instead.. did a taste test, it's all plastic same-flavor stuff, but higher quality than Velveeta, if that's a consolation.<br />I will make note of anytime I see the word "flavor" when ordering cheese in the future. Since I saw "Wisconsin" advertised everywhere, I expected the real deal, even if "sub par" but NOT processed...<br /><br />This brings me to the third strike, the meat products were NOT the flavors they said were included - garlic, mesquite, & original.<br />Instead, it was 1 salami, and 2 original summer sausages, one just in the plastic, and one in the plastic as well as a special paper sack?! Was this to trick me into thinking it was a different flavor?<br /><br />Overall, three strikes you're out DeliDirect (ahem, amazon), I hate dealing with complications in mail order stuff, this is lame & means my family "wins" the prize.<br /><br />><br /><br />Main reason I'm posting.... BE HONEST WITH DESCRIPTIONS. I'm sure all of us consumers would appreciate it.

Honestly, for the price I should have just gone to the local store and bought a Hickory Farms gift box. If this is the "Heart of Wisconsin" then its a small and frail heart.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I decided to give this pack a try, and I was not at all disappointed. Be aware that what you get might not be exactly what is actually listed on the product page. When I ordered, the advertised list of products was as follows:<br /><br />Zesty Cheddar 4 oz.<br />Garlic Beef Summer Sausage 5 oz.<br />Pepper Cheese 4 oz.<br />Mesquite Beef Summer Sausage 5 oz.<br />Old Hickory 4 oz.<br />Original Beef Summer Sausage 5 oz.<br />Swiss Blend 4 oz.<br /><br />But what I really got was:<br /><br />Zesty Cheddar 4 oz. (2x 2oz)<br />Pepper Cheese 4 oz. (2x 2oz)<br />Old Hickory 4 oz. (2x 2oz)<br />Swiss Blend 4 oz. (2x 2oz)<br />Salami Beef Summer Sausage 5 oz.<br />2x Original Beef Summer Sausage 5 oz.<br />2x Mint Torte 1.25oz<br /><br />They were also not in a box like pictured but tossed into a nice cardboard box with shaved heavy brown paper. It is really pretty decent packaging for a gift, kind of like a boxed Easter basket or something.<br /><br />The taste was AMAZING. I LOVE summer sausage and cheeses and I loved everything in this box! I admit I'm not incredibly picky about this type of thing, but I think any sausage and cheese lover would love it. It was all fresh and very good.<br /><br />Definitely recommend trying this out, it's a great price for such a product and the only reason I docked a star was because of the somewhat different package contents, and even then I'm not so sure it deserves only 4 stars.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br />EDIT:<br /><br />When I purchased this it was under $20 with free shipping. I came back to purchase another one and saw that it was almost $35 including shipping. I still think it tasted great, but definitely not worth more than $20 with shipping included.

review/text: I should have listened to the other reviews and bought something else. I'm not sure why I went against other reviews and ordered this. It did not come as described just like everyone else said. They were little 2 oz. packages of cheese and did not have the variety described. I will not order this again. I do not suggest ordering this item unless you want a surprise. I thought it had different flavors of the summer sausage and it did not. there were 3 sticks of regular beef summer sausage and four 2 oz packages of hickory cheese, 2 2oz of the pepper cheese and 2 2 oz of the swiss blend cheese. the packaging was with the little shredded cardboard and the items were just tossed in. i had to arrange them and hope they stay where i put them.

review/text: The item pictured is NOT what you will receive. I got 8 tiny cheese blocks rather than the 4 larger ones pictured. Only 3 flavors rather than 4. Then there is the sausages...3 of the same flavor rather than 3 different flavors and they were all different brands and sizes. Not to mention its not in the nice package shown. They were literally thrown in a plain cardboard box! I sent these back as I would have been ashamed to give them as a gift. Amazon really needs to check up on its outside vendors!

review/text: Bought this to ship overseas to a long time cheese head. It looked like a good deal and liked the variety. When I received it though, I was surprised. The size of each cheese sample is only 2 oz and about 2-3 bites for someone. The sausages are only 5 oz each. About 4-5 bites. I then noticed something that was disconcerting and that was each cheese sample is labeled "Pasteurized Process Cheese Food"!!!<br /><br />There is no self respecting cheese head that would eat cheese food in lieu of the real thing!<br /><br />Try something else

review/summary: Not a lot for the money
review/text: Well, I ordered this thinking it was a fair deal, but the items arrived and were much smaller than they appeared online.  The cheese is actually only 1/2" thick, so it looks ok in the picture but when the package comes it looks like you're trying to cheap out on your gift.  Really dissapointing.  Also, sausages in the picture look like they would be the length of the box, but really are only about 4 or 5" long, the picture is very decieving.<br /><br />Plus the presentation in the box was terrible. There wasn't much stuffing to fill in all the blank space and everything was just jammed in there all higgledypiggledy.  I had to completely rearrange the box in order to make it look somewhat nice.  If you're sending this to someone and it showed up like that I would be really embarassed.<br /><br />Overall it comes off looking like you cheaped out and didn't care enough to get a nice gift box. I would NOT order again, better off making my own basket from the grocery store and paying to ship from USPS.

review/text: In no way was the item I was shipped what I thought I was getting. First of all when I opened the box it was shipped in I noticed the meats and cheeses were in a basket that was litteraly falling apart. And there was only 1 actual wisconson cheese and 1 actual wisconson sausage the rest was other random brands one being a Johnsonville sausage. Then  there was candy thrown in there. This is not at all what I thought I was getting by reading the item discription and viewing the pictures. I bought this as a Christmas gift and I am imbearised to give to give this. It was diffinatly not worth what I paid for it. DO NOT RECOMEND THIS ITEM AT ALL. WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL GET.

review/summary: Very Disappointed & False Advertising
review/text: I ordered the Heart of Wisconsin Cheese & Sausage Variety Pack.  It was listed to have and shown a picture as having 3 varieties of summer sausages that are all from Wisconsin.  However, I received 3 sausages that are all original beef summer sausage (NO variety) and only 1 on them is the brand from Wisconsin.  It was also listed and shown as having 4 varieties of cheeses and instead I only received 3 varieties of cheese and one of them is a flavor that was not listed (and I didn't want) instead of 2 of the varieties I did want.  None of the brands or packaging match (like it showed in the picture and listed) and now what I thought was a nice Christmas gift instead looks tacky, is not what was promised, and is very disappointing.  This is false advertising and at Christmas time no less.

review/summary: Seems to have changed for the better.
review/text: Since most of the reviews for this product are WAY out of date (over a year) I thought I would jump in, since my experience was so much different.<br /><br />First of all, it seems like they stopped sending smaller 'sampler' sizes (2 oz cheeze sticks) and now are sending exactly what is pictured in the product description.<br /><br />The cheese itself is heavily processed as others have said, but I found its quite good for sandwiches (especially melted!) and crackers, which I assume its meant for. Also, I had it with wine on a few occasions and was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful it could be on its own.<br /><br />For the meats... they are a bit of a letdown. Only one was truly high quality; the other two didn't have a good texture, mostly because the fat content was much too high. Think of a summer sausage that is hard to cut (doesn't hold together well) because of high fat content and your imagination will hit it pretty close to the mark. This was a letdown because I had tried Deli Selects in the past (purchased online from walmart) and the summer sausage was quite good and in a larger block.<br /><br />Still, it was good enough to eat on crackers and went well with the cheese.<br /><br />All-in-all its an ok buy and I would probably purchase it again for the cheeses alone.

review/text: These are great chips but this is an outrageous price.  I grew up on these chips and will sacrifice much for a good hot chip. I used to live on OV barbeque fiestas which were introduced when I was in sixth grade in 1967.  I remember them well and with Dr. Pepper, and to this day nothing has ever matched the originals.  However, this is not a good buy, no way, no how. There are other brands that I buy from other places I have lived which are comparable in size and weight and pay about thirty dollars for sixteen bags with shipping.  If you need an Old Vienna chip fix, mail me back and I'll get my mom to hit me up and give them to you for considerably less.

review/summary: Light and Sweet - The best E.S.E. Pod from Lucaffe
review/text: First, make sure you know the type of pod your espresso machine takes before you order. These are E.S.E. pods which are used by the more expensive machines, especially those from Italy. I have tried the Lucaffe sampler pack earlier and found Piccolo & Dolce to be one of my favorites.  This is my third order and won't be my last.  The coffee has a light taste that is easy to drink straight with little or no sugar. The creama is a delight. You cannot do better than this flavor from Lucaffe.<br /><br />I've ordered about a dozen times from Espresso Tiamo and have never had a problem. Roberto is a really nice guy and will bend over backwards for you, the customer.

review/text: My wife brought home a bag of M&M pretzel, the latest product from M&Ms. I'm sure you've seen the silly commercial on television. Anyway, I'm not much of a pretzel person and wasn't excited by this latest snack. But my daughter likes pretzels and I thought she'd eat them. One night while watching television, my daughter was snacking on them and I thought I'd have one. Hey, they were right there next me.<br /><br />And guess what, it wasn't half bad. Before I knew it I was taking handfuls out of the bag. It was a big 40 ounce bag! The crunchy pretzel combined with the flavorful chocolate and candy coating became addicting. I don't who ate more; my daughter or me.<br /><br />Now, if only they make an M&M macadamia nut, I would be in aloha heaven!

Buy in bulk to save money because you know you'll be going through them by the fistful.

I thought I would love the pretzel with the chocolate.  In fact, I think chocolate covered pretzels are dandy.  It did not work with these pretzel M&Ms though.  The prezels do not offer enough salt to complement the chocolate.  They taste almost malty like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C3Q9K">Whoppers Malt Ball Original 24 Packs</a>.  I have to pass on this particular candy.
