review/text: Not really a fan of sugary or overly sweet drinks. When I am not drinking water (which is a lot) I sometimes want something a little sweeter or fruitier. I bought the green tea raspberry mix on a whim and I am really happy I did. I use one packet in a gallon pitcher. The package suggests one packet for 2 qts but i really like it just a little diluted. Its refreshing and has a great taste. Its not overly herbal like most iced green teas I have tried.<br />Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Not as good as homemade, but worth a try...especially if you only need it in a recipe!
review/text: I bought some of this to try and made a batch up this morning to use in a recipe for stuffed peppers.  Granted, it's not as good as homemade...or even Stove Top, if you're kind of lazy like me....but it's pretty good!  I tasted some when it came out of the oven and I liked the flavor, so I went ahead and added it to my stuffed pepper mixture.  I will definitely be using it again because I have a lot of casserole dishes that I haven't been making as much lately now that I'm trying to cut out some of my carbohydrates.  I may even make some to mix half and half with Stove Top stuffing for a little healthier side dish when we have Thanksgiving.  I do that a lot with the Walden Farm sauces/gravies/ketchup/etc. I've found that mixing the low carb things with the regular items is really a good compromise so I can eat the same meals as my husband without a lot of guilt.  He never notices and I don't have to make two different things!

review/text: I drank at least fifty gallons of Crystal Light Sunrise Tangerine Strawberry in its previous packaging, before it disappeared from Amazon (and everywhere else, including the Kraft Foods website) last winter. Now, a few months after Kraft announced its return, it is finally back at Amazon.<br />Or, it was, for about five minutes. I managed to get one package of it before it vanished again.<br /><br />It's a wonderful drink that doesn't taste "diet" at all. It has much more flavor and body than most Crystal Light varieties. All in all, it's everything a low-calorie drink mix should be.<br /><br />If only Amazon can keep sufficient quantities in stock, we'll be in heaven...

review/text: I must admit, when I first tried this flavor, I was a little put off.  I guess I was just a little too used to Raspberry Lemonade, or Strawberry Kiwi.  However, after drinking it for a few times, the flavor has definitely grown on me.  The best part of the flavor is that it is strong, which can't often be said for other Crystal Light flavors.  With this flavor, you will not get the feeling of it being watered-down, regardless of how much water you use.  Great flavor and will definitely be ordering more in the future!

review/text: The only bearable flavor of Crystal Light, (OK kiwi-strawberry was nice, but it's dissappeared from stores) and it's way better than the entire line. It does taste like a sunny morning. You might also notice it tastes a bit like Tang. At any rate it has more flavor than the others, and you hardly notice the aspartame aftertaste. So why can't they do this to the other flavors? (The other bad Crystal Light flavors include; lemonade, tropical punch, fruit punch and raspberry lemonade)<br /><br />Kraftfoods stopped making this product earlier this year.<br />Capitalism: a system where beloved products are discontinued without providing any reason.

review/summary: Surprisingly good, very easy, not a belly buster
review/text: I'm a single guy who likes to eat well and watch my weight at the same time, but I'm a lazy chef so I look for shortcuts like this.  I sauteed some shrimp in 1 can of this (1 can = 300 calories, supposedly 10 servings - hah!).  Right at the end I added a healthy dollop of cooking sherry and a goodly sprinkle of nutmet.  Served it over a 90-second-microwave bag of brown & wild rice in a bowl with a microwave bag of frozen mixed veggies on the side and that made a very fine meal with minimal prep and minimal cleanup.  A sprinkle of sliced green onions on top at serving is a good idea, but the reader should know that I sprinkle green onions on just about everything but breakfast cereal.  If you count grits and/or oatmeal as breakfast cereal, then I use green onions on breakfast cereal too.<br /><br />I got the idea about adding the sherry and nutmeg from a review on another site which pointed out that even though sherry is one of the ingredients, it cooks off immediately and was undetectable in the product.  I tasted it and agreed, so added the sherry at the last minute.  The same reviewer recommended the nutmeg so I added that too.<br /><br />I've looked at recipes for "real" Newburg sauce and I know it's better, but I also know I'm too lazy to make up a short shelf life batch myself.  I also know if I went out and ordered fill-in-the-blank Newburg at a restaurant I'd pay north of $40 for the plate.  This works for me; I'll be ordering it again.

review/summary: Pure Pleasure
review/text: When I want an afternoon snack, I want a handful of peanuts. Now being a senior citizen, I have to watch calories, colesteral, salt, and who knows what else!! I always remembered my late-70's father while working a crossword puzzle, amble into the kitchen to get a cup of cold homemade decafe coffee....but he always came back with a handfull of Planters dry roasted peanuts! I too have the same habit.<br /><br />I have tried just about every kind of peanut, but always wanted a reqular dry roasted Planters peanut. Only problem, way too expense and too much "bad salt". Now along comes this LARGE size/JUMBO pack of Planters dry roasted peanuts at a very reasonable price. And it has sea salt added which is not as bad as my usually sneaking a pinch or two of kitchen salt just for my satisfaction.<br /><br />Now I'm going to share with you a real secret to enjoying this great product. Buy this product on "subscribe and save" and add an order of Planters Roasted almonds with sea salt on the same program. Pour half of peanuts into a bowl and add some almonds to both the bowl and the peanuts jar. As you want more, just add some of each to the original container. Don't discare the original container because each time before you use, turn the container upside down and give it a good shake. All the great seasonings will recoat the mix again. For some reason the nuts always taste fresh. Well, I hope this helps some of you seniors like me who also have a snack craving.<br /><br />Update: I found that instead of shaking the container up and down.... roll it around between your hands. It distributes the seasonings better.

review/summary: LOVE this chocolate!
review/text: I recently went to Japan and although I couldn't find the same kind of chocolate bars I could get in the states, I was thrilled to try this brand.  I haven't had a full bar, only the pack of "mini" bars and they don't disappoint.  They're pack individually in gold foil and come in a easy to dispense box.  I'd LOVE to be able to get the mini bar packs somewhere online.  Any ideas?

review/summary: Think apple pie for the Fall.
review/text: With the Add-On price, you can't go wrong. Price is exactly or less than in the stores, TRUST me!<br /><br />Wow, this tea is TOO perfect to be exist. It's delicious with honey especially in the Fall when the weather's chilly and you want something in season.  Reminds me of homemade apple sauce or pie. I gently smell but don't taste the caramel. The cinnamon or ginger is NOT gag strong. The apple sings more here than anything else. This is much MUCH better than Yogi's Himalayan Apple Spice (and um, even Celestial Seasoning's Apple Cinnamon which has been my favorite for ages!).<br /><br />35mg of Caffeine this has? Well, I am careful with caffeine (no more than 90mg per day) and with 60mg of Irish tea caffeine in me, this does nothing. It actually relaxes me and makes me sleepy which is a disappointment when I want to wake up just a tad. So no worries, this won't make you jittery at all. Better alone with honey. Not OK with milk.<br /><br />I keep the wrapper under my pillow and sniff it when I feel "meh". Reminds me of mum and home :)<br /><br />A must tea for your collection!

review/summary: Smells and tastes exactly as described!
review/text: This tea is delicious! When I first smelled the tea as it was steeping, I found it hard to believe that it was 0 calories. It smells like caramel covered apple lollipop candy. Very fragrant with a slight hint of sweetness, it's extra satisfying with a little bit of sweetener (I like stevia) and "creamer" which for me that's unsweetened almond milk. I overall try to avoid dairy and fake sweeteners so to me, this is a winning combo! I love Yogi teas!<br /><br />Please start selling this in the bulk pack of 6 as a "Suscribe and Save" option. Thank you!

It's a  healthy protein  snack and very satisfying. Curbs your appitite between meals. I have them with me at all times. I highly recommend them for your health and for a low carb dieting snack.

review/summary: Not impressed with this brand but adore Fava beans
review/text: Fava Beans...Love them. Really rich in fiber, they make me full without feeling heavy. GREAT for digestion, be sure to drink lots of water. They even seem to make me have less of an appetite (helps cravings etc). I have barely gone a single day without a serving.<br /><br />Bob's Fava beans...I have found better. I bought 4 20oz bags. I have made 4 batches and used 2 full bags. The first batch I did not soak or preboil (according to packaging), took hours 3,4,5 hours to cook and they were never really all soft. For the remainder I soaked overnight, or boiled the day before and soaked in fridge overnight. Again I still didn't think they all got soft.  All batches were certainly edible and delicious. If I had no other access to fava beans I would get Bob's. Luckily I was able to find them in a semi-local Mexican food store (I would have never guessed). The brand was Verde Valle brand "Mexico's #1 brand of rice and beans" so it says. in a 1 lb bag. distributed by con agra food.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you can't find them anywhere - get these you will be so happy you added Fava to your diet. If you *can* find fava beans elsewhere,  try them as you come across them -you may find a better bean.<br /><br />Oh, the beans that I received (actually even the other brand) were definitely peeled, maybe a couple still had a bit of shell on, but I had no problems at at all.<br /><br />PS. While researching health benefits, I came across important MEDICAL WARNING if you take MAOIs you may want to talk to your Doctor before trying Fava beans.<br /><br />See  [...]<br /><br />Serious reactions--or even death--can result when MAOIs are combined with some foods and medicines. WHILE TAKING MAOIS, YOU MUST AVOID EATING CERTAIN FOODS, such as some cheeses, BROAD BEANS SUCH AS FAVA BEANS, pickled foods such as sauerkraut, beer, and red wine. Eating these foods can cause severe high blood pressure and other health problems. Talk with your doctor about diet and medicine restrictions you need to follow if you are planning to take an MAOI.

review/summary: Food is my medicine
review/text: My doctor prescribed fava beans for my tremor in June of this year. Since then, I have bought boxes of fava beans. These are the best quality for the best price of any of the ones available and they aren't readily available! I have them on subscription to get the better price and use a package of them every three days or so. I have recommended them to others. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because some of the beans are not completely peeled and I have to laboriously clean them off. Inevitably, there are little pieces of the germ under the "flap" of the bean that, for all the world, look like bugs when they're cooked. Otherwise, if you have to eat fava beans on a regular basis (I eat a cup of cooked beans twice a day) you can't go wrong with these.

Comes with a little bag of corn chips for topping but you may also want to serve with additional corn chips or use Fritos Scoops in place of a spoon.  I'm not crazy about the cheese topping provided so I often stir in a little shredded cheddar with or without the topping.

She cooks per package directions (sans the cheese sauce) and then places the cooked product in a casserole dish and tops with shredded cheese.  Bake for 20 minutes ( or when cheese melts)at 350 degrees.  We eat ours with Tostitos Hint of Lime chips.  This takes a little longer to make but worth it.

review/summary: Not recommended for aggressive chewers
review/text: These pressed rawhides are NOT recommended for aggressive chewers.  I have a bulldog that loves to chew...and pressed rawhides have proven to be great for him.  He would go through a typical rawhide bone in a few hours, and normal pressed rawhides will last him days.<br /><br />Not these though.  After an hour or so of chewing the layers split apart, making the bone shrink dramatically in size AND creating a choking hazard for the dogs.  These bones will last an average of 3 hours.  We bought 25 of them thinking they would last us at least a month, and he was through them in a couple of weeks, with us having to throw out most of them because they split into pieces.<br /><br />We have one vendor that we usually purchase these from, but they were on  backorder at the time and Simon needed his bones!  That's why bought them elsewhere.  Never again though.  Now I know that not all pressed rawhide is the same!

review/text: Ok, I eat hot food.  I make alot of chile sauces, marinades, gravies, out of habanero powder from hatch new mexico. I been using the Bhut Jolaka or Ghost pepper hot sauces for about a 2 years. I put enough of this on so that it pretty much stops you in your tracks and you just freeze in awe and salivate like a dog with rabies. Oh yea, your face turns red and flushes and your skin starts itching like crazy. Yep, that is how I like it. On everything anytime of the day. Some people actually enjoy this sensation.<br /><br />I know what I like and I am not easily impressed and very rare to try something new so I do Dave's Ultimate Insanity- Yessss indeed, endorphins are released into my system, my eyes start to water. Of course I used about a teaspoon on some italian bruchetta chicken. Very nice almost an out of body experience. I do not know if this is hotter then the ghost pepper but it is very comparable. This was hot but you could still taste the flavor of the sauce. Ghost peppers seem to be so hot that the flavor just disappears. I did purchase the 3 pack of insanity sauces and cant wait to try the rest of them. I was speechless for about 45 seconds. Keep away from eyes and genitals.<br /><br />I know these will not last long. I will be using this on salads, sandwiches, salsbury steakes, pizza, steak, hashbrowns, eggs and maybe just a late night tonic to give me some wicked dreams. You like hot, get this and be generous with it. Good job Dave!!!! Power to the pepper.

He went back home and we both went on with our lifes, that was until about two weeks ago when he called me up, not to say hello or to ask how I was doing, he specifically called to ask me where I bought the Hot Sauce! It's just that good!<br /><br />For those of you who havent tried it, This really is the Ultimate when it comes to heat, it's weird how it takes about a second or two to kick in, but just like Chuck Norris... Once it kicks, it's a little to late to beg for mercy!<br /><br />Even if you're a heat lover, I recommend that you take it one drop at a time until you get used to it, it might take you a whole bottle to get there and most likely you probably never will, but if you do...

review/text: First a warning, if you are not a true chili head, this sauce will overpower you and cause you pain! Dave's insanity products are called insane for good reason, they take hot up a dozen notches to thermonuclear! This sauce could easily have adopted the old Brylcream slogan "a little dab'll do ya" cause this stuff you use one small drop at a time. Just a few drops in a quart of tomato sauce and it was too hot for several of my friends. So heed the warning about the heat. However, if you are a true lover of hell's wrath in your body, this is the stuff! Incredible heat, but it also has a great taste. If you are not faint of heart, give this a try!

Learning from his misfortune, I took a few tinefulls (on the tip of a fork) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended.  Just the perfect amount.  Two hours later, I still feel a nice lingering heat.<br /><br />As for flavor, I think serranos have a better flavor, but this wasn't bad.  I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of "burn".<br /><br />You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews.  This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food.  I don't know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff.

review/text: Let me preface this by saying, if you are looking for crazy hot, this isn't the hot sauce for you.  I would call it luke warm hot, but the flavor of this sauce is very good which is why I give it 5 stars.  If you are looking for crazy hot, try Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce (which I have also tried and reviewed) or Daves Gourmet Ghost Pepper (which I haven't tried, but if it is hotter than Insanity, it must be ridunkulous hot).  I like my hot sauce to have some flavor which is why I like this Habanero Sauce...the flavor is very good...just not very hot.  I can actually just put this sauce straight to the tongue without much of a problem.  Bottom line...if you are looking for a good flavored hot sauce that won't make your tongue shrivel, this is a good one to try out.

review/summary: Wrong picture, and too sweet
review/text: Acai Mango Zinger was one of my favorite teas EVER.....until I ordered this product from amazon, based on the picture of the box I recognized well.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BRUE54/ref=oss_produc,<br /><br />The picture shows the regular Acai Mango Zinger, but what I got was Acai Mango Sweet Zinger Ice.  So I thought, how bad could that be?  Actually pretty bad.  The stevia makes this tea too sweet (for my tastes) and covers up the nice Acai Mango flavor.  What a shame.  I might as well be drinking sweet tea.<br />The other problem is that I contacted the merchant about this error, and still ... no reply.  And Amazon policy says I can't even return it.

review/summary: Best Celestial Seasonings Tea Ever
review/text: I recently bought this tea from my local Publix store. I went back for some more but they're out of it.  It is absolutely the best tasting Celestial Seasonings tea I've ever had and I've been drinking their teas for over 20 years.  It has a slightly sweet taste even without any sugar in it and is full bodied and fruity. It works equally well as either a hot tea or an iced tea.  Recently I read an article that said hibiscus (zinger) may lower your blood pressure ([...]).  Another plus is that it is one of the few teas without soy lecithin in it (in case you have problems with soy products).<br /><br />The Tangerine Orange Zinger, Peppermint, and Country Peach Passion are also very good.

review/text: I bought this sauce, because I received some of his regular hot sauce in Iraq, in a care package.  For anyone who loves hot sauce, daves is a good sauce, but it's a little pricey.  I bought this to sample his other flavors, it's great on eggs, complements alot of meats as a dipping sauce.  I would buy it again, but it's costly for a little bottle, with shipping.  If you love you will buy more of it.

review/summary: This is Currently my Favorite Tea!
review/text: Out of the huge collection of teas I have at home, this Harney and Sons Fine Teas, Bangkok, Green Tea with Thai Flavors, is the best tasting tea I've had in a long time. For me, the #1 best tea tasting experience I've ever had in my entire life was drinking warm Chrysanthemum tea at a Thai restaurant located in a Thai resort in northern Thailand near the Golden Triangle region. That Chrysanthemum tea was so yummy, special, and extraordinary that all of my Thai relatives and friends kept on asking the Thai waitresses to bring us more Chrysanthemum tea. I never drank more tea at a restaurant than that time. That was many years ago, and now that I think about it, I should have asked them where they got their tea. I've also visited some terraced mountains in and around the Guilin region of China where they grew tea, and I tried a lot of Chinese tea in China, but those Chinese teas still didn't beat the Thai Chrysanthemum tea. This Harney and Sons Bangkok fine tea brings back memories from that tea experience in Thailand. Anyways, from the teas I've tasted and bought, ranging from Tazo, Numi, Kusmi-Kousmichoff, Yogi, Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow, Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, The Fairmont, Ahmad, Stash Tea, The Republic of Tea, etc., this Harney and Sons Bangkok Green Tea with Thai Flavors honestly, in my humble opinion, surpasses all of them. When it comes to delicious flavor, I would have to say that Republic of Tea's Strawberry Chocolate tea and Hibiscus Pineapple Lychee Superflower Tea come in second and third when it comes to flavorful taste. I'm being really honest when I say that Harney and Sons have made a very beautiful, unique, and special tea here with the Bangkok Green Tea with Thai flavors. I can totally understand the reason why the other Amazon reviewer, H. Drum, drove 35 miles to get this tea. H. Drum is telling the absolute truth that this tea is worth driving a long distance for. Heck, I would drive two hours to get this tea. Thank goodness Harney and Sons have a website where you can order their teas online besides on Amazon. To see Harney and Sons' huge array of different, unique teas just blows my mind. I'm completely impressed by this tea company. For this Bangkok Green Tea, there are coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass in the 20 tea sachets. The tea sachets smell fragrant, yummy, and beautiful with the Harney and Sons Fine Teas - Bangkok printed on the tea sachet tags. When you taste the tea, you definitely taste the coconut and vanilla. But I think the coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass combination is great! The tea box says that the caffeine content is 30 to 50 milligrams. Harney and Sons describe the Bangkok tea as "A journey through the soul of Thailand". This is definitely a smooth "transporting" tea. Harney and Sons Fine Teas' motto is that they are: "Unique and Uncommon". Well, I absolutely agree with Harney and Sons Fine Teas. They are "unique" and "uncommon". That's why they are a special tea company making special teas. This tea can is so lovely and beautiful. Everything about this tea is gorgeous and wonderful. Harney and Sons did a great job in terms of how they envisioned their products and the way they packaged their teas - all their tea cans/boxes would make great Wedding and Birthday gifts. Anybody who lives in a city where a Harney and Sons store is located - I admit it - I'm jealous! Again, I think I'm kind of in shock right now over how amazing this tea is. My vision of tea heaven now is having a small pantry stocked with every flavor/fine tea that Harney and Sons have produced. I would be set for life! So, now I know the answer to, what is currently your favorite tea company? Harney and Sons Fine Teas!

review/summary: A little sugar and it's perfect!
review/text: I fell in love with Harney & Sons after trying their Hot Cinnamon Spice Tea in satchets.<br /><br />I was looking for a green tea that I could drink all the time without sugar.  This IS really good and lots of vanilla/coconut flavors.  I could drink it without sugar, but it tastes much better with it.  The gorgeous tin can states that this is a light tea, which it is.  Being a green tea, you brew it at a slightly cooler temp than boiling hot black teas.  And you only steep for 3 minutes.  Personally, I feel like I want a little more, but I'm used to spicy, heavy black teas.  Again, with sugar though, there's more than enough flavor to keep your tastebuds entertained!<br /><br />The sachets, as always are the best quality with huge leaves of tea and plenty of them inside the silk bag.  Very stunning to watch as you brew your tea.<br /><br />I don't taste the lemongrass, but it's a very unique tea.<br /><br />I wish the coconut was a little bit stronger, but not bad.

review/text: I had this tea at a Barnes and Noble cafe years and years ago and have been looking for it ever since. Imagine how pleased I was when searching for "green tea coconut" (the only things I remember being in it) on Amazon and the little pink tin I remembered popped up!<br /><br />This tea is wonderful- a gentle green tea flavor mixed with coconut, lemongrass and ginger. Add a little sugar and some milk, and it's absolute heaven! My only complaint is that the strings connecting the tag to the teabag aren't secured very well. Don't dunk your bag too powerfully, or you'll be left fishing out the teabag with a spoon!

review/text: If you used to eat Heartland in the 70's/80's like I did, you'll be happy to know this one tastes exactly the same!  Unlike almost all otther cereals, which have been heavily cheapened to the point that the name is the only recognizable feature, the current mfg. of Heartland has decided to keep the same level of quality it always had (THANKS!).  I can't get some of the other varieties mentioned on the back of the box; if the mfg. and Amazon would put together a variety pack (one box of each), I'd love to give them a try.  After being unavailable for well over a decade, it's now available at most grocery store chains. Amazon has the best price, and since it goes so fast, the 6-pack is no problem!  My son and I really love this stuff with fresh blueberries; AWESOME!

On the other hand, if you are currently searching for a breakfast cereal that will provide you with a lasting energy boost without the "sugar crash" that usually follows any cereal which lists simple carbohydrates among its primary ingredients, then you owe it to yourself to try Heartland Cereals.  It is the type of "high test" fuel that your body needs in order to convert itself into high performance levels. The "simple sugar" cereals not only do not provide your body with the proper fuel, they are actually considered devitalizers that subtract from your level of energy.  As the saying goes, "Garbage in - Garbage out".

Some might find it a little too sweet -- it's not nearly as sweet as the "sugary" cereals in the cereal aisle, but does have a nice touch of sweetness that I like.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Since it appears that my local Kroger/Ralph's store has stopped carrying this cereal, I reluctantly tried a few of the OTHER "plain" granolas locally available, knowing that they just wouldn't cover the bases that Heartland Original does for my taste buds. Of course, they just couldn't hold a candle to Heartland's delicious, high-quality products, as I'd expected.<br /><br />Granola, if made to be healthy AND taste good, is probably just not going to be the lowest fat thing out there, but even knowing that, I was still shocked to see that my local store's version of Quaker granola weighed in at almost 9 grams of fat for a half cup serving. My coveted Heartland Original granola is not low fat, but it's nowhere near that high! If my guilty conscience would just shut the heck up (which it never does), I could easily eat a two cup serving of this deliciousness for breakfast, and spend my morning floating on a foodie cloud of yumminess ecstasy... But, since I'm no longer quite so young and able to easily burn all of that off, I often restrict myself to a mixture of half raisin bran cereal and half Heartland Original granola. That way, I get the deliciously sweet, almost creamy, nutty and slightly cinnamon flavor of this exceptional granola,  paired with chewable (not tooth-breakable) raisins and bran flakes. It's my perfect morning decadence without all the guilt! And now, thanks to Amazon.com (and, even better, their awesome Subscribe and Save option on this product), I can get it for LESS than my local stores ever carried it at,  AND free, faster-than-I'd-be-able-to-get-to-the-store shipping via Prime!<br /><br />Happiness all around! Bring on the yummy cereal, I've got my spoon ready!

review/summary: Simply the best granola out there
review/text: I have searched and searched and I still find this to be the best granola cereal out there. There are so many granolas to choose from but this is one I could easily eat every day and never get bored. Why? Well, for starters, it has just the right size clusters that are not too big or too small, making it crunchy but easy to chew. Some granolas don't have any clusters or the clusters are too big and hard, not Heartland. The other, more important reason, is flavor - in this category, there is no comparison between other granolas and Heartland Original. It has a slightly sweet flavor with hints of vanilla which is subtle and very pleasant. The ingredients are basic and wholesome, no chemicals or corn-syrups, just good old fashioned granola with molasses. It's not trying to be low fat or low sugar or anything like that, though Heartland offers those varieties as well, but if you just want a straight-up great tasting, wholesome granola, this is it. And for the price you get on Amazon, it can't be beat. I will take this over a fancy shmancy granola any day. Sometimes the most simple things are the best.

review/summary: Heartland Granola Cereal
review/text: I order groceries online from Amazon.com because I trust Amazon to give me good products AND good service.  I would defintely recommend Heartland Granola Cereal, Original flavor, because it is VERY good; has a wonderful texture in milk (doesn't get soggy, but is not overly crunchy), and I saved money by ordering the monthly subscription.  I eat this cereal for breakfast, and sometimes even for a light supper once in awhile.  I have only tried the original flavor so far, but I intend to try some of Heartland's other flavors of their granola in the future.

review/text: Texture and flavor is exactly what I was looking for, and it's at a big savings over my ~$3.89/box at the grocery store.

review/summary: Not that bad
review/text: Well.. after I've read the reviews .. I had great expectations BUT.. as a result.. the product is not bad.. bag to big for the amount of granola inside, if you know what I mean  ;-)<br /> Price is ok but I know I can get a better and/or bigger product for the same amount USD I paid.<br />Conclusion -  not bad but I would select another brand
