review/summary: Good Nut Brown Ale
review/text: I just opened this nut brown after 1 week in the primary, 1 week in the secondary, and only 2 weeks in the bottle. The flavors are already deep and complex, I get chocolate, toasted nuts, and just a hint of coffee(I don't even like coffee). Very simple to brew,and it comes with great easy to follow instructions. I would brew this one again.

review/summary: The best tasting vanilla bean paste out there
review/text: I love this stuff. I use so much of this stuff I have to buy the 32 oz jug. It dissolves easier in fluid than just the powder. I also use their extract. Between these two products and my raw vanilla bean powder, I eat vanilla like it's a food group.<br /><br />I've had some other vanilla bean pastes. They were okay. This one's the bomb.

review/summary: as close to fresh vanilla bean as you can get
review/text: I buy this by the quart, so obviously, I LOVE it!<br /><br />I used to use vanilla beans exclusively.  I found this through a cooking school class.  It is cheaper and easier than harvesting the seeds from vanilla beans, BUT you still get seeds in final product, and the taste is excellent--a triple win.  We now use it almost exclusively when vanilla is needed or wanted.  We've also begun spoiling ourselves by adding a bit to our coffee for vanilla latte.

review/summary: Absolutely the BEST Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste!
review/text: I own a cupcake shop and make all of my cupcakes from scratch. My Very Vanilla cupcakes are top sellers because of the vanilla I use.<br />There's no such thing as "plain" vanilla cupcakes when I use this product. Customers can not only see the flecks of vanilla in their cupcakes but they can taste it as well. This product doesn't "bake out" as others do. It holds it's true intense vanilla flavor throughout.<br />I've tried many other vanilla flavorings but nothing holds a candle to this one.

review/summary: Where's that wonderful aroma?
review/text: I did my research before deciding to spend $30+ on a bottle of vanilla, granted a very large one. After reading all the comments, I expected the pleasant aroma of vanilla wafting from the bottle upon opening, but what I got instead was this murky, smokey smell that doesn't even remotely resemble vanilla. There is absolutely no vanilla aroma when I added it to my custards, even with additional amount. Sure, the vanilla specks are there, but what good would they do if they give nothing to the flavor of the dish? I must have gotten a bad bottle or something (is that even possible, for vanilla bean paste to go bad?). I'm quite disappointed, looks like I'll just have to stick with Costco vanilla extract from now on.

Saw this first on the Jamie Oliver 30-minute Meals show, and finally tracked it down here.  Give it a try - you won't regret it.

review/text: Great thanks for Amazon's existence; I never knew I could get this Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste in this size.  Many years ago I used to purchase the small glass bottles, which didn't last long and was expensive.  Now with this size, it replaces the many little bottles and saves me lots of money!  I always use this for creme brulee, whipped cream, cookies...basically whenever a recipe asks for vanilla extract.  I don't know much about "extract" other than it is cheaper than bean paste, but this bean paste product is definitely YUMMY!!

As for serving them to guests, of course you can.  These are tasty, chemical-free, aesthetically proper olives.

review/summary: Tasty pitted olives
review/text: This is a good buy. The olives are tasty and most are in good condition.<br /><br /> We eat a lot of olives and keep a jar in our kitchen all the time.  To prepare these olives: 1. drain the liquid in which they are shipped. 2. Pierce a 1 or 2 small jalapeno or Serrano peppers in a clean quart jar 3. Add olives to almost the top of the jar. 4. Fill the jar with olive oil.  5. Cover with the lid and keep out of direct sunlight and store on your counter top. Do NOT refrigerate.<br /><br />These will keep for months. The taste is quite good with just a touch of heat from the peppers.  Small jars of olives prepared this way make excellent hostess gifts.  After the olives have been consumed, I strain the remaining olive oil and use it for cooking. The taste of the olive oil flavored with the peppers adds another layer of flavoring to most dishes.  The olive oil is also great for dipping.

review/text: I ordered the black tubs of olives in the past from Roland, glad I still had an empty left to put my new ones in.  The bag doesn't travel well!  The olives in the bag were almost all misshapened, flat, some even squished.  I transferred all to my jug and there was enough liquid in the shipped bag to cover my new olives, thankfully, but I added some olive oil just to make sure.  The new batch of olives are tasty but much softer than my previous order.  I realize different crops and all that, but these new ones are more palish purple than the deep purple black ones I usually get.  I may have to try another brand or type of olive because of this "bag" problem.

review/summary: Cincinnati-style chili -- close to the real deal
review/text: For those of us who long for Cincinnati-style chili but who do not live close to a chili parlor that serves it, these cans make a darn good substitute. Be warned though, that is not in any way a southwestern chili! It was created by Greek cooks (who knows why), and the sauce is thin and flavored rather like the meat sauce you might find in some Moussaka recipes. Some it in a bowl, perhaps with some oyster crackers tossed in. Most folks I know love it ladled over a mound of thin spaghetti, topped with the chili, perhaps with some kidney beans or fresh onion, and then topped with a large mound of finely shredded cheddar cheese. It's also wonderful served over boiled hot dogs in buns, again with the toppings of beans, onions, and or cheese piled on top. And now I am hungry!! Other brands worth trying are Gold Star and the Cincinnati Chili Recipe brand seasoning packets.

review/text: We normally buy the packets and make our own chili, but I couldn't resist buying this product.  Since I don't get to Cincinnati anymore I am left to finding my chili online, and this is the way to go.  Brings back fond memories of sitting in the chili parlor in Cincinnati.  Even my husband and kids love it.  Now I need to convert some of my friends.  When you say chili and spaghetti they look at you like your nuts, but I will convert one at a time.  Great product.  Give it a try.

I love the flavor I get when I use the ground vanilla.  I will definitely buy this again!

review/text: I have used the ground vanilla for many holiday baking recipes so far, and it has done wonderfully in each recipe. This ground vanilla seems to be of good quality, and for such a great price, you can't beat it. I would suggest storing it in a sealable glass container; it arrives in a plastic bag. I put mine in a canning jar soon after getting it, and it is storing well in there.

Therefore, the texture is quite rough and not good in places like ice cream or anything that you want to be smooth, especially. I went back to the glycerine and vanilla scrapings in a bottle for most of my cooking or un-cooking.

review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />How do they color it? who knows....

review/text: I had a few Cry Baby Gumballs at a party awhile back and had forgotten how awesome they are! Such a great sour kick, then an awesome sweet flavor. These are just the same. They have a more intense sour experience, which is my favorite. Sour Patch Kids and that type of candy doesn't do it for me. But this gum is awesome, minus a couple things: the 5 ball tubes make me eat them faster (don't want to leave it open very long) and the flavor only lasts for 5 minutes or so (even though the flavor is great). But the reason I went with the 5 ball tubes is because they were cheaper, per unit, than the individually wrapped version. Love this gum!

review/summary: Finally!  A nutritionally balanced GRAIN-FREE dry cat food!!
review/text: It is a huge breakthrough for a pet food manufacturer to develop a nutritionally balanced dry cat food formula that is high in protein and very low in carbohydrates.  The best part is that all five of my cats love it.  Thank you, Nature's Variety!<br /><br />After treating one of my cats for diabetes for several years, I learned the hard way about proper feline nutrition.  It turns out that the grain-based dry cat food I had been feeding my beloved pet was actually killing him.<br /><br />Cats are true obligate carnivores.  Their digestive systems were never designed to process grains or any other high carbohydrate food. A cat's pancreas can't keep up with the insulin demands placed on it by high carbohydrate dry food.  Once the pancreas is compromised, the cat develops diabetes and becomes insulin dependent.<br /><br />Due to their ease and convenience, dry kibble-type cat foods are very popular with pet owners, and cats can become addicted to it.  Feeding your cat a grain-based dry cat food is the equivalent of feeding your child sugary pastries and donuts for every meal!  It may taste good, but it sure isn't good for them.<br /><br />Although my cats still eat low-carbohydrate canned cat food for the majority of their meals, the Raw Instinct Grain Free Chicken Dry Cat Food is a perfect addition to their diet, and it's great for when I have to be away overnight.

review/summary: A new grain-free choice for your cats
review/text: My cats have been eating Innova EVO, another grain-free food, for a while.  I've noticed a great improvement in their general health but I was never really happy about the fact that their binder is potato.  Nature's Variety now makes Raw Instinct, which uses tapioca as a binder instead.  The kibble is square with some rough edges, which is an interesting shape.  The manufacturer applies a freeze-dried meat and pre-/probiotic mixture to the kibble before it goes in the bag.  My cats dig right in, and although most of their diet consists of wet and raw food, I like to feed them a tiny bit of dry to add some crunch and texture to their food.  This is a great food if you want high-quality meat proteins and no grains in your cat's diet.

review/text: This cat food is the best that there is on the market. If you do not have the time to cook for your pets and you feed your cats dry kibble this is the product for you. Raw Instinct & Innova Evo are the only grain free dry kibble products on the market. This is premium stuff. One of my 5 cats was always scratching and had rashes, then I found out that the allergy may have been from grains. Ever since I started feeding him grain-free cat food, his allergies went away. Nature's variety also makes grain free canned food but it contains garlic which like onions may cause heinz-body anemia in cats so I do not give the canned food to my cats. Innova eveo is also a good choice for dry & canned food - both are garlic free.

review/summary: Complete turnaround for my cat
review/text: I cannot say enough positive things about Nature's Variety cat food. My 3 year old cat was having bloody stools that had been going on for nearly six months. After a course of ruling out many things, and with no diagnosis, the next thing on our list was a bowel biopsy. We had already tried a few different foods, to no avail. Spud was healthy, lively, had a beautiful coat, and no other symptoms. Rather than putting him through a biopsy, I moved toward the idea of him having Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which I had suspected from the beginning. My veterinarian had me purchase some Innova green pea and duck food, but after a lot of deliberation, I decided to switch him to a grain-free and raw diet, and after much research, decided on Nature's Variety. We feed he and my other cat the grain-free chicken dry food, as well as chicken and lamb medallions, and I have never seen them so crazy and happy over food! He starts antagonizing me now at 4am because he wants his food. And most importantly, he has had precisely one bloody stool, near the beginning of the switch to Nature's Variety, and that's it. No more bloody stools, and we are both now very happy! The nutritive value and careful ingredient selection of Nature's Variety, that is health-focused instead of "how can we do this the cheapest?"-focused, has been so important for my cat's health.

I got a 4.4 lb bag at a local store for $13, so a 12-lb bag for $31 is a good deal.

review/summary: Food Fit for Our Princess
review/text: Our cat is SPOILED!!! She only sleeps on the couch during the day, and then only when there's at least two fuzzy green blankets to rest her royal belly upon. She sleeps with us at night, but only if she can ensconce herself on my body pillow, so her royal behind has something very soft to rest upon for the duration. Of course, I sometimes end up being part of the kitty couch, but I can feel her purring where she rests upon my ribcage, so that's a benefit of sorts.<br /><br />She used to have a weight problem. The vet found her blood test indicators to be pre-diabetic. We took an educated guess that it might have to do with her cheap "breeder" food sold by a major manufacturer that was loaded with fillers and grains, and you needed a biochemistry degree to read the entire list of ingredients. We're both healthcare professionals, so we understand how many people start losing their ability to digest and metabolize grains as they age. So we figured: Why not cats?<br /><br />After a few months of Nature's Variety Instinct, she was obviously slimmer. She had a waistline again and was much peppier, acting like a kitten and staying awake more. Our last vet visit, they cautioned us to NOT let her lose any more weight. She was about 28% lighter than in her junk food days, and we've actually INCREASED her daily portion to maintain her weight.<br /><br />I highly recommend Nature's Variety Instinct. It's truly worth spending the extra money over cheaper brands, because the savings in reduced vet bills makes this an easily-justified investment.

According to their customer service representative on September 1, 2009 "The carbs, as fed are 12%."<br /><br />Since I had a bag of cat food I couldn't feed to the cat it was purchased for I began feeding it to my other cats. Their hair coats are much improved, which is interesting since they weren't that bad to start with, and the thinner cat that had a hard time maintaining her weight is now carrying a very good weight. All of the cats I've tried to feed it to have found it very palatable as long as the bag is sealed well when it arrives and is kept sealed when not in use.

review/summary: Took some getting used to
review/text: My cat has had problems with struvite crystals so we had been using Royal Canin for several years.  He loved that food and the struvite crystals became a non-issue. I decided to try this food at the urging of my sister and I am so glad I did. My cat did not like this food at first.  I mixed it with his old food and he would pick out the old food and leave the Instinct.  However, he has slowly gotten used to it and I have realized through reading other reviews and getting more information that he doesn't need to eat as much when he's on this food because it's so nutritionally dense. My cat hasn't had any issues with struvite crystals because the formula is grain free and grain is a major factor in struvite formation.  The best part about switching to this food is that my cat has new life.  He is running, jumping, and playing like he's a kitten.  He has so much energy and his coat looks 100% better than it did before we switched.  Yes, it took him awhile to get used to the new flavor but it has been well worth it to transition to Instinct.  It is superior to any other food we've tried.  If your cat doesn't like it just give it some time or try a different flavor.  If you love your cat and want to give him the best nutrition then try this food.

We have transitioned our female to this food and she loves it. She has a nice, shiny and soft coat, is very energetic and I feel better knowing that we are giving her top quality protein ingredients. Make sure to add soft food into the mix, as cats need a good deal of moisture in their diet - and make sure your wet food is grain free as well. Overall - the cat and the family and very happy with this food.

review/summary: Good choice for ferrets
review/text: Not all ferrets will like this, but the extremely high level of protein and extremely low level of carbohydrates - not to mention the natural ingredients and all-around high quality of manufacturing - make Instinct a top choice for mixing with ferret foods, as many ferret shelters are now doing instead of feeding a single brand. Cat foods used to be a no-no in ferretland but the new crop of super high protein foods such as Instinct is changing people's minds.<br /><br />I feed my ferrets (who are always elderly and always have either insulinoma, adrenal disease, lymphoma, or all of the above) a mix of Instinct cat food, Innova Evo ferret food, and ZuPreem ferret food, and they are doing very well on it. After 8 years or so I think I've finally found a combination of foods that works for elderly ferrets fighting cancer. As I say above, some ferrets do not like the taste of Instinct at all, but I've found that introducing it to them in a mix with other brands that they do like helps them change their minds.

I wish I had some good before and after pictures. Her coat is shiny and SO incredibly soft, and she is much healthier. She has gained weight and is growing well. Some people have complained about the litter box smell, but she was so dirty and stinky when we found her, we haven't noticed a difference. If anything, she is less stinky than she was on cheaper cat food brands. I use the baking soda litter box booster and that has really helped. I also clean it out with soap and water regularly.

I've gone through one bag of Nature's Variety Instinct Grain Free Chicken Dry Cat Food with great fanfare. I was at my pet store when a rep from Nature's Variety was giving away samples.  I got a tiny bag of Instinct Grain Free Rabbit Meal to bring home. It was so popular when I served it alone in a dish, I bought a larger bag last month. So far, so good!<br /><br />NV Instinct makes up the majority of my kitten's kibble food mix and I'll soon test my sample bag of Duck & and Turkey Meal formula.

They have Instinct Frozen Raw and canned wet. The frozen raw is a huge hit with my cats but the canned NV has never once been accepted. With canned formulas such as Lamb, Rabbit, Duck and Chicken you'd think the kitty would be overjoyed. Not so with mine. Maybe yours would like the canned. It's definatley filled with good stuff!

When you buy as much cat food as we do (we breed Maine Coons) that adds up!<br /><br />Well, we used Instinct for several months and the cats really liked it.  During this same time period we started having problems with loose stools and poo that smelled extra-noxious.

We thought maybe we had gotten giardia in the house, but the tests came back clean.<br /><br />Finally, we put two and two together and tried switching back to Evo dry. Within a day the cat poo odor dropped to a normal level of stink.<br /><br />You may not have this same problem with your cats, but I'll spend the extra money on Evo, thank you.

They barely touch their bowls and would rather go hungry than eat it.  I've been mixing it in with some wet food that I have so they'll acquire a taste for it.  As many cat lovers know, Vans are very vocal.  So they've been whining and crying about the food even with full dishes.  Essentially indicating, "We want our old food back!"<br /><br />I will be sticking to Wellness Core.  I do not recommend it to owners with picky kitties.

review/text: I was really excited to find a grain free food that was fairly affordable. Unfortunately, my cat will not touch this stuff! In fact my other cat that does not have grain issues won't eat it either. I think some of it has to do with the fairly large, square shape of the kibble. It is almost like dog food. Other than that it is the taste. The only way I can get my cat to eat this food is to put it through the food processor to break up the large pieces and douse it with water to make it seem like wet food. (My cat has always eaten dry food so it is not a dry/wet issue). By the way, although this food says it is grain free, it does still have grain in its ingredients. This is really deceiving and I am not sure why they are able to label this food as grain free. This purchase was a total waste of money and I will look for another brand and hope that my cat will eat it without the need to doctor it.

I was in a hurry and the petfood store I went to didn't carry the grain-free brand I usually give to my cat so I thought I could give a try with this food.<br /><br />I feed kitty using a toy food dispenser. It's a cylinder with holes, filled with food and my cat rolls it in order to get food. While the toy is in a tray to prevent getting cat food everywhere in the house, that food makes a mess of little crumbles and gunk all over the tray and dispenser. It's never happened with other dry cat food (royal canin, science diet, orijen, etc).<br /><br />Also, my cat started passing huge stools since he's eating that food. Like twice as big as usually. No fun cleaning the litter box and I don't feel I get a lot for my money as the cat seems to poop half of what he eats.<br /><br />Going back to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QIXW6">Orijen Regional Poultry and Fish Grain-Free Dry Cat & Kitten Food, 5.5lb</a>!

review/text: I have bought pig ears for my dogs for over 12 years and these were the perfect size. Very big but not huge. They are smoked perfect and Bubby loves them. Everyone who buys these for their dogs knows you can get stuck with very small ones and be very disappointed, not these. Bought from this company before and have never been sorry.

review/summary: tiny foreign junk - what a rip off!
review/text: I don't know what others got, but I was shipped a box of teeny tiny little pig ears in a box that said they were a product of Spain. All 100 (if that's how many are even in there) of them were inside a plastic bag about the size of a potato chip bag inside the box. You could have fit several of those bags in the box, but I got only one. It would take 4 of these pig ears to equal the size of just one that I can buy from my local pet food store for about $1.00 a piece. That is no exaggeration. To help you visualize this, the average size pig ear is smaller than my computer mouse (and I have a typical mouse. All I can say is don't make the mistake I made. After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a quality product. Well, while it appears that it was at one time, it certainly isn't anymore. I weighed the bag and it was a bit over 4 pounds. I paid $80 after shipping. That means I paid roughly $20 per pound for this junk! And since these don't come from the United States, there's no telling if they're even safe for my dogs to eat.  What a complete rip off!!!<br /><br />edit: Check the "customer images" of this product. I uploaded two photos that show the average sized pig ear.

review/summary: Very Inconsistent Sizes
review/text: I normally buy pigs' ears two cases at a time for my large dogs to save on shipping fees.  The first two cases of this brand that I purchased were nice large ears.  The third case contained very, very small ears.  Each was roughly one-third the size of the ears in the first two cases.  I haven't opened the fourth case yet, but I won't buy any more of this brand, regardless.  EDIT:  The fourth case had the same small ears as the third one.  I have posted a couple of photos showing the size of the tiny ears received here vs. the nice large ears received from a different company.

review/summary: Great product, can be a bit 'dusty,' but not fault of seller
review/text: I've purchased boxes of pig ears directly from Merrick as well as through Amazon.com sellers. Any problem with the pig ears needing to be wiped off originates with Merrick's shipping: in large 'knock-down' boxes that are not sealed airtight and so can get 'dusty' during transit. If it were not for this, they'd get a 5-star rating. I've registered this concern with Merrick two or three times, but don't know if anything has changed, because I no longer buy directly from them (their retail prices are higher to me than if I buy from one of the sellers; go figure). The pig ears themselves are top quality, nice size and very, VERY much enjoyed by my cattle dog. I do recommend supervision when you dog is enjoying a pig ear (ditto for the Flossies), as they can choke on what they've chewed off, if they get greedy and "bite off more than they can chew." It's easy to reach in and remove the offending piece of really-slimy-by-now from my cattle dog's mouth, and he doesn't often choke, but it's enough for me to issue a caution. Beware: These treats are addictive to your pet!!!!!!

review/text: This product is a shoddy replacement for their European Dutch-Processed cocoa (in the silver container) which I used exclusively with fantastic results.  I was mortified when they discontinued it.  At first I was glad to see they put out another Dutch-processed cocoa. What a letdown.  This product is over-processed (they used too much alkali), is bitter and is headed for the trash.  What was Hershey's thinking?  They had a wonderful product that they discontinued and replaced with a lousy product.  I will now only use Peet's Dutch-Processed Cocoa or Callebaut.

review/summary: too "dark"
review/text: This is Hershey's "new" version of what they called "European Style Dutch Processed Cocoa," which was in a silver, white and red box.  They updated the ESDP Cocoa to European Style Dutch Processed Cocoa -- Special Dark.<br /><br />I used to buy the old version (silver box) by the case.  We LOVED it.  It made the BEST hot cocoa, mousse and icings.  It was rich, smooth and had a wonderful chocolate flavor. (The only way I can describe the difference is the old version was more like devil's food cake than dark chocolate cake.)  I called Hershey's this Christmas (2005) to see if I could order another case.  I was told they don't make it anymore, the updated version is the special dark.<br /><br />I bought the special dark and tried it in several recipes.  Even my kids didn't like the hot cocoa with the new Hersheys.  The special dark is too dark -- and I don't really mean bittersweet (which I like.)  It's not as rich as the old version and seems a little bland.  I don't know what Hersheys did, but I'll be going to another cocoa.  At one time I had a large tin of Guittard, which I will probably go back to.<br /><br />Lark

review/summary: Hershey's "Special Dark" Cocoa - "Special Disapointment"
review/text: I used to buy the old version (silver box). My whole family loved it. It was the best affordable European Style cocoa powder on the market. I used it for everything, from hot cocoa, brownies and birthday cake fillings to chocolate mousse and truffles. It was rich, smooth and had a wonderful chocolate flavor. It was great!!!<br /><br />This year, before Easter, I run out of cocoa. I went to different stores trying to find my favorite cocoa - Hershey's European Style. I couldn't find it! I called Hershey's to see if I could order some and I was told they don't make it anymore, the updated version is the special dark. I bought it but I promise not to make this mistake ever again! It is black, without any flavor, and very unpleasant. If this is Hershey's specialists idea of "European Style - Dutch Processed Cocoa" they are wrong! Maybe they need a trip to Holland to drink some good dark cocoa and attend some training!

review/summary: FRUSTRATED WITH HERSHEY'S
review/text: I love this Special Dark cocoa for BAKING, but NOT for hot chocolate. I have always kept regular Hershey's cocoa powder in my pantry; however, I used Hershey's European Dutch Processed cocoa (silver can) for hot chocolate.  It makes a much smoother and creamier drink. When I saw the Special Dark chocolate on the store shelf, I decided to buy it IN ADDITION to the one in the silver can because I love dark chocolate (the darker the better).  I used it to bake a cake and frosting for a family gathering.  The cake & frosting was black, but was so delicious and moist.  My family loved it, even though we all joked that we had never seen a black cake.  In fact, a nephew who never eats cake ate three pieces!  When I went back to replenish my cocoa in the silver can for my nightly hot chocolate, the store said that it was no longer available and that the special dark cocoa had taken its place, using the same bar code.  They are nothing alike, and I used them both for different things.  I started mixing regular cocoa with special dark cocoa to make hot chocolate. It was better than using just regular cocoa alone, but not as good as the cocoa in the silver can.  Later, when I went back to the store to replenish my special dark cocoa, that was no longer available as well.  All that I seem to be able to get is the original regular cocoa.  I'm so upset.  I don't know why Hershey's can't have all three. Each one was good for different things.  I even called Hershey's, only to get a weak, noncommital excuse with no solution.  I noticed that only the original regular cocoa appears on Hershey's website now.<br /><br />I am now going to try to find other brands at other stores and/or will order my cocoa online.

review/summary: Excellent cakes, lovely cocoa, better for you.
review/text: Okay, this is a different cocoa from anything I've ever had before. The first taste is a bit surprising, so it's better just to think of it as its own thing and not expect it to taste like all the other cocoas you've had.  I loved to use it in cakes (I had to increase the flour a little in mine or drop the sugar because it made the already moist cake just too gooey otherwise).  I use the Cooks Illustrated recipe (6 chocolate cakes, sour cream), and with the special dark, it's a family and neighborhood favorite. I also love that it turns icing nearly black.  I've gotten several commetns about how beautiful the cakes are made with this cocoa.<br /><br />Our favorite use though is in hot cocoa.  I use 2tbsp cocoa powder with 1-2 tbsp sugar and add 8 oz of boiling water.  We love it just to drink, it looks like the darkest cocoa ever, and is more like a coffee drink, grown up hot chocolate...  Our skeptical friends even love it, you should definitely give it a try!!  We used to make the cocoa twice as strong, but found 2tbsp is enough for us because it's a very strong cocoa.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  It's better for you... in one cup of the cocoa above (with 1bsp sugar) compared to a cup of cocoa with the same recipe and regular "natural" hershey's cocoa powder (note, it includes 2tbs of each and sugar, not the 1 tbsp on box)<br /><br />________________special dark_______________regular<br /><br />calories............95.......................95<br /><br />g fat................1........................1<br /><br />g fiber..............4........................2<br /><br />g protein............2........................2<br /><br />Iron................30%.......................8%<br /><br />with the twice as strong recipe, we were getting 60% of our iron from each cup, which is amazing to me.

review/summary: Nothing Tastes Like HOME
review/text: One of the few domestic Dutch-processed baking cocoas, Hershey's European-style is excellent for the price.  It is a dark roast similar to most Italian cocoas.  I swear by it, and had to order a case from the manufacturer once for my family and friends cuz not many local grocery stores carry it.  In this category, they usually sell only expensive imported products such as Droste, which is actually a medium-roast product, good but closer to plain cocoa.  Dutch-processing brings out the full flavor of the cocoa bean, while cutting out the acidity.  Sometimes it tastes better than pure chocolate, even though it contains virtually no cocoa butter.  The higher price on imports--at least double that for domestic--reflects finer milling and perhaps a better quality cocoa bean, but alas, foreign cocoa is often stale.  Hershey's is always fresh, and any coarseness is negligible.  Most importantly, it has a rich chocolate taste reminiscent of fudge.  I for one can't tell the difference between it and gourmet brands.

review/text: I've used the silver can dutch cocoa for years and have always loved it. This Special Dark version is darker and does not taste nearly as good as the silver can variety. I had to make two batches of chocolate icing, and I only had enough silver can cocoa for one, so I used the new stuff for the second batch. The colors were completely different. The Special Dark version was almost black and didn't taste nearly as good. I had to mix the two batches together so that my cake didn't look bad. I think that people in my area aren't so impressed with the Special Dark version -- I've noticed that it is no longer available at any of my local grocery stores.

review/text: I have never seen the silver dutch cocoa - when I found this cocoa I bought it at Wal Mart and found it has a recipe for chocolate mousse on the back!  I haven't served it to anyone that didn't like it.  I made it for the church's thanksgiving dinner. I made some with cane sugar and some with splenda - it was a hit!  Instead of using the 2 cups of whipping cream, I use 1 cup of whipping cream and 1 cup of 1/2 n 1/2 and it turns out great.  I get 4 oz plastic containers w/ lids and that is what I put it in. - for a real treat - freeze the cane sugar ones and it is like a fudge cycle.  Oh yea- when I make my cheese cake I make some mousse with the 2 cups of whipping cream (b/c it is thicker to begin with) and pour a layer over the cake, refridgerate it - cut it and serve it! The last time I went to Wal Mart to buy it - they didn't have it so I went to Winn Dixie - then I found where I could order it from Amazon - I signed up for a regular shipment - there was no shipping for 6.

review/text: I have a recipe for Hot Fudge Pudding Cake that calls for Dutch Process Cocoa. I can't find it in the rural area that I live, but I did find this Hershey's Special Dark.  It gave my cake a strange gray/black muddy color that I think is very unappealing.......tasted OK, but it's color is off-putting.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: I never had the Hershey's silver label others are referring to, but I love this version.<br /><br />I like dark chocolate, so I thought I'd try this for hot cocoa. Since it didn't have a recipe for that on it, I didn't make it, but made the cake and frosting recipe instead.<br /><br />People raved! It was so dark it looked black, but we didn't care at all. The cake was moist and rich and the icing spread wonderfully.<br /><br />This will not be my last can of this stuff, and I'm looking for other recipes for it.

review/summary: best ice cream ever
review/text: This cocoa is amazing with its wonderfully strong, sinfully good flavor (I never had the old type in the silver can, so I cannot compare them). Unlike others, I did not notice this to be bitter (and I used a lot in my recipe).<br /><br />When my wife, who *is* Dutch, moved here, she was very disappointed with the cocoa we could find in the stores. I noticed that Ben & Jerry's used alkali-processed cocoa, so I went looking for some and found this, and then made chocolate ice cream with it. Both my Dutch wife and I think it is the best chocolate ice cream ever. My recipe is below.<br /><br />Also, note that the item selling here is for SIX containers of cocoa (I paid $2.37 for one at Central Market). Some reviewers think that the price is for only one container. If you can't find it elsewhere, this is still cheaper than the real Dutch cocoas.<br /><br />Dave's Dutch Chocolate Extreme Ice Cream<br /><br />  2 lg eggs<br /><br />500 ml heavy whipping cream (about 2 cups + 1 tbsp + 2.5 tsp)<br /><br />250 ml whole milk  (about 1 cup  + 1 tbsp)<br /><br />150  g sugar  (3/4 cup + 1/2 tbsp)<br /><br /> 65  g dutch cocoa  (3/4 cup + 1 tbsp: well-packed)<br /><br />pinch  salt<br /><br />whisk eggs a few minutes to fully blend.<br /><br />then whisk in sugar until well blended.<br /><br />continue to whisk until smooth while adding in cream, milk, cocoa, and salt.<br /><br />store in fridge overnight (this helps with the texture).<br /><br />freeze according to your ice cream maker's instructions.

review/summary: Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder
review/text: This is the best cocoa powder on the market, if you want to use dark,<br /><br />Dutch-processed cocoa. It is rich, yields smoothness and great flavor<br /><br />whether in cocoa, fudge, cookies or cakes.  I prefer it to Droste made<br /><br />in the Netherlands.

review/summary: Hershey's Cocoa Has Gone Down the Drain
review/text: I have even written to Hershey's to ask what happen to the Dutch Processed Cocoa (silver can) and they tried to tell me that the new can was the same thing.  Do they think we are stupid?  The cocoas DO NOT even look or taste the same!!!  What's up with Hershey's? Does it have anything to do with their move to Mexico??  I just don't get it.  Why would a product that so many people LOVE be taken off the shelf??  Something just doesn't add up here.  I've given up on the Hershey's cocoa that my mother used to make her famous fudge for years.  Really hated to see this one go.

review/summary: Poor substitute for Dutch Cocoa
review/text: Natural cocoa powder is ideal for baking.  Dutch processed cocoa is ideal for items that are not baked, like hot chocolate drinks.  This mixture is not ideal for anything. Shame on Hershey's for replacing a very good product (100% dutch processed cocoa) with this inferior one.

review/text: I use the Special Dark cocoa in recipes and hot chocolate, and we love the full, dark, rich flavor. I was very disappointed when I tried to purchase more and found it unavailable.

review/summary: An awful "update"
review/text: I don't know if the change was finances-driven (isn't it almost always) or simply product development trying to justify their existence, but Hershey's new version of dutch processed cocoa is new but not remotely improved.  The old Hershey's dutch cocoa was a top-notch product for those on a budget -- great flavor, no harsh or bitter flavors, no interruption of texture.  This cocoa guts most of that success with its strange twang (cocoa may taste earthy, but not dirty) and powdery texture.  For goodness sake Hershey, take a page from Coke and just say no to "new" Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate powder
review/text: This is a hard to find item in the stores. Dark chocolate powder is good for lots of things and this allows me to add artificial sugar to taste instead of calorie heavy sugar in pre-sweetened cocoa. Arrived quickly and well packed.

review/summary: Hideous!
review/text: I, too, used "Silver Can" Hershey's European Style Cocoa for many years.  I ordered it by the case from Hershey, because no local stores stocked it. It had a delightful flavor and aroma, and the color was very dark, but not unnaturally black like this stuff.  Hot Cocoa made with Special Dark looks like dirt, rather than chocolate, and is nearly flavorless in comparison with Silver Can cocoa. I'm only sorry I have to give it one star in order to review it.  BTW, I found a very nice dutch process cocoa--not as good as Silver Can, but very close--from an online spice shop located in Colorado.  It's a bit more expensive than Hershey, but not cost prohibitive.  Haven't bought a can of Hershey's cocoa since.

review/summary: Hershey's Special Dark cocoa is the Best!
review/text: For dieters and any chocolate lovers, this product will satisfy, and for only 5 calories per Tablespoon! It's very dark so it adds a richness to any baked recipe. Unfortunately it is not widely available in stores...yet, at least. If you find it, stock up!

review/summary: Not for ice cream
review/text: We just bought (from Amazon.com) a soft ice cream maker and while we love the maker we aren't thrilled with the fact that getting Dutch processed cocoa (the only kind recommended for use in ice cream) is very difficult.<br /><br />One thing for sure -- this ain't it.  It's only average in flavor, no where near what chocolate ice cream should taste like.  The fact they replaced their "silver can" product (the one recommended by all ice cream makers) with this one is despicable.  One reviewer here likened it to the "new Coke" fiasco but this is worse, because there are few alternatives (at least with new Coke there was Pepsi :>)<br /><br />If you are going to make ice cream you might want to try the Ghiradelli Dutch processed sweetened variety -- yes it is sweetened and thus you'll need to adjust your recipes, but it's easily obtained and reasonably priced.  Everyone recommended Droste but we've yet to be able to find it locally.<br /><br />Shame on Hershey!
