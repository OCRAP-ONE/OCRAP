review/summary: delicious spicy corn soup
review/text: Very good soup.  Easy to make and brings Latin American flavors to life.  Works well with any meal.  My only complaint is that it clumped after letting it sit for a minute, so I had to stir it quite often. But overall, a delicious soup that I will continue to buy & enjoy.

review/summary: NOT CRUNCHY
review/text: Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.

review/text: I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the "Tropical Fruit" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the "Organic Strawberries" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate.

review/summary: don't buy for travels
review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/summary: Really good - little powdery but good
review/text: These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.  Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.  These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Taste testing them somewhere could be advised, although I am not sure where you could test them out.

For Weight Watchers folks like me, you'll be happy to know that it's only 2 points / bag. If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it.

review/summary: Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor
review/text: I started buying these as a "to go" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor.  Now he loves these so much, he seems to object to fresh mangos.  Now the whole family loves them.  We buy all the other flavors (except blueberries, tried them once -- they'd be okay for baking with, but not a great snack).  I've tried 2 other brands of freeze dried foods and I'd say Crunchies brand is the best -- size of pieces, texture/look of pieces, flavor.  Only improvement would be for it to come in a large cannister size too, and even the 1.5 ounce would be better if it was in a hard sided container like "Just ___________" brand (also okay, but more shrivled up, less like airy).<br /><br />Good Job Crunchies!

review/summary: Low Calorie, Nutritious and DELICIOUS...what more could you want?
review/text: I was at Costco one fine Saturday afternoon when they were handing out samples of the Mixed Fruit Crunchies. I was immediately struck by how flavorful they are! Crunchy, and crisp, not leathery like most dried fruit. On their own they are a fun snack for kids and adults alike. I've also discovered that they make great flavoring agents for frostings, truffles, cakes, etc. I used a mortar and pestle to turn, for example, the strawberry Crunchies into a powder, then used that for the Triple Berry tea loaves and the Strawberries & Cream truffles I made during the holidays. The intense, refreshing, true fruit flavor is what I love about these. And the crunch, but then I'm a texture person!<br />p.s. the other reviewer: It's the banana crunchies you think aren't good, I would bet money on it. My daughter doesn't like them either.

review/summary: Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer
review/text: I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!

review/text: Crunchies Blueberries are my new favorite snack. Mine arrived whole and in good condition. There was some blueberry powder at the bottom of the bags, but this is only a problem if you love them as much as I do and insist on sifting through the powder to ensure you get every last blueberry. I haven't tried rehydrating them, as I like them crunchy, but my experience with other freeze-dried items is that they rehydrate well. Incidentally, freeze-dried blueberries are a lot cheaper than dried blueberries, but they retain almost all of their nutrients unlike regular dried fruit.

I was holding my 6 months old (who has so far refused all forms of baby food and has only agreed to try the gerber puffies) and he grabbed one off the table and shoved it in his mouth.  It melted in his mouth and he was hooked.  He ended up eating 7 pieces before I cut him off for fear of giving him too much of something he's never had before.  But they kept him very happy for a while.

review/text: I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?

review/text: Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are "good" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.

review/summary: Crunchy? More like stale  O.o
review/text: Usually I buy freeze dried pears from whole foods but it costs an arm and a leg so I was SUPER excited to see this available at a decent price.<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't even come close...The pears weren't crunchy in the slightest bit, more like stale and chewy in such a way that it brought about a slight "ick" factor. I was expecting the same quality as Whole Foods (my mistake) but when I opened the bag, it looked like someone had taken a pear slice and crumbled it like a paper ball and dried it.<br /><br />We got this to have healthy snacks on hand but no one in my house can get over that slight "ick" taste and no one will eat it. Whatta waste :(

review/text: I bought these for my wife who loves anything strawberry. First of all they must lie about the calories because they are very tasty andd sweet. They are not crunchy, by rather they are light and airy. The packages are small, but a great snack and there were twelve of them. That brings me to my recommendation for you to order two boxes, because I just put in an order for a box for my wife. She will be pleased.<br /><br />Also, try the other flavors, I love the pineapple. I was able to buy this set with a coupon that made them a real bargain.

review/text: I understand the benefits this product offers, but what it lacks is taste appeal. Kind of like eating a little bit of flavored air. It is lacking a palatable texture. There is some flavor, but not what I expected. Very costly per ounce,$3 for 1.5 oz. It may take8-10 lbs of fresh fruit to make 1 lb of crunchies, but for flavor, texture, and cost, I will definately buy 8-10 lbs. fruit. Sorry I am unable to return the other 5 bags.

review/summary: CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  "Crunchies" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  "Crunchies" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is "pineapple," so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend "Funky Monkey" or "Crunchy N Yummy" which are both sold by Amazon.

review/summary: you're lucky if you get all the fruits mentioned
review/text: besides purchasing this at the groceries, i ordered twice on Amazon hoping that this product would improve. there is an unequal amount of fruit distributed in each package. out of the six packages only one actually contained mangoes. also, there must literally be only 5 chips of bananas in each package and i have already gone through about 20 by now. the strawberry chips easily get pulverized so if you think you are missing them in your pack, they may already be turned into dust at the bottom.<br /><br />now why, oh why do i still buy them (at the grocery)? my toddler likes the banana chips and mangoes (we now buy the mangoes separately which is another hit and miss on quality). what doesn't get eaten by the little one gets thrown into my breakfast cereal or oatmeal so nothing goes to waste. so for that i'm giving it 3 stars.

review/summary: Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit
review/text: Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy.  All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans.  Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape.  Excellent, healthy snack :)<br /><br />Update:  For Pears...  (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)<br /><br />The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely.  They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item).  The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack!
review/text: I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.

review/text: These used to come as small cubes, they were delicious and the kids loved them. They now come as dry mango slices, the kids still love them. Ok, I eat them too. I think the previous formulation was slightly sweeter, and you could put it in cereal and the like, whereas the slices now are larger so you couldn't do that.<br /><br />Not quite sure why they reformulated them - they appear to have been out of stock for quite a while, and then when they were back in stock they are different. However, still good and still worth purchasing as a healthy snack.

review/summary: Freeze dried
review/text: I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product.

I love the taste; its not as watery in taste like the ''Alo'' drinks; there is more pulp and real juice in it. In my opinion, the the ''Fremo'' brand named Aloe Vera Drinks are the best for pure fruit taste and the most Aloe Vera Pulp you can find, but they are no longer offered on Amazon after being sold out!:( This brand comes second place and the ''Alo'' brand is a third place runner. I recommended this drink to others and they love it too.

review/text: I was very skeptical when I ordered this as I don't usually order any type of food from this kind of site.  I should have listen to my initial instinct.  The candy arrived and it was basically unedible. I could not even chew it.  It was hard as a rock.  It felt like trying to chomp through a jawbreaker.  I even put them in the microwave in hopes that it would melt a bit so that I can chew them.  No avail.  In order to get it soft enough to chew they were completely melted and too sticky to eat.  I tried numerous times in the microwave to try and get the right setting but it just became too much work and not worth it in the end.  I sooo wanted to loooove these as they were my favorite candy growing up.<br /><br />I did give it two stars ONLY based on the quick delivery.

review/summary: Delicious, relatively healthy alternative to chips!
review/text: These are fantastic.  They taste kind of like Munchos (remember those?) but with only 100 calories and one gram of fat for a full, completely-satisfying-sized bag.  They take care of my potato chip / salt craving no problem, and seriously rival regular chips -- none of that fake, baked chip texture or the gastro problems that come with fat free chips.  Highly recommended for dieters or if you're just looking to eat a little more healthily.

review/summary: Glenny's Spud Delites
review/text: I love these chips.  Not only are they gluten-free, but they help me stay on my Weight-Watchers Points Plus program, too.  I can enjoy a whole bag of potato chips, get that crunchy craving satisfied while not feeling deprived or guilty.  Sometimes I wish they were a little saltier, but that's not a big problem.  I just add a little sea salt when that happens.  Most of the time, they are just perfect!  I have reordered these repeatedly since I was first introduced to them earlier this year.  What a find!  (I have also ordered directly from Glenny's website.  Amazon often beats the price with super-saver shipping, though.)

review/text: Roasted, unsalted soy nuts are not the most delicious snack. So before you buy 12, 9 oz packages, you should try a small quantity at your local health food store or asian grocer. If you know you want roasted, unsalted soy nuts, Amazon's offering from the Bergen Nut Company is an excellent source and good price. When I open a package, I transfer them to a tupperware container for easy snacking while I sit at my computer when working. It's a healthier alternative to satisfy a craving to munch.

review/summary: The preferred salt for kitchen and table.
review/text: Except for baking, Morton Coarse Kosher Salt is what I use in the kitchen and at the table. I prefer pure, plain salt to the somewhat muddled flavor of sea salt.  Table salt is much finer so it is harder to pinch and distribute evenly on a finished dish.<br /><br />This coarse, flaked salt is also necessary for topping pretzels and margaritas and making pickles. It is also especially nice topping whole grain loaves and on meat, poultry or baked potatoes. If you have a French recipe calling for "gros sel" something of this nature is what is intended. A nice gift that is easy to make using this salt is pickled lemons, which are very useful in Mediterranean dishes.<br /><br />Note that this salt is less dense than regular table salt. The label indicates to add 1 tablespoon per quarter cup if the recipe calls for table salt.

review/summary: Yummy! Fun Snacks for Kids or Adults Too
review/text: I must still be a kid at heart because I eagerly awaited this GoPicnic Kid's Fun Food package. I had tried one of the adult snack boxes and loved it so I knew I would probably love other food packages too. In this box you get quite a few tasty snacks (all gluten-free) which include:<br /><br />Pop Chips - Deliciously crunchy chips that are neither fried or baked. They are salted perfectly and are not greasy or dry. The 3-ounce bag is big enough to share. These chips do no contain any preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, saturated fat, trans fat or gluten.<br /><br />Old Wisconsin Turkey Sausage - These tasty snack bites are meaty and delicious and taste lean.<br /><br />Enjoy Life Chewy Bars - These are chewy and crunchy with a hit of berry flavor. They are made in a nut- and gluten-free bakery. They contain no wheat, no dairy, no peanuts, no tree nuts, no egg, no soy, no fish or shellfish. They are also made without casein, potato, sesame and sulfites. These make a good snack or a good breakfast on the run.<br /><br />All Natural Sunflower Crunch - This is the tastiest treat in the box. These crunchy treats are made with sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, rice malt, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />Surf Sweets - Love gummy bears but not all the sugar? These gummy bears are made with organic fruit juice, fortified with vitamin C and have all-natural colors and flavorings. There are three small bags.<br /><br />GoPicnic ready-to-eat meals: Turkey stick and crunch - This is a box of five items which include an Old Wisconsin turkey snack stick, barbecue potato chips, Mariani dried apricots, Baja Blend fruit and nut mix and a piece of organic dark chocolate. If your kids are allergic to peanuts just take out the Baja Blend fruit and nut mix. It has almonds, peanuts, mango and cranberries. What a great combination.<br /><br />I can think of so many reasons to buy a box of these snacks. You might want one box per kid for when you go on a family vacation or it would be fun to have a few boxes for a movie night. This would also be the perfect snack box to send with the kids if they go camping. The only thing that needs refrigeration is the turkey sausage but maybe just sharing the package would be the solution. You could also keep it in a cooler in the car on a road trip. Some of the treats in this box would also be fun for school lunches.<br /><br />Now I'm being honest when I say that these treats are going to be loved by adults too. This is my favorite GoPicnic box so far. Yes I did share some of my snacks with my husband who was as eager to try everything as I was. We will definitely buy this for hiking trips and picnics. I think this is a great deal for twenty dollars! So convenient and yummy too!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

They came in a sturdy box that kept the contents from getting squished as they got tossed around in the car. We will be ordering more to have on hand for trips to the zoo too and things like that simply because it is so convenient and easy to store until you want to use it (unless the hubby finds them first)! Everything I got a chance to try was very tasty and apparently everything else was too because it all disappeared pretty quickly, luckily I came prepared with more than one!

The most notable flavors are bergamot and vanilla, making this a very soothing tea with just the right amount of fruity flavor without tasting overly sweet. I love it on its own (no cream or sugar with this one!), but it pairs wonderfully with orange-laced chocolate. Really a wonderful tea - I'm thrilled I can get it on Amazon!

review/summary: Complex, very well blended
review/text: This is a delicious black China tea blend presented in a beautiful, highly giftable tin box.<br /><br />This tea is available in 35 oz, 8.8oz, 4.4oz and tea bags; I usually get the 4.4oz tin as I am the only black tea lover in the house. One tin of 4.4 oz is enough for one large cup a day for ~3 months so I am guessing ~100 cups (I use a 1.5' mesh infuser).<br />As usual with Kusmi, the tin is beautiful, with raised flower details and old-fashioned design and colors.<br /><br />The blend is a glistening black tea with pieces of citrus peel.<br />The nose is reminiscent of a bergamot Earl Grey with spicier notes that I would describe as all-spice, nutmeg and even a hint of turmeric.<br />The mouth is smooth, low tannins, with beautiful layered flavors of vanilla and soft spices and a savory-sweet finish.<br /><br />Kusmi recommend a brewing temperature of 85c to 90c (~185F to 195F) so make sure the water sits for a few moments after boiling before pouring over the tea. I usually like a rather long infusion time, maybe 5 to 7 minutes. I do not add anything to this tea but a sweetener would probably work if you like.<br /><br />To my knowledge, Prince Vladimir was one of Kusmi's first blend in the late 1800's and remain one of the most popular. I would highly recommend it to lovers of complex flavored black teas. In particular, if you already appreciate some higher-end bagged teas (Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean or Orange Dulce?), I think you should give this superior blend a try.<br />Cheers!

review/summary: Once in a while, in the short term, works for cats too
review/text: Note that I'm NOT recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis: the two types of animals need different kinds of foods and nutrients. However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* added taurine, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily while I looked around more. The cats absolutely adored it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety (one of our cats gets bored with foods awfully quickly). The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat.

review/summary: finally a food that settled my doggie's tummy, but recent price increase outrageous
review/text: No matter how highly rated of a kibble we would get for our little shih tzu & yorkie mix, she would throw up about three times per week.  Once we switched to this raw dehydrated meal at the recommendation of some folks at a local pet store who have a pomeranian with a sensitive tummy, the problem was solved!  Even if she would get into something she was not supposed to, no vomiting, seemed to do miracles for her digestive track in general, so was very pleased!  Have also used the lamb formula, which we have had a great experience with, as well.  Also - she LOVES it!  To save money, we would buy the large 8 pound bag and I am very sad that the price has recently risen so drastically (Nov. of 2011 from $60 per bag to $75, BIG jump).  Because of the price increase, we had switched to Grandma Lucy's (Artisan freeze-dried), with equal success as far as no vomiting and her loving the food, but have switched back to Addiction because she was looking thin, as if the protein content was not enough.  I would recommend calling around to specialty feed stores in your area to find the absolute best price.

review/summary: and in not-so-blind taste testing, our consumer picked....,
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act "stoned" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for "marinating" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a "harmless, euphoric state" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.

review/summary: BEST CATNIP EVER!
review/text: we joke in my house and call this stuff "cracknip" because our cat will do anything for it. He knows which cabinet it's stored in and will meow and bug everyone who walks anywhere near the cabinet until he gets some.  I've had my cat for 8 years and he has never shown interest in catnip no matter what kind it is.  I saw an offer for a free sample of this and had to order some the same day my sample came due to the amazing reaction from my lazy old cat.  I will be buying more when this container gets low.  great stuff, great price!

review/summary: Even the stray cats won't eat them
review/text: I offered these to my cat, but she wouldn't touch them. She loves other treats. She even gets excited when I feed her ordinary kibble by hand. But these she sniffed, licked once and then completely ignored. Have a whole bag left, I offered them to one of the stray cats that lives near my house. He also refused to eat them.
