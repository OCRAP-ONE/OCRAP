review/summary: Cookie good -- chocolate not so much
review/text: I couldn't wait to try these Chips Ahoy cookies. I mean, how do you make chocolate chip cookies better -- by putting more chocolate inside (yes, I'm a chocoholic).  The chocolate has a strange taste to it.  I definitely prefer the plain, soft batch chocolate chip cookies by Chips Ahoy.  However, they weren't so bad that I didn't finish the entire package!!!!!

review/summary: Mediocre At Best
review/text: Sorry Chips Ahoy, this was a miss. I'll preface this by saying I'm not a huge standard Chips Ahoy fan, but they're not bad dipped in milk in a pinch. But these just tasted weird to me.<br /><br />More than just gooey, they're extremely soft and fall apart easily; they actually felt a bit unpleasant and fake. There's an odd taste to them that I can't place as well, and I wasn't fond of it. Neither was my family. My wife: "I hated them." My son: "they were ok I guess, but they tasted weird. I like the crunchy ones." My daughter isn't here now, but she wasn't a fan either.<br /><br />Bottom line is this: I can see no reason to ever buy them again, and if they were on a platter at my kid's elementary school function I'd still skip 'em. Not exactly a ringing endorsement, I know.

review/summary: Nope
review/text: I could't finish the first cookie I tried. It just tasted overly processed and chemical-laced. Ick. But I am giving the cookies two stars since my husband ate most of the package before I threw it away. When asked, he didn't really like them but he didn't find them as repulsive as I did, obviously. He didn't complain when I threw the rest away however. I wouldn't buy these even on sale and in desperation for a cookie. I can handle a regular Chips Ahoy or Keebler at times but these were just gross to me from appearance to consistency to taste which was the ultimate condemnation.

review/summary: Nothing special, and high in calories to boot.
review/text: These Chips Ahoy cookies are not very appealing nor appetizing.  When we first opened up the package, we noticed the majority of the cookies were broken or in crumbles.  One of them even looked like it had a bite taken out of it.  You can't always judge a cookie by its appearance, so we tried a few.  The exterior is soft and the fudge inside isn't bad.  But it just didn't mesh well together and it won't be a cookie you crave.<br /><br />The other negative is that each cookie is fairly small and contains 75 calories, which is pretty high considering the size.  You can get other chocolate desserts that will bring you more satisfaction at lower calories.

review/summary: Good Cookies, Poor Packaging
review/text: The Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies were chewy and gooey as promised. They even included a good amount of chocolate making the Chocofudge moniker appropriate. The product itself I have no problem with. The cookies were delicious and are definitely something I would buy again and recommend to my friends, but the way they arrived? Smashed to bits! If I were to buy these cookies I'd save myself the hassle of eating crumbs and pick up a package at the grocery store.<br /><br />Maybe they were all crumbled because they're chewy cookies? I doubt it. I buy chewy cookies at the grocery store and have never seen so many smashed up cookies in one package. Maybe the UPS guy threw my package around because it was relatively light? I'm going to say that's doubtful because everything else I've received via UPS or from Amazon has arrived in tip-top perfect shape. (Including soft cookies from Mrs. Fields.)<br /><br />The Chips Ahoy! package just isn't made to endure the rigors of shipping in anything other than it's nice large case of cookies that arrives at the grocery store and then gets parceled out and placed on the shelf. The packaging wasn't sturdy enough to keep the cookies in place despite a plastic tray with individual slots for each cookie. In the entire package I had approximately four whole cookies. The rest were pieces. But at least they were delicious pieces!<br /><br />Like I said earlier, I'd definitely buy these cookies again but it'll be from my local grocery store, not from Amazon.

review/summary: Chips Ahoy with Pudding Goo Inside!
review/text: I'm not a huge packaged cookie eater, but I like regular Chips Ahoy, so I thought I'd give these a shot.  I found them somewhat pleasant, but a bit unsettling.<br /><br />For starters, the cookies came with a resealable package.  That's cool and all, but my package had been opened, presumably by the workers who shipped the cookies, and a cookie or two eaten from each row!  A few of the remaining cookies were broken, and the majority were covered in black chocolate smears.  This was not the best presentation, and although I wouldn't expect packages to be open normally, the crumbs and smears I would expect are common.<br /><br />Taste was okay, close to a classic (non chewy) chips ahoy: not too sweet and somewhat cracker-like.<br /><br />The texture was a bit too crumbly, but similar to regular chips ahoy.  The gooey insides were not as gross as I expected.  More of a drier chocolate pudding.<br /><br />Ingredients were better than expected.  There's still a lot of sugar, but no hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup. That's nice to see in a mass market product like this.<br /><br />Overall I found the cookies okay, but unimpressive.  Buy a single box before you go for the box of 4.

review/summary: Not as good as the "Megafudge," but still a tempting snack
review/text: Chips Ahoy! is a mass-production outfit, so there's always going to be something a bit industrial about the cookies they turn out. These are definitely very edible and, if not exactly addictive, I could (and did) find myself putting away more of them than I should at one sitting. I didn't think these "Chocofudge" cookies were as good as the all-chocolate "Megafudge" variety, but still, the quality of the chocolate was, again, industrial at best. My wife, who knows her chocolate, said it tasted like they were trying to craft something darker than milk chocolate without the characteristic bitterness of true dark chocolate. She didn't think they succeeded. But if you're not looking for a connoisseur cookie experience and just need something for the snackin', these might not be bad to keep in the cabinet. If they make it there before you eat them all.

review/text: What can I say?  I love Chips Ahoy and this one with a nice fudgy filling was just what the doctor ordered.  I'm a chocoholic and proud of it!  The cookies are nice and soft with just the right amount of choco chips that are enough to satisfy even the pickiest of chocolate lovers.  Ahhhhh, these with a nice cup of ice coffee, YUMM!<br /><br />I do so like the softer cookies better I think even though if you are going to be dunking you might want the hard ones.  They are great with ice cream also.  I softened up some good chocolate ice cream and crumbled up pieces of these cookies and mixed together then refroze and oh my it made a nice sundae for the terrible heat we've been having.  You have got to try a few as I'm  sure you'll be hooked in no time.

review/text: We really liked these cookies!  While we were expecting them to be hard and crispy like the regular Chips Ahoy cookies, these were actually soft and chewy, just like a home baked cookie.  With the addition of the chocolate, gooey center, these cookies exceeded our expectations and will definitely be something we purchase again in the future.  These cookies will satisfy your sweet tooth and go great in milk.  Try some and you'll see that I'm right!

review/summary: Not as good as plain Chips Ahoy
review/text: Basically these are Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies with a fudge center. When I first got them they were very gooey, as it was over 100 degrees that day. I put them in the fridge and that fixed that. But after trying them hot and gooey, room temperature and some-what gooey and cold and not-gooey from the fridge, I have to say, I liked the cold from the fridge ones the best.<br /><br />Overall though, the original Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies taste far better to me and the gooey factor just tasted gross. I'll stick with the Original from now on.

The flavor of these is really nice and they are soft!

review/summary: soft, chewy and sweet
review/text: I can understand the mixed reviews for these cookies.  The taste is what it is but that just means some folks will like them and some won't. I thought they were fine. I wouldn't buy them again mainly because I try to avoid eating cookies, but I didn't sense any chemical or plastic character as some reviewers mentioned.  Each cookie contains an abundance of gooey chocolate fudge that is definitely very sweet. The dough itself is also sweet and I thought it had a good texture to it. Not too crumbly, but soft and chewable.  I like these much better than the regular Chips Ahoy cookies which to me do taste artificial. The only drawback - each cookie has 70 calories and they are not very big. On the plus side, even one cookie gives you an overload of chocolate and sugar so I can see why such a small thing is so caloric.<br /><br />I would recommend just buying them for yourself and tasting them.  What is "too sweet" for some is "just right" for others. I found them to be very chocolately and sweet.

review/summary: I didn't like the taste
review/text: It's been a long time since I've purchased this sort of cookie, and I was surprised by how sweet they are.<br /><br />It's overpowering.  It doesn't even taste like chocolate.  I just get SWEET SWEET SWEET in my mouth, and there isn't any other data getting to my brain.  After I eat the cookie, the aftertaste is actually a bit noxious.<br /><br />I also requested a different flavor from this brand, and surprisingly, they taste great.  These simply don't.  I love chocolate chip cookies, but perhaps I'm spoiled because I bake a lot.  These are simply too processed and sweet for me.  And I'm no snob.  I love cheap junk food.<br /><br />They are chewy, and they are filled with some kind of super sweet frosting, but it's just too darn sweet.  Makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it.  Also, when I cleaned out my desk I discovered one of these cookies had fallen out of my lunch bag a few weeks before.  It probably spent five weeks in the open air, and yet it was identical to a fresh cookie from the original package.  No bugs had touched it.  It hadn't dried out.  Whatever they are using to preserve this product is potent.<br /><br />I realize prospective customers for this product are not looking for Martha Stewart's $100 chef inspired perfect cookie, but they probably want something that is reasonably wholesome and tastes less like chemicals and corn syrup.

These are not those.<br /><br />These are smaller than those, stuffed with some plasticy-tasting 'fudge' that's actually pretty solid. Maybe like a brick of fudge but less yummy?<br /><br />It's 4 points plus for 2 cookies if you're doing Weight Watchers and TOTALLY not worth it.<br /><br />They also turn rock hard within a week and a half so chow down fast. Or just throw them out. That's probably a better option.<br /><br />Again, Ew.

review/summary: Excellent for store bought cookies... great for chocolate chip lovers!
review/text: I received a package of both these and the Chewy Gooey Megafudge... so I will compare both of them.  These are excellent cookies for a store bought cookie. They are soft and have a great flavor.  Although I'm more of a brownie person (and thus loved the other variety), my husband is an avid chocolate chip lover and greatly preferred this version.  Lots of chocolate inside makes it an awesome cookie... no more plain cookie if you happen to be low on chips in each bite. EACH bit is guaranteed chocolate since it has a nice chocolate center. But it's not overbearing at all, it's really done quite nicely.  My only complaint is really towards store cookies in general: they all have a tendency to have that store bought chemical taste (I think it's the preservatives). Nothing quite like homemade in that regard!  So I took off a star for that. SOME expensive brands somehow mange this by having quick expiration dates, and if you want to spend the money on those it's worth it!

review/summary: about what you'd expect from a popular cookie
review/text: Well, I can tell you, these didn't last long after I brought them to work.  Anything chocolate, of course, elicits immediate interest, but there were two of us working in the area when I opened the bag and a scant 3 hours later I discovered that only about 6 cookies remained. The fudgy center is certainly an added bonus to an already good cookie. The consistancy is good; not too soft, not too brittle - and overall flavor is excellent also. This would be another thumbs up.

I liked the MegaFudge better.<br /><br />They are soft and have a fudge "ribbon" in the middle that improves after having been microwaved. They do have that store-bought cookie after-taste, but they are a good cookie for an emergency treat or dessert on vacation.<br /><br />I feel like they could have included more in the package. The package seems disproportional to the amount of cookies you actually get. Also, they are quite fattening. The calorie and fat content is high per serving, but it is a cookie afterall.<br /><br />I may or may not get these again.

review/text: There must be a common ingredient that all "chewy" cookie makers use because they all taste the same. Be it Soft Chews, Chips Ahoy Chewy, or even Pepperidge Farm, whatever it is that keeps these cookies chewy also keeps them palpably homogeneous.  Chips Ahoy Gooey are no different.  Even the "fudge" on the inside tastes like "that flavor". Now don't get me wrong, "that flavor" is good and put me in the right mood, it's positively addicting.  Just know that's exactly what you're getting into here and don't expect a chocolate chip symphony in your mouth.

review/summary: Good, but not quite gooey
review/text: These cookies were good for a packaged cookie. Of course, with three kids, cookies of any sort are not long in the house. Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />1. Crumbled cookies: I didn't have the problems with crumbled cookies that other reviewers had. They held together nicely. However, getting baked goods shipped to you always has a risk, especially during times of temperature extremes like summer. So, that might be a problem in some cases.<br /><br />2. Taste: these cookies are no comparison to a homemade cookie, but what packaged cookie is? The taste is about the same as a regular Chips Ahoy Cookie if you added chocolate frosting to it. They do taste like a commercially processed food. Most likely because they are.<br /><br />The chocolate filling adds an additional flavor to the normal Chips Ahoy taste. It's good, but not super exciting.<br /><br />3. Gooey-ness: The picture and label hints that you're looking at a fudgy-gooey center. The package I had was good, but the chocolate was more a disc of chocolate. It was not hard, but it wasn't the runny-chewy that it looks like.<br /><br />4. Overall: these cookies weren't bad, but they also aren't something extremely exciting.<br /><br />These are ok if you want to keep a package of cookies laying around.

It's interesting that they were able to keep the chocolate soft inside the cookie, but it didn't add any value to the cookie. The cookie was indded soft, crumbly, w/ lots of chocolate inside but the overall taste was just too unnatural to enjoy.<br /><br />It's not something I'd recommend.

review/summary: Your basic packaged cookie experience
review/text: To me, despite the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge hype, these tasted pretty much like any other packaged soft chocolate chip cookie that I've had.  They are small enough that it just takes one bite to eat one.  It's very soft and so is the chocolate fudge in the middle and the chocolate chips.  They tended to already be broken or crumble pretty easily.  The chocolate is very sweet with little cocoa taste and the cookie itself is also very sweet.  You definitely need a glass of milk to go with these.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty basic packaged cookie experience - no surprises or anything special.  My kids of course liked them the most.  I don't think the package lasted more than half a day in our house.

review/text: I saw these in the store and wanted to try them because they looked like something so chocolatey and delicious. I couldn't wait to bite into one and have the chocolate just ooze out of it. Unfortunately, when I tried it there was no oozing or chocolate explosion or really any sort of different flavor from the soft chewy Chips Ahoy!<br /><br />So, I thought to myself, aha! If I warm them up in the microwave they'll get the texture and oozyness that I'm looking for. Again, big disappointment. It was just a warm cookie.<br /><br />I'd have to say that these are really no different then the chewy Chips Ahoy! There may be a slightly more chocolate filling flavor but not like what you'd expect from something that claims it's gooey. The cookie certainly doesn't look like the image on the cover. Even after the microwave it still pulled apart without any goozing of any sort.<br /><br />They're good cookies and all just not what I expected or hoped for.

With homemade cookies, I've always preferred the soft and chewy ones, but these go beyond soft.  I found the taste of the cookie itself to be only okay, and the fudge filling wasn't what I would call gooey.  I tried eating these at room temperature, warmed in the microwave, and cold from the fridge, and there are still plenty of store-bought cookies I would prefer over these.

review/text: These cookies are okay for grocery store cookies made with preservatives.  They aren't as good as Nestle Tollhouse or Mrs. Fields but they're better than the unrecognizable brands one might buy at a gas station.  The "gooey" filling is surrounded by a chocolate "shell" within the cookie and makes for contrasting textures - soft cookie, chocolate shell and gooey center.  While these are in the Chips Ahoy line, they are quite different from the original.  Not better or worse.  Just different.

review/text: For whatever reason, I thought these were going to be bigger bags than 4oz.  That's my mistake.  By the time you figure in the shipping - well, anyway.  I can get the same chicken strips at Woodman's for less and they're made in China, too.  I can't stand it!  My GSP loves 'em, but I won't ordinarily spend $12 a pound on dog treats made in China.

review/summary: The Best Grapefruit Juice I Ever Tasted
review/text: Lakewood Organic Pink Grapefruit Juice surpasses even fresh squeezed in balance and quality. It's perfectly balanced without a hint bitterness or unripe "green" taste. It does not disappoint. There was no separation or sediment in the bottle. The pulp was very fine and almost indiscernible in my mouth. This is really a "must try" product.<br /><br />By the way, my package arrived in 2 days even though it wasn't supposed to ship for a week. Also, those 6 bottles came in the best designed packing material I've ever received in an Amazon order - no peanuts and rolled newspaper here! This shipment will be gone in the blink of an eye so I plan to order more soon.

review/summary: Love this food!
review/text: My dog is highly allergic, a picky eater and prone to dehydration. The quality of ingredients, moisture content and palatability of Natural Balance L.I.D. Sweet Potato and Fish has kept me a return customer even after trying more expensive fish-based grain-free canned foods. I now mix this in a 1:1 ratio with the Natural Balance L.I.D. Sweet Potato and Fish dry food and it has done wonders for my dog. She now can't wait to eat, no more itching/scratching, has a silkier coat and has a wetter nose (something the vet didn't think possible owing to some potential facial nerve damage). In addition to all of the benefits, I also have to praise Natural Balance for keeping such as high quality food affordable. For less than $2 a 12-ounce can, I can have it shipped directly to my door in a few days.

review/summary: Good!
review/text: I used to buy Pemmican brand jerky, and it was great.  Then they were sold to a different owner, and now the stuff is HORRIBLE.  I have tried other "store" brands, but it is all really nasty.  SO I decided to try Buffalo Bill's.  I went with the safest version, the mild country cut.  At first, I wasn't sure how I liked it.  Then I noticed half the bag was gone!  I would describe the jerky as very moist, and almost pepperoni-like.  After you are done eating, you notice a mild "burn" in your mouth.  I am not into hot food, but I could handle it. Every piece was tender, none were bad.  So I would say give it a try.  I will most likely purchase some more in the future.

review/text: As the title says, consider this a "4.5 star" review, if such was possible here.  I do very much like their jerky, but I found this flavor to be the weakest of any of the ones I've tried so far.  (I've tried the Barbeque, Teriyaki and Honey Pepper in the country cut line, finding the Teriyaki to be my personal favorite, and also their vennison jerky).  I also found this jerky to be just a tad tougher then the other flavors, I don't know if that's due to the marinade used on the others or not.  Still, this is a very good product, and I can easily see this being a 5 star product for those who prefer their jerky to not have a slighty sweet taste.

There are some many different ways to prepare it and so many dishes and side-dishes you can make with it. I just can't say enough good things about this pasta.<br /><br />If you take a little bit of extra time to toast these babies before you cook them up, talk about a completely different level of taste.<br /><br />From entr&eacute;es, to side-dishes, I have yet to find a way I couldn't prepare this couscous. Italian style, with chop suey (as a replacement for rice), even mexican style. This is probably one of the most versatile foods on the planet.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Very Versatile In Cooking Plus Delicious
review/text: This is a starch, a grain product, used in North Africa, especially Morocco.  I now use couscous just like I use pasta.  I even use it in the microwave with my pasta cooker.  I've got perfectly cooked couscous in 18 minutes in the microwave.  I've used this in many non-traditional ways.  I've used spaghetti sauce on it, pesto sauce, quick sauted it in olive oil with pieces with cheese (after microwaving it), etc., Anything you do with pasta or rice, you can do with couscous.  You are not stuck with serving this as a Middle Eastern dish.<br /><br />I've used many varieties of couscous.  I don't know why this Israeli product is the best of the lot but it is really a standout.  Of all the varities I've tried, I liked the whole wheat the least.  This is not whole wheat.

Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this "red apple" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this "red apple" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD.

We drank the Millstone Ground Coffee, Vanilla Nut Cream, 1.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) and grew tired of the smell and taste. Much better to add your own essence of your preferred flavor. Learning about good coffee takes a while and eventually one becomes discerning and somewhat more demanding in their choices. For the time the price was decent so 3 Stars for this one.

review/summary: Good brand, good size bags
review/text: When my husband first got our cat a few years ago, he started feeding her cheaper cat food.  She threw up one day all over the carpet, and it was really hard to get the "red" stains out from the color in the cat food.  He then switched her to Iams, and now on the rare occasion she has those problems, the carpet isn't stained like it was before.  Iams is a little more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth it.  Your cat doesn't cost that much money to keep anyway, so you might as well feed them better quality food.<br /><br />I defintely recommend buying this product from Amazon (the pack of 8 2-lb. bags).  You pay more up front, but it averages out to about the same, or maybe even a little less, as buying the 4 pound bags from the local stores.  Plus, your cat gets "fresher" food more often, which is especially good if you only have one cat and don't go through the bag as fast.  Yes, our cat is a little spoiled.

review/summary: My cats love the tuna flavored IAMS.
review/text: I am no longer able to find original IAMS with tuna in my grocery store and I can only buy it online.  My cats love it.  I'm not sure why the stores only stock IAMS with Chicken.  I wish the manufacturer would continue making tuna available.  My 14 year old cat has eaten it exclusively for most of her life and turns her nose up at most other flavors.

review/text: My cat cannot get enough of this food - so it must taste great.<br /><br />With this as her regular diet, she gained 3lbs in a year; my vet said this is a fattening food.  I still give her individual pieces of kibble as "treats" but I feed her Blue Buffalo weight control now.

review/summary: Suitable for all types of cats
review/text: I had a cat with renal failure who had 1 kidney removed several years ago. The doctor recommended the KD dry for her post-surgery. She live nearly 9 years on one kidney and this food alone! I now have three rescued cats of diverse backgrounds, including 1 longhair. They all eat the Iams dry food at will, with no portion control. None are overweight and though the longhair gets frequent hairballs, that is not a result of the food, but rather how frequently I brush him. More brushing = less hairballs.

review/summary: GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT
review/text: GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)  A great deal on a great product, plus free shipping when you order over a certain amount.---Coos Bay Sandra

review/summary: Update: She got her first hairball
review/text: I have been feeding my cat all sorts of cat food.  She has long fur and hasn't had any hairballs.  If she gets hairballs on Iams Proactive hairball formula, I would definitely update this review.<br /><br />This food is different from any cat food I've ever bought because the kibble is shaped like tiny balls.  Up until now, my cat has eaten foods shaped like starfish or "Y" and "X."  She doesn't seem to mind the shape, though.<br /><br />My main beef with cat food is some of them smell so horribly bad (dead fish).  This one is fine.  That's what I buy for -- that and price.  If it does what it says, make my cat lose weight and controls hairballs, I will be a happy cat owner.<br /><br />Will come back in the future to update.<br /><br />____________________________<br /><br />UPDATE:  Well, this formula must not work.  After being on it for two months, my cat suffered her first hairball.

review/text: My sister has been feeding our cat Zoe this product for a few months now, recently she started to get a few cysts on her body, one on her face which caused the hair to fall out in that area. when we noticed this occurring we took her to the vet asap. The vet asked what type of food we feed her and my sister informed that we use Iams Weight Control (she has trouble loosing weight) The Vet told us that she has had a few animals come in lately with the SAME problem and EATING the same food!!!! we were told to stop feeding her Iams and use an all natural cat food with only half a cup of food in her bowl each day.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! or your pet too can start getting cysts on their body.. no good

review/summary: Works for multi-cat families (Chicken Flavor)
review/text: If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are unbeatable too, even for the small (2lb bags).  While it seems weird to get so many small bags, my cats appreciate it because the these bags don't reseal well, so with smaller bags, the food is fresher in general.<br /><br />As mentioned in the subject, this only applies to the Chicken flavor, my cats don't care for the others.

review/summary: Why Can't We Get TUNA Proactive Health Dry Cat Food
review/text: IAMS Original with Tuna Proactive Health Dry Cat Food has been a wonderful food for our 4 yr old female Manx.  Suddenly after years of good health & a beautiful coat we have to find something else she likes besides occasional raw fish or shrimp.  She will not eat IAMS salmon & brown rice, barely will touch the Chicken Proactive Health. I've finally backed down to Purina Tuna & Fish but I know it is not as healthy as IAMS. Why is the IAMS Tuna suddenly not available in HEBs, WalMarts, K-Mart, Feed Stores nor on-line?

review/summary: I was skeptical but really blown away
review/text: I have to admit I was very leery about getting "chocolate cigars" for the birth of our first child... I don't smoke nor do I feel like promoting smoking by giving away real cigars. well, I've seen them and ate them and every one looked very "kiddish" or over done wrapped in tin foil plus they tasted like cheap sugary chocolate. I found these on Amazon, read the reviews and tried to blow up the picts as much as I could to get the visual... I took the chance and ordered the 100 ct box. These things are spectacular! They look so much like a real cigar that I've had to tell several people that i've handed them to, "They're chocolate... no really, it's chocolate." And then the fact that the taste is really good... I mean it's not gourmet chocolate but it really is good. Not overly sweet, a bit rich but not in a bad way. I mean it's a celebratory chocolate cigar and it sure beats the others. I'm very happy with them and would purchase again (if we have another child).

review/summary: It's excellent, but there are a few things you should know (w/bonus lemon drop recipe at the end of the review)
review/text: To begin, let me cut to the chase and simply say that Nestea Lemonade Sticks are excellent.  The product is tasty, has a natural flavor, is easy to mix and contains only about 5 calories per 8 ounce glass.<br /><br />You should however be aware that one packet is meant to be mixed with your standard-sized 500 ml (aka 16.9 ounce) bottle of water.  I first mixed a glass of this with about 8 oz of water and it was much too strong.  So expect one packet to make about two 8 ounce glasses.<br /><br />I've seen substantial price fluctuations on this product.  I paid around $16 with Subscribe and Save and I just saw that it went on sale for even less than what I paid.  So if your price is anywhere around what I paid, it's a good deal.<br /><br />What I can tell you is that you'll get a lot of "tea" for the money without a doubt.  Let's do the math.  You will get about two 8 oz glasses per packet and there are 12 packets per box and you'll receive 10 boxes from Amazon.  Thus 12, 16.9 oz servings per box times 10 boxes equals 2,028 ounces or 254 8oz servings.  You could drink a glass of tea per day for almost 9 months before you'd run out.  That's a lot of "tea" for sure!<br /><br />The reason that I've been writing the word "tea" in quotation marks is because I can't really taste the tea.  It doesn't really taste like a mix of lemonade and iced tea aka the "Arnold Palmer."  It just tastes like lemonade to my tastebuds, even though there is tea in it, according to the listed ingredients.  So it is very good, but do understand what you are purchasing.  The tea taste is very subtle.<br /><br />But again, I really like it.  Nestea Lemon Sticks have a natural lemon flavor and are sweet without having the usual artificial flavor or aftertaste.  It mixes quite easily and requires minimal stirring.  Plainly, as noted, you get a whole lot of tea with a Amazon's 10 box offering.  At less than 5 calories for an 8 ounce serving, it is refreshing and sweet while adding minimal calories.<br /><br />Let me also tell you something that it's great for if you drink adult beverages.  I have mixed this product with Sweet Tea Vodka and it's fantastic.  It's basically like an Arnold Palmer for grown-ups.  Just make the product like you normally would and blend to taste with the Sweet Tea Vodka of your choice.<br /><br />Finally, I'm very happy to report that this product contains *NO SODIUM*!  Sorry about the caps, but one of my pet peeves is the fact that nearly every diet beverage has a ton of added sodium.  If you don't believe me, just take a look at the ingredients on the diet soda of your choosing and you'll typically see 5% or more of your RDA of sodium in a 12 ounce can.  Who needs that?!  We consume far too much salt as it is!  I can understand a bit of salt with your dinner, but I don't want it in my beverages.  Even most iced tea that you'll find in the stores has a good dose of added sodium.  This product has none and it still tastes great.<br /><br />Thanks Nestea for an excellent new product!  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />OK, and here's the bonus low calorie lemon drop recipe (my own creation):<br /><br /> 1. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice<br /> 2. Add 2 shots vodka<br /> 3. Add 1 packet Nestea Lemonade (10 calories)<br /> 4. Add 3/4 cup to 1 cup water to taste<br /><br />Shake like crazy.<br /><br />Tastes great and almost no calories other than what's in the vodka.

review/text: I'm not sure I would call it tea, to my taste buds, it's all lemonade.  But, they list tea as an ingredient, so it's in there.  One packet is too much for a regular bottle of water, so I usually rinse out a 24 oz pop bottle and use it.  Sometimes the packets are a little difficult to open, it's often easier to use a pair of scissors to open one.  Other than that minor complaint, it's my powdered drink of choice.

review/summary: I'll never buy Crystal Light again
review/text: We drink a lot of Crystal Light and have for many years, and I had only ever tried one or two other similar brands.  Nothing else had measured up.  We usually make iced tea, and when that got a little boring, we started mixing half iced tea and half lemonade.  The thing was, we never really liked Crystal Light lemonade enough to drink it straight - it just has a side taste that is too srong.<br /><br />I just received this box from Amazon and took a chance and made straight lemonade.  We all tried it and were happily amazed.  It tastes so much like real lemonade!  It mixes well (better than Crystal Light) and has a delicious tart but sweet lemony taste that is surprisingly refreshing.  We make it by the pitcher now and find we need to refill it all the time it goes so fast. It says it has a mix of Lemonade and tea, but I don't detect anything but a lemonade taste.  At 5 calories a serving, it's a great way to pour some jazz into your water bottle.<br /><br />My nutritionist always advises that I drink as much water as possible. When I mentioned this, she said it's a great alternative.  Really happy to have something in the refrigerator that is delicious, that everyone loves, and is such a fabulous alternative to sodas and other sugary drinks.

Fox's is THE cult favorite dating way back maybe even before trolley cars and the original TROLLEY DODGERS! No bona fide Brooklynite or ex-patriate, such as myself, would ever consider a substitute. Hershey be da----!This is the real deal; accept no substitutes. My only regret is the shipping cost from this purveyor. It's cheaper to get on a train and visit the nearest NYC Gristede's; and you get a day in Manhattan to boot! 5 stars plus for this wonderful, unbeatable product. Zero stars for the not to be believed cost to get it home. Demand it of your local super market manager.

It did not disappoint!  This syrup is not gritty like Hershey's tends to be, has a fudgy taste and best of all stays emulsified in the milk and doesn't settle to the bottom of the glass.

review/summary: Really good chocolate flavor
review/text: I ordered this syrup to try an egg cream. Excellent! Then I tried it to make plain chocolate milk. Also excellent! Since I live in northern Minnesota, and hot chocolate can be a year round drink, I tried it to make hot chocolate. Superb! The next step is to try it in coffee for cafe mocha. I'm also not ashamed to admit it tastes good directly from a spoon.

review/summary: You bet, U-Bet
review/text: The only acceptable chocolate syrup for a Brooklyn-style "Egg Cream." I own an ice cream shop in Riverside, Illinois and have visitors from the East coast who are amazed to find egg-creams this far west of Brooklyn. If I didn't use U-Bet, I would be accused of being a charlatan.

review/summary: Nothng But The Best!!!
review/text: I was born in Brooklyn and directly across the street from our apartment was a candy store with fountain.  My dad would always take in for a chocolate egg cream.  We moved to MA and unfortunately Fox's wasn't available.  My mom tried to make it with other syrups but the taste wasn't the same.  I now live in PA and had my friend bring me a bottle from NJ on her last visit.  Pure Heaven!  I thought I was a little girl again!  She now brings me a couple of bottles each time she comes to PA.  You don't know what you're missing until you use U-Bet chocolate for an New York Egg Cream!!!!!

review/text: An eggcream made with Fox's U-Bet...pure bliss! Nothing else even comes close. One sip and I am six years old and back in Brooklyn. Which considering I am pushing 50 and living in North Carolina is no small feat. Got me through law school!

review/summary: The BEST chocolate syrup!
review/text: I heard of Fox's chocolate syrup in a discussion about the best chocolate syrup.  I was on a cruise and our dining companions were discussing the merits of various chocolate syrups when one of them remarked about Fox's.<br />I told them I was partial to Bosco, the one I grew up with, but couldn't find where we live. She offered to send me a jar of Fox's when we returned to our respective homes.  She sent it, I loved it and so when the jar ran out, I ordered more.  Thank you!

review/summary: U Bet It's The Best
review/text: This is the best chacolate,I order it on line every couple months. My husband grew up in the Bronx's and he loves to make egg cream's with it, just like he had at the soda shops. You can not get this brand in Pennsylvania so the postage is worth it,if we ever make a trip to New York I will buy him a case. He's been dying for a knish!!! So maybe we be making a trip soon.

review/summary: just okay, nothing spectacular
review/text: I bought this product for chocolate milk.  I found it neither better, nor worse than any old store-brand chocolate syrup.  It's perfectly acceptable but not worth the huge online markup.  I think a lot of regional nostalgia is driving the raving 5 star reviews.

review/summary: Fox's U-Bet is the BEST
review/text: You can believe what everyone here is saying....for an Egg Cream, Fox's U-Bet is the BEST.  I have never been to New York - but - there is a soda fountain located at the Beach Club Hotel in Disney World which I have visited "many" times and on their menu they have the "Original New York Egg Cream" and the taste cannot be duplicated with any syrup other than Fox's U-Bet.  You can make a good egg cream with just about any chocolate syrup, but if you want it to taste like the ones you get at a soda fountain "this" is the syrup you need.  And it's sooooo easy to make.  I've been trying for years to make an egg cream at home that tastes like the ones I get at Disney World and I am finally able to do it.  There's just something about this syrup - the taste is unique - and it can't be beat.  You won't be sorry if you order it because it's good just to put on top of ice cream too!

review/summary: The Original "egg cream" must have
review/text: This is 'the one.' Being a born and bred Brooklyn girl, still living in NY, and having attended the 1964 world's fair where this supposedly originated, I am all over this.  I remember going to the local 'soda fountain' as a young girl sitting at the counter and ordering egg creams with friends. I didn't realize then it was a "New York thing."  It's even waistline friendly to make; 1/4" of choc. in a glass, then add 3/4" of whole milk above that, then add up to a cup of seltzer. Mix vigorously to froth and drink. You can kick this up a notch by making what my dad always called a "black and white" ice cream soda.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to your chocolate egg cream...although that will add a few more calories!  This is sold in some but not all grocery stores at under $2.50; so if you can't find it, you can buy it here--albeit at a bit more cost.

review/text: The syrup was a big hit.  Unfortunately,it cost 3 times as much to ship as the actual price of the product so won't get it again unless shipping becomes cheaper.

review/summary: need a real seltzer bottle
review/text: After living in New York most of my life (50 years)my wife and I moved to Maine, there are only three things from N.Y. that I'm having a tough time living without. good pizza, good Italian bread and Egg Creams, I have been going back to the city for these things for ten years now to get my fix, It looks like I'll never get the pizza or real italian bread up here so I'll have to live with that, but I pick up the U-Bets in the city so I can make egg-creams except seltzer in a store bottle doesn't compare to the real pressurized seltzer bottles, somebody tell me where I can get a real seltzer bottle - PLEASE

review/summary: Seeking a West Coast egg cream
review/text: Good stuff, I got it to make egg creams and find it good for everything else you'd use chocolate syrup for. Reminds me of Hershey's, but Brooklyn egg cream die-hards say this is the ONLY one to use. It's good, tastes like chocolate syrup, nothing strange or different about it.
