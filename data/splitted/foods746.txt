review/summary: Good coffee poor shipping
review/text: This product arrived with several of the items damaged in shipping.  The coffee was very good with robust flavor and slightly acidic.  Because of the poor condition of the coffee when it arrived, not all the cups were usable. I found this coffee was best suited for  morning.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Came quickly (a couple of days), and is exactly what it's supposed to be - Starbucks Sumatra. We started using a K-cup machine in our office and, being a self-proclaimed coffee snob, I wasn't so sure I would like it. These Sumatra K-cups aren't QUITE the same as my French press or even what  you get when you go to Starbucks. But, it's good coffee, cheaper than Starbucks or even the grocery store, and came right away. I'll be ordering again soon.

review/summary: Simply the best K-Cup made
review/text: If you're like me and like to try out every single K-Cup that comes out, you know a few things about them:<br /><br />1. If they don't say "Extra Bold," they're terrible<br />2. The coffee always looks and feels a little "flat."<br />3. It's easier than drip, but never better<br /><br />This Starbucks Sumatra K-cup, though, rocks. You see it right away as the coffee comes out with a nice foamy top. Then it tastes great, with or without milk. It doesn't quite taste like a "freshly" brewed Sumatra, but it's as close to real coffee as the K-cup gets.

review/summary: Moldy and rancid brew (evaluated over a year's time)
review/text: I often find the Starbucks K cups yield a moldy and rancid tasting brew. We have tried an assortment of Starbucks K cups flavors obtained at numerous outlets over the last year. It feels like this is a secondary (or even tertiary) market for Starbucks beans that don't make the grade. Or possibly Starbucks has production/storage/transportation issues when bringing the Starbucks K cups to market. It is a ding to the brand. Luckily, I am a devout Starbucks follower, so I will stick to their more proven bags of beans and grinds.

I am so glad I found you in amazon.  I looked around my town for the product  which I have been using for years but the store that used to sell it  is out of business so I was unable to continue using it and missed it so much.  Of course the price is amazingly affordable thru amazon. so I wouldn't go back to any local store to buy it anymore since you offer it at a very affordable price better than what I used to get it local.  Thank YOU again.

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

review/text: Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

review/text: I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/summary: AESTHETICALLY PLEASING~~~~SPRINKLES!
review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/text: I've been drinking the Kool-Aid singles for over a year now, thinking that there wasn't a good alternative.  D'oh!<br /><br />I just tried Hawaiian Punch and like them a lot more as they just have more flavor -- in the case of both the regular-sugar and diet versions -- and less diet sweetener weird aftertaste -- in the case of the diet versions.<br /><br />As I said in my Hawaiian Punch review, I think the difference is the Citric Acid that HP uses, versus Kool-Aid's use of Maltic Acid.  Even if that's not the cause, truth is that I found the HP packets more flavorful.<br /><br />THE SKINNY:::<br />Regular you-add-the-sugar Kool-Aid packets are superior to the On-the-Go packets.<br /><br />Hawaiian Punch packets are superior to these packets.<br /><br />Not that these are evil or anything -- I still buy them for the kids when on sale -- just that there are better choices.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/text: I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant.  The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.  Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US.  I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing.

review/summary: Best Licorice Ever!
review/text: I was given a sample of this licorice from a friend who bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  With so many of the standard brands having little flavor, this was an immediate standout.  I have only tried the strawberry flavor, but it has a rich taste, and is a "soft" but still good and chewy licorice.  I love it.  When it wasn't available at Bed Bath, and Beyond, I found it on Amazon, and of course, it is considerably less expensive.  The only downside is that you must buy 12 6 ounce packages at once.  For me, that's not really a problem.

review/text: Lucky Country Licorice, black cherry 16 oz tubs (pack of 4)... This candy is the best I have ever tasted, my last order was my third (3rd), it is realy good and may be habit forming to your tast buds.<br /><br />There are several items to choose from, which can be confusing. The best value is the 4-16oz tubs,4 lbs total vs the 1.5 pound package, they are both the same price. I found this to be wrong, on the part of Amazon to allow this to happen. I did not send the 1.5 lbs bag back, it wasn't worth my time, and I do like the candy...<br /><br />I live in Gainesville FL, not Zoe KY.

Lucky Country is sometimes sold at Walmart (Black only) and used to be found at Costco....but is generally difficult to find.  Amazon has a great selection!

review/text: this candy was ok, but it had a different taste than the one we had previously bought at Costco, even though it was supposed to be the same flavor. But, the one in Costco said "new improved recipe" perhaps this one was the old recipe. I was disapointed. But the quality of the candy was fine. Just not the same as the one I already had. So, this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast.This candy was a brighter red color, and not as soft. However, this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor.

review/text: The first sip taste weird, then after that it taste like strawberries and raspberries with nice vanilla undertones. I classify it as semi - sweet, the food editor at my paper thought it was very sweet like preserves.Really good with grilled food,cheddar cheese and those hershey with almonds bars. It brings out all the individual flavors of whatever you are eating. It is really good on a picnic. You don't need a corkscrew, just take the plastic off and give it a couple good twists and your done.It is really hard to find, though. Two stores told me they have been waiting 3 months to get there shipment because the warehouse is out. Another manager seriously told me this wine is frowned upon in the world of wine and only lightweights and only low class people drink it. Whatever,she is full of it. Because this older couple really enjoyed it when I sent it to them in Florida. And they happen to be serious wine people.

review/summary: not bad
review/text: I tried this product in my pursuit of the best seaweed snack for flavor and price.  This one rated higher than some, but still not the best.  First, the flavor is ok, not too fishy, and the texture while thicker than some, and a little chewy, isn't bad.  The packaging consists of 80 strips to a jar, which is convenient and you get 6 jars to an order, so the cost isn't bad.  the calories are good, you get 10 pieces to a serving, a good size and it only has 10 calories.  So 1 calorie per piece w/no fat is great.  As far as carbs go, there is less than 1 carb per 10 piece serving.  Can't beat that.  Some seaweed snacks have a carb per piece.  Overall this isn't bad, but it's still not great.  Perhaps another flavor would be better.  While some seaweed snacks are so bad, I'd never try another flavor, this one is worth checking out a little more.

review/summary: Rock hard marshmallows bring this snack down
review/text: I love Smores, the combination of chocolate, marshmallows and graham crackers are outstanding. I also love Emerald nuts, so when I saw this at my local grocer, I had to try them.  Right away, the biggest problem with this snack is the marshmallows, if you can even call them that.  The marshmallows look like erasers from a pencil, and they are as hard as a rock.  I am not exagerrating, I nearly broke a tooth the first time I tried to bite one.  Are they stale?  Expiration date says September of 2012. I am not sure, maybe I got a bad package of these.  I am hesitant to buy another box.  The rest of the snack mix is fine, the cocoa walnuts, honey roasted peanuts, m&ms, graham chunks and oat clusters all tasted as they should.  But the most important part of the "smores", the marshmallows, was a major letdown.

review/summary: A great way to start the day!
review/text: This oatmeal is not only portable and handy, it tastes great! The apple bits add lots of flavor and are not too sweet as to overpower the oatmeal itself. The servings portion is just right. I've tried all three flavors of the Quaker Express, baked apple, maple, and cinnabon. These tie with the maple for taste and consistency. The cinnabon is a little too sweet for me, but I recommend you give them a try and make your own decision. They are all very easy to prepare. Just remove the top, fill the cup to the indicated water line, and zap in the microwave for 1:15. Perfect every time! Great for a quick breakfast or office snack, and healthy too!

review/summary: meh... not a fave, prefer the other blonde
review/text: When Starbucks came out with the "blonde" roasts, I got pretty excited because I prefer lighter roasts (as do 40% of coffee drinkers, according to the barista at the store)... light roasts are a little earthier, not as burnt tasting.  So I scored a bag each of the Willow and Veranda.<br /><br />This one, the Veranda, didn't do a lot for us.  Subjectively speaking, it was so smooth it was boring... it had no snap, and was kind of mixed and mushy, not a definitive flavor.  It's supposed to have "delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts" - really?  We missed that.<br /><br />On the other hand, we really liked the Willow, which had a brighter citrus-y note and was more flavorful.  The taste was (for lack of better words) clear, defined.  You buy a light roast to taste the bean, not the roast.  The Willow was flavorful, not acidy, and had a clean finish.<br /><br />Your tastes may vary, but if you like a snappy light roast, or a "breakfast roast" the Veranda probably won't be your pick, but do try the Willow.

review/summary: Soft as a Spring Day
review/text: .<br /><br />Recently on a relaxing vacation, I discovered that I had neglected to bring my favorite coffee.  Although I usually avoid buying coffee in a supermarket, I was stuck.  So I shopped a local grocery store to purchase enough coffee for my vacation.  I looked for a Kona blend with a higher percentage Kona than I usually find without luck.  Then I spotted this Starbucks blend that I have seen advertized and decided to try it.<br /><br />Starbucks Blonde Veranda coffee is a light roast coffee that is advertized as having lighter body and mellow favors.  Starbucks claims that roasting for less time frees "nuances" of cocoa and toasted nuts.<br /><br />Not as sharp and energetic as my favorite dark roasts, yet still flavorful.  Blonde Veranda Blend is soft and gentle like cool drink on a summers day.<br /><br />I enjoyed this experience and recommend Starbucks Blonde Veranda Blend for those who like light roast coffee, and maybe, for those who love dark roast, as an occasional treat.

review/summary: Do Blondes have more fun?
review/text: I like coffee so dark that "light cannot escape its surface." (To paraphrase a Simpsons line.) However, I did get a bag of Veranda Blend and drank it for a solid 2 weeks. It is very sweet-flavored, not very bitter but there is a note of "woodiness" to the coffee. It even can stand up to milk and sugar, though I really think it is best drunk black.<br /><br />If you do not like that typical burnt flavor in Seattle-type roasts, you may well enjoy this blend. It is definitely a blonde. For those who like donut-shop blends, this is rather similar but I find it a bit less acid. And it has none of the burnt flavor for which dark roast is criticized.<br /><br />I just got a new bag of coffee-FRENCH ROAST. Light is not escaping its surface. You know where I fall on the spectrum of coffee roasts. Dark, darker, DARKEST. My fling with a Blonde is over. I'm back to my brunette roots.

review/text: I am not the type of person who wants her coffee to bite her back as she sips.  I want to simply enjoy the flavor.  I found this cup of coffee to be very nice.  I would have liked a touch more robustness, as it lacking a bit in flavor (which is why I am giving it 4 stars).  It isn't bitter.  It isn't harsh.  It doesn't taste burnt. I don't have to wince while I drink it, and to me, that is something.  I appreciate a lighter roast.  It's a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: THE BEST STARBUCKS BLEND...PERIOD
review/text: I am a Coffee addict...I admit..as such, I spent much time from deception to deception at the coffee ally, hoping not to waste my well-earned money on yet another bitter coffee blend...and then I found VERANDA..simply awesome...smooth, mild yet tasty and powerful flavor and aroma. I like strong coffees, but it took me years to realize that strong and extra toasted don't mean the same. Less water? more powder? not really, just the perfect blend and there is not much to it. after all, give the blondes a try, it may be the smartest decision after all!! PD: Bear in mind before judging a coffee product that the coffee maker and the water used DOES make a difference too. By the way: veranda blends are becoming more difficult to find, hope they don't go off the market, it  would be a shame.

review/summary: Very Weak/ No Substance
review/text: I purchased the Veranda Blonde at my local Starbucks because they were offering it at a good sale (1 lb for $9.98).  Nasty, weak, and practically tasteless.  I prefer light coffees to most others -- -- don't do the dark coffees at all and only a few of the medium ones (like House Blends).  I like the other light coffees that Starbucks and Seattle's Best offer, but this brew has absolutely no substance.  Because I paid for it, I'm going to keep drinking it until it's gone, but never again.  Weak.

review/summary: Finally, a coffee with a focus on flavor.
review/text: I have always felt that Starbucks' coffee was too strong, until now.  I love this new blonde roast.  It focuses on flavor rather than strength.  If you need the bragging rights for strong coffee, you will need to stay with Starbucks original blends.  However, if you really want a good tasting coffee, I recommend this one.<br /><br />Allow me to say, that I had always thought Mc Donald's regular brew beat anything Starbucks had to offer.  My mind might be changing on that now.

It doesn't taste anything like coffee (especially not the coffees served in a fine restaurant to which it was compared by another reviewer).

When I found this dried lime I thought I would give it a try.<br />It is great.  Easy to use and always on hand.  Takes a very small amount to add the finishing touch to a lot of Latin recipies and others as well.  Showed this to my friend in Australia and she ordered some too.  Plus some of the Real Lemon as well.<br />If you need the flavor of fresh limes and don't want to keep them on hand.  Try this True Lime Shaker.  I would/recommend it to anyone, it's the perfect solution.

It made all the difference in the world. I now enjoy water! When I found the Shakers on Amazon, I started ordering them. I keep a large gallon container of water with True Lime in my refrigerator at all times. My guests also love the flavoring and a side benefit is that it is healthy. For me, water is now a pleasure to drink due to True Lime. The amount I use is geared to my taste. That is one of the benefits of using the Shaker,you are able to use measuring spoons.

review/summary: This Product works So BUY IT.
review/text: The title says it all. Before I bought this product, I honestly didn't think it would work but I said hey I would give it a try since other people gave it good reviews on Amazon. I picked it up at my local grocery store. The tea taste REALLY good. It is just a regular tasting mint tea. The box says the product works in 6-8 hours. I found this NOT to be true but the product DOES work. I took the tea at around 4pm in the afternoon (although it tells you to take it at bedtime) and for me It didn't work until around 9am the next day. So for me it took around 17 hours to work but it will probably be different for everybody. Just make sure you have access to a toilet. You may or may not experience some "SLIGHT" cramping for an hour before of after your restroom break. Notice I said Slight not horrible or unbearable. This tea is in my opinion better than OTC products such as Miralax. Like I said I highly recommend this product because let's face it I wouldn't waste my time writing a review for a product that I didn't either really like or really hate. You can order it at Amazon or pick it up at Walmart or Meijer.

I recently gave up red meat and it caused me to skip almost 3 days before I could go... Anyway, this tea is amazing. I drink it at night around 8pm and I have a bowel movement the next morning around 7:30am. It has allowed me to loose 3 pounds this past week. :) I am quite addicted to this now. I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing but in any case, it works! I have also tried the Detox tea and it does the same for me. I just prefer the taste of this tea better. Great purchase! Way less expensive on Amazon than in the local stores. About a 40% savings.

I suffer from diverticulitis and IBS (good times)and discovered this tea as a great way to keep things moving. The problem is the tea tastes so good I often drink it for pleasure too and sometimes I forget that I need to not overdo it. As I sit here drinking this tea tonight I can tell you the flavor is a very smooth warm taste with a slightly mintyish after taste. I sweeten mine with agave nectar and it is such a flavorful tea that I can't stop boasting about it. Get some for yourself. You won't be disappointed. When its time for the effects to kick in its natural and not crampy like many I have tried in the past. This is a pain free tasty solution to getting regular :-)
