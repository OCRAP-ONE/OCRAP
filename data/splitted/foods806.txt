review/summary: Not a very strong bacon flavor
review/text: This Bacon Salt tastes more like the paprika that's in it than it does like bacon. I guess I was expecting something like ground up Bac O's, with a real bacon flavor even though it's vegetarian. The taste isn't bad, it's salty, but you have to use a really lot of it on anything to have the bacon flavor come through. And when you use too much, it's just too salty.<br /><br />I wanted something I could put on popcorn or on spinach salad or vegetables. This didn't taste great on any of them. I have a smoked paprika seasoning by another company that tastes more like bacon than this does.<br /><br />I think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one. The concept is good, but the end result is not. I'm going to cancel my order for the jalapeno version based on this.<br /><br />Update - 8/6/12 - I just realized that I still have about 3/4 of this bacon salt in my cupboard. I guess that's a good indicator of how much I liked it.

review/summary: It's all relative
review/text: Bacon Salt isn't a terrible food additive standing alone.  To my mind, however, nothing that costs over two dollars -- I paid $5 for a little bottle -- should contain both corn syrup *and* trans fats.  (Why does a spice need fat?)  I probably shouldn't have paid for it, but I heard rave reviews and was sucked in by the prospect of making my spinach salad taste like hot, salty, fatty pork.  For the money, I can't say it's worth the price.<br /><br />Also, it's a major "caker."  Don't use it for a month, and you've got a brick of barbecue potato chip seasoning.

review/summary: Flavor okay - but not gluten free!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IHWDX6">J&D's Original Bacon Salt 16-Ounce Bottle</a> I purchased the large bottle of this, and used it a few times. It is what I would say so-so on the bacon flavor, but okay. However, my daughter read the ingredients, and we found that is has wheat in it, which is a no-no for gluten free diets. Bacon salt speaks to me of bacon flavored salt, not something made with wheat. Ergo, most of the bottle is in my cupboard, and I will not be re-ordering. Disappointed, because who doesn't love bacon?

review/summary: Excellent food for dogs who need lower protein then orijen
review/text: Acana is manufactured by a canadian company that is also a maker or orijen, but its designated for dogs who dont do well on high protein, which was a case with my dog, hes moderately active 3 year old weim, but was putting on weight on orijen, so this was a great addition to his diet. He loves the taste just the same and I've had no issues with it, glossy coat, lots of energy, no ear or eye infections. Plus I like that fact thats they use free range chickens which appeals to my ethical side, since I only buy organic and free range myself.

review/summary: Great Food!
review/text: We have tried MANY different foods trying to find a food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but gave our dogs the proper nutrition they needed as well as the health benefits they deserved. We have a dog with super bad allergies and this food hasn't gave us any issues. We have tried california natural (couldn't digest the rice), organics (had an allergy to an ingredient) and then taste of the wild (feed over 15 lbs a week between 2 medium sized dogs!) and now we are on acana and this food is worth it! You feed less because it has higher nutrient values therefore they poop less and you save money, and our vet says they are some of the healthiest dogs they see! Acana is well worth the money, it is made from Orijen which is a very good company!

review/summary: Highly rated - and my keeshonden love it!
review/text: I have two 6-year-old rescue keeshonden to which I feed a grain-free diet. The three grain-free Acana varieties are the major portion of their food rotation.  One of my two has a delicate constitution and cannot handle the foods with the highest level of protein.  However, they both do extremely well on the moderate-protein Acana.  Other foods with which they have had success are Canidae, Instinct, Barking at the Moon, and Wellness Core. But for the past several months, it has all been Acana.  Acana is highly-rated by dog food rating organizations.  It is made by Champion Pet Foods in Canada, which also makes Orijen.  Champion uses local sources for their ingredients - nothing from China or other questionable areas.  Sometimes I think my dogs eat better than I do!

review/summary: Fantastic for Border Collie
review/text: I purchased this after the Taste of the Wild recall. My dog is a 2 year old Border Collie, extremely active and sensitive to high protein foods. We have done Orijen before, but the protein levels brought out aggression in him and he put on a bit of weight despite lack of change in amount or exercise (he runs on average 8 miles/day). I am extremely happy with this food and do not plan to switch! It is pricey, but having him on grain free means our only vet visits are the annual check up. He is extremely happy and friendly on Acana, his coat looks great (shiny, very little shedding), and his breath has even improved since eating TotW. We will be feeding only Acana from now on!

review/summary: Terrific dog food
review/text: The 5 star review is totally accurate. This is an expensive food, for some that might be an issue. But if you can work out the cost factor, all I can say is my dog loves this and he no longer bites his paws. We had huge issues with his paw biting for a long time, even when we had him on California natural. It seemed like nothing we did worked, until we switched to Acana. He's happy now, and he is super excited to get his food. And I mean like way too excited, he will quickly pace back and forth and whine until he gets it.

review/summary: Let your dogs be the judge!
review/text: I have two Cockapoos age 8 and 6 and have always gone out of my way to find the best rated healthy dog foods for them.  Unfortunately they  have never been crazy about any of the many brands I have tried which to name a few  have been Evanger's, Solid Gold, Taste of the Wild.  They would eat a few bites and leave the bowl or maybe not even eat a few bites but turn their noses up.<br />We are now on our second bag of Acana and I can honestly say that when the food is put out into each of their bowls there is no walking away until the bowls have been emptied.  Great!  Finally found one they love!  I think the first bag was the Pacifica and they seem to like the Wild Prairie the best.  I worry about heavy metals in fish these days so I think I'll stick with Wild Prairie for a while.

review/summary: Acana Prairie is hard to find but the best Dog Food
review/text: I have 3 dogs and I used to feed them Ultra dog food. My 6 yr old rescue lab mix was eating it but would throw up often. I read reviews for Acana and Origen. I first switched to the high protein Origen with chicken and it made my dogs very gassy. I switched to Acana Prairie which is also with chicken and they LOVE THIS FOOD. Even my fussy Papillon loves it. The other 2 wipe their bowls clean. It is hard to find and a little pricy so I just signed up for automatic deliveries. This is a great dog food!

review/summary: Good for my cats!
review/text: I love my cats. For many years I fed them the cheaper brands of cat food.  It was not until I had a cat diagnosed with heart disease that I found out more information about feline nutrition.  Basically, protein is very important (it's what they would be eating if they were in the wild) and grains can be hard for them to digest.  Since that time, I've tried to do better in making sure they get the proper nutrition to keep them as healthy as possible.<br /><br />Science Diet has a new line of cat food available called Ideal Balance.  It features fresh chicken as the first ingredient, fruits and veggies as secondary ingredients and is free of corn, artificial flavors and preservatives.  It is conveniently available in the Kitten, Adult and Mature Adult varieties.<br /><br />When I gave my cats this dry food, they enthusiastically ate it. This is actually nothing new. They do that with all cat food. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that as the days went by and they continued eating the food, there was less throwing up from one of our cats who apparently has a sensitive stomach.  I have no doubt the switching of brands is what caused her throwing up to lessen.  Although Science Diet does cost more than other brands you can find in the big box stores, the higher price is worth it to be able to give my cats good nutrition.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a bag of Science Diet Ideal Balance Cat Food free via BzzAgent. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

review/text: Torani's" Sugar Free Vanilla Flavor Syrup", is a nice way to add a little variety to your coffee, without having to run out to a Starbuck's for a sugar free Vanilla Latte.. As I mentioned in the title, there are no calories, fats, carbs or sugars. The taste is very sweet and vanillery, and you can use it in anything you want to add a little variety or flavor. I like it in my Pellegrino. Makes a nice Vanilla Soda. In my coffee, I found I did not have to add anything else. The syrup was good enough and tasty enough on it's own.I use it whenever, I get a sweet tooth, to get me past a craving for something with more calories involved.<br /><br />It is sweetened with "Splenda", and if you are not used to using Sugar substitutes, you may not like the little bit of an after taste it leaves.<br /><br />Ingrediants as listed are: Water, Vanilla Extract,other natural flavors, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Benzoate(there are 5 mg sodium listed on the label), Citric Acid,Xanthan Gum,Sucralose(the Splenda), Acesulfame Potassium.<br /><br />It's a bargain for the 750 ml, sold here.I paid almost as much for 375ml at my local grocery store. You'll probably use about two tablespoons per drink.(more or less) You'll get your money's worth. Add it to anything you want, hot chocolate, iced tea, etc. Maybe with the holiday's coming, it would be a nice change in other beverages as well. It is also sold with sugar added,and there are several other flavors with or without sugar, just click on other products by Torani at top of page. .<br /><br />Cheers....Laurie

review/summary: Great Pasta - Good price with subscribe and save
review/text: Product Quality: De Cecco pasta is the best widely available commercial pasta.  If you want better pasta, you'll pay through the nose or you'll make it yourself. It is a step up from Barilla (which does not make Orecchiette), and cooks up a little differently.  It tends to be a bit creamier without loosing its firmness.  Orecchiette is a wonderful summer pasta that is perfect with broccoli and sausage.<br /><br />Value: For some reason, the De Cecco pastas are all different prices.  This one is the least expensive and is one of my favorites.  Amazon's price (as of April 2011) is considerably cheaper than the grocery store's non-sale price, and slightly less expensive than the on-sale price.<br /><br />Packaging: There is a lot of plastic and a cardboard backing preventing the pasta from shattering during shipping.  I'm glad to have in tact pasta so I don't mind too much.  The five-pack is shipped in a box that is too large for it adding another layer of waste.  I suspect that the packaging could be reduced without any increase in breakage.

review/text: i bought this pasta after reading the reviews -- something different from sketti  -  i made a white sauce, added some sauteed red onions, used pink salt, some freshly ground pepper, about a half pound of shrimp, a can of organic shrooms,about a tablespoon of garlic/red pepper spice, and this turned out to be a beautiful delicious dish.  i can tell i will be using this pasta regularly.  i like the shape, the creaminess as mentioned by another and how my own creativity will be in play as i think of new ways to use it; i got plenty of time now.  thanks for making it available amazon.  and the s&s price is affordable for anyone.

review/summary: My favorite boxed pasta
review/text: The delivery man laughed when he shook the box and I told him it was "macaroni" but, oh, yes, these are worth ordering online.  They are toothsome and flavorful.  I was reminded how flavorful recently when I mixed in with these the last of a box of another pasta.  In the bowl, the differences were obvious.  Compared to these, the other pasta was mushy and flavorless.<br /><br />An added bonus?  When I did the math and with free Prime shipping, these were the same price they would be in the supermarket if we could get them here.

review/summary: My Fav Pasta!
review/text: I originally learned of this shape through a dish at Olive Garden, we rarely eat there anymore, not as much tolerance for chain restaurants, but I love orecchiette for use with pesto. It is a fantastic little "dish or shell" to hold a little pesto, also great with wine sauces. I buy this on amazon not so much for price savings but because typical grocery stores (non specialty) in this area don't tend to carry this.

review/summary: Good Enough to Eat
review/text: We love De Cecco pasta, but our local grocery chain charges a preventative amount for it. We can get it for a reasonable price through Amazon, and get a bunch of it at once. No downside. So far, we haven't found a comparable pasta, especially for the price, and we eat a ton of the stuff. Perfect bite, perfect taste... if I had a gripe, I'd say that you have to cook it for one minute less than the recommended al dente time in order to get it properly al dente, but once you know that, you're golden. I might also say that the pieces stick together quickly once they're drained, but every piece is cooked, and I think that's a fault of the shape, not the company.

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

I add stock and vegetables, seafood....<br />We like all 3 soups but I think the cream of asparagus is my favorite. The soup comes out very smooth and creamy and the taste is great. I added fresh asparagus along with other vegetables but you don't have to.<br />You do get 48 packages - it would almost be good to split it with somebody - but it really is very good, does not taste like a package or can soup at all. If I ever run out of the supply I bought, I'll buy it again....

review/summary: The phrase "this tastes like feet" comes to mind
review/text: I've been very happy with the majority of the Earth's Best products, but the peas are TERRIBLE.  I am amazed that this received any positive reviews.  I have never seen my 1-year old son refuse a food as violently as he did these peas.  He immediately spat out the first spoonful of these peas and looked at me indignantly, as if to say, "What kind of garbage are you feeding me?"  He then went on to turn his head to one side, refused to eat for the rest of the meal, and start struggling to get out of the high chair.  Since he's generally a good eater with a healthy appetite (and he wasn't sick), I was puzzled by this response and tried the peas myself.  I nearly gagged, and tipped over MY chair in my haste to expunge these peas.  My son just watched me spit out these peas and grinned, as if to say, "See - I told you they were BAD!"<br /><br />If you do decide to go ahead and buy these peas, try them yourself first before subjecting a poor innocent child to them!  I will NEVER give my child this product again.

Not since chewing Fruit Strips gum as a child, can I remember a gum losing flavor this quickly.  You maybe get 5-10 minutes of flavor and after that it's like chewing rubber.<br /><br />The packaging is another annoyance it's a foil blister pack with a cardboard sleeve containing nine pieces of gum.  It's a waste of packaging if you consider the whole thing could have been put in a Mentos-like package.<br /><br />I made the mistake of buying a 3 pack.  If you must, go with a single pack.  It will be enough to turn you off.

review/text: Ricotta cheese is awesome when placed in lasagna.  True story- a few months ago my dad made a huge tray of lasagna for his girlfriend and myself, and he literally dumped the entire container of ricotta in the tray.  I thought it was too much but didn't say anything.  I didn't dare question my dad's experience in cooking for years and years (over 30 to be exact) at several different restaurants.  Anyway the cheese gave off a VERY strong taste, and in fact, it was the *only* thing we tasted in the lasagna, lol.  The sauce, other cheese varieties and everything else practically disappeared.  Still, I love the taste of ricotta cheese enough that I really would have trouble complaining about an abundance of it.  I find it's quite delicious.  Just be warned- use it accordingly and not the entire container (or in this case, bag) in one go, haha.

review/summary: Found my ideal recovery drink
review/text: This is as close to a perfect sports drink as I can find.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* When used at the recommendation concentration the solution is 7% carbohydrate. Studies have shown 7-8% is ideal for gastric emptying and absorption rates. Many drinks are much sweeter, which makes the gut draw water from muscles to dilute the mixture. Thankfully that is not the case here.<br />* It mixes very well, and tastes great.<br />* Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Only one: it has 200% RDA of vitamin C per serving. Since about 2g of vitamin C in a day is the safe upper limit, that puts a limit on how much you can drink in very long activities.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* Contains glutamine and BCAAs (2mg per serving). If you have an energy deficit, which you almost certainly will when you drink this, they will probably just be burned as energy.<br /><br />Other drinks all seem to be either a) expensive, b) more sweet than they should be, c) mix poorly and/or taste terrible, or d) full of protein that is not appropriate during or immediately after a workout. I won't be using anything else now that I have found this.

review/summary: does what it's supposed to do
review/text: OK I can say I've used Infinit, Accelerade, Gatorade, Hammer and Powerade. This is by far the best for me. Others were either real thick and sat in my stomach, did nothing for me or made me a little nauseas or gave me gas. EFS is light and easy to digest, does what it's designed to do and gives me more energy and fuel to push myself harder than if I drank water alone. Also I don't cramp up,or not nearly as much which is a big issue for me on really hard rides or ride and run days. And it even tastes better than all of the others as well. I get the orange and mix some crystal lite with it for more flavor and a little caffiene.

review/summary: Really helped prevent cramps
review/text: I have had lots of problems with cramping when riding hard despite using lots of different products. My coach had me try EFS and it has made a big difference for me. I have tried both the fruit punch and the grape flavor and the grape flavor is the best for me. No stomach issues, great subtle flavor, and it works reduce/eliminate cramps.

review/summary: The better electrolyte drink mix
review/text: I really like this product.  The electrolyte works well as advertised.  For a new cyclist, I can feel an immediate improvement on replenishing electrolytes when I drink this.  After some serious research, I have to agree that this is one of the better electrolyte drinks out there.<br /><br />Downside: a bit expensive; a bit on the sweet side which gives some people diarrhea; you need to drink a whole bottle for all those electrolytes added to your body so it may not work as well for some.

review/text: I suffer from acid reflux and can not take any solids in on the bike.  I also suffer from cramps in heat and "over doing it".  Last year, I did my first 140.6, and used EFS and Carbo Pro mixture, along with the EFS gels.<br /><br />The EFS drink goes down very easy and does not have any HFCS like others.  It also has tons of electrolytes and tastes good too!  Carbo Pro went in and mixed great with it.  Highly recommend.

review/text: The product is great for endurance rides as it does not leave an after taste and the flavoring is light enough to give a hint of the taste.

review/summary: Not bad tasting
review/text: Since I have only been buying this in Orange it's not fair to compare with other drinks besides Gatorade.<br />The first several times it did take me a while to get use to the taste, but now, it's like drinking anything else.<br />Easy on the stomach.<br />I have went thru 4 tubs (25 servings each), BUT, you don't get 25 servings unless you have a small container bottle. I have to use 1 1/2 scoops for a 18 oz bottle. It does say 1 scoop for 12 oz.<br />I enjoy drinking th Orange flavor. Keep searching around for the best price like I do each time I reorder.<br />Usually I get it for $30.00 and sometime a bit under, and that's counting the shipping charge.

review/text: I am a 12 - 24 hr adventure racer.  Every race, after 3-4 hours of strenuous activity, I get leg cramps.  I was hoping the EFS would be my "silver bullet" to put this issue to rest.  I used it in a 12 hr race.  The label says you can mix it up to double strength if needed and I did.  I still cramped around the 3-4 hour time frame.  Pretty sure my case is on the extreme end of the cramping scale, as the guys I train with don't cramp in the races and we train very similarly.

These are just The Bomb mints.  Cinnamon goodness from the first rush of spice right down to the almost atomic fireball core.  No filler here!  I even wonder how they got so much cinnamon flavor into just that itty-bitty mint, but if you love spice, if you love the rush of heat, then these are simply the best.  Now I've gotta go back and see if I can find something at least vaguely similar.  If there's a few on a counter near you, then try it.

review/text: And that is no exagerration!  Roaring 40's Blue is a wonderful mixture of strength and subtlety.. it's almost impossible to guess what flavour is going to break through next.  It's superb on thin crackers and with a glass of good red wine. I tried this at a cheese tasting during the Adelaide Royal Show (in South Australia) and was immediately won over, as were the literally hundreds of people lined up to try it for themselves.  I'm of the opinion that once you've had King Island cheese, you never go back!  Try it for yourself!

review/text: This is a terrific blue cheese, from Australia of all places.  It leaves a strong, but delicious, aftertaste, with a bit of a bite.  The consistency is almost like gorgonzola dolce, that is, smooth and creamy, not at all crumbly.  For me, it has replaced all other blues, except I still prefer roquefort in a salad.  Highly recommended - it was a hit at a holiday party, in fact I had only a couple of thin slivers left over, from a full wheel.

review/summary: My dogs LOVE these, and I know they're healthy
review/text: We're very picky with our dogs' food, but we got caught up in the jerky recalls with tainted food from China. One of our dogs seemed lethargic until we stopped giving him that tainted jerky.<br /><br />We wanted something that they would love, and we tried these Innova bars. They love them more than their biscuits, which they had been getting since they were puppies. Amazon's price is good, and delivery is fast. They stay fresh in this bag, or you can take them out and put them in a sealed jar.<br /><br />From now on, we ONLY buy food made from pet food companies. No "high-end" brands that are actually owned by giant consumer product companies. Check who owns your "high-end" brand--you'd be surprised. They probably don't have your dogs' best interests at heart, but a lot of the smaller companies do. All they make is pet food. Not that they can't have trouble. Some reputable makers have had recalls at times, but you'll be doing your dogs a favor by staying with Innova and companies like it that only make pet food.

With the 12 lb bag, I save $22.  Plus with Amazon Prime the shipping was free, so it works out great (even if I paid for shipping though it'd still be saving me money).<br /><br />I really like this food for my cats, and plan to keep using it.

review/summary: Expensive - But great food
review/text: I'm usually the type of person to buy whatever is on sale to give to her cats. But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on. (Sometimes I get kinds that literally would be the size for a smallish dog and not a cat. They have problems eating it and the pieces fall everywhere.)<br /><br />I will continue to buy this kind as long as it remains available.

review/summary: An excellent, high-quality food
review/text: This is an excellent, high-quality cat food. If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Gonna be a lifetime customer!
review/text: I adopted my boy kitty (Boo) about a year and half ago and my girl kitty (Poxie) one and half months ago from the local pound. They both had a clean bill of health without any allergies or problems (other than the occasional hairball) but I started them on this brand after some reasearch because I wasn't happy about the nasties in the old food and how it left dye all around the water bowl (Boo = messy eater, he likes to pick out his food and it ends up all over the place).<br /><br />After a couple months of changing Boo's food, there was less bits of food being flung around and floating in his bowl, there wasn't a brown ring around his drinking fountain and there was even less fur in his foutain (granted, the latter may have more to do with the seasons and shedding).<br /><br />When I took Boo back to the vet about 6 months after changing the food, the Dr. mentioned that he was a bit iffy because it was werid to have fruit in cat food. He also said that he's noticed several cats that have kidney problems after years of eating Wellness (and checked to see if I was feeding them wet food as well - they eat Nutro Max pouches too. However, throughout the whole exam, he commented several times on how Boo's fur was very shiney, full and didn't have any flakes or dandruff like some of the other black cats he's seen.  At the end the Dr., somewhat jokeingly, said "Ok, if his coat is THIS nice, I have to look into this some more and change my mind about the brand!"<br /><br />Poxie was a scruffy looking girl and spent a couple months at the pound before we adopted her. She had just given birth to kittens before being placed for adoption and was spayed ASAP. She had her own room and didn't have to fight for food while at the pound, but she was on the thin side and her fur was dry and had a brittle feeling. She's been eating Wellness for about three weeks now and her coat has already settled down and is more sleek and silkier.<br /><br />So overall, notciable changes in both their coats (as a general indication of their health) and a huge improvement quality/ingredient wise compared to what they were fed at the pound. I have been recommending Wellness to everybody who askes me about my kitties!

review/summary: Cats' favorite
review/text: My cats have sampled almost every healthy food available in the U.S.A., and all 4 of them will eat this one! Before I learned about feline nutrition, I fed my cats dry food and poor quality canned food. Now they won't eat any good quality canned food, or raw diet, and they are addicted to dry food. I still feed them Fancy Feast canned food (it's the only wet food they will eat) and I am happy that I found a good quality dry food that they will eat! I've offered 4 different premium quality dry foods side by side, and the cats prefer this one! They won't touch most healthy foods, so Wellness must have a palatable formula. I recommend this food to anyone with a cat who insists on eating dry food and is finicky!

review/summary: Worth the expense!
review/text: Moses, my 8 year old cat, was having trouble with itching, dandruff, and excessive earwax accumulating in his ears.  His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).  This was never a problem before he started eating this brand, so beware.

review/summary: it's cat food...
review/text: My cat likes this food. An 11yr+, part Maine Coon, &  fussy as cats can be, she eats this happily. Even in preference to Wellness canned food which she detested. I like the product as it is high protein and grain-free. Still searching for the ideal wet food to accompany it.

review/summary: Amazing Food!  All Six Cats love it!
review/text: This is the FIRST food that all my cats eat and love.  I can't get enough of it!  I had a huge problem with feeding the cats, so much so that one of my kitties got Fatty Liver Disease which nearly killed him.  After syringe feeding him for 6-8 weeks, he turned to THIS FOOD!  We had just purchased it and he like the smell and taste.  He won't eat any wet food now, but I feel good that he's eating this (and I syringe him some wet food just in case - with some supplements for his liver.)<br /><br />The other cats are doing GREAT, and I recommend this food to anyone.

review/text: I bought this after doing some research. This food is very good for your cat. My cats coat is all smooth now. He is more active. This is what cats we designed to eat. Not that cheap crap with corn in it.

review/summary: Great Food !!!
review/text: At $34.99 for 12 pounds I did save gas money and tax. You might want to check PetSmart, Petco, PetSupermarket, etc before buying on Amazon.<br />The food itself is excellent! Our cats are doing great on Wellness Complete Health dry plus Wellness canned. Their coat has improved and they have more energy. There hasn't been any change in litter box odor. We've also noticed fewer hairballs and our "sensitive stomach" cat vomits less!!!

review/summary: seems healthy
review/text: What can I say, since I haven't tried it myself? The fat one likes it way too much and the skinny one doesn't like it enough. If I could find a food that produced the opposite effect, I would be pretty happy. I tried this after the local pet shop stopped carrying their last food, Royal Canin Siamese (which the skinny one went crazy for at first [she doesn't know that she's not Siamese]). This one is less expensive, and even more so on Amazon.

review/summary: My cat loves this catfood! It is his favorite :)
review/text: I highly suggest a regular "wellness" diet supplemented with wet cat food. My cat's fur has never been softer, his temperament so easy going, and energy-level so high! Highly recommend.

review/summary: Litter box smell could gag a skunk
review/text: Switched my non-diabetic (I have one diabetic on wet only for the past year) cat from EVO to Wellness Complete (blue bag) in an attempt to save $ while still providing good nutrition for the fur baby. Ever since starting the Wellness food his litter box has had the most foul odor I have ever smelled in a litter box. Visitors can definitely tell I have pets!! Heck, they probably think I'm secretly hoarding zoo animals. This hasn't been a problem before and I had really been hoping this was a temporary thing but we're almost three months into a bag and there's been no let up. We're finally getting to the last of the bag and I'm going to start switching him back to the EVO because I literally can't take it anymore. I'm quite frankly shocked that no one else has complained about this.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Pretty solid nutrition<br />Cat seems to really like the taste<br />Cheaper than other holistic brands<br /><br />CONs:<br />Twice a day it smells like raw sewage all through-out my house. No thanks!

review/summary: New to Wellness
review/text: So far, my cats appear to like this food. While I'm against feeding cats dry cat food, this food appears to be balanced in ways that other dry foods are not. From some reviews that I've read about this food, most people agree that it's a better quality dry food and made without many of the by-products. The only issue I have with it is the cost. Yep, it's much higher than others but I'd rather pay a higher cost and know that my kitties are getting a better quality food. Look forward to trying some of the wet food as well.
