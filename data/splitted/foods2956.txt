review/summary: much better than I expected
review/text: I ordered Erin Baker's fruit & nut cookies at a discounted price because Amazon said the item was near its sell-by date. I was nervous about doing so -- afraid I might have to scarf down a dozen cookies all at once because they were about to expire. But the cookies arrived at the beginning of September, and the expiration date isn't until Nov. 11. Plenty of time, especially since these cookies taste so good, they won't last long!<br />I haven't tried any other Erin Baker cookies, but I definitely recommend the Fruit & Nut flavor. They have a spicy aroma and a chewy, moist texture, with just the right amount of tender fruit. The density reminds me somewhat of an Odwalla bar, but without the overpowering soy taste of an Odwalla.<br />These cookies can serve as a meal replacement. They are filling, and with more nutrition than you might think (6 grams of protein). The only reason I didn't give these cookies five stars is that they're a bit higher in calories (290) than a typical granola bar or protein bar. But taste-wise, they're just about perfect.

review/summary: Yummy Yummy Good for Your Tummy! IMPORTANT! SEE FOLLOW-UP REVIEW
review/text: I am so addicted to these cookies! Love them! They are great for a meal substitute or snack .  Not too sweet-just right. They are good for you too.  What else could you want?  No more dessert store bought cookies for us.  One cookie and a glass of milk is pretty filling for me as the cookies are sizable. My son likes two at a time though. (Sometimes I do too!) We have disabilities in our home so 'easy' is a word we love. At first we tried the Morning Glory Cookies and loved those so ordered 4 more different kinds, caramel apple, banana nut, peanut butter with chocolate, fruit and nut . We all loved them all.  The Caramel Apple went first though. My son's favorites are caramel apple, peanut butter with chocolate and banana nut. Frozen we heat in microwave 25 seconds. You really must freeze these because they are all natural. Someone said it reminded them of fruitcake but I didn't think that.  I really like this one.  I like the texture of the nuts in it.  I want one right now but unfortunately we are out Darn it!  It is not one of my son's favorites but mine and my Mom's. Do not hesitate to try these in any flavor.  They are a bargain.  We are getting the automatic monthly shipping next month  which is even more of a bargain and will order probably 10 packages at least, for 3 people. I told you we love them!<br /><br />IMPORTANT FOLLOW-UP- I felt this was important to add.  I had not finished my test yet so did not mention it before. I have a rare bile duct disease from a "botched' surgery. I have to be very careful what I eat or I get terrible pains and cramping and am prone to getting pancreatitis.  The list of what I can eat is very short. I loved these so decided to eat mostly just the cookies for a week, if I could, without having any pains and still feel like I always do , which is really pretty awful.  I felt they are nutritious and I would drink LOTS of liquids with them as the fiber can be very constipating, and of course, take vitamins.  Not only did I feel better and had more energy than before but I had NO stomach pains at all.  I can't remember the last  time when I have gone a week without pains.  I expected some but there were none. I will say, I did not miss other foods either and actually craved these cookies.  I love sweets but have to be careful and these are enough sweet to satisfy me. My son brought a cake home and I found it to be almost sickeningly sweet and no nutritional value.  With the cookies It just feels like I am eating well and enjoying it immensely at the same time. (Oh, I was 'regular" as well).  These will continue to be a large part of my diet.  It is so wonderful to feel better, have more energy and not have the horrible pains. Now if I can afford to buy as many as I need and for my Mom and son!  I really need at least 5 cookies most days  (3 meals a day plus 2 snacks) if I eat nothing else . Actually the price is very affordable for most at about 1.00 a cookie and less if you get automatic ordering which I am going to do at the first of every month. I can't believe I just now heard of these on Amazon!  I am thankful to Erin for developing these cookies which are literally changing my life. God bless you Erin, and your business.

review/text: I bought Erin Baker's breakfast cookies for my teenage daughters who are in swim team and leave for practice early in the morning.  This made for a very convenient breakfast for them after their practice and morning workouts!  Paired with milk or a piece of fruit, this was definitely a filling and satisfying breakfast for them.<br /><br />We enjoy the moistness, density and great flavor of fruit and nut.  We have tried other flavors, but this one rates top of the list.  We also feel it's a healthy option for "on the run" mornings.<br />GIVE THEM A TRY!!!

review/summary: Breakfast cookies hit the spot!
review/text: I first tried these cookies years ago and loved them.  However, there was a problem with the nutritional information listed on the wrapper, and I learned that they were much higher in calories than I'd thought.  I stopped eating them and actually forgot all about them.  Recently I was getting coffee at the local mall and they had the cookies for sale.  I bought one and rediscovered how good they are.  They're moist & chewy, with large pieces of whatever fruit, nut or chocolate is in that particular flavor.  They're delicious right out of the wrapper or heated in the microwave for a few seconds.  They're pretty filling and definitely satisfy my craving for the occasional sweet.  I can eat them without feeling like I indulged in empty calories.  I have to say that my daughter doesn't care for them at all -- she says they taste "oat-y", like a horse treat!  I understand what she means, but I don't mind what I think of as the 'organic flavor'.<br /><br />I've purchased 3 different flavors: Chocolate Chunk Raisin, Fruit & Nut, and Double Chocolate Chunk Cherry (seasonal flavor).  They're all delicious!  Because they're high in calories, I reserve them for a special treat, usually as a bedtime snack.  I appreciate that there is no high fructose corn syrup in these cookies.  Obviously since they're individually packaged there is built-in portion control.  They're pricey, but in my opinion they're worth it.

review/summary: Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies
review/text: So far, I have tried caramel apple, fruit & nut, morning glory, and banana walnut flavers.  I have also ordered, (but not yet received) the pumpkin spice cookies.  All of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack.  The ingredients are wholesome, there is no high fructose corn syrup, and they have a good supply of protein & fiber to stave off hunger for several hours.  The caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest, but I really love all of the flavors.  Like other reviewers, I freeze them, and then microwave a cookie for 20 seconds when I am ready to eat it.  I find the cookies taste best warmed up.  Even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies, I think you get a lot of nutritional "value" with these.

review/text: but certainly good enough to put on Subscribe and Save.  They are a bit like a less dense fruitcake without the weird red and green "fruits". I didn't find these at all dry.  They are a good change of pace from the chocolate and the oatmeal varieties.  I don't use these just for breakfast.  With a glass of milk they make a good fast meal when I have no time for anything else. I do freeze and then heat in the microwave.  One caveat - don't eat too many of these (any of them) in succession.  They do have a real tendency to loosen things up if you know what I mean.

I've tried to get them to reorder it but they'd rather sell their own store brand.  I've tried every other popcorn salt I can find in the local stores but they're no good.  I'm glad to finally find it here on Amazon. I've used Jolly Time for nearly 10 years, so you can imagine how I stick to products I enjoy.

McCormick made a very similar product, but it was discontinued about five years ago so I switched to this.  I was horrified to discover this month that the Jolly Time product is now apparently discontinued, too.  If you love this product like I do, better get a case.  The great thing is, it's no more expensive here than it was in the grocery store and it doesn't spoil.  Load up, the other "buttery" products on the market are dreadful compared to this.

review/summary: Wonderful and a little goes a long way!!!!
review/text: I recently started eating popcorn as a healthy alternative to potato chips and other high calorie snacks. While grocery shopping, I found this seasoning with the popcorn and was hesitant to purchase it. I was on the fence because it is high in sodium. Being that it doesn't have any calories, I decided to try it. I was very surprised as well as pleased with the flavor of this seasoning. IMO it tastes just like the popcorn served at the theater sans the greasiness and made me reminisce about being younger and getting popcorn from the neighborhood ice cream truck. Being that 12 jars is too much for my household, I will  give a few jars to family and friends. I paid about $2.00(maybe more, can't remember)for one jar at my local supermarket.<br /><br />When using the seasoning I would suggest lightly sprinkling some on the popcorn BEFORE pouring into the serving container. After pouring the popcorn into the container, sprinkle a small amount on top again, and shake the popcorn around to distribute the seasoning. Due to the high sodium content I would recommend experimenting with the amount used because sprinkling too much will cause your popcorn to be very salty.<br /><br />I have tried it on a baked potato and it wasn't too bad(I like a lot of butter flavor on my potato). I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys eating popcorn that you pop yourself and not the microwave type(prepackaged).

Unfortunately, you can't seem to find it in stores any more, so we ended up ordering a case from Amazon.  That's okay - great price, and we'll use it up.  Here's a low-calorie tip for your popcorn.  Air pop it or pop it in the microwave, then spray it with butter-flavored cooking spray or I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray (both don't have any calories), then dust it with this salt.  Great buttery flavor, high fiber, and low calorie!

review/summary: By far the best popcorn seasoning around
review/text: I couldn't find my Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning in the pantry so I picked up some Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning at the store thinking it would taste the same. I got home and tried it out and it had a bitter, nasty taste to it. Blahh yuck! I rummaged through my pantry and finally found my Jolly Time seasoning, thank goodness.<br /><br />The Jolly Time seasoning has a light, buttery flavor that's not too salty, but just enough to make it feel like a treat. It only takes a tiny amount to make the popcorn taste movie theater worthy. It's simply amazing. Making fresh popcorn at home is the best, but without anything on top it tastes bland. Melting butter and drizzling it on top adds a lot of fat and it only covers a small percentage of the popcorn. The best way to make fresh popcorn is with quality kernels, a little olive oil mixed in with the kernels and this sprinkled on top right after the popcorn is done popping. That'll make your house the most popular place to be on movie nights!

review/text: I'm never without this product and order it by the case.  I use it mostly on popcorn - but it's also great on corn on the cob and other vegetables.  I'm glad I can get it on-line, as my stores used to carry it - but no longer do.  It's a delicious product and you get the buttery flavor without having to use butter and fat which add calories.

review/summary: Like Movie Popcorn
review/text: I've been using this stuff for years and it's disappeared from grocery shelves.  I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon since my hoarded supply was nearly depleted.  This is far and away my favorite popcorn seasoning.  It's fine enough that it dissolves in the cooking oil during popping and you get no grit on your popped corn.  The taste is comparable to the best movie theater popcorn.

review/summary: Fine Textured, More Salt Taste Than Butter
review/text: Received this shipment promptly, and it should last a lifetime !! The taste is salty. I think I expected more of a buttery flavor. I think I'd have to use way too much of it in order to get a butter taste, and I don't need that much sodium! Thus, the 3 stars. It is very fine textured, and just right for sprinkling on popcorn, but I plan to try it on baked potatoes, vegetables etc. [after all, I have a case of it]<br /><br />This is the only buttery seasoning I've tried so far in my guest for movie theater tasting popcorn. I don't think I'd recommend buying a case of 12 to anyone, unless you go in with other people and split it a few ways. I did look for this in several grocery stores, and was unable to find it. That's the reason I ordered it as I did. It was only available as a case.<br /><br />Something I have found in "my movie theater popcorn quest"  is using buttery flavor spray from the dairy section. The one that says I Can't Believe It's Not on the label. It's good to take it out of the fridge a little while before using to let the chill leave it. It's not bad on popcorn and baked potatoes, Irish or sweet.

review/summary: Inedible
review/text: I had high hopes for this product.<br /><br />My kids consume popcorn by the bucketful and are always asking for the "butter kind."  I can rationalize feeding them popcorn as a snack because, after all, it's a vegetable of sorts, and I'll even salt it a little for them once in a while, but I can't bring myself to add lots of butter each time.  When I came across this Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning, I thought that all our prayers had been answered--buttery flavor for the kiddos without the added mess and fat of butter.  Excitedly, I tried the seasoning on a little late night snack for myself and simply couldn't gag it down.  It smelled wretched and tasted even worse.  Still, I remained hopeful.  My kids are the kind that eat all their broccoli and brussel sprouts, so I crossed my fingers that I'd eventually be able to use all 12 containers of the vile stuff.  I was wrong.  My little 4-year-old found my half-eaten bowl the next morning and proclaimed that it smelled "like throw up."  (Her words, not mine.) I tried to sneak a few shakes into their morning bowl of popcorn over the next few days, but they wouldn't take the bait.  Brussel sprouts, yes.  Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning, no way.  It's THAT bad.

I've tried it, and, sorry to say, it's nothing but colored salt.  I guess the moral of the story is that one gets what one pays for; however, in this case, salt would have been much cheaper.

review/summary: perfect for coffee yogurt
review/text: My wife was addicted to Dannon coffee yogurt, and constantly searching for it, since stores that do carry it never stock enough, and she would often find that the previous addict had cleaned out the stock.  With this extract, and home-cultured or store-bought plain yogurt, along with a little sweetener, she can make a perfectly acceptable substitute.  I have taken to eating it myself.  The bottles seem expensive, but a little goes a long way, and it has a rich, true coffee taste.  It would probably be excellent for coffee ice cream as well.

review/summary: best training treat for dogs----  ALL dogs love it
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%

review/text: I have been eating this particular hot sauce for years now and I have to say, hands down, it is the best hot sauce for flavor plus heat. I am addicted and my cupboard always has an ample supply on hand.<br />This particular product is El Yucateco's hottest and, in my opinion, the tastiest. Other hot sauces may indeed be hot, but this one packs a whole lot of flavor that the others just plain lack. If you are (still) sensitive to this much heat, I would recommend their green habenero hot sauce. It's a little less potent and still quite flavorful.

review/summary: A solid choice for hot sauce
review/text: El Yucateco ("one from the Yucat&aacute;n") is a powerful hot sauce. After traveling extensively in the south of M&eacute;xico, I had a hankering for the heat and tastes of the foods typical of that area. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this. There is a good deal of heat, not overpowering, and not to the detriment of the taste of the sauce.<br /><br />As far as characterizing the taste, I would describe it as very "earthy". You definitely can detect the habanero, but there is a complex multitude of other spices that come out after the initial heat subsides. Other sauces this hot I find sacrifice unique taste for heat. A good sign is that if this sauce was not spicy, I would still use it.<br /><br />I am not a very technical cook, so I cannot honestly tell you what dishes this sauce is most appropriate for. I can tell you however that it enhanced every dish I used it on, from adding heat to burritos, to making some plain rice more interesting.<br /><br />I would advise those sensitive to hot sauces to first test this on a toothpick. Also when cooking with it, make sure to pour the sauce into a spoon first, because a little bit of this sauce goes a long way, and the heat does take a minute or two to start to dissipate, you wouldn't want to ruin an entire dish by adding too much heat. I would most definitely buy this sauce again!

review/text: This hot sauce has a fantastic flavor. However, it was not as hot as I'd expected. I assumed habanero hot sauce would be enough to REALLY spice up a dish, since I can't eat a whole habanero without my eyes welling up with tears. This was not the case. This stuff is really mild compared to the pepper it's made from.<br />That said, I have no regrets about buying this product. If you're looking for a really tasty, fairly thick sauce that's comparable to tabasco in heat, this sauce is for you. If you want something that will kick up a burrito all on it's own, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Too hot for casual chili eaters
review/text: This isn't lying when it says it's hot. For a niche fire sauce it's mild, I'm sure, but for a mainstream sauce it's a little too hot to start with. You have to get used to it after a few months. And once you get used to it I bet it won't suit your heat needs, so it ends up moot.  Also, this sauce has a good but specific flavor that in my opinion only goes well with certain foods such as the richer Mexican foods, perhaps others. That's why I prefer the milder red one of this brand. The red one with a less spiced habanero flavor is easier to use once in a while without the need to get used to the heat, and the flavor goes well with more variety of foods, in my opinion.

I will order more very soon because I, and my husband are really addicted to this very flavorful product, which by the way was difficult to find in specialty "hot sauce" stores.  I discovered it in a Mexican restaurant in Sausalito, CA.; I immediately copied down every word on the label until I found it on Amazon about 3-4 months later.

review/summary: Excatally what I was looking for, a perfect fit!
review/text: My 60 LBS english shepherd used to be an intense chewer. After growing out of her puppy-hood, she's dialed back the urge to gnaw on anything and everything. That being said, she still enjoys the occasional rawhide roll or dental chew.<br /><br />Normally those don't last her long, and with the rawhide rolls, it leaves behind a stains that can be a huge pain to clean (if they can be cleaned at all). Enter the Antler chew!<br /><br />This is perfect, she loves chewing it and it leaves behind no mess whatsoever. She's had it for a bit over a week and it's still looks brand new, she's done very little damage to it. Once she's made her way through this one, we'll definitely be ordering more, a fantastic product and deal.

review/summary: GREAT Product - But DON'T order in hot weather!
review/text: Awesome snack, healthy and despite previous negative reviews these ARE gluten free and contain NO msg.  The product itself gets a 5 star review from me and my family.  HOWEVER, I have ordered these many times from Amazon and will never order them again in summer months or warm weather.  Even though they don't require refrigeration until after you open the package, my July shipment was mostly ruined from the heat.  I watched for delivery and picked them up within 2 hours of delivery at my mailbox but they had a smooshy and gross texture, a texture that remained even after refrigeration.  Alot of dog treats in this shipment, but I'll know for next time. I still gave them five stars because the snacks are great when kept in normal temperatures.

They are perfectly shelf stable, but I prefer<br />to have them refrigerated prior to eating.  The spice level is perfect for me and my six year old loves them as well.  For snack<br />time we often will have these along with some cheese.  This was also a go to snack for me while pregnant, a protein boost<br />with flavor, but not heavy on grease and spice that would cause indigestion.<br /><br />6 bites<br />80 calories<br />7 grams protein<br />no sugars/carbs

review/summary: Spoiled
review/text: I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again!

I made a variety of flavors out of the rest in 4oz wide mouth ball jars---one with bay leave and heated pickle juice; whole peppercorns and hot peppers; mixed with sundried tomatoes packed in grapeseed oil and capers; slice some to go on pizzas, salads, popcorn and made a great spicy dip with garlic and red onions.

review/text: We got the Turkey and we really like it. There are only 1.5 grams of saturated fat in 6 bite size pieces and zero trans fat, less than 1 carb plus 7 grams of protein.<br />Refrigerate after opening, makes a good low carb snack, I take with me on mountain bike rides for protein.<br /><br />The taste is mild with no strong aftertaste, I wish the expiration dates were further out however. We ordered in January and received the product in January with an expiration date of August. We order no more than we will use in about 6 or 7 months.<br /><br />Altogether the turkey is a good product and handy snack. I would give 5 stars if the shelf life expiration dates were a bit further out.

review/text: My family and I really like these snacks. Yes, they are processed food and not the healthiest thing to eat, but they are a good quick snack that tastes good and is a bit healthier than the beef and/or pork options out there. I like the fact that they are shelf stable, so we can grab a bag to take with us in case we don't have any other food options (travelling, etc.), and that is the main reason we buy them.<br /><br />We have noticed that these are packaged under a few different brand names, but I can't always find them locally. The price here on Amazon is competitive with our local retailers, so we buy these here when we run out and cannot find them elsewhere.

review/text: Sure, they tasted great at first, and I was happy to order my kids a healthy meat snack without all those artifical cancer causing ingredients.  Problem is, that after a short period of time (way before the expiration date), half the packages molded disgustingly inside.  We have a completely air conditioned house, they were stored in a cool pantry that is mostly kept dark.  Reading the other reviews, I know I am not the only one with this problem.  Something is wrong with the packaging process, or the cooking process, but these rot fast UNOPENED.  Don't bother with this, find another product and don't waste your money =/

review/summary: Delicious, bite sized treats!
review/text: I originally bought these to give my dogs as a nightly treat. When they arrived, I popped one in my mouth to see what they were like, and WOW, it was like this taste explosion of grease and flavor. YUM. These are EXACTLY how pepperoni should taste. Firm skin, softer inside, with that little squirt of grease. My husband then tasted it and he completely agreed. Out of the six packages, he took five and I was left with one for the dogs.<br /><br />As human treats, these are fantastic. But as dog treats, not so much. Each package is 8 ounces, which is a LOT of pepperoni. I opened the packages, put it into an OXO pop container (air tight), and within 2-3 days of being inside the container, it started to form white, fluffy mold. Gross. I threw it out and figured it was a coincidence. I ordered some more, and did the same with a new package. Same thing happened - mold. If you are planning to eat these, it seems the quicker you consume these, the better.<br /><br />With how delicious they are, it shouldn't be tough! Our entire family loves these!

review/summary: In the search for affordable turkey jerky, this was dissapointing
review/text: Wisconsin Turkey Snack bites, I'm sorry for the low rating<br /><br />But,<br />I was pretty disappointed.  It might taste good to some, but not me. I've so far had one other brand on amazon, and a few brands in store, and I disliked this one.<br /><br />The snack bites have a few problems.<br /><br />1) They're fairly watery. Not only do they look more "reconstituted" than other brands, but their water content seems higher.<br /><br />2) they're lacking flavor.<br /><br />I try to solve problem one and two, by cutting them in half, dosing them in some hotsauce pepper mix, and drying them in the sun [and once in the oven]. This is rather time consuming, sort of. But even then, the oil/protein ratio is higher (meaning more oil) it seems than other turkey snacks.  Which is lame.<br /><br />So, I'll keep looking for good turkey jerky on amazon [which is basically anywhere, since beef is the game in most stores], any suggestions in the comments I'd appreciate. Preferably at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />P.S, of humerus note, I noticed one of the suggested tags are "Hip Hop".  Funny.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a comment that pointed out how this is not turkey jerky, but rather turkey sausage. This invalidates much of my review. I dont remember why I originally expected it to be more like turkey jerky. That said, they still were not tasty..

review/summary: No tiramisu without the Pavesini!
review/text: One summer while we were staying at a house in Italy our housekeeper gave me this recipe for the best tirmisu ever. She warned me, however, that you needed to use Pavesini biscotti--no substitutes! I was unable to locate them at any of stores that carry imported items. I thought that trying to track them down through Amazon was a long shot but I should have had more faith. I located the cookies, placed the order and within the week had received the package.

review/summary: Pavesini for Tiramisu
review/text: Madame X is right.  I made many, many Tiramisus over the past years and always used German or Italien 'Loeffelbisquits' until my Italian colleague recommended Pavesini.  At first I was concerned as they are so flat.  Not to worry, they are perferct, I make four instead of two layers now and they do not become as soggy with the Expresso as the bisquits.  Best Tiramisu ever!
