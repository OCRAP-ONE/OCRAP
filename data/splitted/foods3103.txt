review/summary: Strange, chewy, delicious
review/text: After trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NSH6O8">Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate with Sea Salted Almonds</a> (yum!) I had to try another of their flavors, and chose the Nibby. I had no idea really what that might taste like, but it sounded interesting.<br />It is. And it's also yummy.<br /><br />These bars are not as soft as the almond, so it's a little harder to break apart. The nibs are chewy, and not as sweet as the chocolate of course so it's a nice contrast. It's a little odd when you chew that last bit of nib and it almost feels like eating sand -- doesn't bother me, but texture-people might have a problem with that.<br /><br />Each (3oz) bar is 41% cocoa, gluton-free. Service size is half a bar (hehe, right, I try), and it lists calories at 220 and total carb at 20g (per serving). Ingredients include milk, cacao beans nibs and butter, 2% or less of non-gmo soy lecithin, and whole vanilla beans.<br /><br />I enjoy the soft saltiness of the almond bars better, though I like the Nibby. My sister thinks the almond ones aren't sweet enough, but she likes the nib bars.<br /><br />The Scharffen Berger bars are nicely wrapped. The wrapping of mine was yellow, the current picture on this product is for the Dark Chocolate. See this product listing: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DIXODK">Scharffen Berger Chocolate Bar Milk Nibby, 3-ounces, 41% Cacao (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />For something a bit different, and a delicious experience, I recommend the Chocolate Nibby.

review/text: When I ordered the chocolate I was unaware of the cacao nibs. The cacao nibs were<br />gritty and detracted from the chocolate. The inclusion of cacao nibs was listed on<br />the chocolate bar in very fine print which I overlooked. I much preferred the same<br />choolate bar without the cacao nibs.

review/text: Most coffee drinkers are perceived to like their coffee to be strong enough to put a hole in the bottom of the cup.  Chock full o'Nuts sounds like it might just do that.....however you are in for a delightful surprise.  This is a delicious tasting brew with no bite!  Yes, NO bite.  Very much like a smooth wine, very good, very expensive, this coffee is to be trusted to fulfill the taste of a smooth cup of coffee, very rich in taste, but not include that dreadful after taste of chicory or some such flavor. Once you taste it, all other coffees pale in comparison.

review/summary: Can't find 13-oz coffee in the supermarket any more
review/text: I can't find 13- or 16-ounce coffee in the supermarket any more.  So I ordered 6 thirteen-ounce cans from Amazon.  I've had Chock Full o'Nuts coffee before, and often would buy it in the store.<br /><br />When Chock Full o'Nuts and other brands got chintzier and chintzier, putting 13, then 12, then 11 and a half or 11 and a quarter, then who knows how few are coming next? ounces into what looks like a one-pound can, I finally refused to buy anything that's less than 13.  I'd prefer 16 but I'll settle for 13.<br /><br />I can't imagine that there's anything bad about the 13 ounces of coffee inside these cans I got from Amazon.  I haven't opened the first can yet, but I'm sure I'll have coffee for months to come, before I have to reorder from Amazon.<br /><br />My self-motto on coffee is:  Ignore the supermarket aisles.  Go directly to Amazon.  Do not pass GO.  Do not collect two hundred dollars.

You can also do the same with a can of chili in a microwave bowl. Add the cheese sauce. When fully heated add a cold diced tomato and tortilla chips.

But it sure tastes good, albeit salty. Be sure to pair with UNSALTED chips, or use as a sauce on top of veggies, concoct whatever meat dish you fancy. It's rather versatile. Consume in moderation, it won't kill you.  5 stars.<br /><br />I can't  believe what I just said  about this kind of junk food!

I found it too sweet as well. If you're a pocky fan, then you know the pretzelly cookie stick well.  If you've never had it before, the stick is bland and goes well with it's coatings.  The coating consistency is kind of weird and soft.  Kids who like strawberry flavor will probably love it, not many adults will.  Neither I nor the kid in me liked the strawberry pocky.

Additionally, it's flavor goes nicely on just about anything I can put it on.  It's a great hot sauce to put on a bowl of rice, but goes equally well with on wings, chicken, burgers, or fish.  After Death is basically all the flavor of Blair's Original Death but about twice as hot.

Yes, it is still HOT - but that's how I like it.<br /><br />This is the hottest Blair's sauce that does not carry the "do not use without dilution" warning on the bottle.

review/text: Blair isn't joking: that plastic skull is a cogent, stark warning not to take this sauce lightly.  And another note: this isn't so much a sauce as it is an additive.<p>Here's how you can literally fire up your mouth: take one 24 ounce jar of generic hot salsa from your supermarket.  Let's say you laugh at their idea of &quot;hot&quot;, which means you're ready to go with Blair's Sudden Death Sauce.<p>Put the salsa in a blender.  Do not blend yet.  Pour about 1/4&quot; of water in the empty jar, shake it up, pour into the blender (get all of your salsa's worth).  Put four-six drops of Blair's into the blender.  Cover and blend on &quot;Liquify&quot;.<p>Pour into a serving bowl.  Take a nacho chip, dip, and eat.  Now run to your  kitchen sink, and stick your mouth under the tap.  After five minutes, the burning should stop.<p>Repeat until the bag of chips are gone.<p>I add a few drops to canned chicken soup, and it really makes it far more tasty and hot than you could ever buy.  I'm impressed at how tasty the sauce really is, if you use it properly.  It takes a little practice to get the right balance of flavor-to-hot, but it really does add flavor to soups, salads, chili (man, does it ever), hamburger, just about anything.  A single bottle might last you about three months, and you'll sneer at lesser sauces in your grocer's aisles.<p>fred

review/summary: Another great Blair's sauce
review/text: I picked up a bottle of Sudden Death and Beyond Death.  I have previously had After Death, which is very similar, except half as hot.  After Death is the best in terms of pure taste.  Sudden Death is almost as good but twice as hot.  I didn't really care for Beyond Death which is just as hot as Sudden Death, but had both a sweet and a sour flavor at the time time that didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />To date, I have mixed this sauce in with ketchup on a burger, and with BBQ sauce on chicken drumsticks.  I was able to use a good amount of it without finding it overly hot, but my threshold for heat is a lot higher than most people.

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me that this flavor, the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

IAMS needs to make up their mind as to whether they are going to continue this product or not.

review/text: I bought this California style Garlic Pepper some time ago and was initially reluctant to use it because of the amount of black pepper in it but it is amazing if you shake it thoroughly before using to get all the spices in it mixed well, and use it sparingly, it goes a long way. It has a rich garlic pepper aroma that is great on almost anything, especially as a marinade on chicken, pork and burgers. I also like that it has no MSG in it. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: I love this curry powder mix. It's good for a variety of meats, I make lamb and chicken curry with it. It tastes like the good curry you get in an authentic Indian restaurant. And, it's easy to make, the directions are on the back. Just add meat, onions and plain yougert and you're all set. I also add a can of pigeon peas, but you can use any veg you want (although that's not in the recipe on box). You can adjust the "spicy hot" level by adding more or less of the curry powder. Try it if you're a curry lover, and even if you aren't --with this curry powder you may become one.

review/summary: Totally fine!
review/text: I could not find any source for a variety of actual reviews for the Ariel wines anywhere (some from a few wine snob bloggers- what I did read was very, very negative) so I decided to go ahead and review it here. I was infinitely curious about it and finally broke down and paid the $6 to try it myself, anticipating that I might have to dump it.<br /><br />It is totally fine as the review title suggests. No real off smells or flavors as some report (perhaps more with the de-alcoholized reds?) and the flavor is pretty sweet, but not as sweet as the many juices, sodas, and spritzers I end up drinking as alternatives to alcoholic beverages.<br /><br />I mix a little bit of home-brewed kombucha to cut the sweet and imagine it would also be good as a spritzer. I'll probably try the other varieties now but I bet this Blanc is the safest bet.

review/summary: I was so excited when I bought this but I just might throw it away
review/text: I love hot sauces and I have quite a collection of them.  When I saw this product at an Austin hot sauce shop (the apply named "Tears of Joy") I snatched it up.  Of the 5 different sauces that I bought that day this was the first one that I opened.  I have to say that I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I am really not too sure why it tastes so bad to me.  Here is what the label says is in it:<br /><br />Purified water, soybean oil, jalapeno chilies, cane sugar, wine vinegar, fresh tomatillo, Wasabi Rhizome, salt, lime juice, cilantro, ginger, mustard powder, green tea leaf, vitamin C, garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, citric acid and sodium eritobate.<br /><br />It could be the large amount of soybean oil but the sauce tastes dull and cloying.  I was hoping for that nasal-passage-clearing rush of Wasabi but I could barely delete it's flavor.  For a brand that has HEAT on the label it's too bad that there was none inside of the bottle.  The green tea leaf adds to the visual aspect of the condiment (with all of the floating bits of it and the cilantro) but not the taste.  I just could be me or the bottle that I purchased, but I don't like it and I regret buying it.

review/summary: Delicious but laxative effect is explained.
review/text: Ok... the laxative effect is a secondary sweetener called maltitol. It is known to cause a laxative effect. Its very similar to sugar so it can be used in the same manner. However it is known to cause irritation on the GI. Maltitol is a very slow absorbing sugar and excess can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea. However, these jelly beans are delicious and taste very similar to the non-sugarfree variety. But, as the other reviewers cautioned self-discipline is going to be heavily recommended. These things are extremely powerful. On my first go I was warned by a friend who told me he had a bag and he almost died. I didn't believe him and I had a whole bag of these delicious beans... before I continue... go ahead and read the warnings on the bag. It suggests no more than 8 beans at a time... I tested this and it was best way to go and caused no problems. HOWEVER, if you DO consume a whole bag prepare for several hours of repeated bathroom visits, bloating like if your intestines were going to explode and and severe intestinal gas. So, go ahead enjoy a couple from time to time and it will be a very good purchase. But again, caution and self control!

I'm really surprised at how good they are!  They taste like...jellybeans! Good jellybeans.  They aren't fakey or cloying.  In fact, they are so good that I have to be careful not to overdo it with them.  Start slowly, as they can give you a kick in the gut if you are sensitive.  But for me, dong low carb now on my doctor's orders, these babies are truly a tasty little blessing and a treat when handled with care.

review/text: I love these sugar-free jelly beans. They are very sweet. My favorite is the cinnamon and buttered popcorn together. I also really love the licorice. But I think they are all great and better then most fruit flavored sugar-free candies. I eat between 10 and 20 at a time each day and they don't bother my stomach.

review/summary: Great Sugar Free Jelly Belly Candy
review/text: I love them.<br />As with ANY sugar free candy read the label and follow the instructions.  They mean it.  Some folks are much more sensative to the sweetener than others.  Remember to always follow the instructions and you will be fine!  I am ordering more today and I have never had a moments problem with the sugar free Jelly Belly candy.  I could eat a lot more than i do but, lucky for me, I CAN read.

review/summary: BEWARE!!!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015DA1HI">Sugar-Free Jelly Belly 2.3 lb case</a>I want to warn you about the possibility of extreme diarrhea, NOT merely a "laxative effect,"  from a 3.1 oz. bag of sugar free Jelly Bellys. It has been 4 hours since I ate them (yes, I know I shouldn't have eaten so many!) and I am still in distress. This is not just a "laxative effect"! Laxatives don't usually keep you "running" until there is nothing left. I think that this could be a super-fast prep for a colonoscopy - it certainly is just as effective, if you get what I mean. I am just lucky that I was at home and not at work or traveling. The warning should be stronger to save someone who is truly medically compromised from the danger of dehydration or worse. I would hate to see a child or an elderly person go through what I am experiencing.

review/text: The taste is OK but stay away from these unless you want to spend some time on the pot. Within 30 - 45 minutes of ingesting I am on the pot in intestinal misery. I do not know what they use as a sweetener but it IS NOT Splenda. I use Splenda DAILY and it never effects me like these do. Go for it if you want to dump your guts but if you want jelly beans go with the regular ones. If your diabetic and want these.....just eat at home, make sure you have no plans for later and see that the bathroom is free.

review/text: I bought 2 small bags of the Jelly Belly sugar free candy and about 2 hours after eating maybe, 20-25, jelly beans my stomach began to rumble and it became uncomfortable.  I called Jelly Belly and offered to scan and email the receipt for a refund and I was told they could not help me and that the receipt was not enough for a refund,that I had to have the bag itself.  I am disappointed in the company and will not make any additional purchases of any Jelly Belly products.

review/summary: Turned my grass yellow
review/text: We were initially feeding our lab puppy Eukanuba Naturally Wild North Atlantic Salmon & Rice Puppy Growth Dog Food, then switched to this on a breeder's recommendation.  In short order, her urine began killing off my lawn, so I've switched back.  Other than killing my grass, she looked really, really healthy on it; good weight maintenance, and her coat had a nice sheen to it.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />The Eukanuba was discontinued, so I've gone to the adult formula of Royal Canin. Same lawn issues persist, but I've started using Nutri-Vet Grass Guard (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361QPA4/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ), and the lawn is recovering again.

review/summary: EXCELLENT PRODUCT, convenient, and a great value
review/text: My Yellow Labrador as a puppy would vacuum his food up at feeding time. This product controlled that immediately. My current puppy is the fourth one using this dry kibble. I know they are being optimally nourished using Royal Canin. Their only treats are carrots, apple slices and frozen broccoli. All four grew up into magnificent specimens with no problems or issues. They all had a great coats, no digestive problems and clean teeth. While I only have them for 18 months while puppy training, I do get to see them as they graduate as Guide Dogs knowing they had a good start with this kibble.<br /><br />Amazon makes it easy to have it delivered to your door at substantially less cost than the big box pet stores. No driving, less cost, great product delivered to your front door.

review/summary: My lab/springer mix loves it!
review/text: I waited a while (2 months) before reviewing this so I could get a good idea of how my pup would take to it. I am pleased to say he absolutely devours this stuff. I had him on Nutro Max for a while and his stool was runny and yellowish in color. After switching over his stool is firm and consistent. He is a 4 month and 1 week old Black Labrador and Springer Spaniel mix. He's eating around 3 cups a day and he's grown from 11 pounds when we got him (2 months ago) to a healthy 27lbs at 4 months and 1 week of age. He gains right around 10lbs a month, which is what the vet said is expected.<br /><br />His eyes are clear, coat is soft and shiny. I haven't noticed any yellow spots forming in the grass like some other posters said. The only time that happens is if I miss a spot when using the pooper scooper and it sits for a while. Overall I would highly recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: When you graduate from Sudden Death.
review/text: I can't believe it happened, but it did: Sudden Death was no longer a one- or two-drop test of strength.  I'm actually putting tablespoons of it in the sixteen-ounce salsa jars now.  Two years ago, I'd have run outside and eaten grass to put out the fire.  Now?  I've gotten my tolerance up.  It's time to go a little further.<br /><br />Mega Death is that next gradation of heat, spice, and taste.  Really tasty, the single-most important criterion when picking a sauce.  It adds distinct flavor and, when properly used, gives you the blend of heat and spice that turns you into an addict.  You could literally overindulge with a good sauce, so be careful.<br /><br />I have to revert to my one- or three-drop amounts, and that's not only economical but good sense when dealing with Blair's sauces.  If not graduallly tested, you could end up eating grass instead of salsa, and that's not a good way to get fiber.<br /><br />Fred

review/summary: A very hot, very good sauce!
review/text: I have loved hot food and hot sauce since I was quite young.  I only found out about the "Blair's Death Sauce" range recently.<br /><br />Firsly I must say that I found their "After Death" and "Sudden Death" tasted very much alike but the "Mega Death" is by far and away their best sauce.<br /><br />First one is hit by the great taste, you can really tast the Habanero Chile (something you can do with their other sauces)plus it has a slightly sweet side to it.  Then you are hit by the heat, I say "then you are hit by the heat" because it's not the first thing you notice with this sauce.  Though it is much hotter then their other sauces it sneaks up on you.<br /><br />I would use about five drops or more on a big staek but I like a lot of heat so try one drop at a time.<br /><br />The best supper hot sauce I have yet tried!

review/text: God Almighty. That pretty much sums up this sauce.<br /><br />If you're looking for great flavor and usability you've come to the wrong place (although considering the heat its really not THAT bad..)<br /><br />This sauce will humble you to the God's of spice. You will truly know what pain is. I had a small spot on the top of a fork and my tongue was burning for about 20 minutes. I had a spot on a cracker and my entire mouth (not just my tongue, my cheeks, gums, throat, roof and floor of my mouth, and sinuses) were burning, this lasted (even with milk to stop the pain) for about 20 minutes, if I didn't have milk in my mouth it felt like there was 100 white hot knives stabbing every spot in my mouth.<br /><br />In short : SWEET!

review/summary: Best hot sauce yet
review/text: While sitting next to a boatload of sauces right now, I can honestly say this is the best tasting of the bunch.<br />Heres a rundown:<br />Melinda's XXXXtra Reserve -- decent, but not that hot<br />Asbirin Extra Strength -- obscenely salty<br />Ass Blaster -- salty and vinegary<br />Dave's Ghost Pepper -- bitter and nasty, it has a creeper heat to it<br />Mad Dog 357 -- hot as hell, probably a contender but only for certain foods since its too sweet for me<br />Dave's Insanity/Temp Insanity -- good, no real complaint, just not as good<br />Da' Bomb &lt;all> -- taste is ok, heat is unbearable<br />Pain 95/100% -- decent sauces but not that hot<br />Mad Dog Pure Ghost -- tastes like the 357, only not hot at all<br />El Yucateca Green/Xtra Hot -- these are good sauces with minor heat, too minor for me<br />Mad Dog 357 Mustard Sauce -- great stuff, limited usage due to flavor profile, pretty warm<br />Pappy's Moonshine Madness -- awesome, but its a barbecue sauce, decent heat for such<br /><br />So, based upon all that experience right there, I recommend this sauce for flavor and heat as a primary "use on whatever" sauce. I just ate a spoonful off of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E7S5BO">Light My Fire Titanium Spork</a> and its great all by itself. I barely pull a burn from it. I highly doubt its 550,000 rating. My bottle of Mad Dog 357 is hands down at least 2x/3x as hot -- confirmed by testing just now in the same amount. I'm actually starting to wonder if there was some mistake or I got a fluke bottle of 357, because its the hottest thing I have aside from my Da' Bomb lineup. It literally sets my mouth on fire and feels more like about 650,000. I have and have eaten some Da' Bomb Final Answer and this is around half that heat or so I think. I don't have the collector's edition either.... Oh well, YMMV. Have fun chileheads!<br /><br />Update: I got the Mad Dog collectors edition in the mail today. It is twice as hot as the original so there that is. I also have Ultra Death sauce now too. Its not much hotter than the Mega Death that I can tell. I'm thinking that the Mad Dog line may be the truest to its claimed Scoville rating that I have come across. Everything else has been all over the board, no wonder you have to be careful testing sauces. Go hit some Ground Zero with 214,000(my ass) Scoville rating.

review/summary: More of a heat additive than a proper sauce.
review/text: I tried this on pulled pork and on a chicken sandwich, and I found that I dislike it for the same reasons I dislike the original Dave's Insanity Sauce: it's a heat additive with no attempt to make it taste good. What little there may have been to taste got washed down with the first gulp of milk, leaving only the bitterness, pain, and desire to have nothing more to do with this sauce. Lower-tier sauces in the Death series--like Pure Death and After Death--have great flavors and are worthy as condiment sauces, so I was disappointed by this one.

Our new kitten loves it also--she is about a year old. She eats a can per day. She was undernourished and had been viciously attacked out in the wild and on top of that had had a litter of kittens, even though she was still a kitten herself. This food has helped her so much. She is bright eyed and plays and looks like a different cat since we started her on this.

review/text: Recently, I got as many varieties of Merrick's for my cat to try as I could. I got them from my local PetCo, not Amazon. I usually feed him a custom raw chicken diet, but for travel or when friends are taking care of him that isn't practical. I used to use Wellness CORE dry and wet cat food but it was just getting too expensive. I was pleased when I found Merrick's, and love that it is made in Texas (my native state!).<br /><br />I do recommend researching how to switch your cat's food safely to avoid any possible digestive system issues such as diarrhea or vomiting.<br /><br />My cat really liked the Ocean Breeze food. I mixed this with the Wellness CORE to get him adjusted and he licked all the wet food off of the kibbles before starting on the kibble.<br /><br />I rate Merrick's Ocean Breeze five stars. It is made here in Texas, and with real quality ingredients, I can feel good knowing my cat isn't eating meat flavored corn and wheat!

review/summary: Fiber-riffic!
review/text: Have you ever described a food as tasting "healthy" when you mean it tastes so bad it must be good for you? Fear not! It is pleasantly adaptable to use with any fruit on hand. I honestly will say, though, that it does have an earthy quality. It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with--just a little! If trying for the first time, I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar's label. Surprisingly palatable! You'll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself. Easy to digest. The powder is indeed rather coarse. When you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal, you won't mind. Including this in one's eating habits can only be an addition for the positive.

review/summary: great product and keeps the body happy
review/text: I use this product everyday and I have continued to buy it since I discovered it.  I put it with rice milk, or with fruit in a smoothie, etc.  If you just put it in water and drink it, then yes it is grainy.  I don't do that and don't recommend such.  It really helps to balance the blood sugar and keep the body happy.  It is satisfying in keeping the appetite down.  It keeps my lower tract running well.  It is high protein and has carb balance as well.  Be sure to add it with something to avoid the gritty taste.  It wasn't designed to be drank with just water though a person could do it.  I've tried the more expensive Nutiva blends that have flavors added and they are great.  Nutiva does a good job in producing healthy products.  This particular hemp protein powder is effective and it is the cheapest among the hemp protein lines so I just add my own fruit, maca, etc.  If you want to stay economical and add your own blend to it then you have a program that works great.  If you want a sweeter taste then buy the other types of Nutiva hemp as they have several great flavors. I highly recommend Nutiva hemp.

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: I love the taste of this hemp protein Powder.  I love to mush up bananas with a fork, add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the Nutiva Hemp seeds.  It tastes great and satisfies me on every level.<br /><br />I also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands.  I couldn't believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving.  Considering that 90% of Americans are lacking in fiber, this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions.

review/summary: Not the best tasting hemp portein
review/text: I had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there, and love eating the powder raw. But Nutiva's product does not taste good at all, compared to the other products it tastes like dirt, and its not milled to a fine powder, its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything. The only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands. If your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with Living Harvest, Manitoba Harvest or Ruth's Hemp Protein. I eat hemp religiously so trust me, take my advice and avoid this one. Bottoms Up! Hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there, and easy to digest.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I love this product.  All I care about is my health, (breast cancer survivor). Yes, of course I have bits in between my teeth afterwards, so what. I have already recommended this product to two friends.  It does not bloat me out, it is zapped in a blender with almond milk, a banana, goji berries and a few strawberries and a bit of pineapple.<br /><br />I know that I am getting a good and healthy breakfast, plus I have lost a few pounds in the last two weeks as well.  I also have the hemp seeds and oil on a salad at lunchtime.<br /><br />Thank you Nutiva!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I was having blood sugar spikes and after adding Nutiva's hemp protein to my smoothies, I can cruise for a good 3 hours without hunger or spiking.  This has been a godsend. I chose Nutiva because a few die-hard friends will use nothing else.  Plus I am a Californian, and like that it's made here. I tried a few other products over the months and keep coming back to Nutiva.  I just like it best, and Organic is really important to me.

review/summary: Good substitute for soy protein
review/text: I mix this with orange juice, berries and a banana in the blender and it tastes great. It took some time to get used to the grainy texture, but it is much better than soy or whey protein.

review/summary: Used correctly, it's the best!
review/text: As you can see from others' ratings, people either love or hate it! I hope this review helps you decide which category you'd fall into...<br /><br />Its health benefits are totally loveable. Udo Erasmus, in 'Fats that Heal, Fats that Kill', rates the oils from hemp as those most beneficial to humans, surpassing even flax seed. On this recommendation alone I was favorably inclined towards Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder, and I was not disappointed. It provides steady energy, and my body feels good when I eat it.<br /><br />I find it completely palatable and enjoy smoothies with it. I personally use a Vitamix and blend 4 tablespoons of it, as recommended, into soy milk at top speed, adding half a frozen banana, and sometimes organic cocoa powder. Delicious!

review/summary: Protein Punch
review/text: I've been using Nutiva products for years now and the protein powder is wonderful. I add it to a smoothie in the morning, and it keeps me going for hours. It's a staple in my diet, so I usually have one or two jars on hand. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Hemp Protein
review/text: I like the Nutiva Hemp protein. A great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber.  Can't beat that!  It won't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can.  I like the taste and texture too.  Mixes great with cranberry juice/cranberries, stevia, ice and water! I add some Berry Green for extra energy and nutrients!  It's my morning breakfast.

review/summary: High quality, and a change of pace
review/text: Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)<br /><br />Just received in the mail today: Nutiva(tm) brand Organic Hemp Protein Powder.<br /><br />I have tried many, many kinds of protein powders. I have hated them all, for one reason or another. Most of the time it's because they're pre-sweetened with aspartame or saccharine or even straight-up sugar. I'm not really "into" too much sweet stuff. Because I have to consume untenably massive amounts on a regular basis, protein powder will need to be as unobtrusive as possible.<br /><br />I wanted to try Nutiva's hemp powder because it also had a lot of other nutrients in it besides protein, and because all of these nutrients and protein were naturally-occurring, not chemically combined to form some alien mud substance.<br /><br />Right away I noticed the difference. This stuff was powderized, but it's like powderized grass clippings -- olive-green in color, with a smell not unlike alfalfa hay.<br /><br />And this stuff isn't artificial. Besides 11g of protein for every quarter-cup of powder, it also has Omega3 fatty acids in it, and a few other goodies.<br /><br />I love the nutty flavor it lends to food. It changes the appearance of food, however, giving it a khaki-green cast, and it changes the texture of it a bit with a grittiness.<br /><br />It's great in smoothies. Not being a big sweets-consumer, however, I also try to mix the hemp powder into other foods. Mashed potatoes is an interesting choice, particularly if you don't mind consuming green mashed potatoes! It can also be stirred into sauces.<br /><br />I like it WAY better than any other protein powder I've ever tried.
