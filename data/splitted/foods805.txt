review/summary: A game changer!
review/text: The package arrived yesterday, within 24 hours of being shipped.  The package is well designed to keep the product from moving during shipping and the presentation is fantastic.  The taste test was hard to understand between all the mmmph's but eventually got two thumbs up from all parties.  I tried one myself and I do not know how they pick the perfect berries but they were perfect.  The amount of chocolate on these was a dreamy chocolate that was not dominate of the berry but a perfect blend. I do not know many presents that I or you could give for Christmas that will be remembered next year but you have my guarantee on this one.<br /><br />Guys,  if your in the dog house... this is a game changer!

review/summary: Nice, but not superb
review/text: I had been hearing radio ads for chocolate covered strawberries (actually from a competing company).  Seemed like a good idea for my wife, so I ordered a dozen.  They were nicely packed and beautifully decorated, but the berries themselves were visibly shrunken and withered.  They were still delicious, but the leaves were dried and the berries had pulled back from the inside of the chocolate shells leaving visible gaps.

review/summary: Great strawberries !
review/text: I ordered these for my wife and when they were shipped they came on a ups truck and that was not so good. They were shipped from California to Las Vegas and they arrived all melted and stuck to the box. We contacted the company and they were very nice to deal with. They said they would reship or refund our money well we opted for the berries as we wanted to see what they should look like. We had sent them to my sister and they raved about them being so good. So they did reship them and they are excellent strawberries and the chocolate is fabulous. :) You will not be dissapointed if you order these Strawberries! Enjoy !!

review/text: Out of the 12, 3 were soft and inedible. 3 were what I would consider perfect. They came overnight and the cold packs were still cold. They seemed packaged as well as they could be.<br />In summary, they were nice-ish, but not wow-worthy. Perhaps from a local store rather than mail would be better. Unfortunately I didn't have that opportunity. I would say worth about half the price.

review/text: The package was delivered overnight as promised, but the contents did not match the picture. Out of 12 berries, I got 2 with white chocolate and 10 dark. The picture implied 4 white. Also, packaging was not done well; the strawberries were not kept cold enough which resulted in sweating and juices flowing all over the packaging. To top it all off, my wife found a DEAD BUG on one of the berries!!! What a disappointment!!! There are few things that are worse than giving a loved one a gift that turns out to be a complete dud. This, unfortunately, was no doubt one of those times! I have submitted a request for refund; let's see how the seller decide to handle this.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will definitely NOT order these again.

review/text: My husband and I liked the taste of this, but I think it's a little spicier than we like in a soup.  My children will not eat it.  And they are not adverse to some spiciness (they like tacos, chimichangas, med. salsa, etc.)  I tried adding a can of stewed tomatoes in addition to the water, but still too spicy for them.  Crumbling some homemade cornbread into it helps a bit, but we won't be buying this variety again.

And then there is the ludicrous shipping fee for 2 ounces of seaweed... I would love to see this product as an Amazon Prime item...

review/summary: Nice whole leaves
review/text: I had never bought bay leaves before, so I cannot actually review this product comparatively with other bay leaves. However, I can say that this really is a bargain buy.  The leaves are packed tight and full into the containers, so you get A LOT of leaves in each bottle. I wasn't expecting to get so much, and I ended up giving one bottle to my mom because there was no way I can use it all up any time soon. The leaves themselves smell fresh and fragrant, and all the leaves are pretty much whole. I've cooked roasted potatoes with onions and a few leaves in olive oil, and I definitely smelled and tasted the bay leaf flavor in the potatoes. My mom also uses them in her cooking (she cooks with bay leaves a lot) and she never complained to me about them, so I think she approves too!

They were packaged well and arrived in 4 days.

review/text: I ordered this product to make white, strawberry-flavored icing for some cupcakes for a wedding. since it was so expensive, i did not test it to make sure it actually tasted like strawberry before baking day. My Mistake! It smelled like bad bubblegum and tasted like Windex or something - just a terrible, chemical taste. i made the icing, then tasted it and thought "what was on my finger!? nail polish remover or something?" well I hadn't done my nails, it was the icing! i could not serve that. I had to start over and use vanilla at the last minute. Thankfully the bride was very understanding. I DO NOT recommend this product. (Also, when I contacted the seller to try to send it back, they would never reply. Obviously they don't stand behind what they sell. Money Wasted.)

This one does not disappoint and is the best I've had in quite awhile.  This is definitely one I plan on stocking up on; we've still got quite a few months left of hot weather here in the Santa Cruz mountains.

review/summary: HINT ---- Simply the best bottled beverage.
review/text: I started drinking Hint Water a few years ago when Smartwater discontinued its similar line of no-calorie, no-artificial-sweetners, lightly flavored waters.  I find that I drink a lot more water during the day with these than with filtered water.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and refreshing ---- just a tiny hint of flavoring.  No syrupy flavor like all the trendy "fitness drinks" out there and no carbonation or harmful artificial sweetners like with diet soda.<br /><br />I was an absolute Diet Coke junkie for fifteen years until I found this product.  No hyperbole ---- it's literally the only thing that I can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from Diet Coke.  It might seem a bit pricey, but for my health I think it is worth every penny.  I just wish they would stock a larger size so I wouldn't feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles.  Also, this may seem a small point but I am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me.  I always get compliments when I hand these out to guests ---- both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon.  They are very subtle.  My husband's favorite is the honeydew-hibiscus.  I like it, too, but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this product highly enough.

review/summary: A "HINT" OF YECK!!
review/text: I ordered several flavors of the "Hint" water and all of them taste very medicinal to me.  I was expecting a little more "hint" of flavor of whatever was on the label.  Not so...I had to add Crystal Lite to them just to make them palatable, which obviously defeats the purpose of buying flavored water in the first place.  The one big plus is that they are not carbonated, but otherwise...YECK!

review/summary: It's Water with a hint of Honeydew....
review/text: I recently purchased this water expecting to get a nice refreshing drink with a hint of Honeydew-Hibiscus flavor. Well, in the end there isn't much flavor, and it's basically water. And of course water is very refreshing, but I was expecting a little more than just the occasional linger of honeydew flavor, but absolutely no hint of hibiscus. This one is definitely better than the blackberry version that HINT offer, but I wouldn't rush out to recommend it.

review/text: I originally discovered this product at Whole Foods when looking for a healthy fiber-rich carb source to add to my daily breakfast, and think the taste of this is absolutely great.  If you are used to a high sugar baked bean product (eg, Heinz Baked Beans), this will surely be less sweet, however.  My girlfriend, who also eats healthy, seems to only taste one ingredient in this - the Sorghum, and doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />I'd suggest trying it once (if you can buy it in a local supermarket, buy just one), and if you like it, buy it in bulk from amazon as the price is much better here.

review/summary: Healthy - Yes! But The Taste? - Hard To Swallow
review/text: "Eden Organic Baked Beans" have some great things going for it. Low salt, fat free,cholesterol free, organic, a good source of,protein(8 g per serving),potassium, calcium and iron.All those things are what I'm looking for and the only reason I give 2 stars. But the one area they are lacking is good taste. I am not new to low sodium foods. I have been using and on the look out for it for years. Always trying to find something that tastes good as well as is healthy. The products seem to be getting better and better and I have recommended several items. My favorite at this time is Amy's brand. I would especially recommend<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G18NR0">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Minestrone Soup, 14.1-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> (see my review for details)to anyone trying to switch over to low sodium as an example of how good it can be. But Amy's didn't have any low sodium baked beans, so I decided to give this Eden brand a try.<br /><br />I guess if i could only use one word to describe the taste - it would be "blechhh". It leaves a horrible sour sort of after taste in my mouth that makes me shudder, and they are really dry going down. I wouldn't recommend buying these in bulk. If you see these at your local market and want to try a can for yourself, that would be advisable, but have some applesauce or some other favorite side to wash these down.<br /><br />One other good thing I could say is that they have a long shelf life. Which is where they will stay - on my shelf - unless I have some big emergency, and even then I'd have to be desperate.<br /><br />Ingredients for those interested are:<br />Organic Navy beans,Water,Organic Sorghum,Tomato Puree,Organic Apple Cider Vinegar,Organic Mustard seed,Organic Onion and spices, sea salt.<br /><br />Sorry but this is one healthy product I can't recommend.....Laurie

review/text: I had such high hopes for these. I really wanted an easy quick and healthy meal for my toddler on those days we spend too long at the park and needed a really quick lunch before nap time. I thought I'd throw some cut up soy hot dogs in with these and it would be like 'healthy franks and beans.' Not so much. The taste was just awful. I wound up using them up in chili to hide the flavor. I was so sad because these were the only Eden Organic canned items at my Whole Foods. Glad I found a wider variety on Amazon, but I will be sure this time to have a recipe planned for them rather than eating them plain!

review/summary: A little different, but still good.
review/text: I have been looking for canned organic baked beans for quite some time, since my children love them and I don't always have the time to make them from scratch.  When I saw Eden made organic baked beans I immediately bought a case and prayed they would taste decent.  My prayers were answered when I opened the first can of beans and tried them.  They are a little different, for me anyway, but overall they are quite tasty.  The only "complaint" I have is the sorghum.  I'm just not used to it!  I'm more used to baked beans being made with brown sugar or maple syrup, so the sorghum is a little strong for me.  However if I add just a tbsp of grade b maple syrup or agave nectar it sweetens it right up for me.  And of course my children just love them and always ask for seconds :)  The can lining being bpa-free was also a major selling point and plus for me.  Who could ask for more?  Thank you Eden for another satsifying prodcut!

review/text: The product quality is great, but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D'Oro brand due to the ongoing strike. The retail price clearly marked on each package is $2.79, so a case of 12 packages should retail for $33.48 plus shipping. Since the cost of this product is $47.95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages, make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D'Oro before ordering.

LOL<br />The way the food is designed to help keep it in his mouth instead of all over the floor is just great. She just loves the fact that she does not have to clean up after Blaze tears through a bowl of it!<br /><br />As for flatulence... Sometimes this dog farts so loud people turn and look at me like I have some sort of problem! I stopped trying to explain that it's the breed since they usually don't stick around very long due to the horrid aroma that exudes from his anus... After switching to Royal Canin, I noticed him put on a few extra pounds of lean weight. His coat also picked up a great shine to it.<br /><br />All in all I will say the price is a little high, but you know the old saying "you get what you pay for". If you decide that a bulldog is the dog for you then at least do him a favor and get him this food!<br /><br />My dog weighs 55lbs. & is 4 yrs old<br />#30lbs usually lasts about 1 1/2 months

review/summary: Life changer for our bulldog
review/text: We have given our bulldog Iam's for most of his 12 years.  Over the last year he has lost a significant amount of weight and had grown several bald spots.  Knowing the normal life expectancy of a bulldog we had assumed the inevitable was upon us.  However my wife saw the reviews for this food and we decided to give it a try.  The results are amazing.  He put on weight - returning to his normal size - and his coat looks better than it has in years.  The bald spots have regrown hair over the past two months and the overall sheen is great.<br />We could not be more happy to have found this 'fountain of youth' food.  Atticus even feels up to visiting parks and playing with other dogs.  After a couple days of adjustments, even the flatulence seems to have improved.  This product easily gets five stars despite the cost.  We are a Royal Canin family from now on.

review/summary: Best Food for My Bulldog
review/text: After going through Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba, we finally settled on this food after my Bulldog's gas pretty much completely stopped after about 3 days on Royal Canin. My 1.5 year-old Bulldog has been on this food for about 8 months (Royal Canin Medium Puppy before then but after the other brands). It is so nice to have a non-flatulent Bulldog! Her coat is shiny and smooth. She has never had any hotspots or allergies. I started her off before Royal Canin supposedly switched recipes (red and white bag to gold bag) but did not notice any reactions from my Bulldog to the new recipe. If you abide by the recommended feeding amount on the bag, you should have a nice, lean bulldog and you can avoid the medical issues and vet bills that accompany overweight Bullies. I highly recommend this food as it keeps my dog healthy and active!

review/summary: Our Bulldog loves this food!
review/text: We have been feeding our Bulldog this food for almost all of the 6 years we have had him and he loves it.  We have noticed consistently small stools, virtually no gas, great skin and coat health, and best of all, our dog has never gotten tired of this food.  We normally mix in a different brand every six months or so to keep things interesting for him, but every time we have tried another food on its own without the Royal Canin, our dog does seem happy or interested.<br /><br />Another great point of this food is how little our dog eats.  He is about 75 lbs. and only eats 2 cups of food a day.  His weight stays consistent with only daily walks.  He is an apartment dog and sometimes it is difficult to get him a lot of exercise.<br /><br />We are very happy with this food and so is our dog.  Best of all he is very healthy and we only see our vet for annual check ups.

review/summary: Best food for a bully
review/text: My bulldog does so well on this food, I doubt I will ever switch him off of it. It has helped tremendously with his gas, which I once thought I was doomed to deal with the rest of his life. His coat is shiny and pretty, and his weight is just perfect according to the vet. He also doesn't eat as fast as he used to (I think the shape of the kibble forces him to slow down), which is of course a good thing!

review/summary: The Only food for my French Bulldog
review/text: My 3 year old French Bulldog was raised on the Puppy version and now the adult. The shape of the food means he has to slow down when eating and cant just swallow it whole. It keeps his gas under control as well (notorious for bulldogs). He's at a healthy weight, skin and coat look great and always get compliments from the Vet on his overall condition. It's more expensive then the grocery store food, but Bulldogs have certain needs that can be properly met with traditional dog food. If you have a bulldog (any variety) This is the food you should be feeding them.

review/text: My BD is about 20 months old and has been on this food since he was a year.  He weighs about 54 pounds and each bag lasts about 6 weeks.<br /><br />This food definitely helps with flatulence.  It is not completely gone but much better.  As some people have mentioned the shape is very beneficial to allowing them to pick up the food easier making less mess.<br /><br />I save about $6 a bag having it delivered to the house.  The only thing that would make this better would be a subscription service.

I made a comment about the shipping charges being way too expensive but - whatever. It needs to be said.<br /><br />Anyway! About the chorizo itself - it is as a chorizo should be.  I was looking for the small links that I grew up with that we used so much in our dishes.  There are so many products out there that you can buy that don't even come close to what the real thing should be.  And this is the real thing - alot of paprika.  I still have 2 links left that I am saving for a rainy day.  And despite the shipping charges, I would buy these again.

review/summary: This is a wonderful wing sauce
review/text: I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says "Very Hot", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called "Bufalo" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff.

review/summary: Bacon!
review/text: This bacon-flavored salt can be used on pretty much anything to give it a little extra (non-fat, probably non-pork) flavor. I've even used it to season other meats (hamburgers, chicken), which is probably a little strange and just one of the things that gives Americans a bad name in the rest of the world :)<br /><br />Good stuff, albeit a tad pricey...but then again, a shaker of this size will probably last the average user a year or two (and if it doesn't, you've got bigger problems than reading reviews of what flavor of salt to buy on Amazon).

review/text: I've been using this for about 8 months now, have used it for gifts for holidays.  Spread the word! Try 1 tsp in 8 oz of mayo and you've got Baconnaise...great for dips and sandwiches. Add a little milk or buttermilk to that and you've got a great salad dressing. Use it on and in almost everything to give a new layer of complexity to your dishes.  Use a little and it adds a new layer of depth and flavor, add a lot for the distinct bacon flavor.<br /><br />You might as well get the big jug, as it is very reasonable for what you'll get.  There's enough in the jug for you to share your Baconsalt with friends, without cutting your supply short.  Believe me, your friends will be scratching at the door for more.<br /><br />This stuff just might be the best new product of 2008....and 2009!  The boys that invented this stuff are getting rich...the stuff is VERY popular. With good reason.<br /><br />Let the sunshine in!  You'll love this.  Plus, IT'S KOSHER so your jewish friends can get in on the fun!

review/summary: Better to make your own... Not bad but not as good as home made
review/text: Anyone who has a food processor can make far better... And you can make better by using real bacon!  For what this large cannister of bacon salt cost me I could have fried up 3 lbs of lean crispy bacon, bought a cannister of salt, pulled all the fat off my crisp bacon and tossed that bacon in the food processor with the sharp blade until it was pulverized to a fine powder.  Then I add the salt and pulse it a few times to incorporate as I think that salt probably isn't the best for my sharp metal blade.  Instant bacon salt and way better!  Want the other flavors?  Add a few drops of hickory liquid smoke to pick it up a notch.  Jalapeno bacon salt?  Buy some fresh jalapenos and dry them in the oven then toss them in with the bacon when you pulverize.  This isn't rocket science and I agree with other posts... if ya want to know what this tastes like just buy a bottle of bacos and smash them into a salt like substance to sprinkle around.  I am not a fan of bacos as they taste like all smoke and salt with a fake bacon taste you burp up for the next 2 hours.  Home made is way better but I got to hand it to the inventors of this... they are getting rich!  Great Idea!  Maybe someday they'll add a "natural line" made with real bacon.
