review/summary: Good, but there are better.
review/text: This chili kit is pretty good but compared to a kit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO622G">Ass Kickin' Chili Fixins, 16-Ounce Muslin Bags (Pack of 6)</a>my mother-in-law gave me it is not quite as good.  The Amazon price for a dozen is better than what I paid for in the grocery store.<br /><br />To compare this to the Ass Kickin' chili above, I would say that the Ass Kickin' chili has bit more flavor.  But it also takes much more time to prepare.

review/summary: 2 alarm chili kit
review/text: I have used this product for years.  Recently, our supermarket stopped carrying the 2 alarm chili kits. I found these through Google and Amazon, and ordered them. Now I have a stock on hand.  Wick Fowler's 2 Alarm is my gold standard for chili.

review/summary: CHILI DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!
review/text: I discovered Wick Fowler's 2 Alarm Chili Kit about 6 or 7 years ago in my local supermarket.  This fantastic kit along with a few additional ingredients such as tomato sauce and diced tomatoes makes the best chili my husband and I have ever tasted.  The combination and measurement of the spices is perfect.  My supermarket sometimes runs out of this kit so I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.  Once you try it, you most likely will never make chili any other way.

review/summary: AWESOME QUICK CHILI
review/text: We were the Original HORMEL Chili family before they went and changed that recipe all up. So about ten years ago we found this & tried the False Alarm & 2 Alarm & we were sold!<br />As a working wife & mom this is fantastic. I brown the meat the evening before and throw in all kinds of different beans (black eyed peas, limas, butter, navy, pintos, kidneys, green, etc) in the crock pot and come home to a fantastic ready made dinner. Even better the next night. Our house loves it as a Chili Mac (served over macaroni with a lil cheese). YUMMY! We normally find it much cheaper at ODDLOTS or BIGLOTS but we have purchased cases to give as gifts to family & friends. If you are looking for something where you can control the heat & consistency yet, want something fast & easy - THIS IS IT!

review/summary: Great Chili that can be low carb
review/text: This is a really a good tasting mix. Occasionally I'll add extra cayenne to brighten in up--in terms of flames.<br /><br />Texas chili doesn't generally use beans so even with the masa flour it isn't very high carb. I sometimes make ours with venison, which is low fat, or if no one is looking, barbeque pork which is not low fat.<br /><br />Seems like I've used this mix for at least twenty years and was delighted to find it available at Amazon as our small town stores don't carry it.

review/text: I don't understand why they make differnt alarm kits because the only difference is how much red pepper you add.  I only see the 4 alarm version in my supermarket and make it according to taste depending on who I'm serving.  I use it as a base to make a chili dip of my creation.  Like another reviewer said, you could just make up the ingredients yourself, but it makes it easier just to use the mix.

review/summary: Is it the best chili in the known universe?  No, but it's darned close.
review/text: I've rarely had better chili than Wick Fowler's, even by people who really know their stuff.  It's a wonderful blend of spices, full-bodied, flavorful, warm but not hot.  I usually swap out beer for the water, and I find that using a really rough grind on the hamburger makes a huge difference on its deliciousness.  I also toss in a can of Goya kidney beans.  Prepared exactly according to specs, it's a very good chili.  With a little minor tweaking, it's epic.<br /><br />It's much, much cheaper to buy this product at Amazon than it is by me, where the packages run about $4 each.

review/text: Wick Fowler's Chili used to be my hands down favorite, but the last three times (third time was the fortunate last time) it was clear the recipe or ingredient quality had changed.  The recipe now seems to have to come off much darker and grainer and the flavor is thick and unpleasant.  I will not be purchasing Wick Fowler's Chili ever again - I'm sure I can do better with a made from scratch effort which will not take any significant increase in time, but a more sampling.

review/summary: Sea Salt Tastes Wonderful
review/text: I have eaten Planters peanuts, mixed nuts and cashews for years-but was not a fan of their (roasted) almonds until recently. I do not know if it is just the sea salt or if they are preparing their roasted almonds differently but they are crunchy and tasty now. Prior to the company adapting sea salt-I remember the almonds becoming somewhat soggy overly greasy, and stale tasting. This is no longer the case since Planter's has been seasoning their nuts with sea salt-they are crunchy right down to the last piece, fresh tasting and not overly salty!<br /><br />Awesome improvement!

review/summary: Best Almonds on Amazon
review/text: These have a great taste and a great price.  The sea salt provides a much cleaner taste that "ordinary salt".  These are not too salty, but I also use them in breakfast cereal, so I need to remove most of the salt.  While some might rinse and dry the almonds, I find that putting them in a wire strainer and shaking the salt out in the sink works great.  Other times I leave the salt in.<br /><br />Another good option for these it adding them to Ocean Spray Craisins Sweetened Dried Cranberries - 48 oz (3 Pounds) in a salad.  A very nice combination.  I have also done the same with chicken salad!<br /><br />Great, versatile product.

review/summary: "Buttery vanilla" is the perfect description.
review/text: This honey is very pale, thick, and translucent, almost opalescent. It's actually rather pretty when you let it run through a fork. The smell and taste are both mild but pleasant. The smell is similar to vanilla, and the taste is a buttery vanilla. It has an immediate aftertaste that is a bit bitter, but a sweetness that lingers for a while. I think the flavor would be quickly lost in cooking or baking (it might works with seafood, but I don't think I'd try it with red meat), but it would go very well with white and green tea, and mild herbal teas.

review/summary: Delightfully Fragrant and Deliciously Smooth Tea !
review/text: I love this green tea!  When prepared correctly (especially with delicate teas, such as green and white teas) you will experience the most delightfully fragrant and smooth tea ever!<br /><br />Jasmine is believed to be the world's most popular flavored green tea; since I love the scent of jasmine anyway, I thought I'd give it a try.  My first cup was at a local Chinese restaurant in Richardson, TX (of all places, right?...but true!).  The sweet scent of jasmine enveloped the restaurant; my guests and I were immediately presented with this beautiful Chinese Tea Setting of jasmine green tea (already steeped and strained).  OMG! First sip and I was hooked!  With a dash of sugar the green tea  and jasmine flavor just popped. Absolutely delicious!<br /><br />I was advised that one tea bag will yield 2.5 cups (OR a small tea pot).  Brewing good tea requires good preparation. Start with cold fresh water and bring kettle it to a boil.  Let hot water settle for awhile.  Next, prepare your tea pot with one tea bag.  Pour hot water into tea pot.<br /><br />Follow these guidelines for appropriate water temperature and steeping times for jasmine tea varieties.<br /><br />  * Black: Use boiling water and steep for 3 to 5 minutes<br />  * Oolong: Use boiling water and steep for 2 to 3 minutes<br />  * Green: Use 160�F water and steep for 1 to 2 minutes<br />  * White: Use 185�F water and steep for 5 to 8 minutes<br /><br />Adhering to the appropriate water temperature and steeping time is critical for making good tea. Too much steeping and your tea will be bitter; too little and the tea will be thin and weak. Water that is too hot for delicate teas like green and white will compromise the tea's light flavor.<br /><br />Jasmine tea, particularly, green and white varieties, are also wonderful for iced tea. The jasmine fragrance and light sweetness are perfect for a hot day. To make iced tea, brew several servings of tea at once and cool.<br /><br />For white and green teas, allow the tea to cool completely before you add ice. Adding ice to the hot tea may dilute the delicate flavor too much, making it taste weak and flavorless.<br /><br />Hope this helps in brewing a perfect cup/pot of Jasmine Green Tea!

review/summary: Flavorful Jasmine Tea
review/text: I recently purchased this Jasmine tea and I have to say that I did not regret it. This tea, is the most flavor and tasteful tea, I have ever drunk in my life. This package was sent all the way from Taiwan. So you probably wind up with a little waiting time but it's definitely worth it. Also, if you are a Jasmin tea drinker who drinks this hot item frequently I would go ahead and order 2 packages, therefore you safe the delivery cost.<br /><br />This tea is just awesome!!!

Amazon took me to Plush Image and the fantastic tea fairies that magically made the tea show up on my door step in record time.

The package was quickly opened and within was my much anticipated bounty....Stassen Pure Jasmine Green Tea... I applaud the people at Plush Image not just for providing a quality product and providing it quickly....but more importantly for allowing me to complete my quest for this rare high quality tea...in a bag.

review/summary: The quality of this tea is, simply put, AMAZING
review/text: I wasn't expecting to like this tea so much considering its value, but all the reviews here are dead-on!  The effervescent jasmine is an aroma you can enjoy as soon as you take the tea bag out of the box, and I appreciate how the tea is packed in cases of 4 25-packs as opposed to individually wrapped tea bags.  Excess packaging would feel like a waste the way I am going through this tea at work; it's been a helpful tool in transitioning away from coffee.  I like how the tea is very smooth with subtle notes of floral flavors.  It's something you definitely need to try for yourself, though I'd advise to wait a couple minutes after your kettle shuts off before steeping your tea.  Whenever I start steeping my tea as soon as the water is boiled, it always comes out over-brewed.

review/text: I initially bought this to try and re-produce a recipe that I had tried someplace.<br />I never made it that far.<br />I got my package, opened the canister, sniffed it, and fell in love. There's no describing this if you haven't smelled it. My hopes for recreating the long recipe were dashed all to heck because I couldn't wait that long to get the rest of the ingredients. Instead, I opened a fresh pack of chicken thighs, rubbed this spice all over them, let them sit for about 20 minutes and broiled those thighs in the oven on low. The result was my house smelling like an indian restaurant, my tummy growling, and my fingers tapping in anticipation of the amazing tastes that were about to come out of that chicken.<br /><br />I can't say if it's better quality than any other brand but I do know that it was A-mazing, and I won't even attempt to try another brand.<br />Be aware of the size though when buying it. I knew it was a small container, and that was good for me because I had never tried it before. In the future I'll be looking for a much larger package. This has officially become my go-to spice for chicken when I'm lazy.

review/summary: Best Dijon out there!
review/text: I have sampled many Dijon mustards, and I must say that this is, in my opinion, the very best tasting Dijon mustard available.  While all mustards have a characteristic "heat" to them, many mustards rely solely on that heat to get them by.  This mustard has a robust flavor, reflecting a combination of flavorful mustard seeds with a flavorful wine base.  In essence, mustard, any mustard, is a combination of ground mustard seed and vinegar.  Other spices may be added, and different vinegars may be used, but this mustard from Fallot has what I consider to be the optimal combination of the two main ingredients with no other non-mustard flavors to detract from the primary flavor profile, namely Dijon mustard.  This mustard leans more towards the mild side of the heat spectrum, so those seeking a mustard burn on the palate will be disappointed.  I have also sampled some of the other fallot mustards with the various additives (i.e. basil, raspberry, honey, etc.) and they are all nice, too, if a bit limited in their usefulness (raspberry Dijon only works with so many dishes).  However, this mustard, the plain, original Fallot Dijon, can blend seamlessly into the background of so many dishes.  For those of you who seek a proof of these claims, just put this mustard to the simplest and most telling moutarde test there is: vinaigrette.  mix a spoonful of this Fallot Dijon with a few teaspoons of wine vinegar, some salt, pepper, and herbs (fresh thyme is always reliable), and about a 1/2 cup of olive oil and you will understand the sublime versatility of this excellent Dijon mustard!

This is a total waste of money if you live in a town with at least one Asian grocery store.<br />Go to your Asian grocery, preferably Japanese, and purchase dried bonito flakes, i.e. katsuobushi.  Katsuobushi is way cheaper and probably much better quality, as it's meant for human consumption.  There should only be one ingredient.  Bonito.  One of the ingredients we Japanese use to make dashi stock.

review/text: A new pet supply store opened in my area a few weeks ago, they gave me a free sample of this stuff, and told me if I bought some I could return any unsed portion if my cats did not like it. They know what they are doing, I went back and told them this is Kitty Crack. My 1.5 year old male has started refusing to eat unless I put some of this in his food. He races me to the kitchen when I go to it for anything, hoping I'll give him some more Kitty Crack. The six month old kittens gobble it up too. The 4 oz bag is less expensive than the 1 oz container, so I'll be ordering from Amazon a lot. I can only hope my male gets tired of it :)

review/summary: My cat's all-time favorite!
review/text: I am thrilled to find that these flakes are offered on Amazon now!  I had been getting them from a small pet store that may or may not have had them in stock because they were so popular and flew off the shelves.<br /><br />I have a small feral rescue cat who needs medicine for 5 days every month.  He is a skittish little guy and I hated that I had to chase the poor thing down to give him his daily doses during the treatment course.  When we tried these flakes though - it was incredible.  They literally right all wrongs in his world and he now BEGS for his medicine and takes it happily because he knows he's getting these afterward.  (He always did get a treat after medicine, it's just that these were the jackpot.)  He and his brother also get a bit every night before bed, and they've been trained to "say please" for them - so cute!  He is a lovable little guy, and these treats have made adjusting to unfortunate necessities (nail trimmings, etc.) all better.<br /><br />On the website of the company who makes these flakes, there are a lot of glowing anecdotes too (including one from me).  :-)  Another pet owner even claimed that she needed to keep her flakes in the fridge because it was the only place in the house that her cat didn't get them out itself and eat through the packaging to get to the fish inside.<br /><br />My cats have enjoyed other treats over the years, but nothing has come close to these - I highly recommend them.  We use so many that I get the 4 oz. package, but transfer it to a harder container to prevent excess crumbling (my cats don't like the fish dust at the bottom of the bag, so that's a way to minimize it).

review/summary: Will make your cat a snob
review/text: I bought this because I read the reviews and it seemed like a higher quality snack for my cat.  Boomer the cat at first was dubious to the idea of the flakes.  I thought to myself, Boomer, you are spoiled because I try to feed you different things all the time. This wasnt exactly a cheap snack, so he was gonna try it, one way or another. I had to mix it into his kibble so that he would HAVE to try it.  After about three days, I noticed he started eating around the kibble and only eating the flakes... >.&lt; Spoiled cat.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: I have a Keurig coffee maker, which brews a fresh cup of gourmet coffee, tea, or cocoa in less than a minute. If you are not familiar with this machine, it is wonderfully convenient, especially for me, as I only make 1 or two hot beverages at home per day. But I am not reviewing the Keurig coffee maker. I am here to write a glowing review for "Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K-Cups for Keurig Brewers."<br /><br />In the winter hot cocoa is my favorite coffee alternative, and Caf&eacute; Escapes Cafe Mocha is my favorite brand/blend. I have tried 2-3 other brands but nothing compares to the full flavor of this product.<br /><br />I do not taste any artificial sweeteners, and I am sensitive to sugary substitute tastes. I use the 6 oz setting, and the rich, chocolate flavor with the extra tang of coffee is delicious. I used to prefer Starbucks mocha, but now when I compare the two, Starbucks comes across as too heavy, almost syrupy in comparison.<br /><br />This product contains milk, soy and tree nuts (highly refined coconut oil). It is trans fat and gluten free. The caffeine content is estimated at less than 10 mg per serving and the cocoa is sweetened.<br /><br />I highly recommend Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K-Cups for cocoa and mocha lovers.<br />Jana Perskie

review/text: This is one of the BEST flavored coffee I have tried for my Keurig and I've had my coffee maker for almost 2 years. However, I must admit this does taste a lot like a rich flavored hot chocolate.<br /><br />By reading some of the other reviews, I don't think a lot of people are using the correct cup setting. You need to use the setting right next to the tea-cup with saucer setting. It is not watered down taste at all!!! Just the opposite. It has a nice, dark, rich, sweet flavor to it. You don't even need to add any sugar, sweetners, milk etc. to it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Cafe Mocha!!

review/text: I like the Mocha's at Tim Horton's too, and this stuff tasted pretty good.  I was just wondering if it contained any caffeine at all though.  Couldn't find that information anywhere.  I expected a mix of chocolate and coffee flavor, and it's heavily slanted to the chocolate side.  It tastes like a cup of hot chocolate, which is OK, but I would've just bought hot chocolate if that's all I wanted.  I rate it as just OK for now.

review/summary: It's watery hot chocolate, folks.
review/text: It's not bad, per se. I wouldn't call it a mocha by any stretch of the imagination.  It's more akin to watered down hot chocolate.  And if you like strong flavored coffee, you're unlikely to detect the presence of coffee flavor in this K-cup.  I'm sure, given the limitations of what you can put in a coffee pod, this isn't a horrible failure.  But let's call it what it is--watery hot chocolate that may have a detectable coffee flavor.  Feel free to try this one, but expect to taste what I have described, and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Not a mocha, but good chocolate flavor
review/text: If I'm not looking for a full caff-kick out of my B60 brews, I usually put a teaspoonful of Quik powder into my cup after brewing, just to give it a hint of chocolate flavor (I was raised on the stuff, so go figure). After awhile I wondered if there was something out there that would give me the same taste without me having to dump the powder in. When I saw the Cafe Mochas at the local BB&B I couldn't resist buying a box.<br /><br />Ok, the good: Yummy, rich chocolate flavor (I never brew more than 8 oz., so I won't attest to the jumbo cup quantity); a welcome treat on cold days and/or nights.<br /><br />The bad: The coffee flavor is just barely there, if at all. It's almost imaginary, or maybe even psychological? A quick look into the K-cup will also show you that it's not even filtered---just straight up powder, really. It's only my discriminating chocolate buds that tell me that it's not simply hot cocoa. Well, maybe it is, but there's a little twist to it. So maybe that's the "cafe" part? =)<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a real Cafe Mocha, this isn't it. But I will give it 4 stars 'coz it's an enjoyable and tasty drink nevertheless.

This is instance cocoa with some instant coffee mixed in--no magical combination of yummy coffee flavor roasted into beans or anything too fancy.  Brew this on the "small" setting on your Keurig and top with some whipped cream for a nice low-caf demitasse.  Or, brew a cup of coffee on the normal setting of your choice on the Keurig and then add a "small" brew of this K-Cup on top of it.  Similar effects can be achieved, however, by dumping a packet of Swiss Miss into a hot cup of coffee and stirring.

Here's the ingredient list:<br /><br />  INGREDIENTS:SUGAR, ALKALIZED COCOA POWDER, CREAMER (HYDROGENATER COCONUT OIL, GLUCOSE SYRUP, SODIUM CASEINATE (FROM MIK), SODIUM POLYPHOSPHATE, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM STEAROYL-2-LACTYLATE, SILICON DIOXIDE), INSTANT COFFEE, MALTODEXTRIN, SALT, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR, SILICON DIOXIDE, SUCRALOSE. CONTAINS: MILK, SOY, TREE NUTS<br />CONTAINS: MILK, SOY, TREE NUTS<br /><br />I don't mind instant coffee desperate situations, but when I pay this fashionable price for some coffee, I want some actual coffee warranting this price. After you brew one of these and open up the K-Cup you'll notice a little bit of powder residue and no coffee grounds whatsoever as you would with the coffee K-Cups.<br />If the package listed powder in every place it listed coffee or mocha, I wouldn't fault them at all, but after tasting this product and opening the K-Cup and having no trace of 'coffee' anywhere I feel a little duped.<br />If cocoa is about 1/4th the price of regular coffee, this product should be also. Like I said initially if you like those 'International Coffee' deals, go for it, you should like this product...But will you like the price?

review/text: Cafe Mocha is just instant coffee with cocoa and sugar. The K-cup is empty when it's done making coffee. So I guess if you like instant coffee, it's fine, but I wanted ground coffee with mocha flavoring. Main ingredient is sugar and it's 60 calories per cup. I won't throw it away--it does taste good--but I won't drink it every day. If you made a few of them and added ice and cream, it would be comparable to a drive-thru Iced Mocha Cafe.

It does have a hint of coffee flavor, but my thinking is this was designed for people who are not "coffee people" to be able to enjoy a richly flavored "coffee" in the Keurig brewer. I got a Keurig to curb my Starbucks habit, and have to admit this k cup is not an even trade. I suggest, if you have bought these and dislike them, to brew a small cup of another regular coffee k cup and add this to it. If you are looking for a rich coffee with a mocha flavor, this is not it. But it is an enjoyable warm drink with coffee and chocolate flavor.

review/text: I agree with the others who have given this a poor review. Tastes like watered down hot chocolate with a hint of coffee flavor. Open up the used k cup and it's empty. Definetely not worth the money for instant coffee and hot chocolate mix, and then not enough of it to give any decent flavor.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: Where's the logic here? A $100 machine to brew INSTANT coffee. Ugh! I thought this coffee would have a nice froth, but it's simply coffee powder and cocoa powder mixed together. This KCup doesn't even have a filter, so I was very surprised about the difference in price. [You get two FEWER cups in this box, and it costs more!]<br /><br />I got my cups at Kohl's retails store. I know they have a very liberal return policy, but I didn't have the heart to return them...BUT I'll know better for next time. My suggestion: Go to the Keurig.com site to check the reviews of the "bizillion" coffees/teas/cocoas that are availble for the Keurig units!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030H1WW0">Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 16 pack</a>The perfect combo if you prefer a more subtle coffee flavor.  Still has the kick of a cup of joe without being overpowering.  I add some powdered creamer for added richness, but it is not really necessary as the product is rich & flavorful as it is.
