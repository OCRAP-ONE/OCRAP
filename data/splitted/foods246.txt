review/summary: Whole Yummy Wheat
review/text: I bought these mainly to get free shipping for a case of silken tofu. I have yet to try the tofu, but I did try the Shibolim whole wheat soup croutons in a super salad I made for dinner. I'm not big on soups as I am with salads and croutons makes for a nice topper. These being so tiny had me concerned they would get lost in my salads. They are a welcome change from the boulder croutons I usually buy. I would buy these again as they are yummy.

review/summary: I am nuts for corn nuts
review/text: If you've never had corn nuts the best way I can describe them is by stating that they are hard, crunchy, salty and definetly require that you eat them with a beverage. The best snack I can compare it to are the crunchy japanase peas but more dense and with a corn taste ;)<br /><br />However, if this your first experience with corn nuts, I recommend the Rach flavor or original unless your into spicy. They aren't super spicy but they are tangy. I love to eat them with lime and additional chile sauce (like tapatio).

review/summary: Everlasting treat ball
review/text: There is a definate reason these everlasting treat balls are always sold out of the big local pet food stores- they are fantastic! My dog is a very rough chewer- he can even rip apart kongs, and he loves these treat balls. They don't last him for "hours" per say as the package states, but enough time that I am able to have him busy when we have company over. It's especially helpful if you insert a treat ball in both ends of the blue ball, making it especially challenging to pop out the edible discs. Not for an everyday treat obviously, due to quantity and prices, but I will definately buy them again!

review/summary: Not Everlasting, but Not Bad!
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a><br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are pretty neutral smelling, which is a plus for this line. I know dogs are all about the smell of things and the stinkier something is, the more they like them...but when you have to share the household with a dog, you need to find a happy medium. This is ours when company comes over. It has no real smell, but they aren't her favorite either.

review/summary: Vanilla Mint is a hit!
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the liver flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (BBQ and Vanilla Mint). I put a Liver and a Vanilla Mint in the treat ball and she went LOVED the VM. It took effort this time to enjoy it, and she worked on it for over a week until there was nothing left but a disk of the treat in the treat ball (so I removed it, gave it to her, and put a new treat in the ball). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!

review/summary: Great Toy!
review/text: I was looking for something that would keep my dog busy, but also wasn't food that he would just eat and be done with.  This treat, combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball is such a great solution.  My dog (about 60 lbs, Dalmation) has so much fun trying to get this out of the ball, and he seems to love the taste of the Vanilla Mint more than any others.  This takes him a while to eat, but also isn't a lot of food.  it's a pretty decent sized treat.  When I first got it, it took him a while to get the treat all the way out, even days!  Now he can do it in an hour so so, but I still think it's a great buy.<br /><br />Just make sure to get the right size for your dog! Too small and they will rip it apart.

review/summary: All four dogs love these
review/text: I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is!  These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls.  We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each.  These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and  giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy.  Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but this is definitely the favorite followed by the barbecue/smoke one.  The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger.  Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.

review/text: I have two golden retrievers one is 10 mos old the other is 8 mos old.  Every now and then I need to actually get things done, and with two goldens its quite a challenge.  I like to give them their everlasting treat ball filled with the vanilla mint treat.  It keeps them quite and busy for about an hour.  The treats can be a little difficult to get into the ball and first, but the more you use it the easier it is.  It seems like the big box pet stores and also my local supermarket do not carry these in size large.  They only seems to stock small and mediums.  Very convenient ordering through Amazon.  If you need a little time, these work great to keep the pups occupied and they have nice breath too!<br /><br />Cheryl

We have tried the Chicken and Liver flavors as well but the vanilla mint is by far the favorite.

Many other pets(especially non-chewers who don't get enough chewing d/t non-interest in chew treats(like my poor dental health bearded collie) take much, much longer(months). Does produce a bit of a non-pleasant odor when thoroughly slimed by my voracious chewer Labradoodle.

review/summary: "Everlasting" is not quite a good description
review/text: I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by "everlasting" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.

I should have paid more attention to the other review that complains of over-sweetening.

review/text: Was looking to buy some dried strawberries when I came across this offering.<br /><br />In the description it says air dried strawberries without sulphur dioxide.<br /><br />In the picture shown the ingredients list sulphur dioxide!<br /><br />Not saying it's good or bad but why can't they describe what they are selling accurately???

review/summary: Not Freeze-Dried
review/text: I ordered this item because I thought it was freeze-dried kinda like dehydrated, but it's not!  They taste like they were pickled and rolled in sugar!  Yuck!  The original strawberry taste is gone.  The company sent them to me very promptly and in great packaging, but I really thought it was something else...  The page does not provide a good description of what the product really is.

review/summary: should be called "candied strawberries"
review/text: I wantd to make the Barefoot Contessa's recipe for strawberry scones, which calls for dried strawberries.  Expecting to get something akin to dried cranberries or raisins, I was disappointed, these should be called candied strawberries since they hardly resembled fruit and were coated in sugar.  They were OK in the recipe, but I can't feel good about feeding these to my family.  Save your money (they are pricey!)and use craisins instead - or just go for chocolate.

review/summary: A GENUINE TREAT
review/text: I had never cooked or baked with dried strawberries until I came across a recipe for granola that I had to try, and it called for dried strawberries.  I purchased a bag of these Barry Farm strawberries, and I was so amazed by their pure flavor and soft texture that I came back for more ... and more!  Barry Farm must choose berries at their peak of ripeness because the berries are rich in pure strawberry flavor with a perfect consistency. I am particular about the food I buy, and I want good quality.  Why bother to bake something with inferior ingredients?  I would highly recommend Barry Farm Dried Strawberries to anyone.  They are truly excellent.

review/summary: Not really dried strawberries
review/text: When I ordered these I thought they would be freeze dried strawberries that I could use in cereal or for snacking. But they are somewhat dehydrated strawberries that have been super sweetened. I will use them for baking instead. Just be aware that they are not plain dried strawberries.

review/summary: Kitty Carbo loaded Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review/text: I just started using this about 2 months ago and I love it!  It has really transformed my baked chicken from so-so to a well-seasoned, tasty dish.  When I first tried it on fish, I used too much, not realizing the sodium content.  Next time, I just adjusted accordingly, added a pat of butter and ended up with delicious tilapia.  I recommend it as a staple to your spice cabinet.

review/text: We have been using "original" Spike since 1989.  It's great for marinating chicken, steak and pork and as a substitute for baked potatoes and corn on the cob.  We use it on just about everything.  The product incorporates dozens of natural ingredients and altogether create great flavor that is better than Dash and other similar products.  Our guests always ask "what did you use" and have begun purchasing it for themselves.  It's not easy to find at your grocery store; sometimes placed in the international section, sometimes in the spice section.  We're very happy to have found it sold on Amazon.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O8KIWC">Spike Seasoning - 3 oz - Salter Flakes</a>

review/summary: Needs to be more spicier.
review/text: I am trying to find a great chai to make at home when I am not treating myself to a Starbuck's chai. I was drinking Pacific Chai (spicy) for a long time which I liked for the most part. (I made it into a vanilla chai by adding a 1/2 tsp of French Vanilla coffee-mate creamer to about a 10-oz cup of water, with 3 tbs of chai powder, while in the blender.) After a year or so, I wanted to try something different because the Pacific Chai containers were always 3/4 full - it became annoying. But it turns out that some other brands are the same.<br /> I love vanilla chai but I didn't prefer the Pacific vanilla chai because it wasn't spicy enough, and the same thing goes for Big Train Chai Vanilla - not spicy enough. I also did not like Mocafe Vanilla Chai.<br /> I would love to find the perfect vanilla chai that has great spicy flavor.

review/text: I owned a coffee shop for a time, and now that I no longer do, I gotta get my fix elsewhere. Amazon is way cheaper than going to a coffee shop and spending 5 times the money. Plus, I can make it the way I like it...thank you, Amazon, for such a great deal on the most delicious drink on Earth!

review/summary: Best chai
review/text: Big Train is the best instant chai! Make it with boiling hot water , stir it briskly and top it off with some cream or milk and it relaxes and calms you. Great when you want to unwind and have something  more substantial than just tea but not as rich as hot chocolate  and not as stimulating as coffee. Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty - better as an additive
review/text: Since this product is quite sugary, I use it for my coffee which not only makes the coffee taste better but I am using less than a scoop every time so it helps conserve.<br /><br />The taste is smooth, creamy with a little kick.<br /><br />Also, it comes with a scooper.<br /><br />I will buy more of this when I run out.

review/text: I have tried a million variations of Chai - in my opinion, this is by far the best one. I am so addicted to it, I drink at least 1 cup a day. I should note that it's more on the sweet side and less on the spicy side, which not all people may like.

review/summary: possibly the best tasting; definitely the best value.
review/text: in truth, this is the only kind i have ever purchased, so i can't make a fair comparison.<br /><br />what i CAN say, however, is that even if you go to the manufacturer's website, this deal they have on amazon is a better deal pricewise PLUS it comes in the cans instead of the bags.  PLUS each can comes with a scoop, so there is no need to measure anymore.<br /><br />and lastly, there is the inclusion of the HOT CHAI LATTE Famous Barista Recipe.  now in all truth, i have always said i was making myself a chai latte, when i wasn't.  the barista recipe is the latte in that it adds the milk, which i never did.<br /><br />so that's my take on this.  i hope it helps you in your decision making.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Homemade
review/text: So it's Chai.  If you don't know Chai is a spiced tea.  In this case the overtone is vanilla.  It's got a little of everything you might get in pumpkin pie spice.  It's very tasty.  I use two scoops in a twice as large glass and I make it just with hot water.  You don't need to add milk.  Many of the local coffee bars actually use this brand.  You could of course make this whole thing yourself but this is a GREAT alternative. And of course Amazon is a great place to get it.  I actually love that they kind of remind me every couple of months to get more because I usually need it.

review/text: I love this stuff.  I have one of those small individual serving blenders and I love to make Vanilla Chai freezes.  I use ice and skim milk and this powder.  This brand is great, and you definitely get the most for your money.  I used to get Vanilla Chai freezes at Borders for like 3-4 dollars, Starbucks makes frozen Chai's for just under 5.  I've also tried Tastefully Simple Chai, but it was really really expensive.  It's nice to be able to make it at home whenever I want (which is basically every day!) and it's more cost effective.

review/text: I've tried many different brands of chai over the years and Big Train's Vanilla Chai is one of the best out there.  My boyfriend loves it, too!  It's the only brand of chai that he'll drink.  Plus, you get so many servings for the price and free super saver shipping!  One of the gourmet food shops in the mall sells the small pouches of the same chai for $8 and there are only a few servings in the pouch.  It is definitely worth stocking up by buying the two can pack that's offered here!

review/text: I love hot chocolate, heck , I love chocolate period. I was a frequent fan of a certain book store that sounds like charms and local{hee hee} they use to serve there own brand of chai and then time stood still ... they stopped selling it. I called the store frantically to see if anyone could find some in a dusty old wharehouse in Cleveland...no really in Cleveland , Ohio that is where I discovered the yummy warm exotic substance.A very good sales rep informed me that Big Train Chai has the closest taste. So off in search of Big Train. I found it on Amazon and also at a wholesale club but I paid more at the wholesale club for just one can. On Amazon, I paid 19.99 for 2 cans AWESOME!! The flavor is creamy not like chai tea but like chai milk tea and it says to add one scoop per every 6 ounces but I use less for a larger cup. The warm cozy feeling I get is so pleasing it reminds me of the Big "O"{wink, wink}try  a cup, warning chai tea may frequent gas for some, and the caffine levels are probably much lower than tea, chocolate and obviously coffee.

review/text: Yes, this is delicious vanilla chai...the best I've tasted. However, the product description says "99% caffeine-free" and this simply can't be true. I ordered the single-serving packets of this product and the package clearly states the caffeine amount. Each serving actually contains 65mg of caffeine per serving. That's almost as much caffeine as a tall Starbucks espresso-based drink. Almost twice the amount of caffeine in a can of Coke!<br /><br />If you need the caffeine boost, enjoy! But if you're watching your caffeine intake for whatever reason, be aware!

review/summary: Absolutely the best chai tea I've found
review/text: After discovering chai tea a few years ago, I have since been hooked.  I have tried several coffee shop versions as well as a couple store bought varieties as well and can easily say this is my favorite chai tea.  The taste reminds me of that of a cinnamon roll with a very rich, smooth flavor.  Most other chai teas taste more like gingerbread to me, which while enjoyable, not my "cup of tea".  ;)  My only minor complaint would be that I usually end up with small amount of pulp in the last sip.  I'm not sure if this is due to the water not being hot enough but it's not enough to keep me from loving this product.

review/summary: It WAS my favorite...
review/text: I have been ordering Big Train Vanilla and Spiced Chai for just over 2 years on Amazon's subscription.  It was so good and it rivaled the chai at my favorite coffee house (NOT Char-bucks).  I always LOVED it, and enjoyed a cup each morning as I braced for the coming day.  I did, that is, up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher, so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.<br /><br />The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai, so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.  That horrible flavor is still there, so I know it isn't related to the way it's mixed.<br /><br />I am very disappointed because, like I said, it was my favorite beverage in the morning.  After trying so many different things over the last 4 months, I have finally selected another brand to try out.  I hope it is as good as this one used to be.

review/text: You get to large cans of the powder. The flavor is rich and the best part is you can make it as sweet or as week as you like. One scoop per cup is usually plenty. I mix mine with a little milk to for a more creamy texture. I've tried a few other mixes and some have had a nasty smell and after taste. I used to buy the Target brand in the green can but they discontinued that and now make it in a silver can and its one of those fake chemical smelling and tasting mixes...YUK.<br /><br />The only complaint about this is that 25% of the can is empty so you really don't get a full can. Other than that the flavor is great. Very close to the Duncan Donuts kind.
