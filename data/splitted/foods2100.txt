review/summary: Very good tea, works wonders!!
review/text: This tea is very tasty and wonderful for a sore throat. It gently coats the throat. You can drink it hot, or make up a full water bottle full to sip all day long when you can sit and sip hot tea. I use to send my kids to school with a water bottle and 3 bags in it, they loved taking it with them and help them through thier day when not feeling well. I enjoy this tea even when I am not ill too. Ive not bought in bulk like this ad shows. I do not know this seller, I just know the product is very good.

review/summary: immune booster
review/text: myrrh gum is known to quadruple white blood cells in lab mice in lab studies. so this is a fantastic immune booster. you can get this in supplemental form but in this version its fresher. but you'll need to grind it down to a fine powder before making a tea since its rock hard and not gummy soft.<br />recommended for people with low white blood cell count. works in a relatively short amount of time too.

review/text: I LOVE tea.  But I don't like the caffine so I drink decaf which sometimes lacks body and flavor...or has a odd flavor.  Tetley is great.  The flavor is like their regular tea.  Even when I let it steep a little too long it doesn't get that bitter taste some tea has.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I had to drive some distance to find it and although it was worth the drive I can now get online and order it. Yea!  Thanks Amazon. If you like tea this is one you will enjoy.

review/summary: Very clean taste.
review/text: Elderberry jam or jelly is never available in stores around here anymore so I decided to look on Amazon. I ordered this Suro jam and also Mrs. Miller's Homemade elderberry jelly.  In a taste test in front of an open window the Suro jam was superior for it's pure clean elderberry essence. I was surprised that, in comparing the two, an off flavor was apparent in the Mrs. Miller's jelly, which I would describe as musty or like there was honey mixed in.  I had not picked up on this when eating the jelly on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Of course I am comparing an expensive jam with a less expensive jelly.  On the down side the Suro jam was a little on the thin side and the numerous seeds are a potential problem for someone with diverticulosis.

review/text: Corn Pops, one of Kellogg's troika of cereals that Moms hate but kids love! (The other two of the troika are Froot Loops and Apple Jacks.)<br /><br />What's there not to love about Corn Pops? They're sweet and crunchy and corn flavored, it's almost like pop corn, in fact I sometimes eat this without the milk like a snack. Moms hate them because of the sugar but a serving size (1 cup) only gives you 14g of sugar vs. 39g in a 12oz can of Coke, and fruit juices all have sugar so you can't really get away from it. And it does contain quite a bit of vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />This individual pack is very handy. You can carry it anywhere with you and all you need is a small carton of milk to make it a meal or a snack. And this individual pack prevents you from overeating it (unless you decide to eat 2-3 of them at once.)<br /><br />So:<br />Pros: Tastes great. Corn pop flavor. Handy size. Convenient on the go. Snack without the milk.<br />Cons: Moms don't like them.

review/text: At first didnt like this tea as my favorite oolong was the Iron Goddess brand.  That is still a personal favorite however this tea is different.  They are both oolong and at first that was confusing, but that tea is much stronger and fragrant, while this tea is quite subtle.  After finishing the first tin this is one of the better finishing teas I've tasted.  After a sip this tea hits lightly and late.  I find myself taking a sip and going into a stare for a few seconds.  Also over the summer this tea was a favorite iced with a bit of maple syrup.  It has an awesome finish iced and is very refreshing.  Highly suggested for those who enjoy a lighter tea.  Fans of Jasmine teas will likely agree with this oolong than a stronger brand.

review/summary: wholesome, mild, and satisfying
review/text: I got these for my husband, since I don't really go for graham crackers.<br />His thoughts:<br />The crackers have a wholesome, natural flavor and satisfying crisp, though a little sweeter might be nicer; the honey-cinnamon flavor is a little subtle for me. They don't have the artificial aftertaste some others have. 3 stars from me, as in "ok"<br />Mine:<br />I like that they are not to sweet. I find most graham crackers obnoxious because of the overly strong flavor and, as he mentions, the aftertaste. Because of the neutrality, they play well with other accompaniments like preserves, or even cheeses. 5 stars from me, oddly enough. I don't like this type of snack, but these were good.<br /><br />This makes an average of 4 stars between us.<br /><br />Some nutritional information:<br />(per serving of 2 full cracker sheets in % daily value)<br />110 Calories, 20 from fat<br />Total Fat 2.5g (4%), 1.5g from monounsaturated "good" fats that are heart-healthy<br />No cholesterol<br />Sodium 130mg (2%)<br />Potassium 85mg (2%)<br />Carbs 21g (7%)<br />Fiber 2g (8%)<br />Sugars 7g<br />Protein 2g<br /><br />Overall, the fiber content is pretty high, and the ingredients list is short and simple. NO high fructose corn syrup or refined sugars, no artificial coloring:<br />Graham flour from whole grains, whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening, sea salt, cinnamon, vitamin E to protect flavor.

review/summary: A new take on an old classic
review/text: Back to Nature is an interesting company.  I have found that there is a level of dualism with their products.  Their mission is to provide "healthy" and "natural" food products.  After trying several of their products, I would say some of them are healthy and natural, but also very high in fat and calories.  Therefore is it safe to say you cannot eat your cake and have it too?<br /><br />This leads me to these oat graham crackers.  Like all of BTN products, it is made in a more natural fashion.  I would say it is better choice than eating tons of candy bars and pizza.  These crackers aren't the lowest in fat and calories, but one could do much worse.<br /><br />As for the taste, these crackers aren't too sweet.  The honey-graham flavor is mild and very pleasant.  These crackers aren't sprinkled with sugar and this allows for the true flavor of honey-graham to shine through.  I let several of my friends try these crackers and they enjoyed them quite a bit.  I also tried a couple of crackers with peanut butter and/or Nutella, which was a nice combination.  These crackers are a bit pricy, but a nice change from traditional graham crackers.

review/summary: Good, Depending on your Taste.
review/text: I was excited to try these: A. because I love Graham Crackers, and B. Because these (while not necessarily GMO free) are at least using more natural (though natural is a very broad term, and is nothing like the term organic where strict regulations are in place to insure there are no GMO's or chemicals used) ingredients than a lot of brands, and so, in that way, they are quite good.<br /><br />  In comparison to most graham crackers, I found them to be overly sweet, and after a couple bites could not eat anymore, and my mouth was filled with an overwhelmingly sweet aftertaste.  I looked on the back of the box and found four different sweetners in these graham crackers (which were: cane sugar, honey, brown rice syrup, and raisin paste).  Though they did taste good, and I did continue eating the graham after the after taste left my mouth, so I guess their good in the fact that you are not likely to eat the whole pack in one sitting.<br /><br />  My husband on the other hand, thought they were tasty graham crackers and did not feel that they were at all overly sweet.  So, it might depend on your over all tolerance for sugar that will determine how well you like these as the flavor itself of the crackers is nice.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/text: Although I don't crave them on a regular basis, I've been a graham cracker fan since I was a kid (Nabisco in the red box is my go-to brand). I was really happy to have the opportunity to sample Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams because I'd already seen them on the shelf at Whole Foods and was tempted to give them a try--fortuitous timing! :)<br /><br />Those who try these will find that they're somewhat different than the commercial grahams they're used to. Since the grahams I buy contain molasses, they're rather heartier than these in flavor albeit not as crisp in texture. There's no getting around the fact that graham crackers are dry--these are no exception. But they have a lovely crispness that's missing in commercial grahams and although the flavor is more delicate than my Nabiscos, it's really nice--not too sweet and the oats carry a sweetness of their own (I love oats). It's nice to find a whole-grain product that's tastes this good.<br /><br />There's no sense in belaboring the point--these are simple graham crackers, after all. But if you like graham crackers and would like to combine a tasty nosh with wholesome ingredients, definitely give these a try--I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/summary: Tastes healthy
review/text: Unlike many other reviewers of this product, I think nothing of pumping my body full of saturated fats, high-fructose corn syrup, or less-than-whole grains.  In fact the Back To Nature graham crackers landed right next to the Keebler ones in my pantry.<br /><br />So that said, I tried.  I tried to like this healthier alternative, and I just can't quite.  The crackers themselves are a bit tough for a graham cracker (you certainly wouldn't want to use them for a pie crust), and the texture is more like a multi-grain bread than less healthy competitors in the cookie aisle.  To be fair the honey flavor is much stronger and truer than Keebler and Nabisco have been able to synthesize and is definitely the high-point of these grahams.  The oats, on the other hand, are also fresh and prominent, and less in a good way.<br /><br />For a non-health food junkie like me, it's just a little too hard to get past the "healthy" taste and texture of the Back To Nature graham crackers.  If you're looking for an alternative to total junk food, this could be your option, just be aware there may be some adjustment while you acquire the taste.

review/summary: Good graham cracker.
review/text: These are good graham crackers that will appeal more to the sweet tooth than than the salt-seeker.  The golden honey makes them a little sweet, but not overly so.  The oat cracker is a bit dry and has a little too much cardboard texture for my taste.  While not over powering, the honey flavor makes them unsuitable for pairing with cheese, in my opinion.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked eating these crackers as cereal with milk.  They do have a bit of a cereal taste and are very dry, so I thought I would give it a try.  It was delicious for about 15 seconds.  At first, it did taste like very good cereal.  However, the crackers quickly dissolve in milk and within a minute my impromptu cereal had become an unappetizing sweet slurry of this crackery porridge.  As the mixture became thinner and thinner as the crackers continued to dissolve, it became inedible.<br /><br />Good crackers, terrible cereal despite reviewer suggestions, probably very good paired with a glass of milk.  Recommended.

review/text: I received samples of both the Honey Oat and the Apple Cinnamon flavors of the Back to Nature Graham crackers to try out and review. I found their flavors to be mellow and very pleasing, rather than the overpowering style that most types of flavored crackers seem to have adopted. I was particularly happy that they weren't wildly overly sweet, the way that I find some graham crackers to be. I had a slight preference for the apple cinnamon flavor, but I tend to find ways to add cinnamon to nearly everything so that's probably just a personal bias rather than an actual reflection on the flavors.<br /><br />I also asked a couple of family members (who tend to eat more sugary food than I do, so they have a more typical perspective on the flavor of things) to take a taste, and they both said that they found them very tasty.<br /><br />The main downside is that graham crackers aren't really great for holding up to the abuse of being shipped. A fair portion of them were broken into a lot of little inconvenient pieces. I suspect that this would be less of a problem to people who are actually being shipped 6 boxes (since the boxes would presumably offer some protection to each other), but I can't be sure of that. If you're doing something where it's important to have graham crackers that are intact, you'd probably better buy more than you expect to need to leave some room for the fact that some are likely to be broken.

review/summary: Pretty good graham crackers.
review/text: These are "healthy" graham crackers with healthy ingredients, and everything recycleable, and they tasted better than I thought they would.  They have a hint of cinnamon that really made the difference for me - without it, I think they would have been somewhat tasteless and bland.  I have to admit that we don't really buy a lot of "healthy" snacks due to lack of flavor, but that's not a problem here because of the cinnamon, which made them taste pretty good.  All things being equal (price, quantity, etc.), I would buy them again, but if they were more expensive, I'd probably just go with regular graham crackers.  However, if you're into natural, healthy foods, these make a great choice.

review/summary: Oat-y, less sweet, healthy tasting graham cracker. Adequate.
review/text: I have always been fond of graham crackers. These are not delicious, and they have a strong oat taste that I found distracting from my ideal graham cracker taste. They also have oats sprinkled on the top of them that are more to remind you that these are oat-based than for any other reason that I can detect. I also have a concept of the size of a graham cracker box, and this box looked significantly smaller in comparison.<br /><br />That being said, I was happy to have this as an option to feed to a young child, for whom high fructose corn syrup and other such ingredients seemed particularly undesirable. They are reasonably tasty (especially for fans of oats) but not fantastic.<br /><br />My single box of graham crackers was shipped by Amazon in a bubble envelope, and many of my graham crackers were broken, particularly around the edges.

review/summary: Tastier than your average graham cracker
review/text: "Viva la difference" for these graham crackers.  As my 3 year old son put it, "The old ones are soft.  These are crunchy."  There is some welcome texture to them.  The first ingredient is actually graham flour.  Not so for the typical brands, which start with enriched flour and don't get to graham flour until after the sugar.  No enriched flour in these at all--graham flour and whole grain oats.  With the exception of monocalcium phosphate (part of the leavening), all ingredients are recognizable and easy to pronounce.  Less fat by a gram, slightly less sodium by a few milligrams, no saturated fat, same amount of sugar (in a comparison with Keebler).

review/summary: so delicious
review/text: I have never been a huge graham cracker fan, as my husband always buys store brand grahams which are dry and floury.  Back To Nature brand has changed my mind.  These are SO good.  They're kind of sweet but not cloying, crunchy without being too dry, and have a really terrific oat flavor.  They taste a lot like naturally sweetened oat cereals, if you've had those before.  The texture is nice, not overly chunky like some natural crackers I've had, but you can still see and feel pieces of oats within the cracker.  They don't come with handy perforations, but that's not much of a problem for me because I eat a whole cracker in a sitting now.  And I've hidden them from my husband, because I am greedy.

review/summary: An acquired taste
review/text: As a long-time fan of graham crackers, I was really looking forward to trying these. However, I initially found the grainy taste and overly flat appearance to be a bit offputting. It was only the idea that these were more healthy than my usual snack that kept me persisting, and admittedly, they did taste a little better. That said, I think a little additional flavoring would really help. I tried the apple version of these as well, and found that the little bits of dried apple really made a huge difference in altering the taste! Those were downright delicious by comparison, even eaten dry without the benefit of peanut butter or anything.

review/summary: Better Tasting And Better For You Than Nabisco
review/text: If you were like me growing up, graham crackers meant the dark blue box of Honey Maid from Nabisco.  However in more recent years I have tried to look for better choices that include natural or organic ingredients as much as possible.  Kashi was one of the first mainstream brands to have offerings in this market, but Back to Nature has really come on in the last few years.  They have multiple offerings in graham crackers including the Golden Honey Oat Grahams.  For me there are two reasons to choose the Back to Nature product over Nabisco:  ingredients and taste.  With the Nabisco product you get both high-fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oils.  If you accept that these are less desirable in the food you eat, Nabisco is not an attractive option.  Back to Nature avoids these and uses (as their name would suggest) natural ingredients instead.  In addition the Back to Nature grahams have 20g of whole grain per serving compared to only 5g in the Nabisco product.  However taste is also important.  At one time I had the idea that you had to give up on taste in order to make the healthier choice.  This is just not true.  I even find now that I like the taste of natural products over that of the artificial.  There is a slight difference for those who love the Nabisco taste.  The Back to Nature have a hint of cinnamon that is not to be found in the Nabisco.  I like it, but it is a difference nonetheless.  In the end I prefer both the taste and the ingredients of the Back to Nature Honey Oat Grahams, and I highly recommend them.

review/text: I have twin toddlers who enjoy graham crackers for a snack.  I immediately gave these to them for a snack the day I received these and they gobbled them up.  Of course, I had to try them as well and I think these have a great taste.  I was a little skeptical based on the "nature/natural" look of the carton and even the "oats" that are sprinkled on the surface of the cracker, but these really do taste as good or better than other graham crackers you may find in the store.  I would not hesitate to buy these again if they were at a competitive price.

review/summary: Satisfying, healthy sweet cracker
review/text: We mostly eat healthy foods--I'm a vegetarian and my husband tries to make sure we eat enough fruit and vegetables every day. However, both of us are quite fond of anything sweet, and I really enjoy a few cookies after dinner each night. The Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers fit both of these requirements--good for you and sweet!<br /><br />The crackers are a natural brown color, lightly sweetened with visible pieces of oats. They don't have any artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors--the sweetness comes from the graham flour and evaporated cane juice (which is really just sugar). There's no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils, which are two things I try to avoid.<br /><br />The crackers are crisp, but not overly crunchy--you don't get the same "snap" that you do from a regular graham cracker. They also crumble in a slightly different, but not bad way, from a regular cracker. When we first tried the crackers, we thought they weren't sweet enough, but then we realized that was probably because we were used to the hyper sweetness of a recent Oreo splurge! The second time we tried the crackers, we found them quite good--sweet but not cloying. The crackers are a little bit dry, I think that is because of some of the missing artificial ingredients. As I usually eat cookies or crackers with a cup of tea, it was not an issue for me--it actually makes them a bit more enjoyable.<br /><br />The package is made from 100% recycled paperboard, and it is not overly large compared to the actual product inside, which is a nice change. We will definitely buy these crackers again, we are happy to find a sweet tasting treat that is not filled with sugar and artificial ingredients.

review/text: When I think of Graham Crackers, I automatically go to those cinnamon and sugar dusted ones that I loved from my childhood. My children, however, think teddy bear shapes with chocolate chips or spongebob with frosting. This has to stop somewhere, right?<br /><br />These were good and crisp but not too crumbly. The oats on the top didn't scare my children and gave the appearance of healthy. I am not one for labels, so I didn't check it against regular graham crackers that don't use "natural" in the title. They were so tasty though that everyone ate them plain. My husband used them to quell his late night sweet tooth and they worked wonderfully.<br /><br />One box includes 3 wax paper wrapped packages. The size is good for tossing 3 large crackers into a bag for a school snack or adding Nutella in between layers to create a great after school snack.

review/summary: Good Healthy Food
review/text: The Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Crackers, like the Apple Cinnamon Oat Graham Crackers I reviewed on Amazon, are different in a good way from traditional graham cracker products. Both crackers are made with whole grain wheat flour with no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors. There is no high fructose corn syrup and no hydrogenated oils in the foods.  The differences between the two crackers start with the contents. There are 7g of sugars in the Honey Crackers compared to 8g of sugars in the Cinnamon Crackers. The Honey Crackers sugars are in the form of honey, raisin paste, and brown rice syrup. The other general contents are the similar in both products: 2.5g fat, 130mg sodium, 85mg potassium, 21g carbohydrates (1g less with the Honey), and 2g protein.<br /><br />The Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers are thin and crunchy, much stiffer in texture than regular graham crackers. The honey taste is more subtle, with only a hint of cinnamon, but delicious. Oat flakes sprinkled on the surface of the light brown crackers making them attractive on the plate.  They are very good with milk, and I like to break them up and put the pieces on top of cereal covered with milk. I prefer the Cinnamon Oat product, but both are very good. The crackers also make a very good light dessert. I will continue to enjoy these crackers in the future.

review/summary: This Back to Nature product is quite tasty!
review/text: I enjoyed this product quite a bit.  I was surprised at how good these were, as a matter of fact.  I like whole-grain textures but some of my family does not.  These Golden Honey Oat Grahams satisfied everyone's taste buds.  When I bit into the first cracker, I was surprised at how sweet the flavor was, even though there are only 7 grams of sugar for one ounce (about 8 crackers, according to the package).  There seems to be a bit of cinnamon in it as well and that is a definite plus.  Most whole-grain graham crackers are too hard and dry and are not so easy to chew.  These grahams, however, are easy to chew and are not any more crumbly than a regular graham cracker.<br /><br />I give this product only 4 stars, mainly because of the price.  I find 3+ dollars for one box to be a bit expensive, especially since the box is smaller than the mainstream brands of graham crackers.

review/summary: Drywall for your dollhouse
review/text: Like I said in my review for this cracker's sister product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKHX1Y">Back To Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat Grahams, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, I don't start with particularly high expectations for anything calling itself a graham cracker, and that's a good thing too. These are some of the driest, blandest, plain old graham crackers I have ever tasted. They are not very sweet or oily, so I suppose they are healthier for you than your typical graham cracker, but man, these are drier than the Mojave. Not surprisingly, 80% of the crackers were broken and one of the packs was very close to being nothing but crumbs or dust. This makes for messy eating, as they sprinkle some oats over the top, which along with the crumbs and dust makes for a Dust Buster holiday. But, when all's said and done, it looks like a graham cracker and tastes like a graham cracker, so if you like graham crackers, you'll probably like these. If not, you can refinish the walls of your favorite dollhouse and paint right over it like regular drywall. Great graham cracker but just an average snack overall, hence the three stars.

review/summary: Natural nutrition
review/text: If you want to eat something that is natural and nutritious with limited sugar, these graham crackers are for you.  The company, Back to Nature, tried to do everything right.  Don't expect sweet and super tasty, but they are a decent snack that give you lots of fiber.<br /><br />The package, which claims lots of good things, like no artificial anything, is a recycled cardboard which is definitely sustainable. The product inside has two individual packets and a substantive cracker with flaky oats on top.  If the taste seems bland (and it is a bit), it can be supplemented with a topping like peanut butter, jelly or fruit.  The cracker is also good for dunking in milk, coffee, etc. It is a healthy snack or ending to a meal.<br /><br />Since most graham crackers made today have a long list of ingredients, many of them unhealthy chemicals or preservatives, I am trying to be careful about the products I buy.  I can understand all the ingredients on this product's box and appreciate their naturalness.  They're about the same price as regular graham crackers; I'd rather spend wisely on good food than food that is bad for your body. They are a good product, but don't expect the sweetness of a typical graham cracker.

review/text: In the whole of it, these Graham crackers are in fact quite good. The are sweet, and have the 'kick' of the oats in addition to add a unique flavor to them.<br />There's also the fact that they are pretty healthy, with much whole grain, only 110 calories a serving, and an all-natural pretty short ingredient list.<br /><br />But...something about them bugs me at the same time. For something that should be used as a snack, they are almost /too/ filling. Sure one could say "just eat less", but two 'sheets' isn't that much in the first place, so while hunger may satiate it just doesn't 'feel' like there's been enough. They are also very dry, even moreso  than most sweet cracker types.<br />There's also the fact that quality control doesn't seem to be the higher -- a couple of the crackers seem a bit burnt.<br /><br />So yeah, they ARE enjoyable, but not really up to snuff.

review/text: A healthy adult take on childhood favorite grahams, these crackers contain a lot of whole grains, and nothing mysterious in the ingredients list.  At 110 calories for 2 cracker "sheets", they would seem a wholesome snack.<br /><br />Compared to "traditional" graham crackers, the texture is firmer, with less of the dissolve-in-your-mouth; they're a bit more effort eat.  I normally use graham crackers mostly to make dessert crusts; I'm not sure the oat-heavy crackers are the the best choice for that purpose.  Since I don't like to stock more than one kind of grahams, I dropped my rating by 1 star.<br /><br />The pleasingly readable ingredients list, the 55% post-consumer recycled box, and the stamp of the Nature Conservancy (a respected habitat preservation group) help give credibility to the "Back to Nature" branding.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Never knew that regular graham crackers were so bad...
review/text: I thought that these crackers would be fun to try. My wife had tried a different back to Nature product in the past, so we thought these would be fun to try.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was that the box said "No High Fructose Corn Syrup."<br /><br />Do regular Graham Crackers have HFCS?<br /><br />I was shocked when I grabbed the regular graham crackers we had in the cupboard, and sure enough, they had High Fructose Corn Syrup...those nasty things :)<br /><br />Comparing the ingredients side by side, the "back to Nature" graham crackers take the cake...er...whatever. They're better.<br /><br />Here are some highlights:<br />Regular Graham Crackers Contain:<br /> - Enriched Wheat Flour<br /> - Sugar<br /> - High Fructose Corn Syrup<br /> - Honey<br /> - Salt<br /> - Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate)<br /> - Artificial Flavors<br /> - Soy Lecithin<br /> - and a bunch of other stuff<br /><br />On the other hand, the "back to Nature" graham crackers contain:<br /> - Whole Grain Wheat Flour<br /> - Whole Grain Rolled Oats<br /> - Evaporated Can Juice<br /> - Safflower Oil<br /> - Honey<br /> - Raisin Paste<br /> - Brown Rice Syrup<br /> - Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate)<br /> - Sea Salt<br /> - Cinnamon<br /> - Vitamin E (To help protect flavor)<br /><br />Now as far as the taste, our oldest daughter said that the back to Nature tastes just like the other regular crackers. Our youngest daughter didn't want to eat them probably because they have the oat flakes on them. She wouldn't try them.<br /><br />I think they taste just as good, they're a little more crunchy, but that's okay.<br /><br />After reading all the junk in the regular kinds of graham crackers, I'm sold on these.<br /><br />P.S. My wife bought the California Lemon Cookies by back to Nature, and they're really good.

review/summary: Love the kiss of cinnamon flavor
review/text: I grew up on homemade and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVNYRG">amaranth graham crackers</a>, only having the Honey Maid at friend's houses. So for me the Honey Maid were a very sweet treat. Much like cookies, and too sweet to eat more than one sheet. My husband grew up on Honey Maid graham crackers. He thinks the amaranth are too bland and without flavor, I think the Honey Maid are too sweet and dislike the flavor of the enriched flour versus the whole grain that I'm used to. I was going to say that these were a good balance between the two extremes, but both of us actually prefer them to the graham crackers we grew up with. They have more flavor than either the amaranth or the Honey Maid, without being too sweet. They are the closest I've ever tasted to homemade without all the effort of making them from scratch. The hint of cinnamon is delicious.<br />They taste fantastic dipped in yogurt, which is my husband's favorite way to eat them and bake up nicely as graham cracker crusts.<br />Comparing them nutritionally to Honey Maid, these are marginally better in most respects, and a lot better in sodium content with 130 mg of sodium compared to 190 in the Honey Maid.<br />The packaging is nice, and mine were in good shape in the boxes. The boxes are smaller than other brands, and the crackers themselves don't have clear cut perforations to break the crackers on. The flavor and texture more than makes up for that as far as my family is concerned.

review/text: I got to try these graham crackers recently.  The taste in and of itself is nice.  A little too sweet for my taste, but very pleasant.<br /><br />The texture isn't to my liking, however.  Reminds me of that stale graham cracker texture you get when you don't wrap up your graham crackers and they sit out for 2 weeks.  I know that it's probably because of the lack of preservatives in the cracker, but it is offputting none the less.

review/summary: Love the whole grain and taste, but a bit dry, and the oats flake off
review/text: Our family is very big on consuming whole grains.  I make all of our breads and muffins and desserts from scratch, and they are almost alway 100% whole grain.  So, I was very happy to give these 100% whole-grain graham crackers a try.<br /><br />The 100% whole grain refers to the whole grain wheat graham flour, and whole grain rolled oats.  These crackers also use "natural" sweeteners, like evaporated cane juice, honey, raisin paste, and brown rice syrup.  While I prefer the raisin paste and honey to regular sugar, I don't see that evaporated cane juice or brown rice syrup are much of an improvement, but to each his own.<br /><br />The taste of these crackers was very good; there was a definite honey flavor that all of my children commented on.  However, I thought these crackers had a texture issue.  As others have commented, they were somewhat dry.  I am experienced at baking with whole wheat flour, and the texture does not have to be dry like this.  Also, I'd have preferred not to have the flaked oats; they tended to fall off and were rather obtrusive when they stayed on.<br /><br />I also do have to note that I received a single box as a sample through Amazon Vine.  The box was just stuck in a padded mailer, which may be why the majority of the crackers arrived broken.  In giving my rating, I'm assuming that would not happen when they were shipped as a 6-pack in a box.<br /><br />My children definitely enjoyed these crackers, but I was a little less pleased due to the dry texture.  These are worth considering if having whole-grain crackers is very important to you and worth the extra cost.  However, I wish the manufacturer would tweak the recipe to fix the dryness problem.

review/summary: Great Taste from a Great Company
review/text: Graham crackers are always nice to have around if you want a light snack, crave something sweet that isn't bad for you or doesn't have a lot of calories, or are hungry but your stomach is upset. Oh, and there are always S'mores. Now I'm not quite sure these graham crackers would be great with marshmallows and chocolate, but they are a very tasty food. Claiming to be 100% natural, these sure taste that way, which is a good thing in my case. It's hard for me to tell someone they'd like a product, especially if it is a food product, since tastes are so diverse. I'd say it just depends on how much that person likes natural, healthy foods. If you do like natural and healthy foods then you will probably like these crackers, they rather remind me of Nature Valley granola bars in a way (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMM9WG">Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars, Oats 'n Honey, 12-Count Bars (Pack of 12)</a>). Crunchy, not too sweet (regular graham crackers are sweeter), free of artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives, no hydrogenated oils, and best of all, no high fructose corn syrup. They're just all natural! They come in four packages of seven cracker sheets, with a serving being two full sheets which break down to eight crackers. The caloric contest is reasonable, with 110 calories per serving with 20 calories from fat (a serving is two full cracker sheets which breaks down to eight crackers). The sodium and sugar content aren't too bad either, 130 mg and 7 grams respectively, and 2 grams of fiber (double what most graham crackers have). My only complaint is that there could be a stronger honey flavor, and yes they are more than a bit crumbly and don't really break on the perforations like other grahams, but they are crackers after all and the taste makes up for it. With 20 grams of whole grain per serving (you should have at least 48 grams per day) and all the positives I have about this product, those are very minor problems. What is great about Back to Nature products is that they're packaging is recycled and the ink comes from vegetables, so it's a very ecologically aware company to buy from and they are a proud supporter of The Nature Conservancy. If you do decide to try these out and like them, try the Apple Cinnamon oat grahams (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKHX1Y">Back To Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat Grahams, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>) as well, they're even better.<br /><br />Ingredients (in order): graham flour (whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening (baking soda, monocalcium phosphate), sea salt, cinnamon, vitamin E to help protect flavor.

They are also very dry, unlike name brand graham crackers.

review/text: Tastes flat.  Positioned as a wholesome cracker, it features whole grains, no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  A comparison analogy of these vs. Nabisco grahm crackers is comparing whole wheat to white bread.  For most people, white bread tastes better, though the whole wheat is healthier.<br /><br />If you want healthy, tasty grahm crackers, go with Back to Nature's apple-cinnamon version, which is a wholesome good-tastin' grahm cracker.

review/summary: One of the driest graham crackers I have ever eaten
review/text: I love graham crackers and I love "natural" stuff (or the idea of it) too, but these crackers are DRY! How dry are they? Dry enough that I can only eat half of one and then have to put it down to run for something to drink. And sprinkling raw oatmeal flakes on the top of these things is REALLY unnecessary. It's like adding dry to dry.<br /><br />They're also not sweet enough for me, but I suppose having "no artifical preservatives, flavoring, or coloring" and "no high fructose corn syrup" may also mean "has less taste". However, since I have had better tasting natural everything, I don't think that's a good excuse. These just don't taste good to me.

review/summary: A little sweet, but good
review/text: These are a bit sweeter than I was expecting, but since I mostly eat them with unsweetened tea, that's ok.  They're certainly no sweeter than other grahams, but I guess because of the health orientation I was expecting less sugar.  We do like the taste, which definitely includes some cinnamon.<br /><br />You will notice a difference compared to something like Nabisco Honey-Maid.  Such crackers will easily dissolve in your mouth; these whole-grain grahams remain crackers a bit longer.  It is still true that if you dunk them in hot tea they will soon break off and head for the bottom of the cup, but it isn't quite as immediate.  There is a certain graininess to them because of the whole grains; for me, that makes them more interesting, but if you or your kids prefer white bread over whole-grain bread because of the texture, then you might not like these.  And if you eat them plain, they taste dryer because they don't melt in your mouth as quickly as the ones without whole grains.<br /><br />It's hard to compare the nutritional info of these to Honey Maid directly because what they consider a serving size is somewhat different, and the values are rounded.  It looks like the main differences are that<br /> - these have more fiber, perhaps twice as much<br /> - these have significantly less sodium, and a lot of potassium<br /> - these have less saturated fat (although the fat breakdown doesn't add up to the total, so it seems like something is wrong with the figures)<br /><br />The price per ounce for these is currently about twice as the subscription price per ounce for Honey Maid on Amazon.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are trying to be healthier and you like graham crackers, these are worth a try.

The true test was giving these graham crackers to my 7 year old after school.  I literally held my breath and waited for her response and when she just continued eating them and didn't make any "ew gross" comments I relaxed.  I asked her what she thought and she said they were really good.  In fact, she asked for them again today after school.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was when I opened the package, none of the crackers were whole.  They had all been broken in transit.  (They came in a yellow envelope instead of a sturdy box.)  Fortunately breakage doesn't affect taste!

When it comes to graham crackers, it's usually hard to find these qualities in most brands but I like how Back to Nature stepped up and delivered. As with most of their products this one is devoid of HFC and has mostly natural ingredients. One thing I was let down by was how low the fiber content was - most of their products have a lot of fiber in them but this one is lacking severely. On the flip side, it isn't loaded with sugar (just 7 grams per serving) and is sweetened instead with evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup. Overall, these are addictive and quite tasty unlike many "healthy" snack alternatives. Definitely recommend.

These also don't have a weird after taste I've had with some other graham crackers.<br />They are a little more dry than other graham crackers I have eaten, but with a glass of milk or a marshmallow, you won't notice the difference.<br /><br />Please note there is wheat in these crackers, so this is not a gluten free product.<br /><br />I promise, if you don't tell your kid they're healthy, they'll won't know the difference.<br /><br />I'd do a video review of how much I love this, but my momma told me it was impolite to talk with my mouth full :D

review/text: People who appreciate more natural products, are looking for something with lower sodium or less inclined to clog your arteries, will appreciate these slightly sweetened graham crackers.<br /><br />The crackers are slightly thinner than the Nabisco brand, and maybe a tad drier.  I find the cracker to be dry and brittle, although the taste draws me in and the dryness ceases to be an issue once I've had a couple of bites.<br /><br />A smaller bite-size form might be a better style for these crackers that leave a lot of crumbs behind.<br /><br />2 sheets of crackers per serving with 8 servings per box, there are 3 plastic sleeves per box.  The nutritional numbers come in a little better than Nabisco with calories, fat, potassium, carbs and fiber, and a lot better with sodium - almost 1/3 less.  All of the ingredients are easily readable and for those who like to go green, the box is made from 100% recycled paperboard.<br /><br />Because of the slightly sweet taste, I think I'd like to try these in a recipe that has a graham cracker crust.

review/summary: Delightful Change From Average Graham Cracker.
review/text: Actually these didn't taste like a graham cracker at all. The texture was light & crisp yet packed & dense. They tasted just like Apples & Cinnamon Oatmeal without the tart taste of apples. Mine arrive crushed, but when I tasted the pieces and saw the rolled oats embedded in them I grabbed a bowl of milk and was in hog heaven! So they are the perfect addition to your breakfast cereal each morning. They melted quickly, but they were delicious. They could use more oats but there is more than enough to give you that fresh rolled oat flavor!

review/summary: Palatable and not too sweet really for any time
review/text: As the product write up says, a great snack for any time.  Frankly, these are nice additions for a diet, light tasting, satisfying plain, with your morning or mid morning cup of coffee, with a cup of milk or with a dessert like a small scoop of ice cream.<br /><br />The honey taste is not over powering, so the taste of the cracker is uniform through your eating of it.  I also tested the Apple Cinnamon flavor, which is delicious, but the apple favor reduces as you eat the cracker, although it is still quite tasty.<br /><br />Enjoy this new graham cracker treat with real sugar.  Glad some companys are getting away from corn syrup.

review/text: Natural ingredients make a fresh maker-over for the old graham cracker.  It is a low calorie snack that provides a nice crunch and isn't gone in two bites like so many other '100' calorie snacks.  It is satisfying for the both the kids and myself.

review/summary: Excellent Graham Crackers!
review/text: These Graham Crackers are definitely a cut above the regular graham crackers. They have a great flavor, are crunchy and hold up well to dunking. They taste much better than Nabisco and most store brands. We have a box of the Nabisco Honey Graham Crackers and I definitely prefer the Back to Nature Graham Crackers. The Nabisco (and most others) have a somewhat bland flavor where the Back to Nature have a very good flavor that is noticeable. I have a sweet tooth and these would definitely satisfy it and would also be much healthier but I would still prefer these even if they weren't healthier.

review/summary: Lots of reasons to like them.
review/text: I liked Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams before I even opened the box, because of the information on the outside: 100% natural ingredients, nothing artificial, no preservatives.<br /><br />After opening and eating them I had a lot more reasons to love them. The texture is denser than the brands I am used to, like Honey Maid. These are also not as sweet, which is in their favor as far as I'm concerned. There is a very distinct taste of oatmeal in there (contains rolled oats, so yeah) and it really makes this cracker. I can definitely picture buying these over any of the other brands in the future. I think the flavor will appeal to kids as well, so no worries there.

review/summary: Good all natural graham cracker for snacking
review/text: My daughter likes to eat graham crackers and I like to keep them on hand for snacking or baking. These graham crackers have a solid ingredient list (nothing wacky or artificial) but I do find them to be a little on the sweet side. The addition of oats is a nice change for an otherwise simple cracker. As someone else mentioned, all of them seemed to be broken and the oats seem to fall off the tops of the crackers (but there are oats inside, too so it doesn't seem to diminish the flavor).<br /><br />I would say that these are better for snacking as opposed to using them for a graham cracker crust in baking. I'll stick with my regular brand for making crusts.

review/summary: Great taste, not bad for you
review/text: Lately, I've been on a sugar high. In an attempt to break away from boxed mixes and cookies, I'm trying to find a sweet alternative that will taste great with tea and will satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />These Back to Nature crackers are the ticket. They are sweet - but not too much so - have a lovely crunch and wonderful texture. They also aren't created with a bunch of extra ingredients that make them seriously unhealthy.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was skeptical at first. Most grocery items that advertise themselves as healthy are not. They are packed with ingredients that are bad for the diet. However, the ingredients are very basic- graham flower, whole grain rolled oats, evaporate cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown ric syrup, leavening, sea salt, cinnamon and vitamin E. No high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated products - and a great taste. That is a dynamite combination.<br /><br />One serving is two full cracker sheets at 2.5g of fat and 110 calories. Really, I only need one. These are more filling than regular graham crackers. They are similar, but not as sweet, as regular ones. They are also not as refined, so there is a tough texture. I like that, but not everyone does.<br /><br />If you are doing the Glycemic Index diet (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076114479X">The G.I. Diet</a>), or just want something a little healthier to satisfy the sweet tooth, definitely check these out. I'm going to keep them handy to have with tea.

review/summary: Crisp, tasty, just a little too sweet, not organic
review/text: I got one box, inside are 3 packages of crackers, in my house, we call graham crackers "cookies". since we have one toddler at home, and graham crackers are one of the few treats he is allowed to have on a regular basis.<br /><br />The texture is very crisp, it reminded me of the crispness of almond windmill cookies.<br />I found the taste of honey to be very mild, I could not taste the cinnamon at all. The crackers are very sweet and in addition to honey are sweetened with evaporated cane juice, which is apparently another name for sugar:<br /><br />Evaporated cane juice is a loosely defined term which can include combinations of sugars including fructose, glucose and white sugar (sucrose). It is perceived to be less processed than white sugar, leading some to claim it is healthier.[1] However, nutritional benefits are minimal; evaporated cane juice can contain trace amounts of vitamins and minerals but has the same amount of calories as table sugar[2] and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines evaporated cane juice as any sweetener derived from sugar cane syrup,[3] and therefore it might be heavily processed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that "evaporated cane juice" not be listed as an ingredient on food labels because it is not a commonly used name and does not meet the USDA definition of "juice".[3]<br /><br />The crackers are also sweetened with brown rice syrup:<br />Brown rice syrup, also known as rice syrup, is a sweetener derived by culturing cooked rice with enzymes (usually from dried barley sprouts) to break down the starches, then straining off the liquid and reducing it by cooking until the desired consistency is reached. The final product is 45% maltose, 3% glucose, and 52% maltotriose[1].<br /><br />The rolled oats on top of the crackers don't do much for the taste, and in my opinion make the crackers taste dry. The oats do seem to add to the fiber content, since a serving (2 full cracker sheets) has 2 grams of fiber.<br /><br />The package is made of recycled cardboard, and printed with vegetable inks, which is a plus, but the crackers are "all natural" which is a rather vague term, and none of the ingredients are identified as organic.<br /><br />If these were organic, or at least non-gmo, they would be worth the higher price because of the texture. But as just another cracker, they are not worth the premium price.

review/summary: Great with milk
review/text: It's a hard life being a Vine reviewer.  Amazon sends me cookies and I have to eat them.  Sigh.<br />So first of all, the box is plain cardboard, soy inks, and all those good things.  The ingredients are wholesome.  No high fructose corn syrup, etc.  Whole grain whole wheat and rolled oats are the main ingredients, with very little sugar and just a dash of cinnamon.<br />I put the box down and watched TV, but it started whispering to me, "Milk. You want to dip my graham crackers in milk.  You know you want it."  I was helplessly enthralled by this.  So I picked a short stocky glass for easy dipping and filled it with cold fresh 1% milk.<br />Yes, it was delicious.  The box did not lie.  For quality control I shared the crackers with a Weight Watcher.  She thought that the crackers were a little too sweet.  However she does not eat anything sweet except fruit.  I thought that the sweetness was not overpowering and in fact understated. And by the way, these do NOT have the aftertaste of store-bought cookies.<br />I liked the texture of the crackers, similar to the whole wheat crackers that come in the Carr Biscuit Assortment.<br />My next task will be to make a pie crust with them.  I will report back.  Oh, the life of a Vine reviewer.<br />EDIT: The pie never happened.  Mysteriously all the remaining crackers disappeared.  All that was left was a circle of milk on the kitchen counter.<br />Bottom line: I would recommend them to a friend.

review/summary: Tasty and satisfying
review/text: I love graham crackers. But, being overweight and over fifty means I don't get to eat grahams very often.  That may all change now that I have sampled these Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams, courtesy of the manufacturer.  They have a very satisfying graham taste, not thinned out like so many competitors' "healthy" crackers that are "good for you".  I love the snappy crunch and also appreciate that, although there is a good amount of whole grain oat fiber in each square, they don't have that grainy, fibrous texture other snacks do.  I will always want the full-on graham cracker, of course, but these Honey Oat Grahams are an enjoyable, healthy alternative.<br /><br />Try them guilt-free for yourself.

review/text: When I was a kid I always ate and enjoyed graham crackers, but as I got more health conscious as I got older I gave them up. I was more into foods that were whole grain and crunchy, and in fact my taste buds changed and now I prefer those kinds of foods.<br /><br />I was more than happy then when I tried this Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams, because they have a lot of the taste of old fashioned graham crackers but they are different at the same time - they are much crunchier and have more of an oat taste. I just loved them, and for me they are sweet as cookies and totally satisfy my sweet-tooth urge.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and I know I will be keeping a box of these around my house for me and my family.

review/summary: decent taste, a bit dryer/crispier, healthier
review/text: The clear selling point of anything labeled "back to nature" is going to be its healthier ingredients and the crackers do a good job of stacking up against most popular brands in that area.  They have no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors and no high fructose corn syrup--that alone puts them ahead of the usual in my book, especially the lack of HFCS which is so hard to avoid. They have slightly less sugar (7 g vs 8-10 for other brands), significantly less sodium (130 g vs 200 and up), slightly more fiber, slightly fewer calories (about 15 cal fewer per serving).  So yes, they're certainly better for you.<br /><br />The question of course then goes to taste, a much more subjective aspect.  Personally, I found their taste slightly less rich, which is a negative, but better in two categories. They are noticeably less sweet which I prefer as I'm not a fan of sweet foods; obviously others may have a different view on that.  They are maybe a bit more dry, though it's hard to tell as graham crackers in general seem a bit dry to me.  But they are definitely crispier than the usual other types.<br /><br />We don't go in much for crackers in our house, but on the few occasions we'll do so, I'd certainly pick up these rather than the larger brands due to their healthier ingredients, less sweet taste, and similar overall taste.  A plus as well for their focus on sustainability and recycling

review/summary: healthy alternative - predictable trade-offs
review/text: The first thing I did with these was read the nutrition label.  These crackers are definitely healthy.  There's almost no fat and hardly anything else that most people consider to be "bad" for them.  So, that's a big plus right there.  Also, while not as sweet as the regular, commercial graham crackers (these are sweetened with honey rather than sugar), they do have a certain amount of sweetness that will probably be palatable for most people.  The downside is the texture and the overall taste.  The texture is quite rough and the crackers break easily.  They also fall apart very easily when dipped, only briefly, in milk or tea.  The taste is hard to describe.  It's not that it's bad... It's just not as good as the commercial brands.  So, in final grading of this product, I give it an A+ for healthfulness and a B for enjoyment/taste.

review/summary: Hooked on Whole Grain
review/text: Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are incredibly great tasting and good for you. Packaged like regulard Graham crackers, they taste very similar as well. Though, there's a slight after taste that goes away after eating a few. The ingredients are simple enough: graham flour (whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening (baking soda and monocalcium phosphate), sea salt, cinnamon, and Vitamin E to help protect flavor. There are no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors. So, the crackers do taste slightly different from the name brand graham crackers, but lacking the unhealthy preservatives. There are 110 calories per serving, and serving size is 2 full cracker sheets. The picture on the box does not do the cracker justice, making the crackers look bland and dry. Just as the name brand, these crackers are sweet enough to be called cookies and satisfy my sweet tooth. Yet, they're a healthy snack choice. I highly recommend this brand of whole grain, all natural graham crackers. I'm definitely hooked.

review/summary: Not for the Squirrels
review/text: One of my earliest memories was having a graham cracker taken from my hand by a squirrel as I was about to eat it. The squirrel climbed down a tree, snatched the cracker from my hand and quickly disappeared back up the tree. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKHX1Y">Back To Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKLHOS">Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat</a> Graham Crackers have reminded me of that incident.<br /><br />Now that I have tried the Apple and Honey varieties, I find that I like both of them, although I give the edge to the Honeys.  They both taste great, have only 100 calories for two whole wafer slices, are made of all natural ingredients, and contain a reasonable amount of sugar, only twenty-five percent.  I found them to be a perfect snack to go with green tea.<br /><br />What more can you want in a graham cracker.  These are definitely not for the squirrels.

review/summary: Healthier Substitute, tastes great
review/text: If subbing evaporated cane juice and other more natural sugars for corn syrup is a priority for you, and providing more whole grains in cracker/cookie products, these are a great option.  They are less sweet and a little drier than traditional graham crackers to be sure, but my kids certainly didn't distinguish or complain.  Unless you eat them side by side, I'm not sure there is a huge different, and personally, I often prefer "less sweet."<br /><br />If you are going to dip them, or use them for s'mores, I certainly can't imagine why it would make the least difference if the nutritional content is a factor for you.  But let's be real...these are still cookies, every bit as much as regular graham "crackers" and they still are high in sugars.  That hasn't changed.<br /><br />If there's not a huge price difference, and if buying graham crackers anyway, I'll definitely go with this product over traditional brands.

Crispy, crunchy, with just the right amount of sweet. Everything you'd want in your graham cracker!<br />I am choosing these over my usual ones from now on. They have a higher grain and fiber count, and a smaller ingredient list that I can actually read.<br />All that goodness, without sacrificing the most important part, deliciousness!

review/text: I have always liked graham crackers, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a product like Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams available to consumers.<br />Too often snack crackers are loaded with preservatives and unhealthy items like trans fat and high fructose corn syrup. Having an all natural product is a great alternative.<br />Now, on to the taste. The Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams have a very balanced taste, with a hint of honey and good amount of graham taste in each cracker. The crackers also are sprinkled with a small amount of oats. I would have preferred more oats but it may be a challenge to keep them on the product.<br />As expected with crackers, they are a bit dry, but I will take a dry cracker over a cracker loaded with preservatives. The crackers do have a nice texture (not overly smooth and not too sharp and crumbly, if that's a word). With only 2.5 grams of fat, 0 grams of saturated fat, and 0 mg of cholesterol, the Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are a perfect healthy morning or afternoon snack.

review/summary: A very good alternative
review/text: The most common graham crackers are the store brand or Nabisco. Thus my first concern is the ingredients I'm putting in my body.<br /><br />Most brands have the following ingredients:<br />Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate [Vitamin B1], Riboflavin [Vitamin B2], Folic Acid), Sugar, Graham Flour (Whole Grain Wheat Flour), Soybean Oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil, Corn Syrup, Molasses, Honey, Calcium Carbonate (Source of Calcium), Leavening (Baking Soda, Calcium Phosphate), Salt, Cinnamon, Dextrose, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />These ones have the following ingredients:<br />Graham flour (whole grain wheat flour), Whole grain rolled oats, Evaporated cane juice, Safflower Oil, Honey, Raisin paste, Brown Rice syrup, Leavening (baking soda, monocalcium phosphate), Sea salt, Cinnamon, Vitamin E to protect flavor<br /><br />Right off the bat a lot less ingredients and obviously a healthier option. Then again how healthy can a manufactured sweetened cracker really be?<br /><br />But since graham crackers are a necessary requirement of smores we have a better choice with this product.<br /><br />Thus, my next concern was cost. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UL1HWW">Honey Maid Original Grahams, 14.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> are $0.40 per oz. These are $0.35 per oz. So the lower cost is a huge in my book, especially in today's economic times when we all need to be more careful about necessities vs. wants.<br /><br />Third area is actual taste.<br />The crackers are drier than Nabisco's, but the honey flavor is much stronger, which I like.<br />They dissolve just as fast in milk / soy milk.<br />They are thinner than Nabisco's, but more condensed. Better for making the walls of your ginger bread house when ginger bread isn't available.<br />To me they are more of a true "graham cracker" vs. a graham cookie as the other brands.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I really like graham crackers in general. But I like these more for less cost and the healthier option. Yes, they are less cookie and more cracker (may take some getting use to for others). They have good flavor and are more dense. I'd buy this again!
