review/summary: SESMARK RICE CRACKERS
review/text: After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs.  Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs.  My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers.  I guess we won't be ordering them this way again.  We are both very disappointed.

review/summary: The Best Cracker Made, but Change packing--tiny pieces ugly
review/text: I LOVE these crackers.  They are great with everything. (Try them with a touch of pepper jelly and thin slice of Asiago) But when they come in tiny pieces, they are only good for soup!  Whatever this new packaging is, it isn't working.  My last order was ok.  What's up?  Who tests this packaging?  Sending them back is a pain in the patoot!

review/summary: Almost perfect crackers
review/text: Being the lone Celiac in the crowd makes for challenging entertaining. Most of the crackers I've had/served leave a fine dust coating on the pallet, or they have an aftertaste. This cracker does NEITHER. It's a little strong on the sesame flavor, but it really is a great cracker to serve with Alouette cheese, etc.  It was a real crowd pleaser at our holiday gatherings, and several non-Celiac family members and friends now keep it on hand in their pantries just because of the taste. One of the things that I just couldn't keep plated was when I put a little garlic/onion cream cheese on one of these crackers and topped it with a tidbit of smoked salmon. ;-) The only bad thing (and the first reason I won't give it 5 stars) is that the cracker gets soggy if you plate the stuff even just 30 minutes before serving, so you really have to make it as needed, or let it be self-serve/assemble. The other reason I only give it 4 stars I'm listing as a cautionary statement...<br /><br />CAUTION: it's not certified gluten free, and to my knowledge, it's not tested. There are no gluten ingredients, and I have not reacted, but if you are one who has an instant and severe reaction, contact the manufacturer first to verify whether their production methods, etc., are safe for you.

review/summary: Great Crackers, Poor Packaging, And recently the taste has changed even though Sesmark says "Nothing's Changed"!
review/text: We use to love these crackers. We use to buy them at the grocery store but found them on Amazon and it's a much better price!<br />Amazon was having issues with shipping and the crackers being very broken when delivered. I thought they finally got that better with more packaging but the last box I received was sent in the original box the crackers come in and no other protective packaging. Almost all of the crackers are so broken that it's hard to figure out what piece goes with what.<br />This new batch of crackers also has a very different taste. Much more salty and less sesame seed taste. When I contacted the company about the change in taste I was told: "Nothing has changed other then we added vitamin E but that shouldn't change the flavor". Well.... Something did and I let them know it's not the same and they never got back to me. I guess they don't care that their crackers have changed and customers will notice. We can hardly eat them now!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ET93N2">Sesmark Savory Thins, Original, 3.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I recently got more cravings for sardines and I didn't want to pay $2-3 for a can of sardines. I saw these and thought hmm... maybe I'll give it a try. Definitely worth the money. So I think in my opinion it tastes really good. The smoke flavor is there and it enhances the flavor of sardines. It's a pretty decent portion and easy pull tab. I haven't tried any of the fancier sardines like from Spain or something, so I don't know the difference. These are great by themselves or on crackers :) Overall, I would buy again.

review/summary: Not bad...extra scaly this time...
review/text: Pacific Crest Sardines can be hit and miss. Sometimes I get sardines with extra scales that I literally have to wash off in order to consume.<br /><br />These still taste great and you can rinse out the extra oil with a bit of hot tap water to reduce calories.<br /><br />Regarding the 'smoked' flavor...I honestly taste no discernible difference in flavor from the Pacific Crest Sardines in water...just a bit richer because of being packed in soybean oil instead of water.<br /><br />These sardines have 8 grams of fat per can but if you rinse them off, they probably are closer in fat content to the Pacific Crest sardines in water which only have 3 grams of fat per can.

review/summary: Tomatoe and chili are terrible
review/text: I ordered a case of each. The tomatoe chili are the worst sardines I've ever tried. The title should read sardines in tomatoe and sugar, as sugar is placed in the ingrediants before salt or chili powder. Besides the sauce the fish did not seem to have good flavor either. The case in smoked oil were quite good, good taste and the fish were medium sized with good flavor and texture. I would rate them 4 or 5 stars but the tomatoe chili deserve no stars or negative stars.

review/text: I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found--it's all artificial flavoring.<br />I had to throw the bag away.

review/summary: My favorite Starbucks blend!
review/text: I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back-up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!<br /><br />Starbucks writes:  . . . "Spicy & Cherry" and "With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes."

When I see filling, I think of creamy filling, but this was more of a dried Hazelnut paste.  The cookies have a good flavor and there are two rows of them in a nice box.  The box is presentable enough for the cookies to be a little gift for someone.  I enjoyed them hence the 4 stars, but I don't really crave them as a cookie favorite or 5 stars.  At the right price, I would buy them again.

My local store stopped selling these in this molasses flavor & these are the healtiest biscuits around due to the limited ingredients (only 5).

Everyone's dog should be eating these for a treat instead of the grocery store junk.

The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not "terrible" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.<br /><br />I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit.

The little jars in the grocery store are inordinately expensive,so I checked the internet. Most spice companies had good prices but ridiculous shipping costs. Amazon.com to the rescue! This anise seed from Frontier is of excellent quality, potent and aromatic, packaged perfectly, and at a great price. I will definitely re-order.

review/summary: How can you beat 5 lbs. of bite-sized bliss?
review/text: Haribo's gummi strawberries are some of the tastiest candy available. I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed!

review/text: These tasty little gummi candy strawberries come from Germany and are not to be confused with our inferior gummi worm type candy in the States.  Great consistency, awesome flavor, and sweet deal for this quantity.  Once your friends and family try them, you'll need 10 pounds of them to make sure you get a few.  If you haven't eaten these, you haven't lived.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: Funny thing about this order: I thought these were a different kind of strawberry gummy that I like from a different company (and which I have yet to find to buy in bulk). So I ordered these gummies by mistake thinking they were the strawberries I was looking for and it turned out they weren't. However, I was not disappointed that much since I do like Haribo gummies in general and these strawberries are tasty nonetheless. I've nearly finished the entire 5lb bag from my order on Jan. 4th, but I don't plan to order these particular strawberries again. Not because I didn't like them, but because there is another strawberry gummy that I like more over these (sorry, Haribo!). But don't let my preference dissuade you from purchasing these. The price is right and the 5lbs will last you a while and they are of great quality.

These spirals are very tasty (almost too good) and they offer a good, long chew. The one drawback is that they tend to be very oily thus the reason for my 3-star rating. Still the berry flavor is spot on. Just what I love about strawberry licorice. Warning: Having a 5 pound bag of licorice in the house will weaken even the mightiest willpower. You've had your caution.

review/summary: Better and Cheaper Than US Version
review/text: We got Mexican Nesquik because it was cheaper, but I was surprised when it actually tasted different and better than the US version.  It has a darker chocolate taste which I really like.

review/summary: Tastes better that American version
review/text: I used to buy this Mexican version at my local Wal-Mart until they quit selling it.  The mexican version tastes better that the American version. This one ACTUALLY tastes like chocolate milk!  It is richer, and you can taste the chocolate in it. To me it tastes like the American version before they changed the formula to the new "less sugar" formula, which is strange because now the American version tastes way too sweet and it doesn't even taste like chocolate. It taste like plain ole nothing except maybe milk that is too sweet to drink. If you like "chocolate" milk, buy this version.  Its the only one my family will drink.

review/summary: Tasty, but instructions are way off
review/text: The packages are MUCH smaller than normal store packets, and the instructions are way off. If you make muffins, the instructions advise that you will get 6-8. Not on this planet. It takes 2 packages to get that. Not such a great $$ deal after all. In addition, it calls for 2/3 cup water or milk. That makes soup. You need maybe half that to get a proper batter consistency. Two stars off for all that.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes...it's exactly as expected. A fair amount of corn-ness, not sweet. I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and browned nicely, and had great texture.<br /><br />While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower. Too much money for a too-small bag of cornmeal and baking powder.

review/summary: THESE CANDIES DO NOT CONTAIN THE ENZYME PEPSIN!!!
review/text: To quote from the Pure Fun website:<br /><br />  "Today the flavor we call Pepsin is a form of Wintergreen [ . . . ] Pure Fun Pepsin is derived from Wintergreen plant extract [ . . . ] with the old-fashioned flavor we enjoyed in the 1950's and 60's."<br /><br />Think of Wintergreen LifeSavers, and you'll know approximately what this candy tastes like (minus the chalky LifeSaver texture).  You may not like the taste, but the information about the dangers of real pepsin is not relevant to this candy.  The only reason I can imagine for Pure Fun to use the misleading name "Pepsin" would be if they are trying to associate the digestion-aiding properties of pepsin enzyme with this wintergreen candy.  Looks like they made a mistake.

review/summary: Beware PEPSIN is a pharmaceutical labeled as Candy
review/text: This is a very dangerous product. It is not labeled as to identify "Pepsin: A name for several enzymes secreted by the stomach to break down protein; An enzyme produced in the stomach that splits proteins into peptones; Also used as coagulant, comes from the stomach of the pigs; An enzyme from pigs' stomachs, used with rennet to make cheese." I flushed my money down the toilet - don't be fooled by the Pure Fun Organic Candy Pepsin Swirl Mint Pinwheels - These are horrid and made me sick. I allowed a 7 year old to have one (thinking it was exactly as the package was labeled) CANDY. Stay away from Pepsin Swirl which in my opinion is fraud and the FDA needs to investigate this product.

review/text: so even though i did not like everything that was in the sampler (space food sticks are just like energy bars from the gym), the sampler was exactly what it said it would be, and then some. i was surprised by how much was in the sampler, you get a lot for your money. whats best is you get multiple ice cream bars, and those are great! just break off a piece and let it melt on your tongue and youll see it really is ice cream! took it to a backyard bbq and it was a hit! have not tried the peaches or apples yet, but the ice cream alone makes this a five star product!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: The product I received includes 3 packages of ice cream, 2 space food sticks, 2 drink mixes, and 2 packages dried fruit.  The food is tasty. My main complaint is that the ice cream packages are small- they only hold one serving each, and I have bought astronaut ice cream before that contained at least 2 servings per package.  This product is worth the sale price ($20), but I don't think it's large enough to be worth $30. Also, the product description is misleading- I only received 2 drink mixes and 2 food sticks- also, no poster. The product contains less than you are led to believe.

review/text: The items you get with this package are good quality.  The kids think it's pretty cool that they are eating "astronaut food".  Others have said they are expensive for what you get, but it's  kind of a novelty item and the variety was good for the price.  My problem was that the package showed up missing 5 of the listed items.  First reaction was to return to Amazon for a refund, but instead I emailed the seller and told them my Amazon shipment was missing items.  Within 24 hours I received a reply asking for my address so that they could ship me the missing items.  I received the missing items in just a couple days.  Sure, it would have been nice to received the items together all at once, but the seller making good on an honest mistake was greatly appreciated!

We all know space-food sticks taste like modeling clay. But this assortment of food with the retro space-food sticks magnet was perfect.<br /><br />She loved the gift and the dried cinnamon apples and peaches were delicious! I wish they sold them in large quantities outside of the space-food package.<br /><br />(The strawberry section of the space ice cream was delicious as well)

review/summary: Really good... Really interesting.. but next time more apples less bananas and icecream
review/text: **First time review in Amazon**<br />I thought the space food was great...<br />The freeze dried apples were DELICIOUS!!!  They were extremely good - Crunchy, tasty, sweet apples with a little bit of cinnamon.  I would buy a box of just that.<br /><br />The Ice cream were really good too and really cool/weird/interesting to eat.  They are nearly weightless and rectangular freeze dried ice cream cubes that melt in your mouth and really taste like ice cream when they melt in you mouth.  Pretty cool.<br /><br />The bananas I didn't like that much -- others may like them.  They were too sweet for me.<br /><br />The protein sticks are like little bigger tootsie rolls kind of but a little less sweet and more proteins and vitamins.  But that in no way shape or form did it stop my hunger at anytime...  they are little snacks kind of.  They were good also tasted like chocolate.<br /><br />So if you want to tried Freeze Dried Astronaut food well here is your chance finally  :P  I think you will like the ice creams and LOVE the APPLES.

review/summary: Not quite what is promised...
review/text: I received the two "Mission Pack Space Food Sampler with Astronaut Ice Cream and Space Food Sticks" packs I purchased in the mail today. I initially panicked when I saw them - both were packaged in "Astronaut Mission Pack" boxes that said they contained "3 Assorted Freeze-Dried Space Foods." This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived - I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.<br /><br />In terms of the food items themselves - pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).<br /><br />On a side note - because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze-dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm OK with the product - I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted - but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available.

review/summary: Great deal, and great product.
review/text: For price alone this is a good deal. I picked this up for $13, and considering these things normally retail individually in gift shops for $4-$5 each. So just that alone was pretty nice. The other cool thing was just the fact that it contained more than the Neapolitan ice cream. I've never actually seen the chocolate chip, or the ice cream sandwich for sale anywhere else.<br /><br />Neapolitan: If you've ever had astronaut icecream before I'm sure this is the one you've had. It's a bar segmented into chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. It has a texture comparable to a lucky charms marshmallow. It's very light, and almost chalk-like in texture. Hold it in your mouth for a moment and it will start to melt. This is where you'll really get the true flavor of the product. Once it starts melting it tastes exactly like the flavor of icecream you're eating.<br />I give it a 4/5 stars. It's pretty good, and a great treat for anyone who has never had it before.<br /><br />Chocolate with Chocolate chips: This is just one big block of the chocolate ice cream from the Neapolitan bar. The main difference being that is it filled with chocolate chips. There's not much to say about this one that would differ from the Neapolitan. The texture, and flavor is all the same, and the chocolate chips don't taste any different than normal chocolate chips do.<br />I give it a 5/5 stars. This one is my favorite mainly because I just happen to love chocolate.<br /><br />Ice cream sandwich: This one was my least favorite of the bunch. I just am not too fond of ice cream sandwiches in the first place, and this really does taste like an ice cream sandwich. The chocolate sandwich part takes a big longer to get soft than the ice cream itself does, so you're likely to end up with a piece of the chocolate breading in your mouth with no ice cream.<br />3/5 stars. I just don't like the chocolate breading that much, and I felt like that was mainly what I was eating with this one.<br /><br />Chocolate space stick: If you've ever had a slim-fast bar, or most any other chocolate protein bar you'll already know what this is like. It's pretty much identical to a slim fast bar. It's very chewy, chocolaty, and it'll stick to your teeth. It's pretty good, but it's not something I'd want to eat all the time.<br />4/5 stars. If you're the kind of person that hates eating things that get stuck to your gums, and between your teeth I'd stay away from this.<br /><br />Peanut butter space stick: This one is the sister bar to the chocolate space stick. I'm not sure if I like it quiet as much. It seems to mostly be a slab of peanut butter coated in chocolate. The closest thing I can think of to describe it would be if you've ever had those reese's peanut butter cups that come out around easter, the ones shaped like eggs. That's pretty close to what this is like. Very dense low quality candy bar peanut butter. It was easily my least favorite of the box. I wouldn't say I hated it, but I certainly didn't like it, and if I were given the choice I would never purchase it on it's own.<br />2/5 stars. It just tasted like it was of a lower quality than the rest of the snacks. I'm sure it was packed with protein, but I bought these for novelty snacking reasons, not a long space voyage.

review/summary: Not bad. Exactily as advertized.
review/text: I ordered these simply out of curiosity. All those rumors about space food people have been spreading around. First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours.

review/summary: Son loves the astro food but sampler small for the cost
review/text: My son loves the Astronaut Ice Cream which is why I searched and found this product.  He definitely enjoyed the packaging (cool little box it came in) and he enjoyed that I found the product he loves to buy at the museums so the gift was not a bust but the quantity was too small to justify the price.  There is more info in the description now about what you get but I was surprised to get so little.  Simply you get 3 of the astro ice cream packs that you would buy in the museum gift shops plus a few small items that were not of much interest to my son.  It would be less than half the cost to buy him 3 packs of the astro food at retail (museum shops).<br /><br />Check the bulk packs of 10 of the astro ice cream from the same supplier/seller.  These are about a 1/3 more expensive right now compared to the sampler but you get more than 3 times the quantity of astro ice cream.  I gave 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is a unique and sort of cool gift for someone who likes this astro ice cream. They would get 5 stars if the quantity was fair - say 5 of the astro ice cream which would be 15bucks at the gift shops then the other stuff and packaging is maybe worth the extra 5bucks.

review/text: you do need to know that five pounds is a bunch of coffee. if you have two people drinking about 4-6 cups a day (i think our grind & brew carafe counts five ounces as a cup), which i think was our rate, it will take you about month to five weeks to get through it. after four weeks it can lose a good deal of its flavor, so you want to try to use it before then.  we keep the unused portion in ziploc gallon bags, otherwise i don't think we would even get four to five weeks out of it.  for the price, you can't beat it, and if the last little bit gets a little stale then you can always move on to another bag or realize that you need to find someone to coffee-pool with next time you order a five pound bag. they also sell one pound bags, which i've not tried yet.
