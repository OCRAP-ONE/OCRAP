review/summary: These are so tasty!
review/text: Excellent choice for a high fiber cracker.  These taste great and like other Back to Nature items, don't have all the undesirable ingredients you'd like to avoid if necessary. Whole wheat, safflower oil, salt and Vitamin E -- perfect.

review/summary: Bit salty, but otherwise excellent.
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of salt, so take that warning with a grain of, well... you know.  For most people the salt on these is probably fine.  They stay crispy over long periods of storage, even after the package has been opened and split into tupperware containers, they're reasonably sturdy, they pair well with all but the saltiest cheeses (wouldn't put blues on them), they pair GREAT with unsalted pb... just a great all-around cracker to keep in the house.  They've become a staple of my diet and, unlike every other cracker I've bought in bulk, and there have been many, they haven't developed some weird off-flavor due to over-familiarization or the cracker becoming stale.  They still taste good, like a simple cracker.  I'll be ordering them again!

review/summary: Very crunchy and tasty but not organic
review/text: My family loves the taste of these.  They're a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price, I wish they were organic.  I have purchased the Heart to Heart brand, but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers.  Too bad, because Heart to Heart has half the sodium.

review/summary: Top is loose and doesn't poor freely
review/text: The O ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow.  This makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out.  I just lift the top up a little when I poor to bypass this problem.  The glass is sturdy and the apparatus that holds it is sturdy.  I got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass, which looked terrible, but is easily disassembled to clean.  There is no stop for the screw so over tightening during reassembly could break the glass.

review/summary: 16 cats love it...
review/text: I have 16 cats ranging from 1 to 11 yrs old and every single one of them likes this.  I have tried Wellness, Holistic, Avoderm, Chicken Soup for the..., Merck Homestyle, BG (Before Grain), California Natural, and Evangers with mixed results.  This is the first canned food that all of them will not only eat but eat all of it.  I've fed them the Chicken and Liver flavor and the Seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally.  I find it a bit more expensive than I had hoped it would be, but then again there is no waste and I consider that in itself a savings alone.  I'm a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop, less litter use, fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most.  They have now officially rejected all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked.  I also wanted to add that this is a very STRONG smelling brand of cat food, almost overpowering when I open the cans at feeding time.

review/summary: Nice to find product thats safe
review/text: Our older cat is having some health issues, which I "suspect" could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores. We've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls. After going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do, we found the PetGuard line of food. This one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it! Our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he's acted in years. Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn't having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the "fish,chicken & liver" dinner but our older cat isn't crazy about the "seafood savory dinner". He'll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn't smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I've purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I've purchased 2 cases and it's been the same with both cases.. I've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I'm relieved to finally find a food I'm not afraid to feed my pets.. I've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that's part of the attraction for them.

review/summary: Great quality food and my cats LOVE it.
review/text: I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain "Menadione Sodium Bisulfite" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.

review/text: My cats both LOVE this food.  I've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It's natural, mostly organic, doesn't have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we're giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.

They are not so fond of it, but will eat if there is nothing else.  Also, they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened, there is no hope of putting half a can in tupperware and feeding it to them later. Oh, yeah, and STINKY.

Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/summary: Just Right and you will love it!
review/text: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

review/summary: Good coffee, but lets clear up the flavors?
review/text: I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee, but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut, vanilla, caramel, rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off, I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.  Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.

review/text: I used to do the subscribe and save with the Timothy's World Kona, but due to the fact that the price on Timothy's jumped so high, I went to Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed.  Pleasantly surprised, and I must say that I like this one much better than the Kona!  It seems much more smoother, but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow-bold flavor.  Great way to start the day!  Oh, and I love the name of this coffee ;)

review/summary: Too Mild for Me
review/text: I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to "brown water.")

review/text: I wasn't expecting this one to be so rich or full!  Yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a French roast but doesn't taste burnt.  I think alot of times a French roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky, but not this one! Very pleased with it and will definitely order again.  If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.

review/text: As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for.

review/summary: IT IS NOT DECAF PEOPLE!!!
review/text: I'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled.  What you're seeing is a GENERIC ingredient list that covers multiple coffees.  What it is saying, based on the photo I see above, is that IF the coffee type you have is straight coffee, then all it contains is 100% arabica coffee...  But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol

review/text: Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!

review/summary: These K Cups Have ISSUES - Coffee Not Bad
review/text: First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.

review/summary: Good, but not Wolfgang Puck good
review/text: Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.

To be fair, it is billed as a medium roast, and that's what it is. However, it's just too bland for my taste.<br /><br />If you want decaf with more character, try Green Mountain Coffee's Dark Magic Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I2SK">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, or Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004616B3Y">Emeril's Jazzed Up DECAF 48 K-Cups</a>. They are darker roasts though, so if you want a milder coffee the Wolfgang Puck might be what you are looking for.

review/text: Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen/melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.  The affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the Keurig.

review/summary: Wolfgand Puck's Breakfast in Bed Coffee
review/text: Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time.  We were running low on our special coffee. We have sampled many K-cup coffees, some in assorted packs and decided this is the best.  It is mellow, never bitter and always totally enjoyable.

review/text: This is our favorite K-cup at home. Mellow and flavorful.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to clear-up the question of whether or not this is decaf - it is not. See the response I received from WP Coffee:<br /><br />"Is Breakfast in Bed K-cup actually a decaf coffee?"<br /><br />"Thanks for reaching out to Wolfgang Puck Coffee. The Breakfast in Bed is not a decaf blend...."<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Mandy M<br />Customer Service<br />Wolfgang Puck Coffee

review/summary: Hawaiian Hazelnut Always Out of Stock
review/text: The Hawaiian Hazelnut is my favorite K-Cup flavor from any vendor, but it's ALWAYS out of stock on Amazon.com; it seems that all of the other Puck flavors are available for a very reasonable $16.54/24-cup price and sold directly by Amazon.com, but HH's price fluctuates wildly from 3rd-party resellers and hasn't been available directly from Amazon.com for months.  As I'm writing this (8/24/12) the price of a 24-pack is $34.99 from the cheapest 3rd-party retailer, which is absolutely ridiculous.  AMAZON, why can't you stock the Hawaiian Hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors??  The fact that I would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much I like the product...

review/summary: Good taste, but seals are loose so they're busting open while brewing
review/text: The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol

In the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small I did not even consider looking on it. So just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering.

review/summary: The Sorrento is soothingly smooth good blend!  No after taste!
review/text: I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's K-Cups, so far all the ones I've tried haven't left my stomach churning..and,<br /><br />this was my first time trying out the Sorrento Fair Trade Roast and purchased it on a Warehouse Amazon price deal.  I am really happy with my purchase.  The taste of the Sorrento is what I would expect of a Medium Roast = A good, smooth blend.  No bitter, acidic after taste, and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup!  (At least, it left me)! :p  It's doesn't leave you with the "shhhakes" either, it has that right "balance" you need with your daily cup of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, I will be getting another 24-Count of this when I am finished with this pack!<br /><br />5-Stars!

review/summary: Best so far
review/text: I'm a relative newcomer to Keurig coffee, but I do know that I was generally disappointed in the drink produced. However, the Breakfast in Bed K-Cup produces a nicely balanced, not-too-thin cup without being too harsh. I still haven't achieved anything like what I can make either with my french press or with my drip machine, but it's definitely better than the at-work alternative, Community Coffee.

review/summary: Good, if you like flavored coffee
review/text: I too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product, and before it arrived I looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor.<br /><br />So, lets get this out of the way. *********Do Not Purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee. It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.

review/summary: Great, considering I usually prefer a light/medium roast
review/text: I got one K-Cup of Wolfgang Puck's Colombian Reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35-pack that I bought here on Amazon. Since I'd always assumed that I preferred the less-burnt flavor of a light or medium roast, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue. It is sweet, full, and gently bitter. I brewed it in a 9.25 oz. cup in an effort to dilute it a little, but I may be gutsy enough to try a 7.25 oz. cup the next time around.

review/text: I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups. A friend sent me a K-Cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing. The flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk; I added a little vanilla syrup when I reheated it. I am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there. It is just a unique taste for when you're in the mood for something different!

review/text: I've tried a wide selection of k-cups including the big names like Starbucks, Tully's, Donut House, Dunkin Donuts, etc and they all have something in common.. either too watery (weak) or too bitter (strong). I tried Breakfast in Bed based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. It's flavorful without being strong or weak. It's hard to get a cup of coffee from a Keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine.. this k-cup is the exception.. I'll be stocking up.
