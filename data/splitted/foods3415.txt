review/text: These brazil nuts were fresh & crunchy with a creamy, mild taste .... delicious!  I've ordered other bagged nuts over the internet, but they weren't fresh.  You don't always know how fresh they are (even in the stores, the nuts can sometimes be rancid).  Rancid nuts are NOT healthy and contain toxins, so if you taste one, be sure to spit it out.  These were so good I've ordered two more; hopefully they'll be just as fresh as the first batch.

review/text: I usually like Betty Crocker meals. This is the first and last time I will get this one! I followed every step of the directions and had to throw the whole meal out! There was almost no chicken or veggies in the mix. The rice came out like hard little pellets that cut into the roof of the mouth or stuck between the teeth.<br />I am reluctant to even give the remaining 5 packs to the local food bank but hate the idea of throwing any food out. I will avoid any rice dishes from BC after this!.

review/summary: Portion size is not good
review/text: Don't misunderstand my low rating, this is an excellent curry and really is as good as you would get in a quality Indian restaurant; quite unbelievable for a frozen meal in a box. The problem is the portion size is miserable since they started marketing it with the bismati rice included in the box. I am not a big eater and am normally quite happy with smaller sized entrees but you literally would need two of these if you are having it as an entree; and that is if you have the Nan bread with it!!! It used to come without the rice and you got twice the amount of curry, which was perfect (easy to cook up some rice or buy heat and serve to accompany it). Then the makers cut the size in half and included rice, making the actual curry portion half what it was. The reason the manufacturer gave for the change (reduced portion) was that customers like the convenience of having the rice included. Fair enough - add the rice, but don't cut the curry portion in half to where it is utterly misleading to pass this off as an entree. Please go back to a reasonable portion size and either add the rice and charge a couple of dollars extra, or better still, sell the rice as a seperate side dish and give at least a semblance of an entree sized curry.

review/summary: Refreshingly tasty and authentic
review/text: I buy a lot of frozen dinners, including meals featuring Indian curries.<br />Out of them all- I prefer anything by Tandoor Chef because of the portion size and the amazingly authentic Indian taste. I found them at my local grocery store and have been hooked since. I saw the amazing deal on Amazon and decided to order these. They arrived within a day, however, they held only one ice pack. For a 12 pk order- I expected one more ice pack.<br />These frozen dinners are great for people like me watching portion size and caloric intake. Indian curries are notoriously high in calories, but this specific one is 315 kcal. It's a great way to enjoy Indian food on a diet.<br />I recommend Tandoor Chef Chicken Tikka Masala as well- although that one is 400 kcal. The curry is always more than the rice- you can always cook extra rice to go with the meal.<br />Lastly, the best thing about them is the taste!

review/text: As a single, middle-aged man who never really learned to cook, I'm always keeping my eye out for good frozen entrees.  This chicken curry, which I happened across in the local Ingles grocery store, was surprisingly tasty.  And I'm very picky.  Mind you, nowhere near as good as the Indian cuisine at two or three very good local restaurants, but for a frozen meal -- incredibly delicious.  The curry sauce is really quite good, the breast meat chicken is tender and the basmati rice was decent also.

review/summary: Finally a food that works!!!
review/text: I have a 3 1/2 year old American Bulldog that has gone through thousands of dollars in vet bills and worthless speculations. She has been on Grandma Lucy's Rabbit Pureformance for several days now and I have already noticed the vast improvement in her demeanor and energy level. My dog used to violently scratch at herself till she made herself bleed. We discovered that she was allergic to beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and duck. Due to the simple yet nutritional ingredients of Grandma Lucy's she is doing excellent. It's been several days and NO MORE SCRATCHING...I am so excited that I had to write a review. My dog was so allergic to the many different other foods that we have tried with her that we almost lost all hope and we were going to just highly medicate her for the rest of her life. I didn't want to do that and after looking at the excellent ingredients contained in this brand of food I was hoping for the best. I couldn't be more happy and delighted! She's been on various raw, dry, wet, home cooked, and everything else with no luck. Please Grandma Lucy's never change your ingredients on the Rabbit Pureformance line of food because you have just made our lives a whole lot more stress free, thank you! Anyone with a dog that has bad allergies should really give this food a try...it might be the best decision you've ever made for your dog. I'd also like to add that the preparation for making her food is very simple. Just add warm water to the freeze dried food until you get the desired consistency that you prefer. Let it stand for a few minutes and then it is ready to serve. The food honestly smells amazing and at times I have thought about trying it myself. It's made with all human grade ingredients which is good to know. My dog Sadie is 75lbs and a 10lb bag of this fantastic product lasts us approximately 20 days. It's a good deal and so easy to prepare...give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.

review/summary: Great product for itchy dogs
review/text: Each 3 lb bag ends up making around 15 lbs of fresh moist food, once you add water. The rabbit has a slightly stickier texture than the chicken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006COERA2">Grandma Lucy's Pureformance, Freeze-Dried Chicken Dog Food, 3lb</a>, but my dog loves both of them (and he is picky!). It is grain-free and low-fat. I use the Purformance as a large part of his diet rotation. He is healthy and itch-free and has optimum digestion. You add equal amounts mix and warm water, wait 5 minutes, and done! I even tried a little bit and it tasted like human food. You can also easily stir in some kibble if you want to do that, the texture matches well with kibble.<br /><br />P.S. They also have a cheaper Artisan line, which I don't feed anymore because it contains white potato. If your dog isn't as sensitive, it is worth a try. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FZLJWG">Grandma Lucys Grain-Free Chicken Dry Dog Food 3lb</a>

We all sat down with a bowl and were more than a bit disappointed. My husband didn't like them and my son thought they were "disgusting". My daughter said they were OK but terribly sweet and I had close to the same opinion. I normally don't eat cereal as a breakfast food with milk, but prefer to eat mine dry as a snack. This cereal doesn't work at all for snacking. The milk seems to cut the aftertaste and makes them tolerable, but dry - they were awful. Not a cereal I'd recommend.

review/summary: No Sodium! No High Fructose Corn Syrup! Healthy AND Delicious!
review/text: I love shredded wheat, especially Kellogg's Shredded Wheat. I don't have a preference when it comes to what size- the large ones, bite size or these mini little bites all make for a delicious breakfast or snack. The best thing about these new cinnamon roll flavored ones is I noticed they eliminated high fructose corn syrup, and instead added brown rice syrup. Corn syrup is much too sweet in comparison to brown rice syrup, and I definitely prefer my cereals without high fructose corn syrup. I also love the fact that there is no cholesterol and no sodium. Almost all cereals have some sodium, which I don't like. Sodium makes the heart work harder, so I look for foods that have no or low sodium. In comparing the sodium to my other favorite cereals, plain Rice Chex has 240 grams of sodium and Frosted Flakes has 140 grams of sodium. Another thing I like is these cinnamon roll little bites give me 90% of my daily iron needs, in comparison to Rice Chex 50% or Frosted Flakes 25%.<br /><br />As for calories, these cinnamon roll mini bites have 190 calories for a 55g serving. Rice Chex is 100 calories for a 27g serving and Frosted Flakes 110 calories for a 30g serving. They all are pretty much even on the calories when you do the math. They are all the same on the fiber content as well- 25g of fiber for all 3 different cereals. The huge difference on these Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Flavored Cinnamon Roll cereal is NO sodium, NO high fructose corn syrup, and 90% of your daily iron, besides 25% of many other B and other vitamins for the day. Of course, the wheat fiber is a big benefit. The tiny bit of cinnamon added makes them sweet enough to eliminate the too sweet and fatty high fructose corn syrup, and that's a great thing for everyone's health. As for the taste, they are just as delicious as all the other shredded wheat, with the addition of the cinnamon of course.  This cereal is actually much healthier than my other favorite Rice Chex and Frosted Flakes and deserves 4 1/2 stars.

It didn't quite fill me up, I was able to eat two bowls of the cereal alone or one if I added fruit or yogurt. Highly recommend eating this with vanilla yogurt- SO good!!<br /><br />The cinnamon roll flavor is amazing- though I felt like it tasted a little bit more like maple syrup than cinnamon roll. Which I also love, so no complaints. Will kep buying this one!

review/summary: Enjoyable and Tasty--But Lots of Carbs
review/text: Kellog's has brought out a new Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites cereal--this time it's Cinnamon Roll. I liked the size which makes it almost perfect for those of us who love to snack on breakfast cereal at all hours of the day and the cinnamon flavor is not too strong. The carbs seem a little high but, on the plus side, these are very good on iron, thiamin and solid on fiber. While there are better products on the market, this was not a bad cereal by any means.

review/summary: Have you had your 47 biscuits today?
review/text: I must admit that I've never seen portion control described in just this way.  I suppose Kellogg's decided that trying to get square Little Bites into a round measuring cup would be confusing so they just counted them out for you.  So, of course, I counted them out for myself too.  At least I did for the first serving so I could see how much space 47 biscuits took up in the size bowl I normally pour cereal into.  Then I added 1/2 cup of milk (but not skim milk) and ate that for breakfast.  I was starving in about two hours.  The next morning I measured out the 47 biscuits again, but this time I added a banana and a healthy dollop of plain yogurt plus the milk.  Now that combination stayed with me for almost four hours.  Quite respectable from my standpoint.<br /><br />Now let's get down to the numbers.  This cereal is made of 100% whole grain fiber in a size that is nearly half the size of a Mini-Wheats Bite Size (according to the information on the box).  If you are familiar with that size then you understand that these pieces are pretty small.  One serving of 47 biscuits contains 190 calories, or 230 if you add 1/2 cup of skim milk.  This gives you 24% of your dietary fiber for the day which is actually quite good.  The label also states that one serving provides 90% of the daily requirement of iron.  All other vitamins and minerals fall into the 0% or 2% to 25% range.  The first ingredient listed is whole grain wheat, but the second is sugar and there is no indication that I could find of what specific type of sugar that is, just in case that is really important to you.<br /><br />There are games on the back of the box for kids to play while they are eating their cereal with the answers printed inside the box and a segment on the side of the box called Mom's Homeroom which contains a pop quiz of questions pertaining to your child's school work.<br /><br />Now for the taste.  Try as I might I just can't come up with the taste of cinnamon roll.  What I do seem to get is the taste of maple, albeit a slightly artificial maple.  I even tried eating a few of the biscuits dry to see if I was confusing my taste buds with the added ingredients I was putting on and still tasted absolutely nothing but maple.  I usually read when I'm eating my cereal so I had nothing but little spoonfuls of fiber strands - but soft fiber strands - by the time I got about half way finished.  If you want this crisp when you bite into it, don't dawdle over your cereal bowl.  Also, the portion measurement will go to heck in a hand basket when you begin to pour out all the little crumblies that have rubbed off the biscuits and fallen to the bottom of the bag.  That final portion will be all crumbs all the way.  So what did I think about this product which was new to me?  Well, it isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good enough to tempt me into buying it again.  I don't get the cinnamon roll taste at all, it doesn't stave off the hunger unless I really augment it with other items, and the crumbs in the bottom of the bag will have me eating mush for the final portion.  Not very tempting.

review/summary: Nice addition to the Mini-Wheats line-up ...
review/text: I really liked these. They had a nice cinnamon-y taste with just a hint of vanilla. Not *too* sweet, they hold up well in milk.<br /><br />But my FAVORITE way to eat these is dry, right out of the box, as a snack. They're the smaller version of the standard Mini-Wheats, so it's easy to measure out 100 calories-worth, and tuck them in my bag in a snack-size zip-loc Baggie. Great on-the-go treat.<br /><br />Definitely will be keeping these on hand.

review/summary: I love the "Little Bites" but not so much the flavor
review/text: I am a big fan of Mini-Wheats. I eat them often for breakfast. I have tried the frosted and plain, but never anything with a flavor. I was curious to try this one.<br /><br />First, I love the "little bites" size. I find they are easier to eat, they don't get as soggy as fast and they fit on my spoon! I also like the fact that it appears to fill up a bowl more, even if that's just my perception.<br /><br />I liked the sweetness that the cinnamon roll flavor added. I could certainly tell it just wasn't a cinnamon flavor, but a vanilla one, too. Sadly, there was also something very manufactured about the taste. Maybe it was an aftertaste or just some flavor that I wasn't expecting, but I didn't love it.<br /><br />I am going to stick with my normal frosted version. I like that much better.

review/summary: Already a fan
review/text: I'm a snacker of cereal products.  There it is; I've confessed that I'll eat cereal right out of the box as a snack in the middle of the day.  And the Frosted Mini-Wheats on one of my favorites;  sometimes I'll mash up the cereal and mix it in with some yoghurt and eat it that way.  It's very tasty to do this, and I think maybe a bit healthier than just eating sweetened cereal right out of the box.<br /><br />And the cinnamon is a nice touch.  Cinnamon, it turns out, it a spice that is good for you; helping to control blood sugar levels (although this isn't the best way to get cinnamon, for this purpose, obviously).  It adds a nice touch of flavor to the product, and if you enjoy the taste of cinnamon, it is an added bonus.<br /><br />Just be aware that this is a higher-calorie cereal, and there is a fair amount of sugar in it.  It's not going to be a health food for you, unless you restrict the intake (as I don't) to breakfast, and don't go overboard (as I sometimes do).

review/text: I have been a long time fan of Frosted Mini Wheats and have tried all of the newer flavors that have recently added to their lineup (Strawberry, Mixed Fruit, etc.) so I was very excited to try this one when it came out, and it did not disappoint.  At first I was a little skeptical about it being the littler size, as I thought it was going to get soggy quickly in milk, but I ended up eating it so fast because it tasted so good I did not even notice!  The cinnamon roll flavor is fantastic, now to overpowering and not too little that you can barely taste it like with some other cereals.  This is a win for me, will definitely be buying this one again and again!

review/summary: Front mini wheats with a brand new kick!
review/text: As someone who already enjoys mini wheats, I was eager to try the cinnamon rolls flavor and while I have no problem with the regular flavor, this is a good change-of-pace of flavor.  While I would not say it tasted like cinnamon rolls, it did remind me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch a bit.  As with regular mini wheats it was still sweet, but not too sweet, so this is by no means an old-fashioned sugary kids cereal.

review/text: I like Frosted Mini-Wheats and I like cinnamon rolls, but this did not turn out to be a very good pairing.  It tastes exactly like cinnamon rolls but ends up tasting too sugary.  It maybe be because I doubled up the serving size (the box claims to hold eight severing but I finished it off in four bowls) because one recommended serving juts did not fill me up.  Whenever I have a craving for Mini-Wheats I do not see me picking up this flavor and will just stick to the original.  And I stick to the actual roll kind whenever I have a hankering for cinnamon rolls.

review/summary: Yay Cereal!
review/text: If you like sweet cereal but want to avoid the super-sugary cereals peddled to young children than Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats are for you. I liked these little ones because they fit on my spoon better and the Cinnamon Roll flavour was satisfyingly cinnamon-y enough without being overpowering. I will say that due to their smaller size they do absorb milk a bit faster than the regular sized Mini-Wheats but I'm of the weird ilk that enjoys their cereal slightly soggy so it didn't bother me a bit but if you prefer your cereal crunchy 'til the last bite then this cereal isn't for you. But if you like your cereal sweet and a little soft and delicious then you really have to try this new Mini-Wheat flavour.

review/summary: Cinnamon Toast Mini-Wheats
review/text: In my family, cereal is never consumed normally (ie: in a bowl with milk and a spoon) as, in a family of gamers, we usually stick to the tried and true method of munching out of the box while engaging in some tedious task involving an electronic device of some kind.  Call us primitive, but the hand-in-box method helps us stay full all day without gorging on junk food via drive-thru or conveniently placed over-priced vending machines.<br /><br />Kellogg's new cinnamon-flavored Mini-Wheats certainly was consumed in the aforementioned method by myself and my house-sitting brother and we came up with the following results; cool.<br /><br />Truth be told, they tasted like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but in Mini-Wheat form.  Makes sense, really, as all they had to do was swap around the flavor dispensers and called it good.  This isn't a bad thing, it just isn't a new and revolutionary idea like Krave was (something I could definitely get addicted to).  I enjoyed munching on them, but it just isn't munch food given how easily the Mini-Wheats fall apart in my hands.  Maybe I should try a spoon?  Either way, it just wasn't for me, but they tasted good all the same.

review/text: So maybe it doesn't taste exactly like a cinnamon roll (there's no delicious cream cheese frosting), but I still loved the taste of these new Mini-Wheats.  One thing about the Little Bites version that I've noticed is they get soggy fairly fast.  I prefer this cereal when the milk has just saturated the bites.  The only solution I see is to only fill the bowl halfway.  Nutritionally this is pretty good too.  Mini-Wheats offers 24% of your daily fiber and comes in just under 200 calories before the milk is added.

review/summary: Lightly flavored, but tasty enough
review/text: The ambition behind this cereal seems to be to have miniature, little bites of a cinnamon-roll type taste. Certainly that taste is there, but it is a little light. I'd prefer a stronger taste, since mini-wheats like this otherwise taste about as good as cardboard. The frosting adds little flavor, mostly sweetness.<br /><br />All in all, this cereal is tasty enough, but it's not good enough to take a favored spot on my breakfast table.

review/summary: Nutrition and taste will appease both children and parents
review/text: If you've ever had frosted mini-wheats then this "Little Bites" version will already be quite familiar - it's essentially the same thing but smaller. I'm not quite sure what the point is of making mini-wheats even smaller, but it does seem to be a bit easier to scarf down a couple of bowls.<br /><br />I definitely like the taste. It has a cinnemon flavor, which is easily noticable as soon as you open the box, with (what tastes to me like) a hint of vanilla. I suppose this is supposed to mimic a "cinamon roll" flavor, but I don't think that's a very accurate description. It's sweet but not too sugary, and it has a very fiberous texture. Overall very pleaseant, except that the mini-wheats tend to quickly soak up the milk which makes it heavy and soggy.<br /><br />The nutrition facts are pretty typical of a cereal like this: 190 calories (w/o the milk), 1 gram of fat, 46 grams of carbs, an assortment of vatamins, etc. It's not bad for you, but it isn't a cereal for the health-nut either. A nice middle-of-the-road cereal which, I assume, will appeal to both children and parents.

review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I recieved the packgae.  But the moment I opened the cereal box, I was in heaven!<br /><br />To start with, the aroma smelled like the chain store in the mall and my mouth started watering.  I couldn't wait to get some ice cold milk and dig in.  Each tiny bite expolded in my mouth like fourth of July fireworks and the cinnamon urged me on to another bite.  Really the only problem I had with it is the bowl just disappeared.<br /><br />Seriously, I wouldn't let a little one (two and under) eat these without an adult nearby because they can cause choking.  But other than that, they are a very good way to trick kids into getting their daily fiber.

review/text: This product was just okay for me.  It's another sugar-packed cereal product with no uniqueness other than the fact that they are littler versions of Nabisco's Shredded Wheat Minis. I don't like cereals that get soggy quickly and this one does.  In general I believe that almost all commercial boxed cereal products are WAY,WAY,WAY over priced, and their sugar-packed content negates any nutritional benefit for an increasingly obese nation. Oh, did I mention that they are WAY over priced? I don't recommend this product.

review/text: I'm a fan of regular Frosted Mini Wheats so I pretty much figured I'd like these. They don't seem to have as much "frosting" as the original ones, but these are delicious! The cinnamon isn't overwhelming and they're very sweet but it isn't overboard. The "minis" are also easier to eat. Keep in mind that this isn't the most "diet friendly" cereal, but still quite delicious. I'd buy these again for sure.<br /><br />----------<br />Update: The box is nearly empty at this state and I totally intend to buy more of these. I realized that these actually really do taste similar to cinnamon rolls in flavor, and a bowl of these can curb my sweet tooth very well. Delicious! Will buy again.

review/summary: The small size make a huge difference
review/text: The problem with standard "mini wheats" is the size.  One mini wheat is too small to be satisfying face-stuffing spoonful, but 2 or 3 was kind of awkward.  With the "little" version, which is about half the size, it is easy to scoop up a spoonful of just the right amount.<br /><br />I like the taste of this cereal as well.  But I knocked off one star because I don't see why it should be called "cinnamon roll".  There is no roll essence to it.  Actual cinnamon rolls do have a bit of their own flavor among bread products, in addition to the sugar and cinnamon.  This cereal is really just frosted mini wheats with a little cinnamon added.  That's a fine and tasty cereal, but the name is gratuitous.

review/text: When you open the box on these Cinnamon Roll Mini-Wheats Bites you will go crazy!  The smell of these is fabulous.  I would give the smell alone 5 stars.  The taste is not near as strong as the smell, unfortunately.  The taste is not bad, don't get me wrong.  When you smell these and then you take a bite you are a tad disappointed because you want them to taste exactly like cinnamon rolls, which is how they smell.  Overall, it is a good cereal.  The size is just adorable and much more appealing to little kids.  My son won't go near a full size or even a mini sized wheat cereal but he loved these.  My husband also loved these, but thought the smell far outdid the taste.  I would buy these again for sure (if on a good sale or with a coupon) but they will not replace our usual round O's cereal.  Try them and see, they may be your new favorite!

In fact I would even say that it isn't as sweet as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and not as over-powering either. I love the texture of the mini-wheats and so this makes for a great combination. With it being part of the 'little bites' brand the pieces are very small, great for kids, but still a good cereal for adults too! An adult could definitely eat this cereal without feeling as though they're eating a blatant kid's cereal (no outrageously bright colors or noxious fruit smells). A great cereal for all the family.

review/summary: A new staple!
review/text: Finally!  Something new that all of us like!<br />Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Cinnamon Roll Flavor are absolutely delicious!  AND they fit with our dietary restrictions (G6PD deficiency...but check with your docs/nutrition folks to make sure it fits with your restrictions as ours may be different)<br /><br />The best part?  My son, who is 8 and has autism and likes things that are of uniform consistency (i.e. cheerios...plain cheerios specifically) gave these the ol' stink eye at first as it wasn't all "perfectly equal" and some pieces were bigger, some broken, some conjoined, etc but I asked him to take two bites, with milk.<br />And he loved it.  Hallelujah!  This is a kiddo who could eat the same thing every single day for the rest of his life and be totally happy and most new foods that we try result in him spitting it out or vomiting immediately.  So this is a pretty big deal to us.<br /><br />The flavor is fantastic- it's sweet and cinnamon-y- sort of like if you took the flavor of Cinnamon Life and put them on frosted mini-wheats.  It's not overpowering Cinnamon (kiddo hates anything that has so much cinnamon that it smells "like Christmas" or feels even slightly warm- he's definitely a "just a little dash" sort of a Cinnamon person where I tend to like a little more spice)...<br /><br />As an adult, the serving size is done by the piece or weight.  I counted out the number of minis into a bowl and it was a substantial amount, though the carb count is fairly high compared to my usual plain cheerios.  I am a type 1 diabetic and count my carbs to calculate my insulin dose.  For anyone watching their carbs, they might want to weigh out a serving size first, as a visual.  As far as volume goes, I could eat half of the suggested serving and probably be satisfied, as the mini-wheats are pretty filling.  Again, your mileage may vary. As someone who watches her carb intake closely, I'd probably turn to this cereal instead of some other sweet, when the craving strikes.  For my kiddo, who is very active and doesn't have to watch his carbs, I'm just happy he's eating something.<br /><br />There was quite a bit of "settling", and I've had similar settling with boxes from our local supermarket, so it is to be expected and I think it happens with most cereals- even Cheerios get that dust but this was a few good handfuls of "sticks" that nobody in my family wanted to eat.  I'll probably just chuck them in muffin batter the next time I bake, otherwise they will get chucked.

review/text: The cereal tastes like a cinnamon roll, without being too sugary.  It stands up to milk and doesn't break down.  The box is pretty skinny, so when it was mailed it was crushed somewhat, which made it hard to stand it up on the shelf, so that's a note to people who will buy this product to be shipped in the mail.  Other than that, I enjoyed it and might buy it in the store if I got a hankering for a frosted cereal.

review/text: I have yet to find a frosted mini-wheats that I didn't like and this one is no different. It is the first time I have had the "little" mini-wheats and I like them just as much as the regular size. These little mini-wheats pack a powerful punch of cinnamon roll taste. I think they are a good compromise if you a craving a cinnamon roll but still want something that is good for you. While this cereal does have a lot of sugar it is also full of fiber and iron. Sounds (and tastes) like a good compromise to me!

review/summary: Flavor is definitely reminiscent of cinnamon rolls. Sugar seems bordering on excessive...
review/text: I'm something of a shredded wheat fan. Generally my favorites have tended toward post honey nut shredded wheat or possibly the Kashi cinnamon shredded wheat. Though of late I've rather preferred it plain, as I'm trying to cut back on sugar consumption.<br /><br />All said, the falvor of this is what I says it is. It definitely tastes like cinnamon rolls. But, on the other hand it seems rather excessive on sugar at 12g/cup, so probably on the order of 12-20+g/bowl, depending how big a bowl you prefer. To me that seems pretty unbearably sweet after having been off sugar for some time.<br /><br />I don't know whether the "little bites" (that is squares about half the usual size) add or detracts from the overall appeal. Not sure why the bites need to be mini-er than the usual bite-sized shredded wheat already available...? Maybe for kids? To compete with other small cereals like Cheerios or Golden Grahams? Hard to say. Didn't do much for m one way or the other.<br /><br />If you like sweet cereals, and or really crave the taste of cinnamon rolls, this might be for you. If not, well, I suppose you could take it or leave it depending on your tastes. I'll probably stick to plain shredded wheat of health reasons. But, overall, it wasn't bad. If I was still into sweet cereals I might like it more than some others I've had. Though, again, I tend toward more lightly sweetened things than heavy-handed sweetening, generally.

review/summary: Not bad, but definitely not a favorite
review/text: My kids and I all enjoy Frosted Mini-Wheats. Given the chance to sample a new to me flavor I had to jump on it. Had I not known this was a new flavor I would have assumed these were the Maple & Brown Sugar Mini-Wheats because the flavor is very similar. Straight out of the box these are yummy little things, but in a bowl with milk not so much. The first two bites were great, but the flavor just doesn't hold up. By the time I finished my bowl of cereal all the flavor had vanished, and I felt like I was feasting on plain 'ol shredded wheat. Not a bad thing, but when you're hoping for something a little sweet it can be disappointing. I'd buy them again, but probably to use as a dry cereal snack.

review/text: My nine-year-old Daughter is nuts about this cereal. She's been my main sounding board for this review, since I personally don't care for the cereal as a breakfast food. I'm not nuts about the way it tastes in Milk. Oddly enough, I love it straight out of the box, as a dry snack, washed down by a glass of Milk. My Daughter ran through the box pretty quickly, and we've added it to our grocery list, so consider this a recommendation from two generations.

review/summary: Great cinnamon flavor; perfect for a snack!
review/text: I love cinnamon-flavored cereals, and when I'm going to eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast (or, let's be honest, dinner), I usually gravitate toward the shredded wheat. Lately, I've been buying Kashi Cinnamon Harvest--basically because Kashi has done a good job of advertising and convinced me their cereal was healthier. So when I received the Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats, I pulled both boxes out to compare. Here's how they stack up:<br />Serving Size: 55 g--Kashi, 55 g--Kellogg's<br />Calories: 180--Kashi, 190--Kellogg's<br />Fat: 1 g--Kashi, 1 g--Kellogg's<br />Carbs: 43 g--Kashi, 46 g--Kellogg's<br />Fiber: 5 g--Kashi, 6 g--Kellogg's<br />Sugars: 9 g--Kashi, 12 g--Kellogg's<br />Protein: 6 g--Kashi, 5 g--Kellogg's<br />Both are certified "Whole Grain," and Kashi is certified organic.<br /><br />Basically, the two cereals are quite similar, especially if you don't care if your cereal is certified organic. So for me, it comes down to taste, and Kellogg's wins that battle hands down! When I want cinnamon, I want to really be able to taste it, and these Mini-Wheats Little Bites are PACKED with cinnamon flavor!<br /><br />The one drawback is their size. Sure, they're cute, but when you add milk, they get soggy very quickly. I recommend just snacking on them right out of the box--forget the milk!

review/summary: Very tasty, just not as satisfying as I prefer
review/text: If I can't have chocolate for breakfast, I'll take cinnamon as the second runner up!  The Cinnamon Roll variety of Frosted Mini-Wheats intrigued me.  Cinnamon can often be either too heavy or cheap-tasting in cereal.  However, I found the cinnamon flavor very pleasing in these Mini-Wheats!<br /><br />The serving size felt rather small.  I eat about 300 calories for breakfast, and by the time I eat a serving of these Mini-Wheats plus 1/2 cup of milk, I have just enough leftover for an egg and that's it.  I realize that doesn't sound like a big deal, but when I ate it, I just didn't feel like it was quite enough.  The extra sugar content drives up the calories, so there is simply less there to eat.  For example, I could eat two pieces of whole wheat toast with Smart Balance plus a small banana with the egg for a similar calorie count.<br /><br />For an occasional treat for breakfast, I keep Frosted Mini-Wheats around, because nutritionally it is still better for me that a donut.  I just don't eat them on a regular basis.<br /><br />And I don't really eat chocolate for breakfast, in case you were wondering.  Usually.

review/summary: Not as Good as Frosted Mini Wheats
review/text: I tried to like this cereal because I love Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats, but this just didn't go down good for me.  It was too sweet, and it didn't really taste like I thought it would.  I was expecting the taste of cinnamon rolls but instead it was as if I was tasting an impostor.  Yes, I could taste cinnamon but something else was just a tad off.  Further, the size of the mini wheats I felt were too small to have have that correct texture I enjoy with normal Frosted Mini Wheats.  I did end up eating one entire box so it wasn't horrible, but I won't be buying anymore of this.

review/summary: Great flavor, small bites ideal for children
review/text: Our family enjoyed the cinnamon roll flavor of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites.  The cinnamon flavor was a welcome change to the familiar Frosted Mini-Wheats, but I didn't care for the Little Bites size.  The smaller bites grew soggy in the milk faster than Frosted Mini-Wheats usually do.  However, the smaller bites were perfect for my younger children.  Everyone who taste-tested the Cinnamon Roll flavor in my house enjoyed it, but I still prefer the original Frosted Mini Wheats.

review/summary: Cini Mini's
review/text: Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheat's with Cinnamon could be a great cereal for little kids to snack on in the afternoon or in my case, 25 year old grad. students. The cinnamon taste itself does not overpower the other elements of the Mini Wheat, but rather acts as an enhancement to the sweet flavor. When put under the milk test, much to my relief all of the flavor does not end up in the milk or at the bottom of the bowl--it's called cereal in milk, not flavored milk with something approximating cereal in it. Overall, the cereal passed the milk and dry test and proved itself quite tasty in both scenarios. Spoons up.

review/summary: Healthier option if you need a sweet cereal.
review/text: I tend to stay away from sugary cereals due to the lack of nutrition, even though I do enjoy the taste.  Well Kellogg's is trying to remedy that issue by creating this sweet cereal that is somewhat healthy.<br /><br />TASTE: I love cinnamon and really enjoyed the taste of this cereal.  While you won't mistake it for a Cinnabon, it has a nice sweet flavor to it.  The whole grain does not detract from the taste.<br /><br />NUTRITION: The serving size is 47 mini-biscuits.  This gives you 190 calories (10 from fat), 12 grams of sugar, and 6 grams of fiber.  The sugar content is actually lower than you'll see in a lot of sugary cereals.  And the real star is the 6 grams of fiber.  This is a nice bonus as most people do not eat enough fiber in a day.  This cereal is considered an "excellent source" of fiber and is also made from 100% whole grain.<br /><br />Overall, I find these mini-wheats to be a solid combination of taste and nutrition.

review/summary: Great Size; Tasty; Sweet; Decent Fiber
review/text: This cereal has been a hit for our family.<br /><br />The "little bites" size is perfect for both straight-out-of-the-box snacking (including for our young kids) as well as spooned from a bowl and milk.  I think I prefer it to the straight "Mini-Wheats" size for it's just easier to eat while also maintaining the feel and texture of the typical size.<br /><br />The "Cinnamon Roll" flavor is close to being too much sweet, however. It's good in a generically maple-y sweet sort of way (not a perfect cinnamon roll, really), but a fair bit sweeter than frosted mini-wheats (to say nothing of plain, old unfrosted mini-wheats).<br /><br />Like other varieties of mini-wheats, these are a good source of fiber; they get soggy if left in milk too long; and there is a lot of debris (smushed cereal) at the bottom of the box.

review/summary: Keep Getting Smaller and Cuter
review/text: If you've followed the evolution of the this cereal, you know that it started with big, palm-sized chucks of rolled wheat goodness. The Mini-wheats were the bite-sized improvements on the larger parents allowing breakfasters to get the cereal in their salivating mouths without having to use their spoons as a knife and often making a milky mess. Evidently the mini-wheats weren't bite-sized enough because Kellogg's has introduced the Little Mini-wheats and boy are they cute. With the legacy wholesomeness from the wheats and mini-wheats, the Littles are healthy and delicious. It's rumored that Kellogg's is now working on the atomic Mini-Wheats, but in the mean time, the Littles should suffice for your morning bowl.

review/text: I really enjoyed this cereal.  The size is smaller than the normal mini-wheats, so they absorb milk much faster.

All in all a winner.

review/summary: They're okay...
review/text: Well, there's not a whole lot to say about cereal in a review, so I'll just focus on taste and texture.  First off, I'm used to buying the regular sized frosted mini-wheats, so these small ones are kind of amusing.  It's like a mini mini-wheat!  I don't find that the size makes them any easier to eat; if nothing else, it makes them go soggy a bit faster.  As for the taste, the box says "cinnamon roll" and indeed it does taste strongly of cinnamon, and oddly, maple syrup.  It's not an unpleasant taste, but it maybe should've been called "cinnamon toast" flavor instead.  I would prefer it to be sweeter, but I've got quite the sweet tooth!  I'm sure people who prefer a more mellow cereal would enjoy this one a lot more than I did.  Also, 47 of the little squares is apparently the recommended serving size.  What a joke!  Well, anyway, after trying these out, I think I'll stick with my old frosted mini-wheats!

review/text: Cinnamon roll is a welcome addition to the lineup of available flavors. Kellogg's does a nice job to replicate cinnamon roll taste in this delicious cereal.<br /><br />It never hurts to try something new and the smaller square is the latest venture into the realm of Mini-Wheats offerings. The "Little Bites" are about half the size of standard Mini-Wheats; I've grown accustomed to the normal-sized mini, as I habitually go with one square per spoonful in order to regulate my milk to Mini-Wheat ratio; however, the size of the miniaturized Little Bites may appeal more favorably to small children as well.<br /><br />It's the same delicious cereal with a new size and a new taste experience. If you're already a Mini-Wheats fan and you enjoy the flavor of cinnamon rolls, then there's a high probability that you'll like this one as much as I do.

review/summary: Lightly sweet, crunchy, and filling
review/text: Open the box, tear open the bag inside, and you get an instant whiff of things to come - the tantalizing scent of cinnamon and sugar wafts out immediately.<br /><br />When you think cinnamon rolls, if you're like me, you think of warm and gooey and sweet. The Cinnamon Roll Frosted Mini-Wheats are smarter, though. They keep the sugar fairly low-key and don't overdo the cinnamon either. It hints at sweetness and teases the taste buds with the idea of a cinnamon roll without going over the top with it.<br /><br />The result is something you can eat a whole bowl of and not feel guilty about. Something that doesn't lose it's appeal halfway through the bowl, as so many sugary cereals do. The smaller nuggets are easily bite-size and retain their crunch well, as long as you don't drown them in milk. And it's a hearty cereal - eating a reasonably-sized bowl will fill you up nicely for at least a little while.<br /><br />Simply put, it's a big hit in our house.<br /><br />Fill up a bowl, pour on the milk and dig in. And don't forget to take in that lovely scent of sweet cinnamon when you open the box.

review/text: I personally dislike Kellogg's wheats, whether regular or mini. They always remind me of miniature hay bales and I disliked them since I was a little kid.<br />But these Cinnamon Roll flavored Mini Wheats tasted great. My wife loved them too. She didn't even bother to pour them in a bowl and put milk on them. She just ate them from the box as a snack food.<br /><br />If you like Cinnamon Rolls you will love these Mini Wheats for sure. You get a sweet treat plus the fiber you need in your diet at the same time.<br /><br />UPDATE: It has been at least a month since I tried these and they still have the great taste of Cinnamon Rolls. My wife has bought more of them since we finished off the sample box in less than a week. If you don't like Mini-wheats, I recommend that you try these if you like Cinnamon Rolls. You will not believe how much they taste like the real thing. Some who have tried them said they have a maple taste, which is true. Real Cinnamon Rolls usually have a maple frosting coating on them so these mini-wheats are an accurate representation of what a Cinnamon Roll tastes like.

review/summary: Tastes better than I expected
review/text: I anticipated that it would be very sweet. It was, but it also had a pronounced cinnamon flavor. I do not like eating sweetened cereal- its too sweet for me. I like to use 1/3 bowl of sweet cereal combined with plain corn flakes, bran flakes, grape nuts, or oat cereal. That dilutes it down to something with flavor and a little sweetness. After trying the Mini-Wheats with just milk, I added the plain and it was just right with a cinnamon twang. Eating it straight it had the taste of a cinnamon roll. So now you can decide from there.<br /><br />Looking at the box, it said a serving was 47 pieces. I counted out 47 and the bowl was barely half full. So think about doubling the nutritional numbers if that is important to you. It also means the box will only last for 4 servings. That makes it expensive. Well I'm rating it on the flavor and my choice to water it down.

review/summary: Very tasty cereal but tastes more like maple than cinnamon
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:38 Mins<br /><br /></span>I'm a big shredded wheat fan. I like plain shredded wheat with fruit on top, I like lightly sugared mini-wheats and now I've tried this new cereal from Kellogg's, Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites. This particular cereal is Cinnamon Roll flavored and I found it to be quite tasty. I'm not so sure the cinnamon flavor was pronounced enogh though. To be honest it tasted more of maple-ish flavor than cinnamon. But it was good nonetheless. The Little Bites are about 1/3 the size of a regular mini-wheat. Not only does that make them a pretty handy size for snacking but may appeal to children as well.<br /><br />The cereal holds up well in milk. Unless you let it sit for a while, it will not mush out on you. I was worried about that because since they are smaller there is more surface area for a typical serving when compared to mini-wheats which are larger in size. But unless it takes you 10 minutes to eat your cereal they'll be fine. Of course the longer it sits, the softer it will get.<br /><br />The nutrition specs are decent. About 190 calories per serving (230 with 1/2 cup skim milk), 6g of Dietary fiber, 12g Sugar which is a touch more than I usually like in cereal, but still, it's not overly sweet to my taste. My current mini-wheats have 11g sugar so this compares to those.<br /><br />I was surprised to discover that a teaspoon of white granulated sugar equals about 4.2 grams which means this cereal per serving has the equivalent of nearly 3 teaspoons of sugar. With plain shredded wheat, I would normally use 1 teaspoon of sugar. According to the Nutrition Facts, a serving is considered to be 47 biscuits. Since it is  unlikely that you will be counting your biscuits each morning, here's a little hint. In my video you can see about 21 biscuits, that was 1/2 cup. So A heaping cup would be just about 47 biscuits.<br /><br />Overall I like this cereal a lot. I switch between cereals quite a bit for variety so this will be a nice new treat for me. I find them great for breakfast as well as occasional snacking.

I don't get the cinnamon roll experience that some of the reviewers have described but I do get a slight taste of cinnamon. Count me in as one who enjoys the taste and who is looking forward to getting more when this box runs out. As you probably know, Publix runs a Kellogg BOGO quite frequently and I plan to take advantage of the offer next time it appears. Unless you dislike the taste of cinnamon, chances are you will enjoy this cereal. It is worth a try.

review/summary: LOVE them!
review/text: I am an ingredient freak. I love that this cereal has no high fructose corn syrup or partially hydrogenated oils. The ingredient list is actually quite short, which is something that I always look for. The only downfall is that the serving size is rather small, and there's 12g of sugar in a serving. However, if you know anything about the way your body processes carbs, the fact that there is a lot of whole wheat and fiber in this cereal decreases the speed with which the simple sugars metabolize. I'm not trying to rationalize and say that 12g of sugar is "ok" in this cereal, but I'm just making the point that this is better than some other cereals with the same amount of sugar per serving but less whole grain.<br /><br />Another reason why I love this cereal is the way it tastes. It's delicious! Imagine Frosted Mini-Wheats with a hint of maple syrup and cinnamon instead of the vanilla frosting taste. I wouldn't say that it tastes *exactly* like a cinnamon roll, but the cinnamon flavor is definitely noticeable and wonderful.<br /><br />This cereal is great in milk and also dry. The small size makes them good for snacks (but it also makes it easier to go over the serving size if you're watching calories or other nutritional info!).<br /><br />Overall, as a cereal lover, I would definitely recommend these new Mini-Wheats! They are delicious!

review/summary: I LOVE these tasty little bites
review/text: First and foremost - They taste good!<br /><br />These are tiny little nuggets; about 1/4th the size of mini-wheat's that I've been eating by the handful ever since I opened the box.  There is a little sweetness with a cinnamon undercurrent and a BIG crunch.  I did have to laugh at the serving size - it's 47 biscuits.  Now, I counted them out and found 47 biscuits measure about 1-cup.  I guess as a society we've taken portion control to new heights.<br /><br />There are 190 calories but only 1-gram of fat in that cup serving; also no cholesterol and no sodium for folks like me who have to count that kind of stuff.  There's 200 mgs of potassium so if you add that banana on top you're really getting your daily dose.  There're 6 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving.  The sugar grams come in rather high at 12  but you're not going to add anymore by the teaspoon so for a special treat I'm not worried.<br /><br />Last word - They taste good!

review/text: These mini-wheats aren't bad. They've got a good cinnamon flavor and sweetness, but comparing them to a cinnamon roll is kind of a stretch. The texture with or without mill is certainly not like a cinnamon roll. With milk, they taste like cinnamon-flavored shredded wheat. Without milk they taste pretty good as a snack too.

review/summary: The Scent of Cinnamon Rolls
review/text: When I open the box of Mini-Wheats Little bites it smelled as if I had a box of Cinnamon Rolls. That was nice; what makes it better is the cereal does not taste overall sweet. The Mini-Wheats are much smaller and more convenient for children to eat. I ate this with 2% Milk and found it was good. I would do so again. The taste is not exactly that of a cinnamon roll but close enough to be enjoyable.<br /><br />A serving size is described as 47 biscuits and caloric intake is given dry and with a 1/2 cup of skim milk (190 and 230 respectively). This cereal is made of 100% whole grain fiber A serving contains 24% of your dietary fiber for the day as well as providing 90% of the daily requirement of iron. There is a list of other vitamins and minerals that range from 0 -25%. Though this is truly a whole grain cereal the second listed ingredient is sugar at 12g per serving and 2% or less of cinnamon.

review/text: These came just as my kids (5 and 2 years old) were wanting an afternoon snack. I got right into the box and gave them about 20 biscuits each. (A serving is 47) They loved them! I was curious so I made myself a small bowl too. They are so good. The size of the biscuit is just right for their little mouths. They aren't too sweet, but still have enough sweetness to get the kids to like them. They really do taste like a cinnamon roll. I am pleasantly surprised and will continue to purchase these for them! (Note: we ate them dry.)<br /><br />On another note...I have very picky eaters and have been concerned about their vitamin/mineral intake since they seem to want to live on peanut butter and jelly or cheese sandwiches. I checked the nutritional info and was shocked (and happy) to see that a serving gives 90% of Iron and lots of other good nutrition and fiber. That means that I can give my kids a serving size appropriate for them and they're still getting good stuff from something that they love.<br /><br />I think we may have a new family favorite!

review/summary: Not Bad, Just Not Memorable!
review/text: I love cinnamon-flavored cereals, therefore I was quite interested in trying Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Flavored Cinnamon Roll cereal. Frankly, while not a bad cereal, I doubt I would buy it in the supermarket. First of all, the manufacturer was not kidding in naming the cereal "little bites." 47 pieces of these tiny mini-wheats constitutes a serving, which did not even begin to fill my cereal bowl. By mid-morning, I was hungry, which normally doesn't happen to me when I eat oatmeal, Wheaties, or Cheerios. I would suggest that a serving of this cereal would be better suited to a mid-morning or late evening snack, or consumed with toast and fruit on the side if served for breakfast. It would also make a good snack for children to take to school. And, second, I not detect a strong flavor of cinnamon, although the smell was nice. When I am going to indulge in a cinnamon flavored cereal, I like a sweeter cereal with a stronger cinnamon taste, such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<br /><br />For those who are interested in the nutritional facts, a serving with 1/2 cup of skim milk has 230 calories, and only 1 gram of fat. Although there are 46 grams of carbohydrates in a serving, there are only 12 grams of sugar, which would generally indicate that I should not have become hungry so soon after eating the cereal, so my conclusion is that the skimpy portion was primarily responsible for that. As a contrast, General Mill's Multi-Grain Cheerios, also touted as lightly sweetened, has 150 calories for a one cup serving (with skim milk), 1 gram of fat, 24 grams of carbohydrates and 6 grams of sugar. I find that latter cereal to be filling on its own, which as I indicated was not the case with the Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites. My conclusion is that if you are looking for a lightly sweetened cereal, there are better alternatives to the Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites.

review/text: I'm a fan of Shredded Wheat.  I'm a fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  This one is somewhere between the two, but miles away.  Not too bad as a snack without milk, but I did find the sogged down version to be extremely lacking.  With milk the artificial cinnamon is a little overpowering and not quite right with the shredded wheat texture.  I'm not quite sure how else to say it.<br /><br />Not bad, especially as a midday snack.

review/summary: A compromise
review/text: The cinnamon roll-flavored Mini-Wheats try to strike a balance between the healthy cereal and the sugary cereal, with decent results. It definitely has more flavor than most healthy cereals, though I was not a fan of the aftertaste, which to me seemed as strong as the actual cereal flavor and lingered for a bit. It definitely has a cinnamon flavor, though it was nowhere as sweet as a real cinnamon roll. Just keep in mind that the cinnamon flavoring comes at a cost on the health side - there are a significant amount of carbs here.<br /><br />The smaller size of the bites makes it better for snacking, but worse for breakfast if you like to use milk, because they will get soggy significantly faster than the regular-sized wheats.

review/summary: Good idea needs better execution
review/text: Even as an adult, I love breakfast cereal for a snack, dinner, whatever and I'll eat them dry or with milk. I like the original, the Chocolate Little Bites (addicting), Touch of Fruit in the Middle that I wish didn't have the frosting on top as it's sweet enough from the fruit. I also love cinnamon-flavored food including cinnamon rolls.<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor in this cereal is less on the sweet side and more on cinnamon's bitter side. It also tastes artificial. The label says it uses natural and artificial cinnamon flavoring. Is cinnamon really that expensive that the cereal has some artificial flavoring?<br /><br />This has 6g of fiber -- above my minimum required of 3g from cereal. Surprisingly, the cereal didn't fill me up long enough until the next meal. The biggest question is the cinnamon "roll" part. This is more like cinnamon whole grain wheat. No signs of a cinnamon roll.<br /><br />As for the sweetness level, I'd say it's about in the middle. Cereals like Lucky Charms and Honey Nut Cheerios are sweeter cereal than this. But this is sweeter than original Cheerios, Corn Flakes and Crispix.<br /><br />I don't plan to buy this. There are better cereals out there.

I love to eat and generally won't touch anything that I don't enjoy.  That said...  the cinnamon flavoring of this cereal is really pretty good.  It has enough cinnamon that you know what you are eating (if you don't like cinnamon, don't even bother get a fruit-iced cereal) but yet is not overpowering.  I think it's a great way to get guys like me to eat stuff that they should, but usually won't.  If you buy I hope you enjoy and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

It's not too sweet, but it's just right, probably because the amount of wheat in each bite. I will definitely be eating this for breakfast this week.

review/summary: Mushy Bites
review/text: I am a big fan of both Frosted Mini-Wheats and cinnamon, so I was excited to get this cereal for review.  Unfortunately, I think Kellogg's has not made a good thing better.  For those new to Mini-Wheats, it consists of bite-sized frosted bits that are shaped like pillows.  Biting into one reveals the wheaty layers, and there is a brown-sugar flavor inside.  The significant amount of fiber makes it a good choice for those wanting to stay full for a while.<br /><br />This "Little Bites" version changes that formula in two ways: it makes the bites smaller and it adds cinnamon.  I like cinnamon, so that is nice, but it is more of a background flavor than a real punch, almost like they were afraid to change the flavor too much.  The smaller size is a misstep, in my opinion.  It means much more surface area, so all of those wheat layers are almost immediately turned to mush.  A great thing about the normal mini-wheats is that the outside is soft, but the inside stays crunchy for a long time.  The Little Bites instead turn quickly into porridge.<br /><br />I do not hate this cereal, and in general I am a fan of changing up old formulas.  Just show me a flavor with "LIMITED TIME" on it and I am in.  So, it is not that I am stuck on the traditional flavor.  Instead, I think that this was a bad experiment.

It's sweet enough, but the cinnamon seems to leave a bit of an after taste. That's the main reason I'm rating this lower.<br />Otherwise, it's pretty good. The size of the bites is nice - I like that it's smaller. You can control better how much you want to serve.<br />Maybe I'm being a little too picky with the taste. So I would recommend trying it out to see for yourself.

The taste is OK but much too sweet, too much cinnamon too, I would like to see the small squares in the regular flavored mini wheat squares. Since the squares are so small the company should not put much sweetening on each one so it doesn't become over sweet like this one is. My son thought it was great though and ate almost the entire box, I have about 2 cups out of it and he ate the rest so I guess kids will like this.

I love that these are the little bites so I can just snack on them straight from the box which is perfect since I'm not a milk drinker. They are bursting with flavor for such a small item. However, these little bites have one downfall which is the carb count. The carb count is really high (46) considering these are smaller than the normal size mini wheats. With that being said this is a great cereal to eat and your family will love it if you're not worried about carbs.

review/text: I am a cinnamon roll fanatic. I love them, especially mom's home made ones, but that's beside the point. I saw a new cinnamon roll flavored cereal and jumped at the chance to eat some.<br /><br />I poured it in the bowl, added milk and chomped away. The first half of the bowl was pretty good, but as the milk soaked in the cinnamon flavor quickly disappeared and I was was left eating wheat. It tasted bland and just blah. But, like I said the first half of the bowl was decent until the flavoring wore off.<br /><br />Then, as with most mini wheat cereals I tried it straight from the box. The taste that way was much stronger and more enjoyable, but I am not one that eats this type of food directly from the box so I don't see myself enjoying that.<br /><br />All in all, it was an ok cereal for me. I'm not sure I would purchase it again, or if I did it would be a every 6 months or every year just so I remember why I don't get it more often.

Though these smelled delicious when opened, my husband was decidedly unimpressed with the flavor. There wasn't much of a cinnamon taste. The smaller size  of these is ideal for children, but apparently annoying to adult likers of the regular Mini-Wheats. My husband kept complaining about the diminished bites.

review/summary: Good, but that serving size is annoying
review/text: Lately, I have been trying to eat lean protein for breakfast.  That means egg whites and greek yogurt.  While both delicious, these can get a little boring for breakfast.  Once in a while, I just want a bowl of cereal that tastes like it is bad for me, but in reality is not.  Enter Frosted Mini Wheats.<br /><br />This is a cereal brand that I have enjoyed for a long time.  They make several different flavors, and frosted wheat is not that bad, considering it is a great source of fiber.  Food purists might not like the amount of sugar in the frosted wheats, but all in all, not an awful choice for a once in a while breakfast treat.  So, when I learned there were Cinnamon Roll flavored Mini Wheats, I knew I had to try them.  Cinnamon Roll flavored stuff has been a recent obsession, so that I get the flavor of a comforting treat without the fat.<br /><br />I did not realize the difference between Mini Wheats and Mini Wheat Little Bites until I saw them.  These are much tinier than regular Mini Wheats, hence the slight name difference.  Were the Minis not mini enough? Otherwise, these are your standard Mini Wheats.  They look a little like straw, but I truly think they are tasty.<br /><br />Nutritionally, they are not awful, but higher in calories and carbs than I would like.  However, a great source of fiber and very low fat.  So, for a once in a while thing, once again, not awful.  My biggest complaint is the serving size, which is 47 biscuits.  Really?  You could not have just made it half a cup?  For people who are a little OCD about precise serving sizes, it is a major pain to sit there and count out 47 biscuits each time I want to make sure I am getting a correct serving size.  It is a major flaw as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Taste wise, these were good, not fantastic, but good.  But between the annoying serving size and the amount of calories and carbs, I am not sure this would be a staple in my pantry.  I think there are better, healthier, easier options out there. And if I were going to splurge with carbs for mini wheats, I would probably do it on the blueberry ones.

My wife loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZHO7JK">Kellogg's Frosted Chocolate Mini Wheats Little Bites Cereal 16 oz</a> while I used to love the raisin filled mini wheats they made in the 90s. Sadly, they've since been replaced by the artifically flavored and erroneously named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLWGQ">Frosted Mini-Wheats Cereal, Touch of Fruit in the Middle (Mixed Berry), 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>.  As we're both fans of cinnamon rolls and the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006BXUZVO">Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereals, Cinnamon and Almond, 14.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> (also by Kellogs), this seemed like a good one to try.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I really didn't like it. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all and the icing on the mini-wheats doesn't taste like any cinnamon roll topping I've ever had. I've had ones from organic co-ops to Pillsbury DoughBoy encrusted ones. This just tasted...odd and unpleasant to me. After finishing a bowl, I realized that it tasted like my rabbit's hairball medicine smelled. molasses and malt. Sure enough, malt flavoring is the main ingredient in the icing. As such it was hard to want to take eat any more after the mental picture of me gulping down Laxatone developed. On the plus side, my rabbits REALLY wanted this cereal. It's pretty close to what they eat anyway.<br /><br />My wife liked the cereal however, She didn't think it tasted like cinnamon rolls, but she found the taste pleasing. As such the cereal was one for two in my household and so it gets a thumb's in the middle here. One last note though, each serving is 47 grams of carbs. That's pretty impressive.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: Generally speaking, I really like mini wheats, so this cereal was appealing to me already.  I enjoyed the flavor very much since it didn't taste artificial.  I also liked the fact that it contains brown rice syrup in it instead of corn syrup.  It gives it a different flavor that enhances the cinnamon and combines very well with the wheat.<br /><br />My active teen daughter is a big breakfast eater and if she eats cereal, she's usually hungry within a couple of hours.  This kind held her for 4 hours.  It is hard to measure 47 pieces (serving size) so we just served about a cup which is a little more than what the average cereal calls for.<br /><br />Overall, the cereal tasted good and was good for the tummy.  I'm looking forward to buying some more.

review/summary: So the Mini-Wheats were too big?
review/text: First there was Frosted Mini-Wheats, in original size, then there was Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size. Well, if for some reason those were too much of a mouthful, we now have Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bits. Yes, these are about half the size of the Bite Size versions. This particular one is "Cinnamon Roll".<br /><br />There is nothing new to the table here with the exception of size, which I is unnecessary. Personally, I like original flavor and size the best. But the Bite Size edition were accommodating. These come off as a desperate attempt to give attention to a brand that needs some sort of life put back into it and all they came up with was making them smaller and having a new flavor, which is actually too sweet for me.<br /><br />A serving size is approximately 47 biscuits. Thats 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 46 grams of carbohydrates, 6g fiber, 12g of sugar, 5g of protein and 200mg of potassium. Generally they look good but I guess those that are watching their carb intake might want to be careful.<br /><br />These probably fit on a spoon better than its predecessors in a bowl of milk, but I like the other kinds cause they snack better without the milk. But here, these small ones are easily to snack more than you should.<br /><br />I am grading this product 2 stars for 3 reasons 1) I dont think making them smaller has any reason for existing outside of Kellogs filling the shelves with more versions of something that was fine to begin with. 2) This flavor, Cinnamon Roll, is sweet and has a synthetic taste to it. 3) On the plus side, I like Mini-Wheats in general, so it saved it from being one star.

review/summary: Wonderful healthy sweetener!
review/text: This is such a great product.  It sweetens and adds a lovely amaretto flavor without being made of sugar or artificial sweeteners.  The Madhava brand is terrific and there are so many flavors to choose from that I know I will be using this as my sweetener of choice and trying them all out!

review/text: I have never made menudo but, I use this for chili and tacos and have used it for many years.  A+++ product.  Was unable to find it in the local stores after moving from Texas to Montana and was happy to find it at Amazon.com.

review/summary: Dogs love 'em!
review/text: Once I received these in the mail, the dogs went nuts!  I have two boxers and a yellow lab, who are avid chewers, and I needed something that would last.  The rawhides give them loose stools, so I was searching for something that wouldn't upset their G.I. tracts.  Overall, they have lasted quite some time without damaging the teeth as the nylabones have been doing.  Being in the vet business previously for 12 years, I would highly recommend these for the hearty chewers.  Make sure you obtain the proper size for your breed (I ordered the 3 large for my guys who are 50, 70, & 80 lbs).  They do not seem to splinter while chewing, but I would not leave the dogs to chew on them unsupervised to reduce the possible hazard of choking.  The vendor also shipped the items out in a timely manner, and compared to the other antlers on the market, I believe that the price was very reasonable.
