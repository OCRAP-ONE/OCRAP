review/text: This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. It's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts, no corn, no artificial anything). Just great taste!  Rock on, Yummy Earth.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious
review/text: I discovered a small bag of these Organic Lollipops or "Organic Lollies" as I call them in a supermarket isle (in the cough drops section) - I grabbed them, a bit worried at first cause I thought perhaps they may have been tampered with or a hoax etc.<br /><br />All my fears dissolved as the first lollie dissolved in my mouth!  These things are delicious - I particularly love the TooBerry BlueBerry and Pomegranate!<br /><br />I immediately came to Amazon to see if I can find more - grabbed the 5-pound bag as quick as I could!<br /><br />The only suggestion I could make to the company would be to come out with a set that uses >>ZSweet&lt;&lt; instead of sugar.<br /><br />I feel guilty since I've been trying to cut down on my sugar intake to help lose weight (that was blown out the water by these Lollies) - if I could buy these lollies made using ZSweet, ALL my guilt would be gone - pure, guilt-free pleasure!  Please consider this!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm here again for more - that 5-pound bag is GONE!<br /><br />Simply Delicious!<br /><br />PS - FYI, ZSweet info:<br />"Won't raise blood sugar, Zero calories, 100% Natural, Kosher, Vegan<br />Sugar-Free, Gluten-Free, Zero Net-Carbs, Zero Glycemic Impact, GMO-Free, Natural, No Artificial Ingredients"<br /><br />Perfect for these delicious lollies!

review/text: So happy you all made these because my child is very sensitive to dyes.  I think there are probably lots of kids with this problem but they aren't even aware of it.  I bought a huge bag and split it up between my two children's teachers to give out as rewards instead of lollipops with dyes.  The kids all love them!  I wish everyone would get a clue and realize how bad dyes are for them.  Thanks for making these.  Please make different kids of candies - like sweet tarts, skittles, starburst, or m & m's type candies.  That would be awesome!  Thanks!

review/summary: Tastes like real fruit.
review/text: The best part of these Lollipops is that they are made with "Real Fruit Extracts."  Also, there are so many flavors like:<br />*wet-face watermelon<br />*too berry blueberry<br />*sour apple tart<br />*pomegranate pucker<br />*mango tango<br />*googly grape<br />*strawberry smash (5 stars)<br />*very very cherry (4 stars)<br /><br />They are also made in Mexico and coincidently would be a great pi&ntilde;ata stuffer.  They are hyped as "the BEST lollipop I've ever tasted" by a TODAY show food editor.  They are about quarter sized and 3 quarters thick sized lollipops hence the large amount in a bag.  At only 17g of sugar for 3 pops (5.7g for 1 pop), they are pretty guilt free without compensating taste. I will update this review as i try all the flavors and rate the lollipops individually from 1 to 5 stars.

review/text: I am not a die hard candy person, but these are great!  They do cost a bit more; but they're not that much more.  And besides, you ARE putting it in your body, so I think you're worth it.<br /><br />They are made from real fruit extracts; ironic that that is so rare.  The taste has loads of flavor.  They taste like real fruit.  Nice and tart, not like that sicky sweet that I can't identify in the artificial flavored pops.  Blueberry and cherry are my favorite, but all are excellent.  While not health food, they are a healthier version of junk food.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Disappointed at the company's claimed "even assortment"
review/text: The lollipops are definitely yummy. My two little girls love them. I first ordered the counter bin and had only three flavors, very disappointing. Seeing that the company claimed that they made an effort to provide "even assortment" of flavors, I ordered the 5-pound bag. It is not true. Among the different flavored lollipops, my bag had 108 mango lollipops and only 28 grape ones. The order was directly from amazon and not fulfilled by amazon. So, it is not improved at all.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never had "organic candy" before.  We own a small family farm and are currently working on transitioning to healthier foods.  However with 5 kids you occasionally need a bribery tool and I like lollipops.  The best part is that my husband likes them.  Though he makes fun of the fact he's eating organic lollipops - he still eats them and likes them!  I already had to buy a 2nd bag as I plan on putting them on our table at farmers markets and such knowing that almost all the kids can eat them!

review/summary: Delicious and ALMOST an even assortment...
review/text: I had to try these for my family. I love that they are organic and made with all real ingredients!! Our kids love them and so do we. I can't say that they're MAGICALLY better than every other lollipop I've ever tasted, but their ingredients win me over when it comes to choosing a "healthier" sweet option for my kids. I'm always trying to stress to them that there is candy out there that isn't full of dyes and chemicals. You don't have to poison yourself to enjoy something special. If you're gonna have a sweet treat... these are great! My ratio of flavors (and I bought them "Ships from and sold by Amazon" under IN STOCK) was:<br /><br />17 x pomegranate<br />20 x mango<br />33 x cherry<br />36 x grape<br />42 x sour apple<br />44 x blueberry<br />52 x watermelon<br />75 x strawberry<br /><br />So... not TOTALLY even, but I still got a nice assortment. I only felt cheated on the mango because they're my favorite of the bunch. Luckily we also love strawberry! Nice lollies.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: These are the best lollipops I've ever had!  Sadly, they are not available via Amazon directly at the moment, so no "guaranteed" flavor ratios.  The bag I got was:<br /><br />65 Strawberry Smash<br />60 Tart Sour Apple<br />39 Googly Grape<br />35 Tooberry Blueberry<br />33 Wet-faced Watermelon<br />32 Mango Tango<br />30 Pomegranate Pucker<br />28 Very Very Cherry<br />1 Mango (no Tango; was only one of the colors ;) ...)<br /><br />So, a total of 323, pretty close to "as advertised".  I was surprisingly fond of flavors such as the strawberry and watermelon, which I generally don't like in other candies (artificially flavored ones).  However, the blueberry and mango fell a bit flat.  In general, though, these are the best approximations to real fruit flavors I've come across in hard candy before.  Hope the trick-or-treaters enjoy them as well!

review/summary: great taste but poor mix of flavors
review/text: I had purchased these once before, in a health food store at a premium price and really liked them so I didn't hesitate when I saw this big bag for a great price (the price seems to swing quite a bit so you may want to watch it for a few weeks until it lowers before you purchase). It's great to find something for a small treat that is free of corn syrup and is naturally flavored and colored. They're just 22 calories each but are on the small side for a sucker. I would like to see them made in the US (they are made in mexico) or at least have this fact noted so I would have known before I bought them. All of ours but one had wrappers on and only a couple were cracked so it seems that they have pretty good quality control.<br /><br />The other big issue is the flavor distribution. Our favorite flavor is blueberry and our least favorite is apple. Nearly half of the over 300 suckers were apple and only three were blueberry. With two adults and three kids there wasn't even enough for us each to have just one blueberry. There were also only about five of the watermelon. The remaining flavors were reasonably evenly distributed. I still like the product so I'll likely purchase bags of individual flavors in the future and use the surplus of apple as halloween handouts. I contacted the company after receiving them and they were very nice about it. They said I could send back the apple ones and they would replace them with other flavors but I realized that it would cost half of what I paid for the whole bag plus and hour of my time to do this so I decided to hang onto them. If the flavors could be a more even distribution this would be a five star product. So many reviews say there were only a couple blueberry in the bag that it makes me wonder if they use these bulk bags to get rid of the flavors that aren't selling well in the individual bags.<br /><br />Keep in mind before you buy these that there are about 325 suckers in this bag, it's the size of a throw pillow.

Don't worry about a thing, these tasty treats come in a 5 pound bag approximately 350 pops. These are all natural and are good for your kids.

review/text: This is the second YummyEarth product I have tried and I commend them on their efforts.  Purchasing a 5-pound bag is not something I usually do, but I was able to pass the wealth around to friends and get their comments as well.  My biggest compliment for this product is their ingredient list, it does not get better than that when you look at most other products out there.<br /><br />As for taste, I enjoyed about 75% of the flavors in the bag.  That was also the general opinion of others that tasted them.  The Very Cherry, Mango Tango, Strawberry Smash, and Pomegranate Pucker were among the favorites.  The Tooberry Blueberry did not rate very high on the scale and unfortunately the bag I received had a ton of them.  But I guess you can't like every single flavor.  ;)  Generally speaking though, these were well received and I look forward to trying other YummyEarth products.

I love blueberries, but this one just doesn't taste that great. I also wish that since this is organic, they would go all the way to make it sustainable from the plastic wrapper and stick.  I know it's not really a strong implication of being organic, but it would be nice.

review/text: I got this bag of 500 organic lollipops on a lightning deal at a great price so that if I had any Halloween callers I'd have something to give them by the handful.  The bag of 500 was a much better deal than the tub of 150 lollipops.<br /><br />Was I in for a surprise!  These lollipops are very tasty!  I sometimes have a sweet tooth and these also slow down how much sugar I have... because I eat only one at a time... not like cramming a candy bar or two down quickly. Reminds me of the picking the old penny/nickel candies by what would last the longest. :)<br /><br />These get my 5 star recommendation. I had an even assortment of many different varieties in my bag... anything orange or yellow was in short supply.  Flavors are delicious!  I'd recommend these for anyone with a family... a sweet in the lunch box... a treat anytime!  Instead of a cookie jar, or in addition to, you could also have a lollipop jar. :)

I made 200 treat bags and still had plenty left to bring to work, where they promptly were gobbled up.<br /><br /> The flavors were intense in a good way without being over powerful and I didn't feel the usual sugar rush after eating one. A big plus for a diabetic.

review/summary: Incredibly tasty...Teenager approved
review/text: I bought a 5-pound bag of YummyEarth lollipops when they were on sale as Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day. The price was right, and I thought they would be the perfect candy to hand out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween. At the same time, I also bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDK0D2">YummyEarth Organic Lollipops, Assorted Flavors, 150-Count Container</a>. I figured I might as treat myself to some of the suckers, too. Well, the day the package arrived, I opened up the 150-count contaniner and put it on the kitchen counter. When my kids (they're 13 and 19) got home from school that day, they asked, "What are those?" I told them they were organic lollipops that I got from Amazon. Of course, when they heard the word "organic," they made a funny face and passed the suckers up. Meanwhile, I sampled all of the flavors and was very impressed (and a bit surprised) at how great they tasted. The next time the kids looked at the suckers, I told them that they really should try them because they're REALLY good. Long story short: My kids finally tried the lollipops, loved them, and have now asked if we can hand something else out on Halloween. They do not want to give up their YummyEarth lollipops! The other day, when I reminded my youngest son that the suckers are organic, he replied with: "Who cares? They're delicious!" If that's not a testament to how good these things are, I'm not sure what is!

review/summary: Not only for G audiences -- Adults love these, too
review/text: The YummyEarth Organic Lollipops have exceeded my expectations.  Initially, I was intimidated by the sheer number of lollipops in a 5 pound bag and couldn't decide which flavor to try first.  With my eyes closed, I selected one, unwrapped it and stuck it in my mouth.  Immediately, my eyes teared up with joy as I enjoyed the lovely and tart flavor of the tooberry blueberry.  Although it didn't cry out "blueberry" to me, the flavor was exquisite, the texture was solid and the two-tone color was appealing.  Several of us have tried an assortment of flavors and despite the names not truly reflecting the tastes of some, every single person asked where they could get these lollipops.  We all had similar experiences as the suckers dissolved in the mouth at a uniform rate, no holes developed in the candy, they remained on the sticks until the consumer wanted it removed, the paper stick didn't dissolve with the sucker or give the yuck reaction of other lollipops, and we all wanted another after the first.  Review the ingredient list and you'll see why although not sugar-free, they are free of crummy forms of sugar and if you eat one of these, it's not likely that you'll suffer dire consequences, even if you don't normally consume products containing sugar.  I plan to keep these on hand at all times, carry some in my bag, and share them with anyone who knocks at my door, but it's likely that as the bag contents dwindle, so will my generosity.  I very strongly recommend these if you are in the market for something a little sweet!

review/summary: Delicious organic lollipops!
review/text: We're always trying to find healthier alternatives for our kids, ages 3 and 19 months.  When I saw that Amazon was running a special on them, I decided to snag several bags & am glad I did!  WOW!  These are excellent.  The flavors are incredible and both kids are sold on them as am I.  None of that crap that you find in most suckers ... high fructose corn syrup, all of the dyes and colorings.  Just all natural ingredients with an incredible flavor!  As another reviewer stated, there is no rhyme or reason as to how many you get of each flavor, but that's okay by me.  I would have to say one of my favorites is the mango tango.  Yum!  My son has taste tested all of them and there isn't one that he doesn't like.  :-)  And he's a picky kid!  Try them while they are offering free shipping & 45% off the 2nd bag.  It's like getting 2 bags for one and you can put them back for their b-day party grab bags, send some to preschool for party day and pack some in your purse for a quick treat to give the kids while out & about.  Enjoy!  Mmmmmm!

review/summary: Hits the Sweet Spot!
review/text: I purchased these to fill my candy jar at work a few months ago, and I've now placed my third order. People go nuts for these things! They are absolutely delicious and have no corn syrup or artificial ingredients, which makes them a winner in my book. They are especially attractive when Amazon runs one of their terrific specials on them. Yeah, they are more expensive than a big bag of Dum Dums, but they are also SO worth it! I'm not even a big fan of suckers and I find myself reaching for them at least a couple of times a week. Perfect when you just want a taste of something sweet.

review/summary: YummyEarth Lollipops
review/text: Got these on sale.  Not usually an all natural ingredients kind of guy, but must say, these lollipops are amazing.  Bought two 5lb bags.  Donated one to our church health fair that my wife organized.  She wanted something for the kids as give aways.  They were absolutely popular with them.  Personally, I think they are great.  My favorite are the  blood orange flavor.  My least favorite are the blueberry.  The pops are sweet, but not over the top, and have just enough zing (tartness) to appeal to grownups.  This is a nice assortment.  I keep them on the coffee table to grab one when I need something sweet.  Great product that you can feel confident that the kids (and yourself) will like and also know that it is all organic.

review/text: I bought these because I am allergic to artificial colors.  They have a very strong fruity taste and are quite good.  My only complaint is that the 4 flavors do not seem to be equally represented in the packages.  The two red flavors dominate, leaving only a few of the orange, lemon, and other flavor.

review/summary: Good bargain when on sale.
review/text: I bought these (5 lb. bag) when they showed up as a Gold Box special since Halloween was coming up & I had nothing to hand out to the kiddies & didn't want to just hand out the usual overly sugared junk from my local market. The sale price ($15) was certainly better than what I get for candy at my local health food store, where most candies run at least 5$/pound (& certified organic usually more). The candy arrived (via regular free shipping) 1 week after I bought them (still in time for the holiday). They were packaged in just a plain clear bag (not very heavy duty, but wasn't broken open, despite Amazon's (usual) lack of any insulation in the box.<br /><br />The label on the bag was very bare bones & gave some idea of the ingredients, but was not up to usual standard for selling in a store.<br /><br />[direct from the label:] Ingredients: Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Tapioca syrup and/or Organic Rice Syrup, Non-GMO Citric Acid (from beet sugar - not corn), Natural Flavors, may contain Organic Black Carrots [?], Organic Black Currant, Organic Apple, Organic Carrot, Organic Pumkin [sic].<br />Serving Size 17 grams (approx. 3 Lollipops): Calories 70, Total Carbohydrate 17g 6% (sugars)....everything else is 0.<br /><br />The label also states "Certified Organic By Oregon Tilth". 100% Natural Flavors. Real Fruit Extracts. 100% Vegan. GMO-free. Allergen Free. Egg free. Soy-free. Nut-free. Gluten-fee [sic]. Gluten-free. Wheat-free. Casein-fee [sic]. Dairy-fee [sic].  & an additional label that states "Best By 09/23/11".<br /><br />Now, I was a bit skeptical about these, particularly since I am a long-time Organic consumer. There are several organic candy manufacturers near me & I have not seen this label in my local stores. The label only added to my skepticism about whether the contents were really organic. It does use the USDA symbol on the package, but identifies an agency I never heard of as the one that did the certifying. The ingredients listing only added to my skepticism: what is pumpkin & black carrot (?) doing in predominantly red & purple lolllipops? Also, no mention of the actual flavors in the ingredients (except apple) & a rather vague statement about what syrup is used, which all seems rather strange to me. I was also a bit skeptical of the organic claim because these were manufactured in Mexico, which has lower quality control & labor standards than the US (but with the recent scandals about the FDA & USDA's poor regulation of the safety of US food, & with the USDA watering down the "Organic" label from it's initial, stronger standard as created by the CCOF, who knows how food quality would compare any more). Third, the misspellings in the ingredients added to my skepticism.<br /><br />Because of the reviews, I decided to count the flavors of the 325 Lollipops in my bag. Here's the breakdown:<br />Apple 43<br />Pomegranate 39<br />Cherry 34<br />Grape 39<br />Watermelon 50<br />Strawberry 39<br />Mango 46<br />Blueberry 35<br /><br />So perhaps they've improved quality control over the mix breakdown. In the time it took to count the lollipops, I ate 3: Apple was fairly sour, but clearly identifiable as such. Watermelon was also on the sour side, but less identifiably watermelon. Cherry was also a bit more sour than tart or sweet. So far, I liked the flavors (I don't like overly sweet candies, which was another reason I bought these, many of the candies at my health food store are coated in extra sugar & too sweet for me).<br /><br />So the overall verdict so far is pretty good candy in bare bones packagaing. A bit of clarity in the labeling would make these a winner.

review/text: While the flavors aren't earth-shattering or exotic, and you may not necessarily notice a huge difference between the taste of these and suckers that are not organic (inorganic?) and full of crappy stuff but with similar flavors (such as cherry or watermelon), they're a nice get, especially if you can get them on sale.  I find them to be particularly nice to give out on Halloween because they're something a little different from what everyone else is handing out. If you're a big fan of suckers, you'll enjoy these, but they aren't going to be revelatory.

For this reason it is great for birthday party bags or Halloween.

I read the reviews of YummyEarth lollipops and meant to pass them up for something without any sugar.  I am very glad that I changed my mind! At least, I was before my daughter needed treats for Valentine's Day, and my sons friends seemed to like my candy stash.  Don't get me wrong, I love to share- except for these candies.  Usually my purchases last a month.  When I saw the HUGE bag of candy, I thought I would have it for maybe 3 months.  I am down to hunting stray lollipops in the livingroom now. The good thing, 3 lollipops are a serving.  I don't like the apple much but then my daughter didn't like the grape. Even my husband, who doesn't eat candy, has been seen combing through my stash. I will buy them again!

review/summary: It's all in the name
review/text: I spent today nibbling on these. I kept wondering why they called these Orange Punch. When was the last time you ordered an orange punch?<br /><br />Could it be that the name "Orange Crush" was already taken by the soda they taste so much like? Or maybe it was that combined tangerine flavor I could get a hint of when I first rolled one around in my mouth that made it "punch-like." or perhaps the names wanted to emphasize that the flavor had a punch to it (because it certainly does have a punchy taste). Or perhaps they were a bit punchy after naming all of the other flavors.<br /><br />Whatever the reason for the name, these taste a lot like the orange soda they aren't named after. Because they are so sweet, they also remind me of the orange skin candy my grandma used to make.<br /><br />If you don't want to stick to a single flavor, these are also a part of the soda fountain collection. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBMAS8">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Soda Fountain Mix</a>.<br /><br />If you are new to the Beyond Gourmet collection, they have all natural colorings and flavorings, and carry a wide variety of flavors intended for the adult palate. Save the cheap ones for the kids, and stash these where they won't find them.<br /><br />I am grateful to have received a complimentary sampler of the flavors and have been savoring them one flavor at a time.

review/summary: Disappointed....Ok but Nothing like 7D Mangoes
review/text: I received these thinking they would be delicious. I was disappointed. They are average. In my opinion, they are too sweet. And however they are processed, they do not resemble the actual mango. Once you've tried 7D Mangoes, everything else pails in comparison. 7D Mangoes are awesomely delicious!! These ones are just very so/so! and actually not very good when compared to 7D.

review/summary: Good Mangos
review/text: These mangos are similar to others that I have tried from SE Asia.  They are sweetened with cane syrup which has a brown sugar like flavor.  They don't have the stringy fibers like other dried mangos that I purchased.  They are a good product for the money and I will probably buy them again.

review/text: So looking forward to receiving this as I am unable to find it locally, but the jar arrived already open (the seal was halfway removed & the jar was leaking) & the lid had been TAPED closed with packing tape as if I wasn't supposed to notice. Eww.<br /><br />This seller CALLED ME AT MY HOUSE this morning!  I don't know how they got my information since this was fulfilled via Amazon & the seller should not have had anything to do with the transaction other than receive the funds.  They called to ask me to take down my review (though they did graciously ask if they could send me another jar of Tamarind) but this was seriously creepy, not to mention a violation of Amazon's rules.<br /><br />When I leave a review, it is for the item that I ordered.  This item (& transaction) deserved 1 star.  To ask that I remove it would be disingenuous.  To call my home is downright scary.

review/text: My family loves the Al Dente Three Peppercorn Fettuccine.  I use the recipe on the back of the package every time I cook it.  The only thing, I don't add is the tomatoes, because 1/2 of the family members do not like tomatoes.  It is such a big hit.  I have a five year old and a three year old and they have seconds and thirds every time we eat it.  I've tried the recipe on the back with different pasta, and it is not the same.  It is well worth the cost to buy this pasta to use the recipe.  It is much cheaper on Amazon than in my local grocery store.  I will definitely be buying more of this through Amazon.

review/text: I absolutely love peanut butter but it's such a high calorie food that I really have to limit my consumption. My typical morning begins with a bowl of oatmeal which I like to mix about 150 calories worth of peanut butter into. I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!

review/summary: Utterly foul.
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee. I've had at least two cups a day, every day, for the last 5 years. I've been all over Portland and Seattle, and I've tried coffee from all of those places. In that time, I've had good coffee, and I've had bad coffee.<br /><br />Never have I had anything as bad as this product. Now, I don't want to give the impression that I am a coffee snob. I grew up drinking poorly brewed Folgers. It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. When I make my own coffee, it usually isn't of the highest quality, and I can make due with a lot of crap.<br /><br />But this was a whole new world of bad. The cinnamon completely overpowers the taste of the coffee, and I could bare get it down. I don't know who in my family wasted their money on this filth, but I am very disappointed.<br /><br />If you LOVE cinnamon, this might be OK for you. For the rest of us who enjoy normal coffee, don't waste your money.

review/summary: Cinnamon Via
review/text: First of all, I know that "It doesn't taste good" is not a very useful review, so I apologize and caution that it's what this review boils down to. Unfortunately, there's really not much else for me to say about the Cinnamon Via. The smell is revolting in a way I can't describe, and it tastes exactly as it smells. I could not make it past two sips either time I tried this product (once with milk, once without), because the flavor was vile. It wasn't just "hm, this isn't really my bag", it was "holy crap, I need to rinse my mouth right this second or I'm going to throw up."<br /><br />I chose the cinnamon flavor because I like the "Cinnamon Dolce" latte, so I was surprised at my reaction to the Via. Ultimately, I guess my recommendation to anyone considering this (especially based on the Cinnamon Dolce latte) is to just buy one packet instead of six. Even if six is cheaper per unit it's not a good deal if you don't like to drink it.

review/text: If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />Have always used loose tea, but this time wanted to try their teabags (because of the convenience/portability) and to see if the bagged tea would brew as clear as the loose tea, and I am happy to report that it actually does.<br /><br />I am so glad to find Ahmad teas available here because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current Prime deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally). I'm taking advantage of the Subscribe and Save offer.<br /><br />The six tea boxes arrived nicely packed (see the photos I uploaded).<br /><br />Each box has a packing date (08/2011) and a best before date (08/2014).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend.

review/text: My one year old, like any other baby, always wants what the next kid has.  But what the next kid has is always "fruit juices" with not really any fruit, but tons of sugar.  I am very picky what I give my child so when I randomly came across this water+juice drink at a farmers market, I was hooked.  Only problem was, I couldn't find it anywhere!  I eventually searched Amazon after wasting a lot of time driving from store to store, and tada!  Here it is.  This drink not only tastes good, it's mostly water so it doesn't contain even half the sugar as most kids fruit juice boxes out there.  It also comes in a smaller box so it's perfect for my little one.  By the way, both the tropical and berry favors are delicious.

review/summary: Hansen's Tropical Junior Water for Junior.
review/text: I just recently discovered some small boxed drinks (4.23 ounces) at a nearby market that are called Hansen's Tropical Junior Water Beverage. They come in several varieties, but I chose the tropical variety for whatever reason I'm not certain. I got them for my little boy (about four years). Junior Water for Junior, so to speak. He's always asking for a drink and I suspect he'd prefer soda pop or some other unhealthy thing. I try to head off this desire by providing him with some more nutritious alternatives and this beverage is one of them. It's organic, low on sugar (real sugar, by the way) and has a mild but excellent taste. He likes them. I much prefer giving him these rather than some of the alternatives.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

So that means for 2 cans it's twice the price, Unless the price drops to about seven dollars per can with no shipping, it's not worth it. I paid under seven for my 18.5oz can...and they're over half almonds and cashews...I don't mind almonds, but I'm not a big cashew fan (I know, weird) I love all the others the best. :) However, they are getting 3 stars because the quality of the nuts was great - if you don't mind that cashews and almonds are the new "peanuts" of no peanut nut mixes - then you'll be fine!

review/summary: GREAT ITEM BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRICE!?
review/text: I like the no peanuts & the variety with Macadamia nuts,Brazil nuts & Pecans...As expected it was 80% Cashews but at the previous "Amazon" price of 14.00 for two 21 ounce tubs, and Super Saver free shipping, How could I go wrong? The price has more than doubled though and the value is no longer there. At 25.00-27.00, Ill not be purchasing this item any longer.<br />Is it possible Amazon does not offer this item any more which is why the prices are higher with other vendors?

review/text: I love Planters Mixed nuts! I gave them up because I am losing weight, and have to reduce my salt intake. Now I eat walnuts, a few at a time. But this is a great product!!

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: Mostly almonds and cashews which is fine with me, but the nuts did not taste as fresh as they should.  Some nuts had an off taste, most were OK, though, and overall not too bad, just not as good as I would expect.<br /><br />Not even close to the fresh nuts you can buy at the few remaining stores that carry them.  I would not reorder these.  Not trying to knock Planters, I've been eating their nuts all my life, but these were just OK at best.

review/summary: Gone to seed
review/text: I bought this product in December 2010.  It is at least 50-60% almonds, and I'm yet to find a hazelnut, despite re-mixing to overcome shipping segregation.  They used to be best on the market - now they're just another ripoff.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This Oat Bran pancake mix is delicious.  They are very tender and light, with just a touch of cinnamon.  They only take water to mix and any left over pancakes freeze very well and can be heated up in the microwave.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Krusteaz Low Fat Oat Bran
review/text: In the past, I have purchased the Krusteaz Low Fat Oat Bran Pancake Mix from our local grocery stores. Usually, I mix this product with Krusteaz Honey Wheat Complete Pancake mix.  Even my youngest son will eat this and normally doesn't like anything other than plain homestyle pancakes.  When I used up my package of the oat bran pancake mix, I went to all of the stores and could not find any that carried Krusteaz Low Fat Oat Bran Pancake Mix.  I looked on the Krusteaz web site and this product was still listed as being available at the store where I used to purchase it.  I decided to look for this product online and found it through Amazon.  This is the first time that I have purchased any food item online.  I'm so glad that I could find it.  Krusteaz Low Fat Oat Bran pancake mix makes great pancakes, even if you don't mix it with any other complete pancake mix.  Once made and allowed to cool, these pancakes freeze well in a freezer bag.  They can be easily reheated in a toaster set on a low setting.  My kids and I all love them.

review/summary: My favorite pancake mix
review/text: When we moved from Michigan to Wisconsin, we could not find a store in the state that carried this mix.  We could not find a good subsitute so now we just order four boxes at a time from Amazon.  We really enjoy the pancakes.
