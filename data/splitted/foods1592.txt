One added bonus was that they helped him with heartburn.  Who knew?

review/summary: Buyers Beware...Misleading Product Information...
review/text: First off...I have no issue with Similac Formula Liquid or Powder, its a great product and my son loves it.  I do have a serious issue to discuss and that is with the way this vendor displayed the product information.  With a price of $59+ and a description that says, "(4x6) Size 8oz one would assume that you would be buying 4 boxes times 6 bottles of 8 oz size bottles.  What I received was one single box of 8 oz bottles, and no way of contacting the seller.  Talk about misleading, it might as well be fraud, considering you can pick up a 6 pack of these from CVS for about 15 bucks.  What a crock.  In fact writing this review, makes me want to change my rating even though I know this vendor doesn't care about customer service since they have no way for me to contact them.<br /><br />once again, I have no issue with Similac or any of its products, this review is to let the vendor know that your information is misleading and just plain wrong.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing.

review/summary: FIVE stars for this as iced latte; TWO stars as a cup of hot joe
review/text: I tried VIA when it first came out. I tried it the traditional route--as a hot cup o' java. I did not like it. Not this roast and not the Columbian (which was so weak, why bother).<br /><br />So, it's hot. It's summer. I normally hit Starbucks after the gym for my fave iced sugar free vanilla latte. I saw the ad for the iced coffee VIA, but it has sugar. I don't want sugar. So, it hit me, why not try making iced coffee from the regular VIA. (duh, should have thought of that sooner). I bought a 3-packer (like this one shown in image).<br /><br />It was amazing. 2% milk (about a cup), ice, Starbucks sugar free vanilla syrup (I buy it at my local Starbucks), in a blender bottle and shake, shake, shake. It comes out frothy and delicious. FOr me, I like it BETTER than my habitual 2 to 3x a week fix of it at the store. Because you add the VIA to the milk and the milk is cold and the instant coffee is not hot (like espresso), there is NO DILUTION. It makes for a much more flavorful, less watery, iced latte. OH MY GOSH SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.<br /><br />Now, my problem is not having three lattes a day, instead of three a week. Seriously. I'm a junkie now. (And I have coffee everyday, but my homebrew is so much better than Starbuck's that I don't get hot coffee there, I just used to like the convenience--still do--of grabbing a fast latte after exercising. I have a great coffee set-up at home with Paradise Roasters and Terroir gourmet single origins and a Technivorm and a Barratza burr grinder and filtered water pitcher, so really, now that I can make a fast latte at home and take it with me to the Pilates studio and put in the fridge there until I'm done, I may not be visiting the Starbucks as much, except to get my fave protein plate now and then and stock up on VIA.)<br /><br />The product is crazy overpriced. What...more than five bucks for what's 3 servings? How sick is that? Buy it at the store unless the price is dropped. That's crazy.<br /><br />But, nummy latte.<br /><br />So, if iced lattes are you vice of choice, might wanna consider this. And if you don't want sugar, skip the one they're pushing now in the blue packaging and buy the unsweetened.<br /><br />And I just slurped one after dinner (latte that is). Addictive. (Er, literally, I guess.) But at least I'm getting my calcium. :D<br /><br />This price is much better than the other one I reviewed on Amazon (by another supplier). But I still think it's overpriced. Once you pour out all those servings, it's just a few teaspoons of instant coffee. Amazon would move tons of this if they priced it more reasonably.

review/summary: Wonderful for travel
review/text: I bought this to try for camping since I normally do Starbucks drip coffee at home but wasn't sure what access I'd have to coffee and didn't want to drive to a town to get it.  It was great!  Nothing like other instant coffees.  I saved my extra packets after my trip and have used them when I ran out of ground coffee at home for my "backup" plan.  It's expensive for instant but so much better than driving in to a coffee shop on a Sunday morning when I'm out!  For camping/travel it can't be beat.  We are the type who road trips with a camp stove, tent, cooler etc and stop where we are ready to stop, hotel or campground or what we may find.  Heat up some water in a hotel microwave or over a camp stove, it doesn't matter with this stuff.  Love it!

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I've recently switched to drinking instant coffee due to time constraints and other reasons I won't get into on here. Let's just say I've drank hundreds of cups of instant over the last few months. Before drinking instant, I drank tea almost exclusively. Aside from being a former tea addict, I've had an appreciation of well brewed coffee in the past. My favorite coffee is Melitta's Sun & Moon organic. It's simply the best coffee I've ever had with perfect balance of rich taste and complexity. Formerly, when living in San Francisco, I really had no reason to ever go into Starbucks because there was always a Peet's near by, or a local coffee house. So I think I know a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />Alright, now I'll get onto the instant coffees I've tried. I've drank Folgers instant, which has an awful chemical taste but it's tolerable for instant, I've drank Fred Meyer's organic select, which is actually quite good and doesn't have much of a nauseating aftertaste. I've had nescafe, which also has the awful instant chemical aftertaste. How does Starbucks VIA compare to these brands? It has the same nauseating checmical aftertaste of Folgers and Nescafe.<br /><br />Starbucks VIA can be described as having sweet acrid bloom when it first hits your mouth that turns into chemical sweetness nauseating finish that makes you want to pour the whole thing out. There's no denying this is an instant. It's also a mediocre instant compared to generic organic select I've tried (which surprises me, honestly). I have no idea why someone would pay a premium for this, except they're very gullible and easily manipulated through brand loyalty and corporate marketing. Strange to me people would spend so much on an instant that comes in very environmentally unconscious packaging, costs almost 10x as much as any other instant, and tastes mediocre and only review it highly because it has Starbucks familiarity to naive and gullible consumers.<br /><br />Next to try is Jacobs Krunung instant coffee, and I'm hoping for better results. Which shouldn't be too hard considering Starbucks VIA is one of the worst instants I've tried so far.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I strongly urge you to try purchasing Organic instant or perhaps Jacobs Krunung instead.

It is almost like drinking hot water - but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee. If you want fast coffee, allow me to suggest a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO">Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> instead.

review/summary: Not Impressed
review/text: I haven't been able to find Via in any store that sells starbucks coffee (Big chain stores not actual Starbuck stores).  So, to try it, I had to order it through Amazon.  This instant coffee tastes like instant coffee. The only way I would ever use it would be to add it to a weak cup of regular coffee to make a stronger brew.  At least this way the "instant " taste goes away and I can enjoy a strong cup of coffee without my friends having to brew their weak coffee my way. I won't be buying this product. By the way, I ordered the instant Italian Roast. If you like strong coffee like I do, but hate the "instant coffee" taste, don't bother purchasing. I read the favorable reviews and truly hoped I would be just as impressed. Sadly, I was disappointed. Live and learn.

review/summary: Starbucks VIA Italian Roast instant coffe
review/text: I live in India and during my last visit to USA in 2010, I was greatly attracted and thoroughly satisfied with VIA Italian roast - NOT BOLD or EXTRA BOLD. During my current visit now, I couldn't find the normal Italian roast in any of the Starbucks stores. Hence I placed an order on-line for a single 12 pack, thinking that I would get my favorite normal Italian roast (at least the picture at the site made me think so!) but was disappointed to receive the EXTRA  BOLD! Whatever happened to the normal Italian roast? The EXTRA BOLD is over-roasted and the taste and flavor are spoiled.<br />Sundaram Parameswaran

review/summary: comparable to most any home brew
review/text: I am a plebeian as far as home-brewed coffee is concerned. My first coffeemaker deposited itself at the kitchen counter less than 12 months ago, after 30+ years of ground bean indifference. And it's a mini Mr. Coffee, to boot. So, I do not consider my coffee buds in any way honed or refined by home schooling. However, I do indulge in professionally prepared coffee at the many excellent outlets NYC provides and must say that the Starbucks instant comes close to a cup of coffee sold by a local Java parlor. The little packet is also a whole lot more potent than a cup of average Joe at the local deli -- I'd love to see what the actual caffeine content of the single portion is. Having said that, I can hardly justify the price of this new instant variant. The best deals on these are generally offered by Starbucks site itself and god forbid, one decides to check out prices at the local Target -- it's actually more expensive to buy Starbucks instant there than anywhere else!

review/summary: Perfect for travel
review/text: This last summer we had an extended trip from Missouri, across Kansas, and then to Denver. As a Seattle area native, I'm used to great coffee on practically every corner and daily lattes are my favorite splurge. (Hey, I also give 10% of my income to good causes, so I'm not TOTALLY decadent.)<br />I'm sure someone on here can tell me they exist in the midwest, but I didn't find a place for over a week with a decent cup of coffee, and while I know on a scale with world peace that isn't a tragedy, I LOVE coffee.<br />From the freeway as we came into the Denver area, I spotted a Starbuck's sign and begged that we leave the freeway and find it. When I told the barista at Starbuck's about no good coffee for a week, she introduced me to Via packets I could carry in my luggage or even purse.<br />I was totally sceptical that instant coffee would be drinkable, and then completely won over when I tried it. I don't know how Starbuck's managed it, but Via smells good, tastes good, and is incredibly convenient and easy to use. It goes with me everywhere I travel now.<br />On mornings when I don't head for my neighborhood latte stand, I add Via straight to hot milk and get a very (relatively) inexpensive treat. I seem to be doing this more and more, and saving a lot of money doing this. If you thought instant couldn't be good, suggest you try Via.<br /><br />Added: I travel quite a bit -- both nationally and internationally -- and one of the first things to go in my suitcase when I pack are VIA packets. They are tiny, and guarantee I'll have decent coffee wherever I go, at a very minimal price per cup.

Highly recommended if you can't get to a Starbucks or a decent coffee brewing apparatus.

review/summary: Best Coffee - Period
review/text: I love coffee. I love it's taste, smell, texture - I love it all. What I love most about coffee now is how easy it is to make. There is literally nothing more simple than VIA. You simply heat water and pour. Up to this point, I was going to Starbucks everyday for my morning cup of joe. Well, not anymore. In fact, I love VIA so much that I no longer enjoy the taste of Starbucks morning brew. My favorite type of coffee has always been french pressed but it takes time. But then VIA came out and literally rocked my world. The best part is I can have great coffee anytime. When I travel or visit friends or family, I don't have to worry about whether or not they have a coffee machine or lug my french press with me.<br /><br />Also, for those of you who don't like the taste of Starbucks, no worries. My mother detests Starbucks and I asked her if she'd like a cup of coffee without telling her what it was. I made her cup of VIA and drank with her. She looked at me and said, "This is really good. Can I have another?"<br /><br />I know it may seem expensive to buy, roughly 83 cents a cup, but I found that I don't drink more than one cup and I used to drink around 24-30 oz every day. In truth, it's cut down on coffee consumption, not increased it.<br /><br />Also, you can vary the strength depending on how much water you add. I like mine strong, the way it was intended, so I'm adamant about only pouring 8 oz. of water into a mug. Actually, I bought the VIA mug too because it just made life easier.<br /><br />So, don't question your decision anymore. Buy it and love it.

review/text: I drink 2-4 cups of coffee spread out over the first 8 eight hours of the day. I start with a travel mug on the trip to work, an occasional mid-morning refresher and a cup of coffee after lunch. My early morning coffee is almost always half-caff drip coffee and my lunch coffee is almost always instant. I drink coffee black with no sweetener.<br /><br />I like the convenience of instant coffee because it allows me to indulge in one of my favorite brews at odd times in the day. It is simple to make and there is very little waste or mess. If no one else drinking coffee then I can still have a nice hot cup with very little bother.<br /><br />How does the Starbuck's instant stand up for me? I like the no-mess packaging and the flavor is excellent - it would be hard to distinguish this from drip coffee. The quality is everything Starbuck's has advertised.<br /><br />What do I dislike? The only thing I don't like is the cost. I think it's way too expensive.<br /><br />Would I buy this on a regular basis? Probably not. For the price of an instant cup of coffee I could make a whole pot of coffee and thow out the extra.<br /><br />Would I buy this again? Absolutely. It really was very good.

review/summary: Hate to admit that I like this coffee
review/text: I hate to admit when I'm wrong, but I was wrong. I received a box of these in a coffee raffle basket, and I immediately stuck them in the back of the pantry, with no intent on using them. I prejudged it because:<br /><br />- I hate instant coffee<br /><br />- Starbucks coffee is good, but I prefer to support local coffee houses whenever possible, rather than the "McDonaldization" of coffee that Starbucks is after. So, I'm one of those superficial "Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks" pseudo-snobs. Nothing against the product quality. Just against the idea and presenation (I still say "small," "medium," or "large" whenever I go there. Sometimes they're the only game in town. Can't bring myself to use the Startalk names)<br /><br />Today, I tried one because I was too tired to grind and drip. Surprisingly, this stuff tastes pretty good for instant coffee. Naturally, not as good as fresh ground, but still pretty good. After reading up on it, I suppose the difference is between the microgrind and the traditional freeze-drying.<br /><br />So, yes, I'd drink this coffee again. But at the price, I'm not likely to buy it often. Or ever. Trader Joe's has a similar type of instant coffee for much less. Maybe for camping trips, but I'll try others before buying the Starbucks brand.<br /><br />Five stars for the product quality, as far as instant coffee goes. Lose a star because of the high price, which is probably due to the brand than anything else. Good product overall.

review/summary: I don't usually drink the grounds
review/text: The coffee beans are apparently micronized so you barely notice the fine grounds you are drinking. The coffee is good, but the sludge at the bottom of your cup is still gritty and your coffee is too.  I was able to filter the finely divided grounds out, but why pay $1 per cup to do that?  I'll just go back to my French press.

review/summary: I expected to like it... instead, "yucky" and "owie"
review/text: I love coffee and coffee drinks and have been a Starbucks customer for years. (I don't think that Starbucks is as good as serious espresso bars, but we don't have any nearby.) So I was excited when Starbucks announced VIA, and I tried both flavors as soon as I could get my hands on them*. I was surprised to find that not only did both of them taste harsh and acidic, but they gave me a stomachache.<br /><br />After confirming several times that I wasn't just imagining the stomachache, I stopped buying VIA. Luckily a relative introduced me to Taster's Choice Colombian instant coffee, and it is not only better-tasting in my opinion but it doesn't bother my stomach. As a bonus, it is about one third the cost of VIA.<br /><br />*Rather than mixing instant coffee with water, I add it to a cup of hot milk and stir in a bit of sugar.

review/text: I am of the opinion that VIA Columbian is pretty awful I was very excited to learn that there was an instant coffee out there that could compare with my drip; maybe be even better, but it's not even close. This instant coffee is just another one on the shelf, and at the price, totally not worth it.

review/summary: Best instant coffee out there!
review/text: Starbucks Via Italian Roast is the best instant coffee I have ever tried. The flavor and aroma are identical to a fresh brewed cup of Starbucks. It doesn't taste washed out, is in fact really bold, and there is no bitter aftertaste at all. My only complaint is the high cost per cup, but as the only regular coffee drinker in my household it is still affordable for my weekday morning drive.

review/summary: Starbucks fufu coffee snob approved!
review/text: I am not a regular coffee drinker.  I don't "need" it in the morning. But when I do drink coffee it's usually iced, it's usually doctored up with sugar, cream and other stuff (caramel, whipped cream, you name it!) and it's usually Starbucks.  And there comes the win! I can make my own iced coffee drinks at home, without owning a coffee pot, or any heating mechanism whatsoever. This instant works very well for iced coffee when mixed with cold water. It doesn't need hot!<br /><br />And I get a very familiar taste!  Four stars instead of five only because for someone that fits into my category, the price is a bit high for someone who may not be that demanding on the flavor but can't find easy cold water substitutes.

review/text: There are two levels for walking into Starbucks: a great cup of coffee and a great experience,<br /><br />If you walk into a Starbucks that is a local hangout  and not a briefcase stop, chances are you have several friends or will soon. The best coffee in the world is part of this.<br /><br />Via will not replicate this on either level. Empty the Via pack, add water, stir, and you will get a strong, bold, and flavorful cup of coffee. You can taste the heaviness of either flavor, Columbia or Italian. These both beat Pike Place fresh hands down, but given the choice I would still go for fresh Pike over Via. To get the full nuance of either Via, try it fresh first. .<br /><br />There is still that chalky aftertaste that comes with most instants, although the one here beats any non-Bucks by miles. You know you are not drinking fresh brewed--besides, no sexy girl with kindness and smarts is handing it to me with a smile, asking how my life if going. But if your stuck in a Tasters Choice office all day, you wanna have this. You'll never go back.<br /><br />If only a sympathetic ear came at the bottom

review/summary: It's Instant Coffee ...
review/text: I have a friend that gets Armenian coffee sent from his relatives back home in Armenia.  It is a fine powder that you put in a cup, pour water over, stir and drink (I put in sugar before I drink).  It is heavenly, but he lives far away now and I don't get it anymore.  So, when I saw this VIA and that is was not processed like an 'instant' coffee, but the real beans ground into a fine powder I thought of the Armenian coffee.  Well, I was comparing apples and oranges.  VIA, however they say they process it, tastes instant coffee and that's not a good thing.  It is convenient, but so is every other instant coffee.  It's a decent substitute when I'm too lazy to grind and brew, but so are the other instant coffees.  Basically, it's okay, nothing out of the ordinary.

review/summary: Can't believe people actually buy this stuff...
review/text: This is such a scam! All they do is grind up coffee beans extra small so you don't notice you're drinking grounds! Maybe it tastes ok if you swallow it down right away, but let it sit for a while and tell me you don't notice that nice burned bitter flavor like you left the french press sit too long. Let alone the acid stomach ache. Strong does not equal bitter. This isn't "instant coffee". If you're stuck on drinking grounds, just go to the store, grind up some beans on the finest setting, and put a spoonful in your cup. Just don't drink the last .5 inch. Or you could buy some of those hand-fillable tea bags, fill them with medium or coarse grind, and steep for 30 sec. They decompose and are near free. These little packets (just like everything Starbucks) are a huge waste of packaging and money.

review/summary: My dog loves them!
review/text: My dog loves these things.  They are getting harder to find.  I have had some problems getting "old" product that has either expired or nearing expiration from some vendors that offer them at discounts.  I am glad to see that Amazon is carrying them directly now!<br /><br />EDIT Sept 2012 -- While the product is still great, Amazon is ripping people off with this product and has it priced significantly higher than even the manufacturer is selling it for.  This product used to be significantly lower in price and was packaged in (3) 3-packs here.  Currently amazon is selling the product 1 package at a time for 7.15.  The manufacturers retail price on their website is only 5.49 so you are paying over $1.66 extra (30% more than the manufacturer charges) to buy this on amazon than to buy it from the manufacturer (and it can be had for much less than 5.49 from other vendors on the internet).<br /><br />Frankly I am shocked.  I have brought this up to two customer service people and they seem to insist that there is nothing wrong with the pricing.  I used to trust when I shopped amazon that I was getting a good price, but this experience has taught me a lesson that I can't blindly assume I am getting a good deal on amazon any longer.

review/summary: Best rawhide chew
review/text: I have a large Golden Retriever who loves to chew.  Rawhide chews are great for dogs because it takes quite a lot of chewing to finish them.  But they can also be dangerous because the rawhide gets soft and slippery.  If the dog bites off a large chunk it can get caught in the throat and is almost impossible to retrieve.  The directions always say to monitor the dog while they are chewing rawhide.  Another thing to consider when choosing a rawhide treat is the calories.  Dogs eat rawhide and too much of it will pile on the pounds.  Dingo makes the best rawhide toys, and they come in a variety of sizes and shapes.  The larger ones, particularly the ones shaped in a knot, are dangerous for my dog because the pieces she breaks off are too large and sometimes get caught in her throat.  But these sticks are perfect.  After a couple of really serious bites the red flavor strip in the center starts to fall out and that occupies her for quite a while.  When that's gone she returns to the rawhide.  They are large enough to keep her happy but small enough so that she can have a couple of these each week without compromising her diet.  I think Dingo may rate them for smaller dogs, but they work well for my Golden.  The only problem is availability.  My local pet stores have stopped carrying this size, for some reason, so I had to buy through Amazon.

review/summary: Too Large for Small Dogs but Tasty (I Guess)
review/text: The moment I opened the package, my dog went crazy and tried to chew it for couple hours. However, this rawhide is too large and too thick for her and she ultimately gave up on it. My dog weighs about 7 pounds (not a puppy). I wish Dingo makes same rawhide with half of its thickness. Bad luck for my dog and me, but if you have a bigger dog then this rawhide is highly recommended.

review/summary: My dog loves these... but is this three total or nine total?
review/text: First, my dog LOVES these Dingo bones.  He won't touch any other kind of bone, but these are a special treat.  He's very finicky, so I'm thrilled to find something he enjoys so much.  Plus, since these don't have the knots at the end, I'm able to give them to him and feel confident that there won't be any gastrointestinal issues later.  (My sister had a poor dog that swallowed the knotted end of a bone and had to have a surgery to remove the blockage.)<br /><br />But this particular Amazon item... is it for three packages of three bones?  One would have to imagine, since it's over $10... but assuming it's so doesn't MAKE it so.  It says it's a three-pack, but there are three bones per package, so it doesn't necessarily mean there are three packages.  One package of three generally goes for $5.99 at PetSmart, so I can't imagine Amazon selling it for $10.80, but stranger things have happened.  Anyone have any idea how I could find out for sure before I order?

review/summary: Finally, a rawhide my dog loves
review/text: My sheltie was starting to snub rawhide bones, even the flavored ones, and I was trying to find a chew she'd like as she can always use something to clean her teeth.  I'd seen the Dingo bones before, but the bright red chicken jerky turned me off.  Well, now I was willing to try anything.  I gave her a Dingo Dyno Stix, and watched her devour it over the course of a half hour.  She meticulously pulled it apart and ate it until she'd gotten every last bit of chicken jerky.  Only part of the innermost bit of rawhide remained.  Success!<br /><br />I wondered if it was a one-time thing for her to like it, but I've given her another 1/2 dozen Dyno Stix over the past couple weeks, and she spent a good half hour on each of those too.  So far, so good!  She does have to be in the chewing mood for these (she's not a "gotta chew all the time" kind of dog).  She might not chew on it the first time I give it to her that day, but later in the day she'll be ready to chew, so I'll give it to her again and she'll sit down and go through the entire chew until there's not a scrap of jerky left.<br /><br />For those wondering how big my dog is, she's a 30 lb sheltie, to give you a better idea of how long it might take your dog to eat a Dyno Stix.

My vet suggested pumpkin puree, an all natural product, but it  was nowhere in the grocery stores! I turned to Amazon, my reliable source for so many things... and there it was. I like this product although it took a few days for my dog to accept the new taste (but he's finicky). Now he eats it with no fuss. I have to give him a lot more than the recommended dose, about two heaping teaspoons per feeding, and I make sure he poops every morning at the same time and at night at the same time. I also cut back on his dog food in general, which is good quality, and I make sure he gets exercise. Now he is regular and all is good! I credit Nummy for saving my dog's life. Thanks Nummy-makers!!

review/text: The lamb is tender and spiced like a true "Vindaloo", which is quite spicy. Strange thing I discovered--if I eat the food warm and not piping-hot, then the spice level is "medium to hot."  If you heat it according to instructions, then you'll get a habanero-like hotness.  There are about 3-4 chunks of lamb in each meal (perhaps 3-4 ounces' worth), so it's more of a lunch-sized portion at under 400 calories.  It is delicious, and I have not had any better at Indian restaurants.

review/text: This is the only paprika to use when making Chicken Paprikash!  I like my version HOT and this item is used to replace the bland paprika that most clueless cooks use to make what I would call a "Politically-Correct" dish.  Don't eat a "one-size-fits-all" Chicken Paprikash and if your guests don't like it, dump them, they're too provincial; get yourself newer, more sophisticated friends and watch how socializing with the right group of people will compensate for life's travails.

review/text: If you love your paprika smoked were just the smell of it makes you say aaaahhhhhh and you love the smoky taste it gives any food.I would not recommend this brand!As it is barely smoky.Before I tried this brand I feel in love with Especias delSol hot smoked paprika-which is good and smoky with only a touch of hot.When I could not find it anymore I decided to try this brand.Let me say I was really disappointed.

review/summary: My new addiction
review/text: I purchased the two pack and gave the other jar to my son.  Well both of us use it all the time. It adds a flavor to foods like chicken that is just incredible. It is not overly hot so if you want your food very spicy you might want to purchase some cayenne pepper to crank it up a notch. I think this is one spice that is a great addition to my spice collection and because it works so well on so many things it is a spice that will always be found in my spice cabinet.

review/summary: tastes good but could have wheat in it
review/text: I ate these pretzels for years and loved them and YES they are a great value.  I am wheat sensitive so spelt products are what I use for a substitute.  A law was passed a few years ago that requires companies to label their spelt products in the ingredients section as:  Spelt flour (wheat flour).  (I'm not going to get into why they do this here).  BUT this allows the companies to cut the spelt flour with 50% or less wheat flour and still call it spelt.  This was a nightmare for me, and after attempting to contact Vitaspelt to ask if they did cut the product with wheat flour, they never answered me so I don't eat their product for fear it will make me sick.  If you aren't wheat sensitive it's a great product, if you are BEWARE.  There is another great alternative, Newmans Spelt pretzels.  They do not have the wheat label on them and I switched to eating those years ago...very tasty!

review/summary: Old fashion fresh taste
review/text: This was a bit of a surprise to me.  I've been working at eating healthy for 20 years, I'm from the era where "white" meant pure and healthy.  So I make the best choices I can with the info I can find yet still eat somewhat "mainstream".  So for a crunchy snack, that meant whole wheat pretzels, and I enjoy them, the sweet wheat taste is nice.  However, I saw these and I was curious, the price is certainly reasonable compared to purchasing locally so I gave them a go - how bad could they be? They are amazingly like the fresh crunchy pretzels of my youth which included bleached white flour.  So much like them that I re-checked the ingredients.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was expecting something different, perhaps that might take some getting used to but these are just great.  I would change brands for one with sea salt, but for now, I'm happy that my snacking can be a bit healthier.  If you are looking for wheat free, healthier or just wanting to try something different, I think you might enjoy these.

review/text: My daughter and I have been on a 'wheat free' diet for several years now.  WE are thankful for the health benefits that these choices have opened for us.  One top food item I've missed the most have been good, crunchy pretzels!  These Spelt pretzels fit that niche wonderfully!  Wow!  The bags are a good size that keep us going for snacks and dipping.  They are fantastic!!!<br /><br />I just came back to Amazon to order more and I was shocked at the price change.  Only two months ago, I paid just over $2 a bag....  and now it is about $3.60 a bag!!!  What's up with that?  I suppose then I'll have to look in stores to find a better price.  I sure would have ordered more in a heartbeat had I know the prices would change so much....  now I feel like I'm 'back to the drawing board'.

The commissary normally has the lowest prices, but the Amazon 12 pack box with auto reorder option is by far the best option around (plus you can share them with friends). I figure one order every 6mo should do. And yes, gluten free is the way to go for many of us regardless of your present health. I'm in the medical health field and all the studies are leaning this way.

review/summary: Crunch can break a filling
review/text: This has got definite crunch if that's what you are looking for.  I would say that if you don't have good strong teeth don't attempt to eat this.  There are tiny little crunchy pieces that can break a filling.  The Tomato Chipotle flavor has a little chipotle warmth but no real heat, I wasn't crazy about the flavors or lack of it.  I did keep chewing away for the definite crunch factor.  If you are looking for a healthier snack I would recommend trying Newmans Own Organic Pretzels, Spelt.

review/summary: Love these...
review/text: New item for us. We saw the word  Chipotle and had to try them. The pretzel has an unique flavor and a great "crunch" factor. They are Organic, gluten-free and the ingredients is brown rice, flax, quinoa, sesame, amaranth, millet, and chia seeds. These sticks are hollow in the middle and come in different flavors,  chipotle tomato,  sea salt, and curry.  We have only tried the Chipotle tomato. We  liked them a lot but  I can't remember which store I bought them at. I have gone out of my way for a couple of months now to every store I shop at to find these again, that's how much we enjoyed them,  but no luck. It seems the Internet is the only way to purchase the product right now for me. I have never bought a case of any snack but since we thought they were so good it is worth it to us.

review/summary: A delightful alternative to "flavoring"
review/text: Read the ingredients - the three items used to flavor these are sea salt, tomato paste, and chipotle powder.  I would say the tomato is barely noticeable.  If you like smoky chipotle chili powder - this is a deeply enjoyable alternative to most other snacks on the market today.<br /><br />These are a snack I want to keep available at all times.  It is a crunchy (very, very crunchy to be clear), satisfying, noticeably spicy, nutritious alternative to basically any other snack.  I was surprised by the spice (as in spicy spice).  This definitely is not a flavor that has been tamed - and I am grateful for Mary's boldness.

review/summary: Tasty Gluten Free Cracker Sticks!
review/text: We love these cracker sticks! We're happy that this flavor (and the curry one) are soy free too. They are nice and sturdy like pretzels and have an excellent crunch. This is our favorite flavor-Chipotle Tomato. The flavor is not overpowering, but a nice additon. They are excellent for munching on as they are and dipping in hummus or salsa and other dips too.

review/summary: "Bad" Flavor
review/text: The crunch and texture are pleasant, but (wow) the flavor is terrible.  These taste like burnt hair, shaved from a sweaty homeless man on a humid summer day.  While there is a slight hint of heat, which I guess is the chipotle flavor coming through, the inclusion of "tomato" on the packaging is misleading to say the least.  In summary, I would rather eat extremely stale, unseasoned rye chips over these "sticks & twigs."

review/summary: Genuinely unpleasant tasting
review/text: Every now and then a product will come along that seems so perfectly unsuccessful that I marvel it actually went into production. I love to cook, and as such, in my experimentation, I've had a few misses along with my hits, but there is something valuable to acknowledging the misses. These have a weird bitter (almost burnt) taste which merges most unharmoniously with the (vague) dry, smoky chipotle note. There is no tomato flavor whatsoever. The previous jocular review which cited the flavor of "human hair" is, sadly, not far off. When I dislike a cracker's taste, I'll try to make the best of it by slathering cream cheese on it. These are beyond cream cheese's redemptive powers. They're the first cracker ever that I've thrown in the garbage. Mary, you really have gone crackers by bringing these to market. They totally suck.

review/summary: Not a Fan!
review/text: These do not remind me of pretzels at all. They may be crunchy but they lack anything in the center and remind me of really crisp thin crackers rolled into sticks. If they were crackers, I would not buy them either but that might be because I don't like really crunchy crackers but instead ones similar to the Glutino Original Crackers or Ritz crackers where they have a slight more substance to them.
