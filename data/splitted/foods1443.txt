review/summary: Does a chocolate chip cookie stand for improvement?
review/text: When I think of chocolate chip cookies two brands come to mind, Toll House and Chips Ahoy.  Now Chips Ahoy has been around for quite some time and over the years they have come out with many variations of their cookies, from the classic style to cookies with nuts, oatmeal, reduced fat and candy bits, just to list a few.<br /><br />This deviation is "chewy gooey chocofudge" which is a soft style cookie with a fudge center.  So to simplify even further, there is a soft/chewy chocolate chip cookie surrounding a fudgy center.  I would have thought I would have liked this cookie more than I did.  I mean a chocolate chip cookie with a fudge center, how could that be bad? Allow me to explain....<br /><br />I think that the combination of chewy cookie and fudge is too much.  I almost wished the cookie was traditional; it would balance the fudge better.  The fudge itself is almost more like cake icing, very concentrated.  Not to mention that all the fudge took away from the chocolate chips.  The final issue, perhaps the most unnerving, is there is a bizarre aftertaste.  It is almost like I can taste the preservatives in this product.  If a person is a hard core chocolate junkie I think this product is a grand slam.  I prefer the old school Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookie. However, capitalism will tell if this "spin" on a classic will stay on the shelves or not.  Who knows, perhaps we will see chocolate covered chocolate chip cookies next.

review/summary: Not To Bad, But Not As Good As You Might Think Or Expect
review/text: These super moist chocolate chip cookies come with a layer of fudge inside of them. If you are looking for a lot of chocolate, these cookies are for you.<br /><br />But they are not as great as they are at first taste. After a couple of bites, the cookie part tastes a little bland, almost like they used too much flour in the cookie. When you bite into them, the cookie around the fudge stays semi firm but on the edges crumbles away. Also, they are really small cookies, about the size of a silver dollar. I was a little shocked at how few cookies were in the large package.<br /><br />And, of course, if you are looking for a quick chocolate treat, two cookies are 150 calories. If you want a good chocolate snack look elsewhere.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs.

review/summary: Pretty Good Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: I am a big fan of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies, so I am somewhat partial to these gooey cookies. They are filled with chocolate fudge, which makes them noticeably sweeter than most other chocolate chip cookies. They are certainly very gooey, but they are not at all chewy. They are also much smaller than most other Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies. They are very crumbly, and I am even tempted to leave them in the fridge to stiffen up. Like most other Chips Ahoy! packagings, the box has an easy resalable cover which will help keep the cookies fresh for as long as they last. Overall, these are good chocolate-chips cookies that add a new twist to this kind of sweets.

review/text: I wish I could give these cookies ten stars! I am not generally a fan of pre-packaged cookies, but these are as moist as homemade. The chocolate filling has the same flavor and consistancy as chocolate chips in cookies still warm from the oven. It is not gooey, nor is it overly sweet. And, there is exactly the right amount to enhance, rather than overpower, the taste of the cookie. Well done, Chips Ahoy! Very well done!

Gooey goodness!<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Sure!  They were scrumptious.

review/summary: Chocolatey Goodness
review/text: I was under the impression that everything that could possibly be done to a cookie has already been done. There have been cookies dipped in chocolate, covered in sprinkles, or with frosting on top. That is why I wanted to try these new cookies because I am always interested in a "new" take on the old classic chocolate chip cookie. Most "new and improved" cookies fail but Chips Ahoy has done it right this time!! These cookies are a wonderful new twist on the fantastic classic chocolate chip cookie. These cookies are just like regular Chips Ahoy, which I love, but a bit gooey-er. They almost taste like they're just out of the oven. The best part, is that they have chocolate INSIDE the cookies. I don't want to say that they're "stuffed" because that would sound like the chocolate inside is overpowering...which it is not. Instead, there's a thin layer of chocolate in the middle that is just perfect and makes the cookies a real treat! If you warm them up a bit in the microwave or oven, the inside gets extra gooey and fudgey which I love! Basically, this is the perfect dessert. I felt completely satisfied after eating two cookies and with a good-sized helping in the package, I have more than enough for the next two weeks. I know that new takes on a tried and true classic can be a letdown, but trust me on this one...it won't disappoint!

review/summary: Semi Scrummy, but...............
review/text: These cookies arrived on the first day of summer during a heatwave.  I expected they would be melted beyond all recognition and was quite surprised to open the package (which is cleverly resealable)  and find the entire contents intact.  Right away I wondered just how gooey and chewy they would be if 105 degree temps and a day in the mail truck couldn't melt them.<br /><br />Well, it turns out they were definitely chewy but not what I would call gooey!  I found these cookies to be pretty sweet, more so than "chocolatey" and that was a big disappointment.  I would have to say that regular old 'Toll House' type cookies are much better in both the chocolate and chewy category.  I also was struck by how 'processed' they seemed to taste.  More so than many of the packaged cookies we purchase. IN fact, for me there seemed to be some unidentifiable taste (not a bad taste) that didn't jibe with the ingredients.  Nothing terrible, just not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I admit my taste buds aren't what they used to be, but these are my honest observations.  I am quite sure these cookies will turn out to be many people's favorites so please don't take offense.  For me, I think I will stick with my standby toll house mix in a bag.  Yeah, you gotta bake em, but they are immeasurable better in every way!  Nice try Chips Ahoy, but no cigar from this household.

review/text: I had actually had one or two of these cookies at a picnic a few weeks back. I was fairly impressed at how good they were and was eager to try them again.  Unfortunately, the pack that I received from Amazon was less than impressive. The cookies themselves were dark, seemingly burned. Half of the pack was broken. And honestly, they just didn't live up to my memory of just a few weeks earlier. I'd be willing to give the cookies one more swing, based on my first exposure.  Because, to be certain, if this pack of Chips Ahoy Gooey were my first go round...  there wouldn't be a second.

review/text: These are really tasty cookies, but the name isn't quite right. They say they're chewy and gooey. They're neither. The outside is more "crumbly" than "chewy", and the inside is definitely not gooey; It's more like a big chocolate chip.<br /><br />They might be gooey if you microwaved them for a few seconds, I suppose.<br /><br />They are so crumbly, in fact, that the contents of my package were pretty beat-up by the time I got it. Cookies were broken in half, or shattered into crumbs.<br /><br />Still, the flavor is awesome and that's what really counts here. I'd say get them if you're a chocolate lover.

review/summary: Mine were not gooey, but they were good.
review/text: Since it's summer and extremely hot outside, I expected these cookies to be very nearly melted when I opened the package.  But they were still perfectly intact.  And were not actually gooey at all.  The chocolate filling in them is soft and a little grainy as cooked chocolate tends to be.<br /><br />What I do love about these cookies is that the chocolate inside is dark chocolate.  In my experience, chocolate chip cookie fans like milk chocolate in their cookies.  I tend to prefer oatmeal and dark chocolate in my cookies--trick myself into feeling like it's a healthy cookie--but in most cookie crowds, my preference seems to be in the minority.  I am so glad the good people at Chips Ahoy see things the way I do.  Well, no oatmeal in there, but it is dark chocolate.<br /><br />They don't taste like fresh-baked cookies.  They are soft and moist, which is good, but they do taste packaged and preserved.  I guess that's not so shocking considering that they are actually packaged and preserved.  The cookies are small... I don't see a problem with that... as they are soft cookies; their size keeps them from crumbling under their own weight.<br /><br />I asked my 8-yr-old daughter to "review" these cookies.  I did use the word "review."  She said, "They taste like cookies.  With extra chocolate."  Then, feeling that a review should probably be more creative, she announced, "It's like there are stars bursting in my mouth!!"  Yes, creative, but I have no idea what that is really supposed to mean.  Means she likes them I guess.

review/summary: Milk's New Favorite Cookie?
review/text: Chocolate chip cookies with a chocolate center? What a concept! Good thing someone finally made it real. Chewy Gooey Chocofudge is a treat which delivers what it promises, but not so much the "gooey" part.<br /><br />The texture of the cookie is like the soft <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>, but that's where the similarities end. The chocolate center isn't gooey though, but it is a healthy dose of chocolate. Still disappointing for people who were expecting cascades of chocolate. I have a serious sweet tooth, and I found the aftertaste to be too sweet for me. They are still very enjoyable, just keep that milk within reach.<br /><br />Serious chocoholics will enjoy them.

review/summary: Not appealing based on look and taste
review/text: What could be better than a soft Chips Ahoy cookie with a fudge center?  Apparently quite a few things, as this tempting snack did not live up to expectations.  To start with, the image of the cookie on the package looked nothing like the contents within.  Perhaps it was because the cookies arrived on my doorstep in the heat of summertime, I don't know, but what I found were trays of unappealing, blackened-looking (because of the fudge interior) chocolate chip cookies.  Oddly, it looked as if these snacks got into a fight and emerged all black and bruised.<br /><br />Still, a cookie might look ugly and still offer up a great taste.  Well, not so much.  Yes, there was a definite overload of chocolate, to be sure, but it had a sandy, gritty taste.  I stopped my snacking after a single cookie, even though the serving size is two for 3.5 grams of saturated fat (thankfully, no trans fat).  Again, I am willing to accept that I maybe got a bad package or one effected by the heat, though I rescued it from my porch less than ten minutes after it was dropped off by UPS.  I can't recommend this, unfortunately.  I would instead go with a Keebler Soft Batch cookie any day.

review/summary: Tasty but not as gooey as you would think
review/text: These are pretty good for Chips Ahoy and have a good flavor.  The chocolate is a bit strong in the cookie (you feel that you need to drink something to overcome the flavor).  They are good, and enjoyable.  The Gooey center is not as gooey as the picture would have you think.  In fact I feel that they have a chippy (or hardened chocolate) when you bite into them.<br /><br />They are good, and if you give them a try you will either love them or hate them.  However, keep in mind, the different taste seems weird at first, but after a couple of cookies they are really good.<br /><br />In the end they are good cookies, and offer a different twist on the chips ahoy that we all love.  Also they ship well.  I live in South Georgia and even after being in a mailbox for a whole day, they were not melted.  They held their shape and texture, and were very good (even after being in a mailbox in 100+ degrees weather!

review/summary: Softer Cookie w/ a Fudgy Center
review/text: This is a pleasant new addition to the Chips Ahoy! brand.  It's softer and a little smaller than the original chocolate chip cookie. Each cookie has a bit of fudge flavored choco-cream in the center.  Although it's soft, it holds up surprisingly well when repeatedly dipped in milk.<br /><br />I scanned the package looking for any mention of hydrogenated oil, but happily found no such listing.<br /><br />10 oz was actually plenty to satisfy a couple of sweet-toothed kids (and mom).  It was a rare indulgence.  It certainly doesn't taste homemade, but will satisfy on a road trip any day...

They just looked said, all broken in there with no real chunks to grab and enjoy.<br />These aren't that gooey, either.  I prefer the chewy Chips Ahoy!, as at least they're intact.  These cookies tasted a little more dry than the chewy ones, and I didn't notice any larger chip chunks or "gooiness," per se.

review/text: The Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge along with their cousins, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2">Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge, 10-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> have been a disappointment. There is something off with the taste. It tastes flat and overprocessed, and on top of that each cookie is 75 calories. These are fairly small cookies, around 2 inches in diameter.<br /><br />Too bad because the description sounded promising. These Chocofudge actually taste slightly better than the Megafudge, perhaps because they have less of the uninspiring fudgeness.<br /><br />They arrive in a package that opens and reseals at the top. The cookies are arranged in three rows of six cookies each.<br /><br />They get 2.5 stars for the taste, but 75 calories for a 2-inch cookie drops them down to 2 stars.<br /><br />If I had to chose between these Chewy Gooey and the regular Chips Ahoy cookies, I would definitely go with the regular tried and true Chips Ahoys.

In fact, even when I tried to pick the cookies up from the container, then bent and broke apart.<br /><br />My husband commented that he enjoyed the cup of milk more than the cookies.<br /><br />Our 7 year old said that it was good, but he would choose the original Chips Ahoy over this gooey version.<br /><br />We all agreed that your money would be better spent, and taste buds more thoroughly satisfied, if you stick with the very delicious original Chips Ahoy.

review/text: I love chocolate, and I love cookies, so I was excited to try these cookies.  I was particularly looking forward to a gooey center filled with fudge, as depicted by the large picture on the package.  I was disappointed.  There is a thin, disc-shaped chocolate-colored center in these cookies, but it is certainly not gooey.  Really, it's more like putty, and it doesn't have any discernable chocolate flavor.  The rest of the cookie is chalky in texture and also has no recognizable chocolate flavor.  Personally, I prefer the regular, old fashioned Chips Ahoy cookies over this new gooey version.

I think most adults would want a better tasting chocolate for their palette, though, and a little less of that artificial sweetness.<br /><br />I think most kids would love them, and they are small, which makes for a nice treat size. They are not gooey when you break them open, though, as the picture on the packaging implies.

There is a firm flavor of vanilla in these cookies, making for a nice contrast with the fudge flavor of the chocolate chips.

review/summary: chewy and tasty but looks are disappointing
review/text: Chips Ahoy!'s latest entry into the competitive chocolate chip market is "Chewy Gooey Chocofudge". The package comes with a convenient re-sealing top, to keep your cookies fresh. Which brings me to the cookies themselves - while they taste pretty good, they are definitely not what I clarify as "gooey". Think of these cookies as having a chocolate fudge inside, with the veneer of a regular chocolate chip cookie on the outside. The cookies are easy to bite into.<br /><br />Size-wise, the cookies are more bite-sized (3/4 of an inch or less) than regular size. They don't look as appealing as the outer package photo. If you can live with that, these are pretty decent cookies to snack on.<br /><br />My recommendation: put the cookies on a baking pan or microwave and heat them up before serving. They go well with a cold glass of milk, which is really the only way to eat chocolate chip cookies anyway.

I know shipping is a separate issue -- unrelated to the quality of the product, but I would be hestitant to buy cookies online unless something were done about the packaging. Despite the cookies being busted, I enjoyed them being cold & hard, as opposed to being advertised as soft & gooey -- I think if these cookies were served room temprature, parents would have fun cleaning up chocolate covered kids. In any case, the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge is a yummy new item from Chips Ahoy!!

review/summary: Not a bad soft chocolate chip cookie
review/text: I have never been much of a fan of Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies.  I don't like hard chocolate chip cookies and I would only eat a Chips Ahoy! if I was stuck at a kid's party or some other place where there was nothing better.  Now, though, Chips Ahoy! has launched two new soft chocolate chip cookies:  the one under review here (Chocofudge) and Megafudge.  I think they are both pretty good, but I think the Chocofudge is better.  The Megafudge is almost like a brownie -- as many fudge-style cookies are -- and I prefer a more conventional cookie.  So, if you are thinking of trying one of these Chips Ahoy! cookies, you shouldn't be too disappointed with either one, but I would go with the Chocofudge.  Actually, of the mass produced chocolate chip cookies, I prefer the Pepperidge Farms soft baked Nantucket chocolate chip cookie.

review/summary: Chewy, but not gooey
review/text: These were pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. The texture was good, as far as soft cookies go. They were soft, but still held together in the package and when you removed them from the package. The flavor was stronger and more chocolatey than the "megafudge"  version of this cookie, which I also sampled. They were not gooey, in spite of the name of the cookie, but I see that as a benefit.<br /><br />The cookies come in the resealable package, which works very well and I like.<br /><br />I probably would not buy these cookies in the store, but did like them well enough to eat several for dessert on the day I opened up the package.

review/summary: So yummy-- a nibbler's dream, but pricey on calories and $
review/text: I absolutely adore chocolate chip cookies, especially soft ones with lots of opportunities to nibble.  These new Chips Ahoy cookies are so yummy!  They're soft, with lots of chocolate chips and a fun, fudgy center.  When I got a box, I immediately opened it and doled out portions for the family into separate plastic bags, because I knew I'd be tempted to each everyone else's share!  My share quickly disappeared, and I am now poised to go do a long, cardio-heavy workout to burn off all this sugar and fat.  As much as I love these cookies, they're NOT for every day, and especially not if you want to slim down!<br /><br />If you do purchase these through Amazon, I would recommend putting them in the fridge if they've been exposed to high temperatures, such as in the summer while they're out in the USPS delivery truck.  I can imagine the center fudge could easily melt and create a big mess.  Time in the fridge would solidify these right up.<br /><br />My only criticism would be with the price-- it seems a little high for only 18 cookies.  A family of four would go through a box in no time flat, for sure.<br /><br />But overall-- tastes great, don't have it every day, and be sure to burn off the calories!

review/summary: Funny Taste & Broken Cookies!
review/text: I was disappointed by these cookies, and would never get them again.  Here's what went wrong.<br /><br />1. The cookies themselves are not "engineered" to withstand any kind of travel or transport.  Upon opening the package, over 60% of the cookies were broken, with piles of crumbs at the bottom of each tray well.  Those cookies that were spared would practically disintegrate when I picked them up.  This made for difficult eating.<br /><br />2. The cookies have a very strange chemical flavor to them that I couldn't explain.  it's most noticeable in the aftertaste, but both my wife and I found it extremely unappealing.  They're also far sweeter than normal chips ahoy! cookies.<br /><br />3. The cookies are small.  Meaning, if you want to feel like you really satisfied your sweet tooth, you'll have to eat far more than the recommended serving size of ...two cookies (150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar). If you can get past the aftertaste, you'll want at least 4 to feel satisfied.

review/summary: VERY Sweet, Chewy, Not So Gooey
review/text: These are smaller than the average Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookie.  They are very soft and chewy, but not too chewy that your jaw tires before you can swallow!  I wouldn't say they're gooey, but they are "mushier" than a soft chocolate chip cookie.  They are VERY sweet.  Too sweet for me, and I am a major chocoholic with a sweet tooth!  They seem to have a lot of brown sugar in them as that's the most prominent taste.  The chocolate center isn't really fudgey either -- it's more like a Hershey's kiss in the center.  Kids will probably love these (my son likes them), but I'd never give them more than one or two in a day!  Honestly, I prefer the original Chips Ahoy over these and probably wouldn't reach for these again (unless my son asked me to buy them)

review/summary: overly sweat...mostly a piece of chocolate and little cookie
review/text: The cookie is basically a single "center" piece of chocolate with a thin cookie coating plus chocolate chips. The idea, is you heat them up and they become this big chocolate gooey-ness of delight.<br />Well, yes and no.<br /><br />We get the same re-sealable packaging and 150 calories per serving (2 cookies. . .they are small)<br /><br />Also, I'm normally very critical about food products these days since we have the a lot of options to make things healthier. In this case we have flour, sugar, cornstarch, more sugar, cocoa button, etc. Overall, other than the preservatives that keep the cookies "fresh" I was impressed. . .but I still don't like them very much.<br /><br />I've always been of the opinion that processed/packaged cookies that say "chewy" never taste like real, soft cookies. And this continues that trend. . .it just doesn't taste real.<br /><br />I'm more of a processed cookie needs to be non-chewy or if you want chewy make homemade.<br /><br />Kids are definitely not particular, they just want a sweet item. My kids did like them, but agree that homemade cookies will always win out. Even with all their praise, they didn't come chase me down the following day for more cookies, they wanted other sweets. So, it was a fleeting impression on them too.<br /><br />Go with the original in my opinion, you could pass on these unless you really want something you don't have to cook and isn't a hard cookie cookie.

review/text: These cookies are great if you also love Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies. The extra heavy layer of fudge in the middle it too much for some, but for others in our family it was just right.<br /><br />That said; some of us feel that Chips Ahoy original cookies are the one and only. For us this cookie offers very little. They are not the cookie for those looking for that crisp crunchy perfectly balanced chocolate chip cookie that is the original Chips Ahoy.<br /><br />Simple math: Love Chewy Chips Ahoy = Like or Love these cookies / Love original Chips Ahoy = Not likely to love these cookies.

review/summary: An acquired taste, so say the least
review/text: While I love Chips Ahoy cookies, I can't say these "Chewy Gooey Chocofudge" cookies would ever win me over. They are slightly reminiscent of the Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but filled with fudge in the middle. If you like the chewy CA cookies, you'll like this. If you're on the fence about the chewy version (like me), then this definitely will not sway you to their side. Oh man, these are bad. I've tried eating a couple of them at different times of the day just to give my taste buds a chance to try a second opinion, but it's always pretty much the same. Think I'll go back to my old favorites, the original brand.

review/summary: I hope I got a bad batch...
review/text: First: I wanted to like these cookies.  I really did.  The concept is good, they look awesome on the outside of the package.  I like the regular chewy Chips Ahoy (like them, not love them) so I figured the addition of more chocolate would be a plus.<br /><br />Before opening the package, I checked the ingredients.  To my VERY pleasant surprise, no HFCS, but real sugar.  Doesn't say cane or beet, so I'll probably never know, but it isn't HFCS.  I'm sensitive to HFCS, so this was a BIG positive for me - and the only reason the cookies got two stars instead of one.<br /><br />Now for the bad:  The cookies are small.  A little smaller than standard crispy Chips Ahoy.  That's not a bad thing, except a serving is two cookies and that serving comes to 150 calories.  For the calorie content of approximately 3 cookies, I could've had a Snickers bar (or similar) - and I would have been happier.<br /><br />Finally, to touch on the title of my review: I hope I got a bad batch.  These cookies were awful. They tasted like plastic.  I'm not talking about a plastic texture, but taste.  They honestly tasted like melting/burnt plastic.  My wife tried one and noticed the same thing (without any coaching from me).  I'd love to try another batch, in hopes of having received defective cookies, but I'm not going to take the chance.<br /><br />If you're considering buying a pre-packaged cookie, stick with the standard Chips Ahoy varieties - crispy or chewy.  But stay away from these.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: Words cannot describe the nasty aftertaste in my mouth right now after just having finished one of these cookies. I am currently wracking my brain thinking what I have in the house that might get rid of this taste (other than brushing my teeth). Ugh. Basically, these are the regular soft Chips Ahoy cookies with a chocolate filling. It's not a gooey filling that spreads out of the cookie when broken open like the picture on the package implies. The filling just sticks inside the cookie and stays there when you break it in half. Not gooey at all (though I'm not even sure that would have helped). The flavor is totally artificial and sickeningly sweet with, as I have already mentioned, a very nasty aftertaste that lingers. My husband had pretty much the same response as I did when he tried the cookies. My 12 yr. old kids are away for a few weeks, but when they get home I'm going to let them try them and see what they say. Personally, I would stay far, far away from these.

They weren't even very good dipped in milk.  I ate them, but I'm not sure why...I think it was just because they were there.  I wouldn't get them again, but a die-hard Chips Ahoy fan might like them alright.

review/summary: Nauseatingly chocolatey
review/text: As a big fan of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies, both the original and the chewy, I was prepared to love these as well. But it was just a big glob of mushy chocolate, barely held together with a tiny bit of cookie. Now, like most people, I'm pretty enthusiastic about chocolate, and theoretically, there is simply no such thing as "too much." But it just didn't taste right here. I really wish there had been more cookie involved, to break up the taste a bit; maybe that would've helped. But whatever went wrong here, it definitely did.<br /><br />Overall, it was a rather disappointing experience. I won't be buying these anytime soon.

review/text: I normally eat cookies from bakeries, rather than supermarket cookies, as  provided by my workplace at lunches and events, so I'm comparing them with what I'm familiar with, not against other industrially produced cookies.<br /><br />These are very sweet, without much real chocolate flavor.  While the gooey chocolate filling is much better than just the dry little chips, it needed to have more flavor. The texture of the cookie itself was what really lost me.  Instead of being soft and chewy, it had a sandy, gritty quality.  I'll stick with just the bakery cookies.

review/summary: Chocofudge Chips Ahoy!
review/text: Adding extra chocolate to something already chocolaty is usually a spectacular idea. Unfortunately, the end result of adding a gooey, fudge center to Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies is something that looks like a mushy cookie and tastes like a mouthful of chemicals.<br /><br />The taste of these cookies is strange. They look and smell like your average Chewy Chips Ahoy! if left out in the sun for a bit. The appearance doesn't do anything to indicate the taste though. The initial bite is of a salty, sweet cookie, but there is a biting aftertaste that points to way too much in the way of processing and preservatives.<br /><br />The fudge used to fill these cookies isn't gooey. The picture on the package in no way accurately represents the consistency of the filling. The fudge is thicker and drier than expected and doesn't seem to have any flavor at all.<br /><br />Chocofudge Chips Ahoy! are a disappointment. A better choice would be to just stick with the original Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies.

review/summary: Gooey, but smooshy
review/text: This rating is as much for the state of delivery as the cookies themselves.  The cookies were delivered in a box with air pillows but were totally crunched.  Because they are "gooey," you'd think crunched meant just smooshed, but, no, actually crumbly as well. There wasn't a whole cookie in the package.<br /><br />Still, being a fan of the normal chewy Chips Ahoy, I figured my cookie crumbs would at least be tasty.  The taste is different, though, more bitter and almost metallic.<br /><br />Maybe there was a chemical reaction going on here, exposure to higher humidity or air that caused the crumbs, thus impacting the taste, too.  Regardless, these were literally dead on arrival.<br /><br />I love amazon.com, but cookies and crackers seem to be total waste of money purchases.  I don't know if the fault rests with UPS, but cookies and crackers are the only amazon shipping fails I've experienced in 10 years.

It would be nice if all cookie packages were like this one.  I might have liked the cookies a little more if I could have warmed them, but the kids loved them and they disappeared too quickly for me to get the chance.  I prefer the Chips Ahoy chocolate chunk cookies, so my rating for these would be 3 stars, but the kids would rate them 5 stars.  I set my actual rating at 4 which is smack in the middle of what I thought and what the kids thought.  I think that's fair

review/text: Basically, these are very soft chocolate chip cookie with a fudge filled center. This is pretty much what is advertised, and thus there can't be any complaints on that end. However, I just don't particularly see the value in this compared to many other options -- they don't particularly taste special (average....maybe even a bit worse than that compared to more expensive options), and each cookie is pretty small. Sure you can just eat more, but I find a single larger item more satisfying than two smaller ones, especially when it there's a filling such as in here. And the fudge somewhat overwhelms the fact they are chocolate chip cookies on the outside.<br />Three stars, on account of the fact that they ARE still good enough that, were I presented with a plate of these and no worries about health, I would still chow down -- but at the same time, I'd choose many more options first were I given a choice.

review/summary: Too Sweet and Artificial
review/text: When Chips Ahoy! first came on the scene when I was young, I thought they were a good cookie that was always soft and a good balance of cookie to chocolate chip ratio. Since then, they have come up with variants on the initial blend to keep people interested and aware of the Chips Ahoy! brand line. Now they introduce Chips Ahoy! Chewey Gooey Chocofudge. Do I like it? Not really. Maybe its with age or refined taste or my lack of interest in snacks and sweet foods in my older years, but I found this cookie very sweet. Not just in the chocolate chips, but the cookie itself seemed very sugary. Also, in addition to the many chocolate chips, it looks like they baked one giant chip smack in the middle to ensure every bite gets a chocolaty taste. So it seems overkill on the sweetness factor. And because this is a cookie that is manufactured by food scientists to ensure sameness in every cookie, it ended up tasting on the artifical side. Perhaps these would taste better fresh out of an oven and have a warm taste, but that is a preference for the individul to determine. But they are not sold that way, so I am taking it as it is given. So will I buy these? No. I dont buy the ones I grew up with, so I definitely will not get these either.

One of the kids went so far as to spit out the one bite they took.<br /><br />If you want to purchase them in bulk from Amazon, we recommend that you purchase one pack from your grocery store for a taste/texture test first. Just because we didn't like them doesn't mean you won't.<br /><br />ETA: I forgot to mention that the center is creamy, not gooey and there is a wafer type texture just above the creamy center.

review/text: I am on a quest for a satisfying grocery store chocolate chip cookie. Unfortunately, Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey didn't get me any closer to my goal. For context, I like regular Chips Ahoy, but don't consider them great; I prefer a softer texture. Chewy Gooeys are not hard, but also not really soft. More mushy, or squishy. Also, the fudge filling isn't gooey, more like pasty. The overall mouth feel is too oily for my taste. Finally, I couldn't get the resealable package to open correctly and had to put the remaining cookies in another container.<br /><br />When I gave one to my husband telling him that I didn't care for it, he popped it in his mouth and disagreed with me saying, "I don't know, they're OK." We won't be buying any of these to stock our pantry.<br /><br />PS. A quick warm up in the microwave helped the texture of both the cookie and filling, but not enough to change my mind about future purchases.

review/text: Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are a chocolate chip cookie stuffed with soft chocolate.  They're good but they don't really take the basic chocolate chip cookie in significantly new or interesting directions.  This is nothing much more than a soft cookie with a layer of frosting on the inside. Ultimately not so exciting that they inspired much more than a shrug.  Not bad but really not a big deal.  And one of us who tried them said we'd rather just eat freshly baked cookies because these tasted a bit fake.

review/text: It isn't really chewy or gooey but if chocofudge is concoction that is neither truly chocolate of fudge then the description is one third correct.  These cookies aren't as overly sweet as many new entries on the market but the smaller size does indicate that they are pushing the limits on how much sugar and fat can be stuffed into a single serving.  While the outside isn't as crumbly as the texture and taste would predict, it seems to be little more than a coating for the center portion of semisolid fudge.  This stuff is more sugar than anything else, with a bit of texture to it and a slight chocolate flavor.  The cookie itself isn't very good although there is only enough of it to cover the fudge center. Overall, none of the parts of these cookie come together well and the result is a letdown.

The fudge center was not gooey like the picture on the packaging had suggested. The center was more like soft chocolate rather than gooey fudge. My wife decided to put one in the microwave in an attempt to make it gooey, yet that didn't work either.<br /><br />As for the taste, I felt the cookies tasted pretty good. I still prefer homemade chocolate chip cookies and I suppose I shouldn't expect packaged cookies to come close to homemade cookies. All in all these cookies are some of the better grocery store cookies you can buy. I recommend them, but I wish the fudge lived up to the advertising. Don't expect gooey fudge on the inside, but rather soft chocolate and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />This item would get 4 stars if the fudge was actually gooey by the time it reaches consumers. I would be willing to give a perfect 5 stars if the fudge was gooey and the flavor profile tasted even more like homemade chocolate chip cookies.

review/summary: Gross.
review/text: (See the image gallery for my three photos that accompany this review)<br /><br />I hadn't eaten a Chips Ahoy in a while, but was kind of looking forward to these new "Gooey" chocolate chip cookies. But, from the moment I opened the package I knew I was going to be disappointed! First off, the cookies were a crumbled and jumbled heap of a few cookies in overly large packaging... the same as regular Chips Ahoy packaging that would hold two or three times as many cookies. Not the most appetizing first impression. So... is this really what Nabisco wants us to see when we open the package?? a jumble of cookies in an overly large package for the few cookies you get? A total turnoff from the beginning. I didn't expect the cookie to be as big as the photo on the package, but I did expect it to at least kind of look like the photo (which looks like a standard Chips Ahoy with the goo inside). This cookie was dark and mottled and misshapen and kind a gross to look at.<br /><br />Okay, presentation stinks, but maybe the cookies are really good nonetheless? Um... no... they kind of suck. And, Gooey?? Not even close... it is a wedge of grainy and dry chocolate-like stuff in the middle. The most distinct flavor (or really after-taste)? That is an overly sugary and heavily preserved food-like substance. After one cookie, I tossed the rest out.<br /><br />Bottom line... just plain gross.

review/summary: gooey chewy and chocolatey
review/text: These are chewy chips ahoy cookies (not the crunchy ones), with a chocolate fudge baked into them. What could there possibly be not to like? ;-) The fudge is uniformly and well distributed throughout the cookie and it complements the cookie part well. The overall taste is very rich and very delicious. The soft chewy cookie complements the texture of the soft fudge very well. My only gripe is that the chocolate chips and the chocolate fudge create too many somewhat clashing textures. I think the cookie would be better if it had just the fudge inside the cookie without the chocolate chips.

review/text: The cookies are fine. A bit too sweet for my taste, but I really had to force myself to try one. Getting cookies shipped to you is NOT the way to go. Let's just say it was a cookie LOAF not individual cookies. Everything had melted together by the time they got to me in the mail. They were probably sitting in some mail truck for six hours re-baking. I don't think I can give a proper review for this one.

review/text: Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are delicious! They can be a bit messy in regards to getting chocolate on your fingers, but as far as flavor and texture goes for store-bought cookies, they're about as good as they can be. They're soft and moist. Each one is like a gooey, quarter-sized chocolate disk wrapped up in a soft chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />They're not nutritious nor are they supposed to be. The easy open and seal package contains three stacks of a few [10 oz. worth of] cookies which probably will not last too long in a casual goodies-munching environment. A few seconds at a low-power setting in the microwave makes for a wonderfully fudgy melted treat.

They are really rich, and a perfect snack if you have the will power to eat only one or two. And, you better just eat one or two, or the package will be gone before you know it. Like all products, Nabisco is shrinking the amount of product they put in a package while still charging the same price.  You'll get around 21 cookies in a package (3 rows of 7).

review/summary: Not very good and kind of pricey
review/text: I did not find either the cookie part or the chocolate part of Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge appealing to my palate. There are only 18 cookies in this large package. If I feel a craving for a small expensive cookie with chocolate, I''ll stick with Pepperidge Farm or something from a local baker. This is not a knock on Nabisco, by the way; their Nilla wafers, Ginger Snaps, and Fig Newtons� are the supermarket cookies I buy most frequently; I've just never found their chocolate products (other than some Snackwells) very enticing. Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge did not change that.

review/summary: Skip-Worthy!
review/text: First, let me say I'm an adult, so maybe that affects my tastes.  On the other hand, though, I have not one but 32 sweet teeth.  With that being said, I'm going to be bold and assert that the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are going to be too sweet for anyone over the age of 11.  Unless you're drinking really black coffee with them.  The kind of black coffee that is so dark and strong, you wouldn't be able to see ANY light through it if it were in a clear cup. Besides that, if you're looking at these cookies here on Amazon with intent to order a bunch, you should note that they don't travel well.  My package arrived looking like most of the cookies went through a rock tumbler (on the bright side, I guess they're ready to be made into a cookie-crumb crust?).  They ARE chewy.  Gooey?  I wouldn't go that far.  Maybe on a really hot day, or if you put some on a plate and microwaved a few seconds.  Finally, they have sort of a Play-Doh aftertaste if Play-Doh were made with lots and lots of sugar.  Chips Ahoy has a good thing going with their original cookies.  I think these are an abomination and should be skipped right over with no regrets.

review/text: These are definitely below average cookies.  They don't even try to look homemade, and are kind of small and processed-looking.  For taste, they are passable but I thought there was something powdery and definitely salty about them.  In my little tasting party of seven people in my immediate family  I was hearing words like  chalky, boring, stale, and "has that low-fat taste without the low-fat benefit."  They are certainly edible--but it's not a product I would seek out.

review/text: I usually like Chips Ahoy, so was eager to try these; they were, unfortunately, a disappointment.  To start, the portion size is incredibly small: two mini cookies equal 150 calories.  And there was just something artificial about the taste.  The chocolate was only okay and the surrounding cookie was fairly blah.  They are, however, chewy so at least that part of the description is accurate.

review/summary: Chocolate chip cookie lovers beware
review/text: Anyone who has eaten a real chocolate chip cookie would not bite twice at a Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Chocofudge creation.  The chocolate center makes up the largest part of this small cookie and while it is soft, it is not what I would call gooey. It does taste pretty much like semi-sweet chocolate which is about all this product has going for it. The pastry part is chewy in a dry sort of way with a strange taste going down and a bitter, unpleasant back bite afterwards.  The 2 piece serving has 150 empty, off-flavored calories that could be wasted on something far tastier.  The lift resealable packaging must be less expensive than the original. It may or may not be effective but it is hard to imagine that a stale chocofudge would be any worse than a fresh one.

review/text: The Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge tastes a lot like chocolate with the cookie "breading" of a Fig Newton.  I doesn't taste a lot like the original Chips Ahoy!  It was soft, with a log of chocolate (though not particularly soft or gooey chocolate).  Personally, as someone who likes Chips Ahoy! and who's not a fan of Fig Newtons, it was not a tasty cookie.  If a chocolate Newton sounds good to you, then you'd probably enjoy these.

review/summary: A Good Soft Cookie...
review/text: I was very interested in what Chips Ahoy! would do with a soft cookie and these do not disappoint. Like most soft cookies, they use a lot of brown sugar (or at least it tastes like brown sugar) in the flavoring to keep them soft. As I understand it, there is a variation in taste bud which causes some people to taste this type of flavor as very bitter and objectionable - luckily I'm not in that group but if you have had that experience with soft cookies this might not be a great purchase for you. The chocolate flavor is very bittersweet, which I like as well. For me, the resealable package is a blessing and a curse - it works so well that I find myself returning for more and more cookies whereas a more challenging-to-open container might serve to slow down my vacuum-like consumption.<br /><br />All in all, this is a recommended product for those that like soft cookies with bittersweet chocolate. I actually prefer the original Chips Ahoy!, however.

review/text: These cookies seemed a little on the small side, but they're chock full of soft, melted chocolate - not too sweet (especially with a strong, black cup of coffee) but satisfying enough to the sweet tooth within the serving size (2 cookies). I like to microwave my cookies to soften them up and make the chips melt, but this wasn't necessary with these Chips Ahoy Gooey (no, they weren't particularly gooey but I was glad - the chocolate was melted but not messy - perfect). Very soft cookies that amazingly did not crumble.

They were delivered on a sunny Florida day and cookies braved the heat until I come home from work.  They probably spent at least five hours in the hot weather, in the mailbox.  When I opened them so I can treat myself to a desert after dinner, they were still intact.  Bag comes in resealable package, so one does not have to worry abot keeping cookies fresh.  Cookies were medium size and loaded with chocolate both on the inside and outside.  I liked cookies very much and I took them with me to work, so I can nibble on them when I feel like having a desert after lunch; or in a late afternoon with my last cup of coffee.

review/summary: Chips Ahoy version of Soft Batch?
review/text: These Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are very similar to Keebler Soft Batch Cookies.  They are about the same size and softness.  I am not sure if Soft Batch has the fudge center these do, which in my opinion, give them the advantage.  They are small, about 2" each, and come about 18 to a 10oz package. Stats are not great but not unexpected for cookies: 2 cookies 150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar.  They are tasty little guys and my whole family liked them.  I recommend the Megafudge version if you like all chocolate cookies.  Those were tastier but you really have to like chocolate (like I do).

review/text: I love chocolate chip cookies.  I love Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies.  So, CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies should be just about perfect, right?<br /><br />WRONG!!!  CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies truly could not be more disgusting.  The cookie is mushy not chewy, the taste is like cardboard, and the chocolate fudge smells and tastes medicinal.  They are not at all sweet.  They are tiny, highly caloric, and have a strong, weird aftertaste.<br /><br />I've offered samples of CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies to just about everyone who has entered my house in the past few days, just to see if it was me or if it was really the cookies.  It really IS the cookies.  My family (husband and kids ages 6 and 14) were not impressed.  Friends and neighbors were equally disappointed.  The best thing my kids said about CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies was that they tasted like Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars.  Now, that may very well be, but I ask you:  who wants their chocolate chip cookies to taste like dry, low cal cereal bars?  Not me, that's for sure!<br /><br />It is possible that the packaging and shipment may have contributed to the disastrous taste and texture of these CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies.  These cookies were shipped to me, cross country in 100 degree weather.  They sat in my broiling mailbox for most of the afternoon.  But, come on, if you are going to offer a product that you ship nationwide or worldwide, then it needs to be able to  stand up to any and all possible conditions.  Hey, Nabisco, you need to seriously rethink this product.  NOT RECOMMENDED.

review/summary: Addictive, a bit on the sweet side though
review/text: If you're a Chips Ahoy! fan, you'll probably understand when I say these taste like the red bag <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OXIZOE">Chips Ahoy Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>, not the regular blue-bag <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z2BS">Chips Ahoy!</a>. They're a slight bit sweeter, a lot softer, and the cookie part doesn't have that (to me at least) distinctive Chips Ahoy! flavor. It's like they took a Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookie and shoved a large chocolate fudge chip in the middle (which I guess really is what they did).<br /><br />They don't taste bad - far from it. If you're a fan of Chips Ahoy! cookies in general you won't be disappointed. They're addictive and will hit your sweet spot sugar craving without much effort. To me they were a bit on the over sweet side of the fence which was probably the only thing that kept me from eating the whole bag at once. Kids?  Kids will probably inhale these.<br /><br />It should be noted that even at room temperature (78-80 degrees) these things are falling-apart soft and the chips are melty. On the day they arrived, they were literally destroyed (and it was a cool day - only reaching 94 instead of 104). You opened up the package and it was just a giant clump of cookies and chocolate. Attempting to pull out a single cookie resulted in "cookie bits". After a while in the AC they did firm up a bit and had their shape somewhat restored. However I would call these cookies overly-soft.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the ingredient list was a lot easier to understand than I would have guessed. There aren't a ton of artificial ingredients (comparatively to other snacks on the market) - I'm not saying these are an organic, all-natural wonder, but other than a few specific additives, you could probably make these at home from scratch.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Unbleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate {Vitamin B1}, Riboflavin {Vitamin B2}, Folic Acid), Sugar, Semisweet Chocolate Chips (Sugar, Chocolate, Cocoa Butter, Dextrose, Soy Lecithin), Palm Oil, Invert Sugar, Coconut Oil, Dextrose, Soybean Oil, Cocoa (Natural and Processed with Alkali), Cornstarch, Whey (from Milk), Leavening (Baking Soda and/or Ammonium Phosphate), Salt, Molasses, Nonfat Milk Solids, Caramel Color, Soy Lecithin, Natural and Artificial Flavor.<br /><br />Serving Size: 2 cookies<br />Servings Per Container: 9<br /><br />Calories 150<br />  Calories from Fat 60<br />Amount Per Serving and/or % Daily Value*<br />Total Fat 7 g (11%)<br />  Saturated Fat 3.5 g (18%)<br />  Polyunsaturated Fat 1 g<br />  Monounsaturated Fat 2 g<br />  Trans Fat 0 g<br />Cholesterol 0 mg (0%)<br />Sodium 110 mg (5%)<br />Potassium 60 mg (2%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 21 g (7%)<br />  Dietary Fiber &lt;1 g (3%)<br />  Sugars 13 g<br />Protein 1 g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 4%

I prefer this one over the other Chewy Gooey flavor "MegaFudge" because it has a better balance of fudge and cookie. The Megafudge tasted too much like a hot cocoa flavor on the outside dough instead of a traditional cookie dough flavor. That's why I say that I prefer this one. Other than that, the two flavors are very similar.  A few other minor complaints is that the dough on the cookie crumbles a bit easily... especially around the edges. I would've liked it more cohesive. Also, the "fudge" core wasn't quite creamy enough, as far as the texture is concerned. The fudge also would've been better if it tasted more like "dark chocolate", but instead it tastes more like hot cocoa. Despite these observations, I think these are pretty delicious cookies and definitely worth a try. If you like the chewy variety of chocolate chip cookies, I would definitely recommend these for you to try out.

review/summary: Chips ahoy has done it again
review/text: The kids loved them, I loved them and they were definitely gooey. Warmed up in the oven they were the best. Soft, not crispy, with chocolate oozing out of the middle. Excellent and a tasty treat. Taking it one step further I also put ice cream between two of these cookies, stuck it i the freezer or 20 mins and it came out to be the best ice cream sandwich. Chip Ahoy is definitely missing out on a potential gold mine in the ice cream sandwich department.

review/summary: It's a gooey, fudgy Chips Ahoy - what's not to love?
review/text: This is a Chips Ahoy flavor called "Ooey Gooey Chocofudge," so it should already be pretty clear from the get-go who is going to love this and who isn't.  The cookies are soft, but don't fall apart or dissolve in your mouth.  They are definitely gooey, but not overly messy.<br /><br />Obviously they aren't going to beat homemade fudge cookies fresh out of the oven, but for a packaged treat in the goodie aisle of the supermarket, these are pretty tasty and well worth the purchase.  Add a little milk and you're in for a seriously good time.

review/text: I am a fan of Chips Ahoy. I love them. I am not, however, a fan of the Chewy Chips Ahoy. Those are too soft. the flavor is very different. I like the original and even the low-fat. Yummy.<br /><br />So i was a bit skeptical about the Chewy Gooey Chips Ahoy. but Nabisco nailed it: they found a great balance between gooeyness, chocoloateyness, and cookieness. Magic, if you will. These are yummy cookies, not too sweet, not to soft. Delicious. Sorry, I have to go... I'll get myself another cookie....

review/text: This product was chewy and had plenty of fudge in it, as the name suggests.  The flavor, however, falls short of regular Chips Ahoy.  The taste seemed a little unnatural.  My kids were not very excited about them and both liked the regular Chips Ahoy much better.

review/text: These sounded like such a great idea.  Of course gooey chewy chocolate fudge cookies will be wonderful, right ?  Sadly, no.  There is a strong artificial chemical taste and the texture is neither chewy nor gooey but only soggy.  They were surprisingly edible after having been left to get stale for a month.  I would never buy them at a grocery store.

review/summary: Kids Love Them, I Prefer Original
review/text: My kids absolutely loved these cookies, which have a chocolate filling that is sort of like commercial chocolate frosting. I thought they were good (they are Chips Ahoy, after all!) but I prefer the original Chips Ahoy or Chunky Chips Ahoy. It's a fun and different cookie but for everyday cookies, I think I will stick to the original types.

review/text: I've always loved Chips Ahoy cookies, so I was excited to try the new Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge......In retrospect, the operative word is "Chocofudge" which conjures up images of something that is not quite a food, more like a chemically created psuedo-edible.....thing. The fudge in the middle of the crumbly, dry cookie is neither chewy OR gooey, more like a piece of old jerky that's been sitting in a hot car for a few days. I cannot imagine ever having any occasion to eat one of these cookies again.......

review/text: The Chips Ahoy! Chewey Gooey Chocofudge cookies are good for a packaged cookie. They were soft like homemade cookies but the taste was off and tasted like a typical packaged cookie. They were fudgy and full of chips, but to me they did not taste homemade. Overall they are good for a packaged cookie.

review/text: I like these better than the Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  There's still a slight aftetaste to these cookies, though.  Yes, the cookies are soft, but they really aren't as "gooey" as the name implies.  The packaging, with its resealeable flap, is a good idea.  It will keep the cookies fresher longer.  If you like Chips Ahoy cookies, you will likely enjoy these too.  For me, they were just okay.

review/summary: A little too gooey for me
review/text: These were a little too gooey for me. Parents should have napkins readily available for young children as there may be quite a mess, especially if it was hot weather. Also, having been through the shipping system, many of the cookies were broken. Of course if you can find these in the store, you probably won't have this issue. One thing you could do is refrigerate them and then you will have a nice soft cookie that doesn't seem to melt on your finders. My recommendation is to purchase these in winter months only.

review/summary: Didn't care for them at all!
review/text: Yuck.<br /><br />That's the one word I would use to describe the taste of these.<br /><br />But, before we get to taste, let's talk about how these were so smooshed and crumbled inside the package when I opened it. Many of them stuck together, and then fell apart when you tried to pull them apart. They're WAY too mushy and soft, so much so that they lose their form and come apart into pieces.<br /><br />The taste, to me, was awful. I can't even describe it, but let's just say that my reaction was "Ugh!! Yuck!!" after a few chews. It almost had a medicinal taste to it (to me, anyway). I also found that they leave a bit of an after taste in my mouth. I LOVE cookies, baked goods, and almost all sweets, but I couldn't tolerate these. I ended up throwing most of them out because I didn't want to eat them.<br /><br />Good try, Chips Ahoy, but not your best work.

Somewhat chewy and very rich.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're splurging.

review/text: Fudge flavored chocolate chips? Soft cookie? Sounds good, huh?<br /><br />Well, it's on OK cookie, not a great one. The "soft" style of cookie just doesn't have the taste of the harder original style and the fudge chip tends to overpower the cookie as well. In fact, I am more fond of the original Chips Ahoy than these.<br /><br />That being said, I ate the whole package because, let's face it - an OK cookie is better than no cookie at all.

review/summary: not as delicous as it sounds
review/text: It did have a fudge center but it was too much chocolate and not enough cookie,  and the cookie was all damp and soft as a consequence.  I think gooey is the perfect word - but it translates to soft and not very interesting,  as well as having a bad chocolate cookie ratio.  Too much of a good thing can overwhelm the flavors, and unbalance the baked good...<br /><br />We all ate 2 (some may have eaten 3) but we all agreed that the while regular chocolate chip chips ahoy are terrific,  these are not.  I will not buy them again.

review/text: These are all right.  I probably liked chips ahoy! cookies more as a child than I do now.  They taste fake, look kind of gross and just aren't very good overall.  The chewy fudge in the middle is pretty lacking, but it does make the cookies softer than your normal chips ahoy! cookie.  They are slightly better warmed up, but I can't say I'd recommend them.  There are so many better cookies out there worth buying.  Not to even get into the ingredient list, which contains nothing decent for you.  I'll pass.

review/text: These should be amazing.  Really, just look at that picture!  A chocolate chip cookie that is chewy on the outside and full of creamy fudge.  Good glory, I could go into a happy coma just thinking about it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are not so good.  The fudgey middle is actually just a bigger chocolate chip, and the cookie is more crumbly and dry than chewy.  The taste is heavily dominated by all of that chocolate, and the chocolate, while not bad, is not good enough to stand on its own.<br /><br />Don't break your heart by buying these.  Just look at the picture and dream.

review/summary: The taste and texture were okay, but is this the best option?
review/text: I tried this cookie at the same time I tried Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  These cookies are better than Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, but they still fall short of what I expect from Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies.<br /><br />I have given up expecting products to look like their packages.  I suppose there is a bit of artistic license in making food look as though your mom and grandmother whipped it out of a bunch of basic ingredients.  The problem, of course, is that the cookies bear little resemblance to the picture on the package.  Things seem to go downhill from there.<br /><br />Try putting one of these cookies on a napkin next to the package.  The picture on the package is beautiful, with chocolate chips on the outside and gooey chocolate in the middle.  I could barely see the chocolate chips on the cookie itself because something, crumbs I think, covered the chocolate chips.  None of my cookies were lovely and round like the one of the package.  Instead, my cookies were mostly broken and I had a difficult time removing more than fragments from the package.<br /><br />Well, beauty is only chip deep, I suppose.  The important features are the taste and the texture.<br /><br />The texture was okay.  The cookie seemed chewy and moist to me.  In general, I thought the texture of these cookies compared favorably with regular Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies.<br /><br />The taste was okay.  The taste was hardly great, but okay.  I tasted cookie dough and then a chocolate hit, about what I expected for chewy chocolate chip cookies.  What I missed was the creamy chocolate in the center of the cookie.  I tried several of these cookies, trying to taste the creamy chocolate in the middle.  My taste buds could not separate the taste of the supposedly creamy chocolate from the other flavors in the cookie.<br /><br />These cookies need to compete with regular Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies along with dozens of other varieties.  In order to do that, a new cookie should be phenomenally good to convince customers to change brands.  However, this cookie is hardly phenomenally good.  In my opinion, this cookie is just average.  I believe there are many better options available, particularly given the price of these cookies.  My prediction is that either this variety will disappear from store shelves or its formula will change.  Meanwhile, you have plenty of other, better choices.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: An Odd Mixture of Tastes Not Quite Ready for Shipping
review/text: Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are billed as soft-baked cookies with a fudge center.  The cookie part is pretty good - definitely chewy if that's your thing.  However, the fudge center has a strange, almost bitter taste that is at odds with the rest of the cookie.  It also has a thick, gooey (can't say they didn't warn us) consistency that makes each cookie way too rich and heavy.  Even though the cookies are small, you'd be hard-pressed to eat two of them because of the heaviness and strange flavor combination.  Make sure you've got plenty of milk on hand when you bust these ones open.<br /><br />Also be aware that due to the small size of the cookies themselves, there was a lot of shifting during transit.  As a result, several of the cookies were already bent if not bashed into mush by the time the shipment arrived.<br /><br />If it sounds like the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies were saddled with a name that only a kid would love, it's likely no coincidence.  Only a kid would (probably) enjoy the cookies as well.  Anyone who puts much/any thought into their snacking would steer clear.

review/text: These cookies were certainly chocolatey, what with the gooey chocolate-flavored filling.  But, it was kind of a phony-tasting chocolate flavor, as opposed to the rich milk chocolate flavor of, say, Nestle Toll House morsels.  Furthermore, there was also a someone stale, wheat flour flavor that lingered on the palate after the chocolate flavor faded.  Plus, these cookies were somewhat soggy, not in the least little bit crunchy.  Neither my wife or I cared for them much, to be honest, and won't buy them again.  Kids might like 'em, but they didn't impress us in the least...

review/summary: A disappointing offering from Nabisco
review/text: I love chocolate chip cookies. I love fudge. So, when you combine the two, one could reasonably think that it would make for a perfect cookie right? Well, it very well may, but in this instance it doesn't.<br /><br />A couple things for starters.<br /><br />Based on the packaging and picture on the packaging I was expecting to bite into this cookie and have fudge ooze out. Not the case here. The fudge, and I use that term loosely, if really just a gob of something in the middle that does no oozing at all. I even tried to microwave a couple cookies to get the packaging effect and never did.<br /><br />The cookies also seem really dry and crumbly. I usually like the Chips Ahoy line because of the soft chewy nature of their cookies but these are just a crumbly mess.<br /><br />Just a side note the cookies in the package I received looked nothing like the cookies on the packaging. Several were reduced to crumbs, a couple were slightly burned, but none even resembled the picture on the package.<br /><br />Taste wise they were average at best. Nothing special about them, which left me disappointed. I was expecting a more full flavor and something different than the normal Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookie. Didn't get that. If I see these at the store I will most likely skip these as they aren't anything special.

review/text: This cookie is very similar to the Chewy Chips Ahoy except it has added chocolate chips on the outside.  It tastes okay but it's not going to earn raves.  Just like the Megafudge version, the cookies are very small and at 150 calories per serving (which is only a few cookies), it's not worth it. The taste isn't spectacular, cookie kind of dry, although the fudge center tasted good. It's a small package as well (10 oz) and at more than $3, I think I can find a better tasting and more satisfying cookie at my local grocer.

review/summary: Pretty good, soft cookies!
review/text: Growing up in San Francisco, home of Mrs. Fields's cookies, I have a very healthy appreciation of soft cookies.  Couple this with the fact that many packaged cookies that you find at the super-market is pretty stiff and crumbly, I'm generally apprehensive when I hear about the words "gooey" and "soft" when describing such cookies.  Regular Chips Ahoy is no exception, unfortunately.  I do, however, appreciate their chunky chocolate cookies (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VMW1QA">Chips Ahoy! Chunky Chocolate Chunk cookies, 13-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>), especially the peanut butter ones (don't see them on amazon, though).  Therefore, when I saw the new Chewy Gooey line of cookies, I had hope that this new generation of cookies would continue their improving trend!<br /><br />Sure enough, the cookies were soft.  I wouldn't say that the chocolate was able to stretch like on the main package, but there's definitely more chocolate in these new cookies than in your standard Chips Ahoy.  It's almost like a filling lay, and definitely not just chips being melted more during the baking process.  Honestly, they're strictly not even chocolate chips anymore, more like a fudge.<br /><br />And the big question, are they tasty?  Definitely.  Are they messier?  Yeah, so be even more careful giving them to little kids (or even my 10 year old, who happens to still eat with her hands when we aren't looking).<br /><br />Recommended.  If only they'd bump up the package size closer to the 12-14 ounce of the earlier packages (or even better, make them 16 ounces again!!!!!)  Then I'd give them 5 stars!

review/summary: I don't really like Chips Ahoy
review/text: I'm a chocolate fan, and a cookie fan, and I like the idea of these cookies. The thing is, it turns out I just really don't like Chips Ahoy. If you do, but wish they had more chocolate, you'll probably like these.<br /><br />I don't eat many packaged cookies, but I was still surprised at how little I liked these. Honestly, they kind of taste like cardboard and chemicals. The chocolate is, of course, low quality as well, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Lest I sound like an irrelevant snob, I will say that I do enjoy Oreos, and they're certainly made of cardboard and chemicals -- they just don't taste like it. But it would be hard for the local cookie man to recreate an Oreo, whereas he can do super chocolatey chocolate chip cookies no problem, so....if you want the latter, just go buy fresh made. Unless you really do like the regular Chips Ahoy, in which case these are even "better".<br /><br />(I'm gonna get blasted for this, aren't I?)

review/summary: Love the Chocofudge!
review/text: What's better than a chocolate chip cookie filled with fudge?  A WARM chocolate chip cookie filled with fudge!  I pop one of these cookies in the microwave for a few seconds (experiment to find your perfect temperature), then sit back with a warm cookie and a cool glass of milk.  Pure bliss!  Granted there are plenty of calories in this treat, so do consume in moderation.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat!<br /><br />Service size - 2 cookies, 150 calores, 7g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 110mg sodium, 60mg potassium, 21g carbohydrate (13g sugar, less than 1g fiber), 1g protein.<br />Contains: wheat, milk, soy.

review/summary: What can you say about store-bought cookies?
review/text: Yes, these Chips Ahoy cookies are better than their hard, crunchy counterpart, but they still taste very artificial. Also they are not terribly gooey, just very soft, with the chocolate in the middle seperating very easily. I've had worse and obviously much, much better, but I think some kids would like them regardless. I brought these into work and left them on the counter. They were all gone by lunchtime so I guess some adults who could care less about quality would like them too.

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: The downfall of these cookies are not the way they taste, but the way they are advertised. From the packaging, I expected a chewy cookie with a soft and, to use Nabisco's word, "gooey" chocolate center. Unfortunately, the cookies failed to meet my expectations.<br /><br />The actual cookie part was similar to what I expected. The outer portion tastes just like the normal chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies. However, I would not describe the center as gooey. Instead the chocolate center was closer to the consistency of chocolate that is just beginning to melt.<br /><br />While I would not say these cookies were necessarily bad, I certainly would not pick them over regular chewy Chips Ahoy!
