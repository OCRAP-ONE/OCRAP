review/text: This is a VERY strong roast and a great morning coffee if you need your eyeballs popped open in a hurry!  I would strongly suggest using the largest cup size when brewing this kcup.  I used quite a bit of sweetener and threw in some cocoa powder which really enhanced the flavor and actually made the coffee much smoother.  Next time, I will use even more milk to further dilute the flavor.  This coffee would be a great base for cappucino, frappucino, etc etc.  I picked this up at Bed/Bath/Beyond for $11.99 with 20% off coupon.  It's also available at Target and Safeway.

review/summary: Just too expensive.
review/text: The Starbuck's French Roast is a good, bold coffee. But, at almost double the price of other comparable brands (Green Mountain Double Black Diamond for one) I just can't justify  the unrealistically high cost.  I'll stick to the Double Black Diamond.  In my opinion it is equally as bold with just a little more flavor.  Since taste is so subjective, you will have to decide for yourself.

review/summary: Starbucks comes to Keurig at last!
review/text: Partisans of Starbucks coffee have been waiting a long time for it to be released in the K-cup delivery system.  Coffee drinkers who like the Starbucks approach to dark roasting will not be disappointed.  The brew is strong but not bitter, slightly smokey but not excessively so, and with a pleasant flavor palette that, to me, seems dominated by chocolate.<br /><br />I've been a coffee fanatic all my life.  Many coffee fanatics take delight in denouncing Starbucks for a variety of reasons, some valid, some mere pretense.  I'm the first to say that Starbucks is not the best coffee in the world and that the Keurig brewing system does not produce the finest cup.  However--and this is a significant however--when one considers the time saved, the hassle avoided, and the waste eliminated, I find this a very satisfactory way to produce a fresh cup when I don't have time to fire up my grinder and brew the in the conventional way.<br /><br />I won't give up my freshly roasted beans, my dripper pot, or my grinder but I will certainly drink--and enjoy--Starbucks K-cups when the time is just not right for a meticulously hand-crafted pot.

review/summary: Nice strong Cup
review/text: This produces a nice strong cup of coffee. I prefer strong coffee..most K-cups usually result in weaker brews. The usual problem with Starbucks is they are pretty expensive. But this deal for around 50c a cup is a very good deal, usually starbucks brand k-cups sell for about 1$ a cup.<br /><br />Update: on the ones sold by warehouse deals: the best before on those is aug 2012, so all those hoarders start drinking!

review/summary: Great K-Cup Coffee
review/text: First off, for those of you crying about the price of this coffee......... you probably shouldn't have this coffee maker in the first place. This is the best k-cup I have tried yet. You can use the "larger cup" button on these k-cups and get a great tasting, aromatic, strong cup of coffee. I can even see a little bit of foam around the rim of my cup when the brewing is complete. If you do not like strong coffee (as the French Roast always is) then don't buy this coffee. I will be trying the Pikes Place k-cup next.<br /><br />P.S.  As for the Dunkin' Donuts K-cups, do not waste your time. They are the same price as Starbucks, and you can only get them at the stores. I had my wife send me some of the original blend and it tastes nothing like their coffee.

review/summary: Best K-Cup,hands down...
review/text: I have tried all the Coffee People flavors (Jet Fuel, Tiger, Wake up Call,) as well as most of the Green Mountain flavors. I have found that the Sumatra by SB is the best tasting one of them all. It makes me happy to get out of bed and have my Sumatra coffee. When you brew this coffee, it has a "head" on it when it comes out of the Keurig spout, it is just like the smell at the SB store, and also has that very fresh taste. I have found that most of the KCups are either crazy weak, or just too acidic for my taste...I swear, thank goodness SB finally got in the KCup game. No, I do not work for SB.

review/text: This Starbucks French Roast K-Cup is indeed a very delicious and bold coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. We typically drink the much more affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but occasionally like to try other types. There is no doubt that this Starbucks coffee is better tasting but it is a too expensive when drinking 4-5 cups a day.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor (5 stars) but not at the retail price (3 stars).<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Simply the best K-cup I've sampled so far (and I've sampled many).  If you like bold, rich coffee than you should definitely try this one. When it comes right down to it, it's still cheaper than buying a cup of coffee outside of the home (even at a donut store) so I don't see the price as that exorbitant. Sometimes quality comes at a price.

review/summary: Just so gross....
review/text: This coffee tastes like chocolate that's gone bad.  It's overpriced and just not very good.  Starbucks has always over-roasted their beans.  I guess if you like that then you might like this coffee.  To my tastebuds however, it was just bitter and gross with a weird off-taste that left me making faces long after the cup was gone.<br /><br />Also, to all the reviewers who are saying that this was finally a strong k-cup, I say bah.  There are many other brands that make a cup just as strong but much better tasting.  This was just swill.  Bitter gross swill.<br /><br />If Coffee People still made their french roast I wouldn't have even bothered putting this in the brewer.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> is my current favorite for my Keurig.  It's so much cheaper than a Starbucks k-cup.  But even if it weren't, it's still a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Overpriced and over-roasted equals bad coffee.

review/summary: On those youtube videos, they aren't exaggerating!
review/text: First of all, I am not really into all that really hot, spicy food. Some spiciness is alright, but bland food is fine with me. Here at the house we were watching some funny videos on youtube, people eating these, and after some talking about it, I bought this 15-pack, and I have to say, the people in the videos weren't trying to be funny; this stuff is unreal!<br /><br />If you just hold it by the stem and bite a piece off, you'd better have a butt-load of bread and dairy products on hand, because the experience is something you'd never expect. I chewed it on the left side of my mouth, and quickly felt like there was a blow-torch searing my tongue and inner cheek. It took my breath away for a moment, and I lost my voice. Then my throat started to burn, and I could feel the heat radiating from inside my body. I drank some 1% lowfat and then got the cold sweats. It definitely is a different experience.<br /><br />So if you want to make your prepared foods with an extra punch, or are just into some college-hazing type pranks, this is doubtless something to consider. It's amazing that something this volatile is even edible.

review/summary: Unbearably Hot
review/text: Peppers are like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. Every pepper is different. I can tell you the bright red ones are the hottest. The orange ones are about as hot as a habenero. But if you want the full effect, eat a bright red one and chew it for 30seconds - 1 minute then swallow. Do not wash it down until after you swallow it. By doing this the heat stays in your mouth and not so much in your stomach and you wont get sick. The red ones are also very fruity tasting. It is quite good until your taste buds disintegrate from the intense heat. Your ears will then feel like they are bleeding. Then when the heat hits its highest point and you cant take it anymore...it starts getting hotter. I ate 2 of them before I got a hot one. About an hour later the heat is gone, but your entire body feels like hell. The effects are completely gone about 3 hours later. Thats if you get a really hot one and follow these instructions. But like I said, every pepper is different. Overall very satisfied for the price. I just chopped a half of one up and seared them in a pan with 2 chicken breasts and it was delicious.

review/summary: A bit better than I expected.
review/text: I bought 3 packages of these peppers. Though there were some brown ones most of them were in good shape and ready to grind up into a fine seasoning. While it wasn't as hot as I expected it to be it was as hot as they were described. Hotter than I can eat on their own (at least for now). One good thing about the ghost pepper is, it doesn't just have an intense heat but has a really intense kind of smokey flavor that really makes it a yummy pepper if you can handle it. It goes good in chilli if you're used to spicy foods. I wouldn't use more than a quarter pepper a serving though.

review/summary: Sheer HELL!
review/text: I have done extensive research on peppers and what is the hottest.  Though it appears that the Bhut Jolokia may have been passed up, I still was dying to try them.  I have seen many videos of people eating these peppers and I knew I had to be another one of them that can say they ate the "Ghost Pepper" the world's hottest pepper.  They were very difficult to find, and thankfully Chickendinner offers them dried, at a great price and with very fast shipping.  The peppers themselves smell wonderful.  They have a light smoked scent to them.  But the flavor is out of this world.  A tiny nibble and I had to drink a giant glass of milk.  I can't wait to try these in recipes.  My friends and I are going to make some good hot sauces with these.

review/summary: Dried Whole Ghost Chile
review/text: Chiles are a staple food for me, from serranos, jalapenos, de arbol, pequin, japoneses and even habaneros.  I believe I expected mouth numbness (lips and tongue)making the salivary glands work extra hard and dripping thick siliva and that icky feeling of liquid coming out your ears... but no, just really hot, hot peppers.  I have tasted hotter habaneros, but that is maybe because they were fresh.  I put mine in the blender and have them as crushed pepper.  I will plant my own and until then we shall see.  Try them they are pretty good, and the flavor is not too strong and just a bit sweet.

review/text: These peppers are indeed very hot.  When I first opened the package and took one of the peppers out to try I nibbled on just a little bit of one and although it had a bit of kick to it, it didn't seem too terribly hot.  But then I tried the bottom half of one that had broken off another pepper and proceeded to chew it up.  It didn't take too long before my whole mouth and throat began to burn like I swallowed burning napalm.  Burning lasted for a good 15 min and I ended up drinking some milk.<br /><br />I ended up taking them and putting them in my spice grinder to make a chili powder with them.

I suggest only using one pepper for a BIG pot in your favorite chili recipe. Be aware.

review/summary: Decent quality, Decent price
review/text: In anticipation of receiving these peppers I purchased a couple single peppers from a friend and ate them whole to gauge the spiciness. The separate peppers that I purchased were extremely spicy, leaving me in agony for at least 20 minutes each, and making me feel sick for the rest of the day (that was the desired effect). After getting these peppers I gave a few away and ate a couple and found that they were significantly lower in their spiciness; though not disappointingly so. The packaging also gives the idea that they were a few years old and some of them seemed to be fallen apart or shriveled up. Overall, they were spicy and came with the amount advertised.

review/text: This review is "according to my husband" cuz there's no way I would try them.  That being said, he said these peppers are the hottest thing he's ever tried.  He wanted a pure taste, so the first thing he did was take a bite out of one.  While that's a good way to get an unadulterated test, I don't suggest you do that.  He was sweating and snotting all over himself for the next 2 hours!  He did say, however, that the flavor behind the heat was awesome, and he loved the smokiness of it.  He is actually craving it today and is going to find a dish to put it in this time instead of eating it straight!  Overall, awesome pepper, awesome preparation of dried/smoked, and well packaged and shipped.  THANKS!

review/summary: Delicious & Very Spicy!
review/text: I love a good spicy kick in foods, and needless to say this didn't disappoint in giving the ol' kick, however since this is regarded as the spiciest pepper in the world I was a little dissapointed that I didn't end up going to the hospital after eating it. Most spicy stuff just tastes good to me with a slight tingle, tobasco for example is just barely spicy and is about a 2 on a 1-10 scale. This stuff is about an 8 or 9, and while it didn't make me call 911 it put me in a scorched coma for a bit.<br /><br />First bite was a cautious little nibble, a slight tingle but nothing much. After awhile of nothing I ripped off about half of it and ate it, and while it numbed my mouth a bit once it hit my stomach, well... now I know how Mr. Orange felt throughout Reservoir Dogs. It just sat in my stomach in the same place burning like a damn minituare sun, burning away. So the peppers certainly work well for 'dares' or whatever circumstance it is where you're only eating the pepper.<br /><br />Mixing them with foods is a different story, the peppers have a great dried delicious quality, and they look just like the picture so you can imagine the texture. The heat is great too since it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors, it's rather subtle like an infernal landmine waiting to go off in your mouth. If you like spicy foods it's a great addition to your kitchen, and if you want to prank someone or go on a dare or whatever, these peppers work for that too.

My wife tried a bit of the pepper too.  I asked her to describe the taste and she said "so hot that it's giving me a pain between my shoulder blades."

They said something about employees and refunded $2 of the $6.00 and then shipped out item that day (the 10th). I appreciate the partial refund, but this was needed for a chili cook off thats come and gone (i still won 1st)<br /><br />I just figured that anyone looking to buy this chile deserves to know that it may not arrive on time, but once it does, its fantastic.

review/summary: Hot enough, but use carefully.
review/text: These peppers are not your ordinary peppers. I would definitely not recommend eating them solo.  Mixed with Salsa (either queso or regular) they definitely add a nice bite.  I only used one in a small container of salsa and they really added a great spice.  With queso, the effect was much more subtle.  When I mixed it with mild salsa I got quite a kick from it. I love spicy food, so this was a great deal for me, but if you are more inclined to a milder version, then queso is a better use.

review/summary: Dried Ghost Chili Peppers
review/text: After ordering, these peppers arrived much earlier than I expected.  When I opened the package I could smell the amount of win that these peppers were secreting. Perhaps my heat tolerance is a bit high, but these only burned for about 20 minutes.  Regardless, they did pack a little bit of a punch to them.  I will definitely be buying from this supplier again when I need more dried ghost peppers.

review/text: Maybe I was expecting more from them, but these were purchased as a gift. The recipient definitely liked them & said the flavor was great & different from anything she ever tasted. However, she found her dried habaneros to be hotter. Unfortunate, considering these are supposed to be significantly hotter than that. Next time, I will try to buy the extract to get more heat.

review/summary: Habanero are hotter then these
review/text: I was very cautious and cut off a small corner of the pepper and set it on my tongue to see what they tasted like. I was very surprised that it wasn't that "HOT" that I was expecting, and that they are rather sweet. I would almost say that these are Cayenne peppers if not for the sweet taste to them.<br /><br />Though these aren't all that hot, they still go great in chili!<br /><br />Only 2 stars because they taste great. Just not hot at all to me.

review/text: The truth is real, this thing is freaking scorching man.  And I eat hot pepper basically everyday.  I only ate half of 1 and it kicked my butt.  And still is hours later lol.  It arrived in 5 days, not bad.  But, the reason I'm giving it 2 stars, not because it's not hot (It's waaaaaay hotter than a habanero, the hottest I've ever tried up until this bad boy) but it's because I didn't get 15 peppers.  I only received 12.  And I know it's only 3, but when you advertise an amount, that amount needs to be that amount.

review/summary: Bland and Tasteless
review/text: One bag of thoroughly dried ghost peppers roughly the size of your thumb.  Back of card has instructions on how to rehydrate the peppers so that they're easier to cut/eat (trust me, these things are REALLY dehydrated) that include pouring boiling water on them.  I want to try and harvest a few seeds out of these pods before eating them, so I don't think I'm going to be using boiling water, but warm should do the trick.<br /><br />That said, these are not good peppers.  I don't know if its because the pepper stock is poor, or if they lose too much heat from being dried and then rehydrated, but they were not face meltlingly hot like they should have been.  I'm so much of a lightweight when it comes to hot peppers I break out in sweat and tears from a jalapeno, and yet I ate two of these things in a row without difficulty.<br /><br />Yes, they were hot, but they were not the mind blowing experience ghost peppers are supposed to be.  They were a complete letdown.

review/summary: Good Value For Home Gelatin Desserts/Snacks
review/text: This bundle is a good value for the home consumer if you are not frightened away by the package size. Each bag contains 24 oz. of gelatin mix, and, if you read the directions, makes a bit over a gallon of prepared gelatin. That is too much, at one time, for the average family (unless you are having a party!)<br />If you keep the unused portion in a zip-lock bag, you should have no problem storing the left-over gelatin mix.<br />Here is the recipe I use for home preparation:<br />Place 3/4 cup of the gelatin mix in a large bowl (at least 1 1/2 quart size.)<br />Add 2 cups boiling water (allow the water to come to a full boil.)<br />Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved (about 2 minutes.)<br />Add 12 large ice cubes and stir until all the ice has melted.<br />Refrigerate until firm. (Typically 3 - 4 hours)<br />(Alternately, you can stir in 1 1/4 cups cold water in place of ice cubes, but it will take longer for the gelatin to set.)<br />This recipe will make about a quart of prepared gelatin.

review/summary: Would NOT recommend this to anyone!
review/text: I was so eager to try this dressing based upon the stellar review posted though my intuition and experience have taught me that when there is only one review to be cautious. I thought the Biltmore name might add some additional assurance, so I overnighted it with my wonderful Prime membership as I had to make an enormous pasta salad for the same day I received it but thought it was going to be a safe bet. NOT SO. The flavor of this dressing was so sharp and off that it ruined the entire dish and I had to apologize to everyone as I had already committed all of my ingredients to the salad I had made and had no time or resources to make another one, which also would have been extremely expensive.<br /><br />Even the aroma when I opened the bottle (and opened a second one with the same result) was a bit skunky but I was optimistic that when combined with other ingredients it would reveal the great flavor cited by the first reviewer. I will never use or buy this dressing again. : - ( I'd give this zero stars, but that's not an option.

review/text: A folk remedy was suggested to me by a friend from the Philippines: boil guava leaves for 10 minutes; the resulting "tea" is considered an aid for upset stomach and common diarrhea. Maybe it is, maybe not. Since I don't have a guava tree, I decided to find a packaged guava tea on Amazon to try to help with my touchy gut. To my surprise, I found I actually liked the flavor well enough to drink this tea regularly with my breakfast instead of coffee. I let it steep twice as long as black tea, add a small amount of honey, and it's just right. This drink is a nice change of pace from regular tea or coffee.

review/text: I picked this coffee up at a local store where I found it on the clearance rack.  I wasn't too sure if it would be any good since being on the clearance rack usually means "old" and "not too good".  However, after enjoying a cup of Tully's Kona blend I'm confused.  The coffee flavor was exactly what I would expect from a Kona blend: smooth, mellow delicious coffee without the bitterness of Columbian coffees.  It had a great aroma.  The k-cups keeps the coffee fresh, so, even though it's pushing it's "sell by" date, it tastes like the beans were freshly ground.<br /><br />If you expect this to be just as good as the Kona you got during that Hawaiian vacation, lower your expectations just a little.  This coffee is really good, but it is still a blend.

review/text: When we first purchased a Keurig machine 3 or 4 years ago, the Kona blend was one of our favorites.  Due to a shortage of beans, Tullys had problems manufacturing the product and availability became difficult.  Well low and behold, it was finally available again, but at nearly $1/pod.  Oh well, great coffee, why not?  Well the version is awful.  The flavor is strange and not the same deep, dark Kona that we were familiar with drinking in the past.  I'm not stuck with $100 of crappy coffee that I'll probably dump on my neighbors or some other Folgers loving coffee drinker.  I would avoid the new Kona blend at all costs.  Too many other good quality coffees available.
