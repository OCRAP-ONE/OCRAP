review/summary: Tasted like water
review/text: No surprises here, I guess. When I drank it, I got just what I was expecting. Water. It tasted good, no plastic or funny after-taste. I can't say it did anything else for me, seems a bit pricey for what it is.

review/summary: Fresh tasting.
review/text: I got this product out of sheer curiosity and as a sufferer of acid reflux (sometimes when I drink water, the acid in my stomach goes up and I can feel it in my esophagus). The first sips gave me acid reflux just like all the other water brands. However, after a few days of only drinking Essentia, I found that the water no longer impacted my acid reflux and I was able to drink it normally. I do not know if this was a placebo effect, but I did find that it gave my stomach no reaction when it was drank cold. As a result, I will continue to drink Essentia water.<br /><br />I heard Whole Foods sell these, and they probably have it cheaper. So I would go there first before purchasing here on Amazon.

review/text: I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good. After watching a demonstration on the benefits of purifying the water that comes into my home I can see that drinking from my tap is not an option. However, as much as I like the Essentia water I am not convinced it is so much better than other bottle water that is certainly more affordable.

review/text: For me some bottle water is better than others. This bottled water was very good. It had a good, clean taste which is always important, especially for those who do not enjoy drinking water. The bottle was also thick enough to withstand being dropped but not so thick that you are really just paying for the bottle. Overall I would buy this bottled water again.

review/text: The bottle of water is huge and helps keep me hydrated when I have had a marathon of patients in my office. The minerals in the water help replenish what you lose after a workout , a day or two of not eating right, or even having one two many drinks at cocktail hour. I loved the taste and having such a huge bottle helped me get my recommended water intake for the day ( when I don't drink enough I feel dizzy or get a migraine).

review/summary: Taste's like.... Water.
review/text: Essentia Drinking Water tastes like (drumroll please) clean, filtered (public RO) drinking water.  Having used an alkaline gadget with my water in the past, I expected it to have more of a slightly different "flavor", but that wasn't the case.  It tastes like water.<br /><br />But taste isn't everything.  The bottle boasts of a silkiness to the water within the bottle.<br /><br />The silkiness made this less refreshing for me and I, frankly, avoided the rest of the bottle for a day and tried it again and still, the mouth feel made it seem like a thicker beverage with some sort of starch in it.  According to the label of the bottle I have on hand, there is no starch, but still it feels that way.  Like cornstarch- soft, silky, but not something I would seek out in my quest for hydration.  The silkiness killed it for me and sent me in pursuit of a bottle of Smart Water.  (Note:  please read the other reviews.  The silkiness might not be an issue for everyone, but I am very sensitive to texture and flavor variations. This might be a non-issue for you. YMMV)

review/summary: Taste is perfectly fine, don't know about the PH thing
review/text: This water has a nice taste and the bottle is nice and sturdy to hold. What else to say about this water? Oh yes, the PH. I did not feel any different after drinking this water than I do after drinking any other water. It did absolutely nothing to even try to blow my socks off, and the asking price is too high for it to be so mediocre. This water didn't come from some rare source so the price tag is unwarranted. So why the 4 stars? Because it tastes like good water, as it's supposed to. If it were sold for the same price as Sam's Club water then I'd buy it.  Also, I think I'll stick to Gatorade as opposed to expensive filtered tap water when I need electrolytes.

review/summary: Love the taste.  Other issues??
review/text: First, I'll discuss what I like most about this bottled water (the taste), then address some of the other issues I read from other reviewers:<br /><br />I love the taste.  Most bottled waters taste like most tap waters . . . bland. I have preferred Dasani (by Coca-Cola Co) due to its light mineral additive package which gives it a pleasing taste.  Likewise with this Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water. Very pleasant taste. No taste negatives and in my judgement, no aftertaste.<br /><br />I like the 1.5 liter size in the durable smooth clear bottle.  2 liter bottles are a little too big for packing around.  Other smaller sizes are often not very economical, or because of limited size require carrying more than one bottle.  This 1.5 liter weighs about 3 pounds when full and is a nice size in my estimation.<br /><br />The price is admittedly higher than the no-name bargain bottled waters, but neither is this Perrier-priced, and I do not find the price to be excessive for a quality, tailored water.<br /><br />I really can't speak much to the "magic elixer" claims regarding the pH. If I did, I think I'd be just making stuff up. I do, however, experience some infrequent heartburn, usually depending on what I've eaten. I had no such digestive problems after drinking the Essentia 9.5 pH. Maybe coincidence, or maybe the water helps. The idea of a basic pH water to balance an excessively acidic stomach situation has some merit. It would take longer for me to develop a more sure opinion.<br /><br />I like this water. I'd be willing to buy it regularly.

review/summary: Good Water But I'm Not Convinced it's Worth the Price
review/text: According to the Mayo Clinic, insufficient research exists to support manufacturer claims of any health benefits from drinking alkaline water.  Furthermore, the Mayo Clinic also disputes claims that bottled water is superior to tap water.<br /><br />That being said, I drink bottled water because I prefer carbonated to flat water.  So taste certainly has an influence on what kind of water to drink and any water is preferable to soft drinks.<br /><br />I couldn't detect any difference in the taste but my daughter and grandson (both with ADD) could.  They preferred the clean taste of Essentia to our well water but didn't find it to be significantly better than our filtered tap water.<br /><br />If the claimed benefits are scientifically to be true, then it may be worth the purchase price.  But individual testimony (anecdotal evidence) isn't enough to convince me.

review/summary: Good water, wins local taste test, but just barely.
review/text: This water is good, it is possibly the best tasting of the water we had in our taste test which included several well knows brands, grocery store distilled and filtered, as well as in home reverse osmosis. But this was a side by side comparison. All the water we tasted is exceptional on its own.<br /><br />I don't personally believe any health benefits, the small difference in pH from other water seems it would quickly be equalized in the acid digestive environment.<br /><br />I did find some change in baking but it was not a improvement, the high ph seemed to interfere with yeast and pizza dough did not form a quality skin as if the gluten formation was negatively impacted.<br /><br />Conclusion, the water is good, but seems expensive without any appreciable advantage.

review/text: I'm not rating Pepsi itself because pepsi soda is wonderful tasting. I'm rating the price, which is a complete rip off. I'm currently a cashier at Kmart. Customers are constantly purchasing the 12 packs for about $3-$5 per case (so $9-$15 for 36 cans total), depending on if it's on sale or not. You can even go into most grocery stores for around the same price.<br /><br />Bottom line, save your money and take a trip to your local grocery store or other stores with a grocery section to save money.

review/text: I think these Diet Snapple Singles are great.  At first I didn't think it would taste the same as the Peach Tea that I buy from the convenient store but it was actually very close.  It was not too sweet nor did it have a metallic kind of taste that I read in different reviews.  The box recommends that you use one stick in a 16.9 fl. oz. bottle of water.  I use one stick in a 24 oz. refillable bottle and it still tastes great, not watered down at all.  I will definitely be buying more of these in the near future.

review/text: I saw this at my local Dollar Tree which I had just begun frequenting.  I thought "..hmm name brand, Snapple, sure why not" and grabbed it to try.  I don't usually drink Snapple products so I have nothing to compare it to, however, being an avid drinker of Emergen-C and other powder based water flavour-ers I was eager to try this.<br /><br />It was actually quite good.  I split one pouch among two 16.9 fl oz bottles of water.  I like it a little diluted; just enough to get my tastes buds going.  Though I must admit, in the morning, even diluted it's too sweet for me.<br /><br />I was not expecting this to taste that good.  Word of advice, follow the directions.  I didn't the first time and dumped it in and wondered why the powder wasn't dissolving and almost swore off the product for good.<br /><br />If you can get it for a $1 at your local dollar store then I say it's worth it.  At 10 cals a pack it's much better than a soda or energy drink :)

I was looking all over for this information so I wanted to publish it for other people who are looking.<br /><br />I like the taste of this, although I do like the taste of the bottled Diet Peach Snapple a little better.  But this is a lot cheaper, so it's worth the trade-off.  I generally put one pouch in 24oz of water, otherwise it is too strong for me.

review/summary: UNPARALLELED HOT SAUCE!!!!!!!!
review/text: This hot sauce is one of a kind. I am always hesitant to try spicy foods because of the taste of hot sauce.. but when I tried Rocky's I was transformed. Other hot sauces seem chemically to me but Rocky's has a homey flavor that is incredibly diverse-- so much that I have been using it on eggs, tacos, as a marinade for chicken and on grilled cheese!! My family and I have been through six bottles of Rockys in the last two months. I can honestly say this is a first for our family, but certainly not the last as Rocky's has become a staple on the table for every meal. Thank You for creating such an amazing hot sauce and FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED IT: ORDER NOW!<br /><br />Bar-B-Que Notes: Love love love the barbeque flavor on grilled cheese. It is a staple as a snack or appetizer or a side for lunch. Honestly your grilled cheese is missing out. Also perfect on tacos for some extra smokiness.<br /><br />Lime Notes: Zingy with a fresh lime (not that awful concentrated flavor)... It goes perfectly on salad when mixed with some olive oil and chicken with a mexican twist or as a marinade for pork (that's the ways I've tried and loved it).<br /><br />Original is for everything. Awesome on roasted veggies and for breakfast with eggs/potatoes. My wings are made with nothing else, really.

review/summary: Smells just like roses
review/text: This is not strictly a "rose tea", it is neither black tea flavoured with roses, nor rosehip tea.  It's more like a herbal infusion that smells like perfume and roses without being overpowering.<br /><br />It brews quickly - if you're in a rush, a few dunks in boiling water produces a lovely drink, so it's perfect when you need to make a quick cuppa and don't have time to brew a proper pot of tea.<br /><br />I order this by the case!

review/summary: Relaxing but Weaker than most Tazo Teas
review/text: I've tried most of Tazo's teas and this is by far the weakest tea. I have to use at least two teabags per cup in order to get enough flavor. I may even try four teabags at some point although then I think the floral elements would be too strong. The ingredients include: Lemon balm, rose petals, honeybush, orange peel, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, licorice root, lavender, valerian root, natural flavors, ginger, orange oil and geranium oil. The taste of honeybush and rose come through the strongest. If you kissed someone after drinking this tea they would say you tasted like delicate flowers. Despite this not being as strong as I prefer, it is relaxing. I think I much prefer Tazo Calm to this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Used chicken rather than beef [saving of around 3g of fat per serving].  It was tasty but I do think that the beef would have enhanced the meal more.  Very easy to prepare.  Cooked the dish on high for 5 hours, left it to warm for 30 mins and then cooked it on low again for 30 mins.  Beans were just about done; they were still a little bit crunchy which mightn't be to everyone's taste.  I'd make this again.

review/summary: Nice cup of coffee but thats about it
review/text: This coffee might taste like Kalhua if you added some, but I couldn't taste anything but a nice medium strong cup of coffee. Only my opinion and I'm not a coffee expert, so take it for what it is.<br /><br />Update: I may have been a little more critical than I should have, I guess I was expecting a little more flavor like some of the other flavored coffees. There is a slight taste of Kahlua, not much but it's still a good cup of coffee, just don't count on a strong Kahlua taste. I'll have no problem buying it again just for the taste of the coffee in general.

review/text: If you enjoy the flavor of Kahlua, there is a good chance you will like the flavor of this coffee.  However, while I always use the smallest setting on my Keurig (5 oz), this is definitely one of the weaker coffees.  I still enjoy it for the flavor, more as a second cup or an afternoon cup, rather than a "wakeup cup".<br /><br />If you prefer stronger coffee and more flavor, I would recommend using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TIU7XG">White Coffee Kahlua Original Gourmet Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> with a reusable filter such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>.

review/text: I just tried this coffee for the first time, and I have to say, I really like it a lot. I normally go for the really strong robust flavors everyday, but was pleasantly surprised with this one. When brewing, the smell is mesmerizing, and the taste is very smooth. Yes, true it is not a very strong cup of coffee, but it's very nice. Oh yeah, you can taste the Kahlua in it also. Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed. This will definitely be one of my new flavors. By the way, I did not buy mine off Amazon, but somewhere else. I got a great deal on mine for an 18 pack!!!

Yes, I know that Kahlua is a coffee liquor, but it still has its own unique flavor which I like.  It is not overpowering and it is not artifical.  Just right.

Reminds me of how my aunt fixed Kahlua and coffee.  One tablespoon for an entire pot.  It might as well not have been in there as I could never detect the flavor at all. I would sneak back into the kitchen and pour a shot in like you would get if you ordered it at a restaurant or bar.

review/text: I bought a 24 can case of these and will never do it again. I should have heeded others reviews but I thought "I'm not that finicky". You don't have to be finicky to disapprove of these. (1) They've got a stringy thing hanging off of them. (2) They are small (3) If they haven't fallen apart by the time you open the can, they will by the time you get them to your mouth. Probably more wrong too but I'm trying to stomach my way through them by making stew. I have to put them in a strainer first to rinse off whatever crap that is on them, cook them in butter and lot's of salt & pepper before I put in milk. Then close my eyes & try to palate them. I would never feed them to a friend. I think Amazon would take them back but they have been so good about that on bad products I hate to ask them.

review/text: The important issue is that they are made in China. Remember the pet food from China that poisoned American dogs and cats in 2007. Remember also poisoned milk that killed Chinese babies in 2008. I'd rather buy food from another source with a better track record.<br />Unfortunately, I read the box after I'd eaten some oysters. The other person's comment is correct - the texture is icky and they crumble when you try to get them out of the can. I can not recommend this product to anyone.

review/summary: If You Like to eat Mold, This is the Product for You!
review/text: Do not waste your money on this product unless you like to eat mold!  Just so you know, you won't easily be able to detect the mold except by taste.  It shows up adjacent to the apples, and in the cinnamon strip in the center of the cake.<br /><br />The one star that I had to give it was merited, however.  I did not get sick from eating some of a piece of the coffee cake ... the phenolic flavor of which caused me to pull apart the cake, and identify that gray fuzziness which hallmarks mold.  No diarrhea.  No puking.  Well worth one star.<br /><br />My story.  The week after Thanksgiving (2009), I received one of these coffee cakes as gift from my aunt.  According to the label, she had purchased it the first week of November 2009 at Walter Reed Hospital (military) commissary.  After detecting the mold, I resealed it in its packaging material, what the company describes as a reusable freezer bag.  I placed it in my freezer, including the outer box, anticipating sending it back to the company for examination.<br /><br />A note about the packaging.  When I first opened the coffee cake's box, the inner (reusable freezer) bag conformed tightly with the cake, and the tape sealing the bag was undisturbed.  While the flyer included with the coffee cake advises that the product is stable for up to a year, I believe this could be overly optimistic if the mold eats cake quickly.  On the bright side, as the mold progresses, it's likely to become more visible during the course of a year.<br /><br />Know that if you don't heed my warning you're on your own.  The company will not stand by their product.  When I called their 'customer service' number, the woman advised me to return it to the military commissary where my aunt purchased it.  Not being in the military, I can not get on the facility within which the commissary is located.  Further, I'm not the boorish type, so the idea of returning the gift to my aunt as inedible was not an option.<br /><br />As we spoke, the customer service woman asked me 'if I had a problem with Campbell's soup would I call Campbell's soup, or take the soup back to the grocery store?'  I'd get in touch with Campbell's about defective soup ... if for no other reason than to allow them to recall the product.  Bottom line, she could no nothing for me as I had not bought the coffee cake directly from My Grandma's.<br /><br />When I related to the customer service woman that I would endeavor to communicate my dissatisfaction with their product, and their customer service, to the extent that I was able, she put me on hold.  Twice she came back on the line, asking me to continue to hold ... advising that held calls could only stay on hold for a short while.  The call disconnected after this.  There was no discussion on either of our parts with respect to the desired resolution.  My only option was to return it.<br /><br />With natural foodstuffs, especially those not chock-full of preservatives, it seems likely that problems might crop up every now and again.  I would've been content to ship the coffee-cake back to them (at their cost) to let their experts determine what was wrong, how it likely happened, and whether or not a recall was indicated ... after which I would've hoped for a replacement coffee cake.<br /><br />The crappy customer service ensured this didn't transpire.

review/text: I ordered this product and wished I had read the only other review before purchasing.  The boxes arrived (I ordered 4 of the 72 count boxes) and in the first box the vast majority of the individually wrapped candies were GLUED to the bottom of the tray.  The few that weren't glued to the tray had the wrappers glued to the bottom of the candy.  Upon closer inspection this sticky mass was a result of the "cordial" or syrup portion of the candy had drained out through some obscure way and created a disaster.  There were a few that had not "leaked" and those were far tastier because they had all the ingredients they were supposed to have.  I don't think this was a good value considering the state they were in.

review/summary: BEST VANILLA!!
review/text: this is hands down the best vanilla I have ever tasted!  the flavor is intense too, so you don't really have to use as much - it is well worth the price and will make all your baking that much better!  The grocery store vanillas, even the pure one's, leave a weird aftertaste and have an odd flavor whereas this has a true rich wonderful vanilla aroma and taste because of the cold processing.

review/summary: The Best By Far.
review/text: It would be difficult to find a better pure extract than this Nielsen-Massey offering.  Like several other reviewers here, I use a lot of this product in baking.  Over the years I have used quite a number of different brands, some out of necessity, and some out of curiosity.  I have yet to find a better one than this!  I do not want to sound like a snob, but the few dollars extra you pay for the real thing is worth it.  I cringe when I see the imitation vanilla on the shelves of grocery stores, as I know how much difference the flavor of the final product will be when using it.<br /><br />Quite often, even with the better grocery store brands, you get a strange and rather unpleasant after taste.  Not so with this stuff!  It should also be noted that the flavor here is extremely intense, so slightly smaller amounts are called for in some recipes.<br /><br />It always seems a shame to me to got to all the trouble of making a cake, or any dish for that matter, and not strive for perfection, giving it up for a relatively few saved cents.<br /><br />In addition to cooking needs, I have found that if you moisten the tip of your finger just slightly with this product, and rub just a small amount in a small area on the bulb of your bedside lamp, you get the most marvelous and sensual aroma...not overwhelming, but just slightly lingering.  Wow!<br /><br /> I really cannot see how you can go wrong here.  The price is equivalent to what I have been paying locally and an 8 oz bottle will last quite some time with reasonable use.

Real vanilla makes all the difference in your baking & cooking.  Chocolate chip cookies went from ok to phenomenal.  Whipped cream made from real cream, sugar & real vanilla....absolutely divine.

review/summary: Pure vanilla - richest flavored vanilla I've found!
review/text: This vanilla is fantastic and a great value!  If you're an enthusiast for "pure vanilla" as I am, you've likely tried many.  People often push Mexican vanillas on me, as though they're the best, when they're rarely even pure vanilla. Pure vanilla is more expensive than the artificial stuff, but the sweetness, complexity of flavor, and general warm, home-baked goodness of your baked goods will make them the envy of others.<br /><br />The vanilla I used before this one came from a spice store - and it's a very good vanilla, especially if you buy the double strength - but this vanilla has a little more complexity and I don't think you have to use twice as much to get double strength.  (I don't believe Nielsen-Massey sells a double strength.)  If a recipe calls for a teaspoon, just use a generous teaspoon and you'll have all the vanilla flavor of a double strength.  If you're concerned about thinning the sauce or whatever it is you're making, you can also use this company's vanilla paste, which is syrupy.  Just one caveat: that product has real vanilla bean in it, which means whatever you make will have small pieces of vanilla bean in it (like Breyer's ice cream that is made with vanilla bean in it - the pieces are so small you lose no creaminess in that ice cream or in anything you bake with this product - but you can see them in both of these separate products).<br /><br />Here's the bonus, though: this product sells for less than half of the price of the vanilla I used to get at the specialty spice shop, yet I've lost none of the rich vanilla flavor.  Wahoo!  I can't vouch for any of their other extracts, but the vanilla is amazing!

review/text: I agree with the other reviews on this being the best of the best on vanillas. It is an exact ratio of taste to bite and perfect for cakes and cookies as well as other vanilla uses. The cost for this quality seems in line with today's market.  While you may have paid less a few years ago. you also paid less for the price of gas and water then too! The most important aspect is it is a true extract, you use less for more flavor, so it is a true savings!

review/summary: LOVE IT
review/text: In the last few months, I've had the urge to get back to some serious baking, in the past things didn't always turn out good. I used the flavorings from the supermarket in the little bottles, but wasn't very keen on the flavor, even the ones that said they were the real deal, didn't taste great to me.<br /><br />The insentive to get baking again, are the really nice cookbooks I've been purchasing. In the past the old ones would sit on the shelf gathering dust. Here's one that I really love and I'm glad I found it, I've used it several times, some of the baking recipes (like cookies) have hot spices I would never have thought of using, but I'm now hooked on them! I feel so proud of myself for making some great treats.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579654584">The Back in the Day Bakery Cookbook</a><br /><br />I decided to use this Nielsen-Massey vanilla extract after a lot of thought. It's more expensive than the ones in the supermarket but the reviews were so good, I thought I'd give it a try. An 8oz bottle was huge for me, but is actually cheaper in the long run.<br /><br />I've used it in a few recipes now, and I love it, it doesn't have that yucky taste like those in the store. The baking has been so successful, that I'm getting through the bottle faster than expected. Next time, I'm going to purchase an even larger bottle!

review/text: Ronzoni's ziti pasta is an easy dish to cook when you want a hot meal without a lot of fuss. It can also be the main ingredient for a meal that has pasta with sauce as part of a main course dish. The pasta remains quite fresh until any expiration date that is printed on the top of the box; and each box has enough pasta for eight servings.<br /><br />The pasta is so easy to cook: just boil a pot of water; pour in the amount of the ziti that you need; and stir for about 10 minutes. If you like your pasta a bit firm then cook it for about 8 minutes--watch it and take a taste test of just one piece of pasta if you have any doubts. Some people add a little salt while the pasta cooks; I personally don't add salt. I never noticed any difference between salted and unsalted because the small amount of salt that you're supposed to add makes no big difference.<br /><br />The pasta is very low in fat; and it contains no trans-fats--thank goodness! This pasta contains no cholesterol and no sodium, either. That's very good health news. It does contain carbohydrates (42 grams per serving); but a single serving still keeps those carbs at only 14% of the daily allowance. In addition, the pasta has 7 grams of protein per serving as well. There is even a recipe or two on the outside of the box.<br /><br />Keep in mind that ziti is comparatively heavy pasta as opposed to radiatore and other types of pasta. If you want pasta that is lighter, I would recommend something other than ziti.<br /><br />A couple cautionary notes: This product contains wheat and it is made using equipment that also processes products that contain eggs.<br /><br />Overall, this ziti by Ronzoni is the best out there! It's affordable; easy to cook and serve; and it doesn't pose any major health risks to the vast majority of people. I highly recommend this fine pasta.

review/text: I have enjoyed Bartenders Whiskey Sour mixes in the powder form since the 70's, and they were easy to obtain all these years.  That is until recently in the last two years.  The shelves are crowded with the bottled mixes, which if you are a Whiskey Sour enthusiast, makes a clear and lifeless drink!  I traveled 40 miles to the one grocery store that carried them and would stock up on them, until they, too, discontinued offering this product.  All of a sudden, I thought of the computer!  I entered the exact thing I wanted and there they were, in all their glory, the boxes of packets of powder mix.  I ordered a case!I am not a heavy drinker, however, I do enjoy my cocktail before dinner.  My Mom (90) enjoys her one Manhatten and I, my Wh. Sour, and we talk and talk while we share in making our dinner.  Thank you Amazon for offering my long lost friend.

You can mix your drink, one at a time and the flavor is exceptional, especially when used in Amaretto Sours!!  I'm not much of a drinker but I really enjoy one of these every now and again.  Couldn't find the mixes in CA so I had to order them from Amazon. (I think they are an East Coast thing)  Didn't think we would go through a case of them but everyone that had a taste ended up asking us for some of the mix!!  Yes, it really is that good!
