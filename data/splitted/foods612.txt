review/summary: Good Cherry Flavor
review/text: Switch Black Cherry has a nice Black Cherry cider type flavor with a bit of carbonation.  The drink is naturally sweet and has no discernable after-taste.  The product comes in a rather small poptop can (and I only recieved one can) so I went for it straight in a glass and couldn't see how it stood up to ice.  I gave the main-squeeze a couple of sips too - she liked it and gave it a two-thumbs up.<br /><br />It was a bit milder tasting than IBC Black Cherry Soda but not unpleasantly so.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I prefer Stewarts Cherries and Cream (a 5 star beverage if there ever was one).<br /><br />If the price on this is right - I'd probably buy it if Stewrts or IBC wasn't available.

review/summary: Great tasting drink
review/text: I have long enjoyed the combination of a fruit drink mixed with sparkling water. The fruit drinks by themselves tend to be too sweet and syrupy for my taste, and the sparkling water cuts that and adds the zing of carbonation as well. This drink does the work for me, and they do it well. I really enjoyed these and will buy more!

review/summary: Pretty standard fruity drink
review/text: This carbonated juice drink tastes pretty artificial, although they claim that it's made mostly of juice. This is really more like a Black Cherry soda. It's got a pleasant taste just nothing that will blow you away. It's a bit expensive for such a small can and not a fresh enough idea to really get anyone to Switch from their current drinking habits.

review/summary: Tasty and refreshing!
review/text: I really enjoyed this flavor of Switch, as well. It's startling when you first take a sip, because although it's advertised as sparkling juice, I for one still expect an overly-sweet soda taste. What you find instead is simply a carbonated fruit juice. The taste is true to the natural juice flavor, refreshing with the right amount of carbonation. This one had a very slightly funny, maybe slightly bitter aftertaste, so I gave it 4.5 stars. Overall, tasty, healthy and refreshing!

review/summary: Tasty, but I wouldn't drive out of my way for it
review/text: Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Black Cherry was my preference over the other flavor, Kiwi Berry.  The cherry flavor really stood out and with every sip I felt sure that real black cherries were used to make this beverage.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars.

review/text: I love fizzy juice drinks!!!  I got a case of the blackberry Izzes last year and was hooked!  There fizzy juice drinks are bad if you like izzes you will like these, or any sparkling juice drink.  There is no added sugar which is nice.  The main downside to these drinks is the fact that although these are dubbed "Black Cherry", cherry and is the fourth juice listed and the flavor just isn't that strong.  I haven't tasted the other kinds yet so I can't do an analysis and tell you whether not the others are truer to the title, but if you are looking for a bold cherry taste, look elsewhere, or just buy some cherry juice.  Oh, and I've had black cherry juice and it tasted like wood chips to me, so maybe this is a good thing...  haha<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy

review/text: Harness the power of the mythical "black cherry" with the new Switch Black Cherry flavored energy drink. For centuries, people have struggled to unleash the mysteries and wonder surrounding this strange fruit. Finally, the fruit engineers at Switch have discovered a way to infuse all the pros of the black cherry flavor with none of the cons of a typical energy drink. I can't explain how it works, but I do know it tastes delicious and will satisfy your thirst in ways you didn't know were possible. How, you ask? Simple: Black Cherry power!!

review/summary: Not Great, Not Horrible
review/text: The taste of this drink didn't really knock me out; there's not quite enough black cherry to completely disguise the apple juice base. And there was almost a very slight taste of salt...though this may be more a factor of the carbonation that any actual ingredient. Overall, not an unpleasant drink - but not one I'd seek out when there are other choices.

review/text: This drink is a lot more thirst quenching than any soda pop that I've had. It's a little over carbonated for my taste, but with a splash of Spiced Rum ( only for those old enough of course {;-)in it, it's really pretty good.<br />  I approve of it being in aluminum cans that can be recycled instead of plastic bottles. I know, in some places plastic bottles can be recycled, but not around here.<br />  It would be nice if it was in a larger container, 12 oz instead of these dinky little 8.3 oz.<br />  Depending on its cost, if it was available around here I'd buy it.

I love the fact that it has no artificial anything in it, so it's just bubbly juice. It's a nice mix between syrupy like a pop and yet still refreshing, unlike a pop.  I highly recommend this one, even if you don't like cherry! I'm not a huge cherry fan myself, but the black cherry flavor is really wonderful!

review/summary: ------Taste is great and Switch is 100% juice------
review/text: There are many things to like about the Black Cherry Switch drink.  I found the taste to be very good. Also, since juice by itself, can be a little flat, the small amount of carbonation in the drink gives it that zing that seems to further enhance the taste.  I was happy to see that it is 100% juice, but on the down side, Switch has 130 calories.<br /><br />Now, if you're drinking a lot of sodas, this could be the way to change your habits. Drinking one can a day would be a delightful treat with the benefit of juice, which may not be a part of your diet at this time!  It's worth the switch!  Sorry, I couldn't help myself!

review/summary: good idea, so-so product
review/text: The idea of carbonated fruit juice replacing standard sodas is a good one.  So many people drink a lot of soda.  This indeed is a healthier option.  However, I was disappointed.  Despite being called Black Cherry, this soda actually contained quite a number of different juices and the cherry flavor was subtle.  It tasted like a carbonated juice box.  If you must have carbonation, then I would suggest this.  If you can do without carbonation, then save yourself the money (these are pricey) and just buy juice.

review/summary: alternative to colas
review/text: The Switch Black Cherry soda is a fine drink if you enjoy light-flavored carbonated beverages.  To my taste, this drink needs more intensity of cherry flavor to compete with the carbonation.  It contains concentrated cherry juice, along with the main juices of apple and grape.  I found the carbonation slightly more than I expected, after trying one of the other flavors of this brand.  The black cherry-flavored brand name colas deliver more "cherry punch", but if your goal is to drink something less sugary and more healthful(100% juice), than this is the one to choose.  The cans are small: 8.3oz., which is good for a small thirst or small child.

review/text: The closest resemblance of taste is: apple juice with a dash of sourness and dark color of black cherry and slight fizz. I found it very sweet. Carbonation is not like Coke or soda but just a slight fizz and I am not sure if it adds anything to the flavor. 130 calories from 8.3 oz. is a bit too much to call it a healthy drink, although it is supposedly all natural. Add 1 part black cherry juice to 4 part apple juice and you can have it much cheaper at home than paying 96 cents for this drink!

review/summary: A fruity refreshment
review/text: The name of the beverage is unmistakable--Switch. I guess it follows that "Hope" and "Change" slogan that was popular last summer and fall. The good news is this drink won't escalate the national deficit.<br /><br />I tried the black cherry variety. To be honest, I thought the 8.3 ounces was a bit sparse. I'm used to a full 12 ounces. I liked the cherry flavor. The carbonation was not over powering, just enough for a slight fizz.<br /><br />The product bills itself as all natural. No sweeteners were added, a good thing as my son gets enough in the line of sugars. But my son doesn't drink sodas and didn't want to try this. (More for dad, eh?) It claims to be 100% juice. Now the labeling can say one thing, but what does the required "Nutrition Facts" say? It does claim 33g of sugar (in an 8.3 ounce can). Since the bottle of Cherry Coke Zero doesn't even list sugar, I'm not sure how to take that information. Or is the sugar fructose from the cherry juice itself?<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the drink. I haven't seen it on the store shelves yet--but it is available at Amazon. Try it for a refreshing change.

review/text: This was not bad at all. It had a sugary black cherry taste but overall, not bad. There is a slight bitter after taste. It's a nice alternative to soda, although an 8.3 ounce can of Back Cherry Switch has 30g of sugar. It's not thick but the sweetness does hit you! One thing that raises my eyebrow (besides the after-taste) was the price of the case. A 24 pack of cans that are slightly smaller than a can of soda for $24 is a little on the high side. Consider a 12 pack of Pepsi (or if you like Coke) which is roughly about $5.99 per pack. If you get 2 packs, you're only paying $12, but if you get a 24 pack of Switch, then your paying over $20 (for smaller cans than).

I'm also a HUGE fan of black cherry sodas; however, you might be disappointed if you intend on replacing your favorite black cherry soda because while this has a black cherry flavor, you'd definitely miss the extra sugary flavor, thus leaving it to taste like a fizzy black cherry tea.<br /><br />Still, I don't normally drink soda, and there are times that I definitely crave it. So these would be a good-enough substitute, especially if you're not used to extremely sugared beverages. I'd also feel very safe about giving this to children.

review/text: Switch Beverage company's Black Cherry juice drink does pack a pretty good cherry taste.  It is mildly carbonated and not too sour.  I found the thin 8 ounce can nice to look at and a good size to hold onto.  It states "100% juice" "no sugar added" and "no preservatives."  Don't let the no sugar added thing fool you, though.  It has 33 grams of sugar!  Not a low caloie drink either at 130 calories.  It does not have corn syrup or any artificial colors which is nice.<br /><br />It is pretty good, but I am not sure I would buy this all the time because of the hight sugar content and the calories.  Plus, after a few sips I start really tasting the grape juice in this (#2 juice after apple on the ingredients list).

review/summary: Black Cherry is my favorite of the Switch Drinks
review/text: When trying this drink we decided to use the taste test method. The four of us sat around the table with little drink cups filled, waiting to start our test. Around the table each one took our sampling. Our four year old son decided this was good and he wanted more. Seven year old Daughter had lots to say but all her adjectives revolved around and excited yummy. Cherry is his favorite flavor and he stated this was his favorite of the Switch drinks. Dad's turn to try and he like it but he thought it was a bit sweet. My turn. The can is slim and tall and reminded me of the apple juice cans only taller. Tasting the Black Cherry drink made me think of the version of the JD alcoholic beverage minus the spirits. A little on the sweet side, with a little bit of a twang and if you drink too much you may regret it! These little carbonated juice drinks were good and I can see that they could become an addition. As a parent I would definately put this in the lunch box over say one of the fruit punch pouches we so readily disperse! All-in-all this is a pretty "yummy" drink.

review/text: This is a fun drink if you are looking for a change of pace. I was surprised at the calories but most juice is highly caloric anyway. I think this could make a great ice cream soda! I preferred the strawberry over this but only because the black cherry seemes in many ways just like a soda. The cans are very small -- like slim soda cans so they go quick.

review/summary: The first sip was divine.  After that, more mundane.
review/text: I tested two flavors of Switch soda, and I liked the Black Cherry flavor the best.  The first sip made my taste buds start dancing; it was full of flavor. Not the super-sweet, overcompensating with sugar to cover up the lack of real taste kind of flavor, either.<br /><br />Have you ever eaten a pile of chilled cherries on a hot summer afternoon? If so, you'll know that every so often, one of the small fruits ripens to a deeper flavor than the others.  You'll be snacking along, and then... BAM! that one special cherry makes you sit up and take notice.  Well, that is what the first taste of Switch is like.<br /><br />Maybe my taste buds went into overload, and shut down, because the flavor-palooza didn't last.  My last sip was good, and I enjoyed the drink, but it just didn't deliver that same "punch" with every tip of the wrist.<br /><br />This soda is what I'd call "lightly carbonated".  I find that a plus, as it's not burp-inducing. But, if you're looking for a fruit-fizzy, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a nice Switch from the usual soft drink fare and it's full of healthy goodness. I don't think I would enjoy drinking this everyday, but for an occasional treat, it's lovely.

review/summary: It's still soda!!
review/text: Yes, it's most certainly better than coke or the usual carbonated drinks since it has nothing artificial added to it. It has a cool name and the taste is quite good. For those people addicted to soft drinks, this might be a better alternative but for people who don't drink much soda like me, I don't see why you would switch to "Switch" since you are still drinking a carbonated beverage when there are still better alternatives.

review/summary: Note: recipe calls for 1.25 packages worth
review/text: I love India Tree and wish this was organic and non-GMO. However for occasional use I will overlook that. India Tree fondant sugar is 100 times finer than regular powdered sugar and that does make a difference in icings and other decorations. I used it for royal icing on sugar cookies.  One caveat: I was really annoyed that their recipe calls for 1 lb. or 1.25(!!) packages of the stuff meaning you have to buy 2 packages worth. Why on earth don't they provide a recipe for a single package of fondant sugar rather than 1.25??? I don't usually need a calculator when I follow a recipe so that was really annoying. And don't bother substituting regular powdered sugar to make up the difference ~ your icing tip will clog, clog, clog.

review/text: I have been making wine kits since 2004 at the rate of 1 kit per week. I have been buying mostly the Wine Expert/Vintners Reserve kit. These are very good kits. I thought I would try the Vino Italiano kit as the Wine Expert are getting pretty pricey.I couldn't believe for $44 you could get the corks, labels, etc.PLUS the kit.The 1st thing i noticed when making the kit was how the thicker consistency of the juice, this explains the smaller 15.5 ounce package (more concentrated). This kit requires an extra racking but makes the wine clear up much faster than the Vintners. When I tried this Merlot before bottling I was so surprised at the flavor. It is a drier white which I prefer. The body is comparable to any I have made and I liked it so much I subscribed to once a month delivery and saved an additional 15%-unbelievable!I have also tried the Riesling, very good as well. I now have a Pinot Chardonnay, Valpolicella, and a Merlot going and expect them to be just as good. These are the best deal for price and quality I have found to date and will continue to use these as long as they are available at this price!

review/text: This is one of several Vino Italiano kits I have ordered and done in the last year.  This is the first one with a red content.  This one finishes more of a blush than a red which is what I was looking for.  It finished out at .990 and I backsweetened to an off dry.  Wife says its her new favorite wine.<br /><br />It may not be the best for most but we enjoy the lighter off dry to sweeter wines and it fits the bill very well at a great price.

review/summary: Great value for the money!
review/text: This was my first Vino Italiano kit. I'm quite pleased with the results! The feedback from my friends has all been quite positive, and I think it tastes just dandy for a blush.<br /><br />The kit was easy to make. Depending on the temperature of your workspace, it takes roughly 4 weeks, though I personally think it was much better after aging a bit. Drinkable right after bottling, but better if you wait a couple months.<br /><br />Simple to make, came with the corks, labels and capsules. Mixed up well, fermented properly, and clarified beautifully. Can't ask for more than that for a buck and a half a bottle.

review/text: I am not a zin drinker but this kit is just fine for the price.  Good instructions, easy, and easy to work with.  I would cut it to 5 gallons, or use a top off of something sweet, and a wine conditioner, which I did.  What I have now at bottle time is a nice, light little wine to chill off and enjoy.  I am sure the age in the bottle will make it better.  I did let mine age about 2 weeks longer before bottle, and the taste was quite different, age is the key.  Nice little wine for the back yard zin folk, and a good pair with white cheese and crackers.  I will keep this stock on hand for the informal little do. And they like it!

review/text: I have made a number of these kits and the Zin Blush is my least favorite but the wife likes it so I made it again. The price and ease of making these kits keep me buying them. Let these age six months or so and it makes a huge difference. I really like the Tuscany Rosso and the Muscato to blend 50/50 but the Muscato is no longer available. Will try the Barolo next. I have dedicated a 6 gallon carboy to these kits and have one working all the time. I also let the wine bulk age in the carboy for a few extra weeks. Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't but I think it helps not to rush it to the bottle.

review/summary: Used to love it...
review/text: I've been buying this product for years and have always loved it.  There used to be three separate packets - the pasta, seasoning mix and the crouton/cheese mix.  There were bits of dried bell pepper and mushrooms mixed in with the pasta.  I just recently purchased the box and was surprised to see that they had changed it.  There were no mushrooms at all, hardly any bits of bell pepper, and now the croutons were mixed into the seasoning.  Now instead of sprinkling the croutons onto the finished product, you're forced to mix them in to the oil/water mixture.  You can guess the result of that, by the time the pasta is mixed the croutons are completely soggy.  I wrote to Betty Crocker to let them know I was disappointed with the reformulation of the product and they assured me that before making such a change they do extensive testing to make sure the changes will broaden the product's appeal to the customer base.  I guess their taste testers like soggy bits of bread in their pasta salad, however I do not and will not be purchasing this product any longer.

When we are in a hurry and don't have time to make everything from scratch, it is convenient to make something tasty like Suddenly Caesar Salad.  Usually we add olive oil instead of vegetable oil.<br /><br />There's a suggestion on the box for creamy Caesar salad. It calls for mayonnaise and milk.<br /><br />Sometimes we add some romaine and chicken.  It's also good with crawfish tails, leftover broiled salmon, or shrimp.

review/text: Briefly:<br /><br />- taste is VERY close to sugar's<br />- no aftertaste<br />- no known adverse side effects<br />- one packet is the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar<br />- zero calories<br /><br />I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy the larger boxes and save :).<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time.

review/summary: Delicious! Nice little real coconut bits.
review/text: My wife and I love bubble tea, and the best bubble tea we can get around here is a coconut milk shake with tapioca and lychee jellies. However, $6 a drink x2 adds up quickly, and she had tasted Big Train products before, so we bought this 3.5 lb bag of coconut mix. It's delicious. We usually just blend it up with milk and add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001N7RLQ">tapioca pearls (2.2 lbs)</a> to it, but the back of the package has directions for smoothies or iced drinks. It has a nice creamy, sweet, coconutty flavor with little bits of real coconut. It tastes like real coconut and has both coconut oil and coconut in it.<br /><br />This bag has enough for 40 servings (4 Tbsp per 8 oz). Nutritionally there are 180 calories per 4 Tbsp, 6g Fat, 5g Sat Fat.  I'd recommend this to anybody that likes coconut (or doesn't for that matter, as I'm not a big fan of coconut flakes, but I love this). It goes well with or without tapioca pearls. We haven't tried it as a smoothie yet, but I'm sure that would be good too. I'd recommend mixing this with milk though, not water (both are listed as options on the back). Hope this was helpful! Let me know if you have any questions by leaving a comment. Enjoy!

review/summary: The Missing Pork and Beana
review/text: When I first met my future husband (over 30 years ago), he raved about his mother's pork and bean recipe and how they used Campbell's Pork and Beans has its base.  Up until several years ago, I could not find these beans on any grocery shelves in my area.  Finally has a last resort, I looked up Campbell's Pork and Beans on Amazon and I FOUND them!!  I was overjoyed and I bought 12 cans of these beautiful beans for my husband's birthday.  The beans came promptly within about 10 days and the Campbell's recipe for these beans has not changed one bit. We made his mother's recipe and it turned out just has tasty has it did several years ago.  No other beans out there can be used for this recipe, I have tried.  The 28 ounce can can easily feed a family of 4.

review/summary: Guess I won't buy again
review/text: My dog seems to like this just fine and dandy. She's happy to eat it but I don't like the fact that it is so mushy. She's not a big dog and it takes her forever to lap the food up. Yes, I know, it's probably good exercise having to work to eat her food but I don't like to have to work to eat my food so I don't want her to either.

review/summary: Gold standard...Years of research on my part...
review/text: When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my "baby" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE "health" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept "treating" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and "cured" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.

review/summary: No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food
review/text: Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell "dog food".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.

review/summary: My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago
review/text: My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!

review/summary: Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.

review/summary: Must have been a contaminated batch
review/text: We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

review/text: My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.

review/summary: The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....
review/text: I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.

review/text: I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.

review/text: My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?

review/summary: Newman's Own for Puppies/Dogs Canned Food
review/text: I love this dog food. I eat very well myself, being a vegetarian for over 20 years and try to eat organically as much as possible. I did a great deal of research on commercial dog foods and I was disgusted when I discovered the amount of chemicals and pesticides they contained. I tried my puppy on many different natural dog foods and she would have gas and the runs with every type, but Newman's Own.  So I am back to my first choice since she never had negative effects with it. Unfortunately it was a little hard to find locally, but now I can order it through Amazon and get it delivered every month. Thanks Newman's Own and thanks Amazon for making my puppy and I very happy :)

review/summary: This one is an obvious winner at our house - for my lab mix!
review/text: I offered my lab mix his new DRY dog food yesterday. He refused it. It was one of the Newman's Own dry dog food. No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!

review/summary: Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice
review/text: I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!

So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own. The liver was not her favorite and was a little strong smelling for this vegetarian, but the beef was great. She loves it, I steam some veggies and mix them in, then put a dry food on top and she scarfs it down. I do wish Newman's would put out an organic beef treat and a dry food that does not have chicken and corn but am very happy with the beef.

review/text: My little toy poodle had digestive problems a few months ago and just didn't want to eat dog food. All he wanted was cooked chicken breast, and so, that's what he got (so he'd at least get some food into him).<br /><br />Happened to find the Newman's Own canned chicken dog food, and he absolutely inhaled it! He finds it irresistible. I am so thankful this food is on the market -- it looks and smells like cooked chicken (which he likes), and has helped him get back on track nutritionally (which I like :-)

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: I've noticed a big difference in my dog's weight = she's able to maintain her weight, not gaining as much weight as when she ate dried dog food.  And being a white dog, she doesn't get dark teary eyes when she eats only Newman organic dog food.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food is NOT made in the USA
review/text: I was not aware of and was not told the country of origin when I purchased a case of Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food..  This product is made in Uruguay not the USA!! It made both of my dogs sick with severe diarrhea.  Blue Buffalo was out of stock so I thought "Newman's Own" indicated it would be a good product made in the USA.  WRONG!!!

review/summary: Gives my dog terrible diarrhea
review/text: After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.

review/summary: Great food--dented cans happen too often!!
review/text: This is great, healthy food---the only food my dogs (Cav. Spaniel and Spaniel mix) can eat w/o stomach issues. Many other premium foods are just too rich!!  The dented can issue has never required me to return the food, but it happens too often and is very annoying!  I would never feed my dogs anything else and no one here carries this particular food, so I am very thankful that Amazon sells it.

review/text: My pup loves this food and I love that it's organic and not bulked up with useless, unhealthy fillers. However, unless you're using the 'Subscribe & Save' feature, you're better off buying this at Walmart for $2.18 per can.

review/summary: Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice Dog Food
review/text: This is quality dog food and my 9 year old cocker spaniel loves it.  She has more energy and is more alert.  I give her half of a 5.5 ounce can each morning and the other half in the evening.  I also give her Newman's dry dog food twice a day. It's expensive but our darling pets deserve the best.

review/summary: too rich for my dog, gave her black poo
review/text: I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.

review/text: My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)

review/text: I have 2 rescue poodles which will eat just about anything that doesn't breathe.However I just don't feed them anything after a bitter lesson of my poodle Max dying from the China dogfood crisis.I will not feed them anything but totally USA made. They do like the chick/rice and I am about to give Turkey/rice a try.  I'm happy with it being mushy as easier for Spice to eat as she has only 1 tooth. I will continue to buy as long as they are happy with it.I'm so happy to have found it at Amazon with free shipping.

review/summary: Doggies love this food-even finicky dogs
review/text: I have two dogs.  One of them, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has a very sensitive stomach and Newman's food is the only food that agrees with him.  Ordering from Amazon on a scheduled basis has made my life so much easier as I am a senior citrizen and UPS delivers the food free right to my door step.  Sammy loves the turkey & brown rice and chicken & brown rice with the dry food serving as "treats".  My Yorkie has an improved appetite since I changed to Newman's products.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: This is an excellent dog food. My dog just had IVD surgery and has been on the canned dog food - chicken and brown rice. Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever.

review/text: I was looking to change my dog's canned food as he is getting on in years and I wanted a more nurtitious healthy brand than what I was currently using. My dog loves this food and eats it heartily. I feel better knowing he is eating an organic food from a company I trust...I would recommend it highly. I also signed up to receive automatic delivery which saves money. With that discount this is the least expensive pricing I have been able to find.

review/text: I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry.....this canned food drives her crazy, she just loves it, must be the whitefish in. She gets a teaspoon or so in with her dry & cleans the bowl...Amazons price beats that big box store when you use subscribe & save.

review/summary: my dogs love this food!
review/text: First, I feed my dogs fresh raw food I make into patties and frez, each morning they eat one frozen,and I give them Fish oil, Garlic and Klamath shores Blue Green Algae caps. Then at night I give Newmans Chicken can food and mix in their Probiotic Miracle & Enzymes and Plaque off. Then they always have their dry food (Taste of the wild, grain free)anytime they are still hungery.<br /><br /> My 2 big dogs are very healthy at 8 years old, hardly get fleas anymore, I don't use chemical flea or heartwormer products anymore, as one dog had a bad reaction to them and lost most of his hair and had hot spots for two years. Then nat. path vet said my other vet should not have given him the yearly vacinations,which also caused the problems. He went on a 10 week detox after that.)<br /><br />For the alternative heartwormer I do 1 week each mo. I give my dogs Natures sunshine Artemisia Combination 2 in the morning, 1 at night with 1 BlackWalnut. then 2 times that week I will give them 1 HS2. I give these about 20 min. before I give them morning food. Then at night before bed. My dogs weights are 100 and 70. The dog that had allergey, I also would give him first thing in the morning, before eating, Transfer factor, or colostrum, also everyother day a kelp tablet, which I think helped the hair grow back in. I used emu oil with lavender oil and tea tree oil mixed in, on the hot spots. Also for the ears, I used Zymox, OTIC Enzymatic Solution. it worked great.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone.

review/text: I did not post this under packaging review, because the order arrived fully sealed, no markings or damage to the outside box, but 8 out of the 12 cans were severly dented, so I had to assume they had been packaged that way.  They were even hard to open with the can opener.  I will still get my subscribed monthly order, but if it happens again I will probably cancel it.  I have no problems with the quality of the product, just very dissatisfied with the way it was mailed.

review/summary: All flavors repeatedly make my dog terribly sick
review/text: At first, I thought my toy schnauzer had gotten into something that made her very sick but I took her off the Newman's Own anyway just to be safe (a decision made by my vet and I after I took her into the ER that night). I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again.
