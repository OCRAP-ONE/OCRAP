review/summary: Great healthy convenient "fast food"!
review/text: We use this and others in the line of Eden "rice and beans" for making quick dinners which are actually healthy. Although it is a meal in itself, i usually first brown ground chicken or saute shrimp and then mix with the beans and chick peas. I like to add chopped spinach, or brocoli too and then it really rounds out nicely and a complete meal in a skillet. We also like the "Cajun beans and rice", rice and lentils, rice and pintos (makes a great quick chili if you add a jar of Salsa).

review/summary: Enjoyable and Healthy?
review/text: I never before found a can that combines brown rice, per say, and beans. You heat it up and add some tasty choice of Beef, Fowl, Seafood or Veggies and you have a standard meal ready to be consumed. I have come to appreciate Eden Organic. Yes, I admit that I usually add a little more salt, pepper and herbs but in the end they do taste very good. I initially was looking for the beans alone but when I read the label and since I only use brown rice now a days, we gave this combination a shot and for us, it paid off! I can cook all manners of legumes, beans, etc but hey, if a nice organic company wants to do it for a while for an acceptable price, why not? For sure 4 Stars or even higher, they are reliable fare but for a couple of weird reasons we ended up with 6 cases of different kinds so we are still figuring how are we going to consume so much since most of the times we are only 2 people. That is the beauty of canned food, I guess, that it does keep longer and well. 4 Stars!

review/summary: Rhubarb Spread
review/text: I should have read the label on this: It is a spread, not jam. The flavor is acceptable, but I've been looking for a good rhubarb (not rhubarb-strawberry) jam since Bonne Maman stopped making theirs several years ago. I'm not rating my disappointment, though--even as a spread I thought this was average. I've also tried Andresy's rose jan (3 stars) and fig jam (4 stars).

review/text: I keep a jar of this truffle salt right next to my stove all the time. It gets used 3-4 times a week minimum, more than any other single seasoning I use. I love the flavor of truffles and this way, I can have it.

Also, a jar of this salt makes a lovely hostess gift. I just gave one to a friend last week and she loved it.

review/text: I gave this to my dad for Xmas.  He and my mom have been very pleased with the truffle flavor, BUT no method of packaging can contain the truffle odor, which is very strong and pungent. For a while it worked to keep the small jar shut up in a larger jar, but now they've had to move the larger jar to the downstairs pantry. I know people rejoice in the wonderful smell of truffles at the harvest, but no one wants to smell truffles all the time, especially when making rhubarb pie.<br /><br />The flavor deserves 5 stars, and I would consider buying it again -- but first I need to think of a way to store it!

review/summary: Truffle tang you can count on to last.
review/text: Truffles are evanescent little buggers, and even truffle oil eventually goes bad, but the unique flavor of truffles is such a welcome and exotic complement to some foods that it pays to have access to the taste on hand.  Truffle salt can never replace fresh truffle shavings for truly gourmet dishes, but a pinch of FungusAmongUs Truffle Salt on scrambled eggs turns them into something much classier than they really are.  And not much of the seasoning is required to provide a hint of extra flavor (in fact, my sin has more often been using too much).  My sole complaint about this product is that it would have been nice if the container it had been packaged in had been a shaker rather than simply a squat jar.  Whatever the salt is stored in must be air-tight, so the cover is essential, vesus just leaving the seasoning open to the air via shaker holes, but if Mrs. Dash can find a way both to protect the goods and create a more convenient sprinkling solution, I bet the good folks at FungusAmongUs can go them one better.<br /><br />This stuff isn't cheap, but I think it's worth it to have on hand for those rare occasions when I want to appear sophisticated, or, more admirably, just crave the signature aroma and flavor of truffle.

We go through the Casina Rossa at a 4 to 1 pace, and only because I use the FungusAmongUs brand in heavier stews where it's indelicacies will not be noticed.  I wouldn't even consider the brand for a finishing salt on tomatoes or mild cheeses.<br /><br />If Casina Rossa is a well-mannered Persian housecat, FungusAmongUs is a burr-covered, hacking Maine Coon.  I'd adopt both, but would love them differently.

review/text: When first purchased you could smell the truffle through the container, very strong. Stored it in the jar in a ziplock bag. Thought the "grains" or bits of truffle were not quite right. Texture like soil or clay. Product now smells nothing like truffles, smells like clay, tastes like clay. I believe they used soil that could pass for trufle bits, and infused them with truffle oil. Mixed with the salt it would be hard to tell, but I know I'm not eating salt and truffle. Friends agree. Shameful.

review/text: This is the first truffle salt I have tried so I have no prior experience.<br /><br />That being said, I was a little disappointed with this salt. The aroma is very pungent when you open the jar, and a nice truffle flavor is present when you sprinkle a little salt on your tongue. However, I never really got much truffle flavor come through in the food, I tried it on eggs and french fries, and I like to use a good amount of salt, but it became too salty and there was little-to-no truffle flavor. Also the nice pungent truffle aroma from the jar has gone completely about 6 months later, leaving behind a terrible funky old-shoe smell. I'm considering another salt eventually, but for now I'll stick with the oils which seem to work well.

review/text: Was what my husband said, when I held the UNOPENDED jar to his face. Indeed, when I opened the package it came in, I was hit with a blast of what I am assuming was truffle, but really smelled like garlic? Having never tasted a truffle before, I have no basis to compare it too, but I found this tasty. A little goes a long way, if you like strong flavors, like garlic, and like salt, this is a great salt to taste and experience. Not a bad price when you consider how little you will use, (a small pinch for a pasta dinner for 4).

I bought a couple other jars of different brands in a local gourmet shoppe, but neither was as good as FungusAmongUs. I purchased a third  brand from an online gourmet shop...still not as flavorful. I was so glad to finally find FungusAmongUs on Amazon at a very reasonable price (compared to what I had paid for others). The jar arrived in a few days. I made my pizza and opened the jar...oh, the delight! Lots of Truffle specs and that same delicious flavor I remembered from a few years back. Thank you Amazon and thank you FungusAmongus!

review/text: this truffle salt offers a fabulous flavor & aroma of truffles.  the salt is very salty (no phun intended) so be sure to ck the seasoning before adding add'l regular salt to recipe.  i've primarily been using this item on saut&eacute;ed french string beans - adding a bit of this at the end of cooking - fabulous!  whole family loves it!

review/summary: Aroma is a Truffle Lover's Paradise
review/text: I've got to agree with the other reviews.  And I have to say that if you love truffles you will love the smell of this salt.  People are right in saying that you can smell it straight from the bottle but if you love truffles and the smell of mushrooms in general this will not be offensive.  On the contrary it is delightful and very addictive.<br /><br />The salt by itself, just like the oils, doesn't taste as strong as the smell when eaten alone.  However, this is definitely tastier and more pungent than the oil I used from Roland (good brand but need to cut back due to calories).  I'm sure when eaten with mushroom based soups it will also impart it's own delicious flavor.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not crazy about is the jar as it caused some spillage on the first opening.  However, seeing as how tasty the salt was and how I was actually eating it straight from the jar, that's really not going to deter me from giving it a five star rating.<br /><br />So if you love truffles and love a strong pungent aroma, you can't go wrong with this.  For truffle lovers it's good enough to eat out of the jar.

review/text: Love it!  Don't let the pungent smell scare you away.  Keep the lid closed and only open when using.<br />It's wonderful on most anything that you would put salt on like a pasta, eggs, meat, cheese etcetera.<br />Just try a little at a time.  It basically makes what ever you put it on taste better than plain salt would.

review/summary: Chemical Disaster?!
review/text: This stuff is just god awful. I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what. I was excited because I thought I found a cheap alternative to the truffle salt I had bought and enjoyed in the past and (which is Casina Rossa BTW, it is a delicious salt/truffle combo) this is not the case with "Fungus Amongus." It is in no way comparable in any way to decent truffle salt, it has a horrifying chemical smell to it. ALSO, ***Amazon has a NO RETURN policy for this item*** Save yourself some money and buy something useful! What should I even do with it at this point? Do you think it might pull oil out of the ground like kitty litter?

review/summary: mostly salt with some grains of truffle
review/text: I was turned into the truffle salt in Sonoma where they served at a wine tasting bits of cheese sprinkled with truffle salt. I loved it! I didnt want to weigh my luggage so I didn't buy it there. As soon as I got home I ordered this product from FungusAmongUs. Unfortunately, it tastes nothing like the one I tasted in Sonoma. It's mostly salt with some sprinkles of truffle. I tried to sprinkle it on cheese, but tasted salty. I can probably use it with eggs, but there is hardly anything else I use salt with, so this product is not very useful to me.

review/text: I bought 2 jars on the basis of reviews (i.e. 'strong truffle aroma', 'earthy', etc.), after no longer being able to find my usual brand, Sabatino's, at my local retailer.  I'm disappointed.  This salt has no finesse.  It tastes more industrially produced than the Sabatino.  The salt itself is lower quality and the flavor doesn't linger.  I would pay more to get the Sabatino online.  I may give the second jar as a gift to a neophyte.

review/text: This is verbatim from my boyfriend's mouth, "I can't imagine why everyone would say Truffles were so wonderful if they taste the way they do in this salt." My boyfriend didn't want to, "breathe while it was in my[his] mouth so I[he] wouldn't have to smell the rancid fumes of this truffle salt." I have had truffles a few times in other restaurants, but never tasted something similar to this salt. Hands down awful. I can't even re-gift it because I know something is wrong with it.<br /><br />Not happy I wasted money on this item AND shipping.

review/summary: Stank
review/text: I have never tried truffles before so I am not sure how they should smell or taste but I'm afraid there is something very wrong with the truffle salt I purchased from this company. When I opened the container I was hit with a sharp acrid smell that was similar to garlic. It was so strong it filled the entire room within seconds, which sent my family reeling with tears in their eyes. I was determined to try the salt in hopes that the flavor would be better than the smell. I cooked a tiny amount in with scrambled eggs. To my horror the flavor was the same as the smell. I asked some friends to try it and they had the same reaction to the smell and flavor as I did. After all the great things I have heard about truffles I find it hard to believe that this is the way they taste and smell.

review/summary: Hands down best popcorn you can get outside of a theater
review/text: I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn.  Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy.  Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet.  Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too).  You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping.  While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl.  Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is $1.66 per pouch, which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!

The hulls are farely tame for big kernels. My only suggestion for Wabash Valley Farms would be to boost the butter flavor just a smidge.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but popcorn popped on the stove top is so much better than microwaved.

review/text: I have ordered this product twice.  The box contains 5 packets inside, and each packet contains the liquid oil, the flavored salt, and the popcorn kernels.  Easy to make and surprisingly good, far better than any microwave popcorn and I have tried many brands.  You can make this in a large cooking pot with a lid.  They suggest you use something called a "Whirly Pop Popper" but its not necessary to buy that.  I have a gas stove, so so I set the heat to medium, pour in just the the oil first, let it heat a few minutes, then I drop in the salt and kernels.  Cover and gently shake a few times during popping and enjoy.  My family agrees this is the real deal.

review/summary: Wellness puppy food
review/text: My boston terrier/english bulldog puppy's coat became shiny on this food, his breath smelled good, his gas wasn't stinky, and the food appears to have excellent ingredients.  However, after over a month of eating Wellness, his stool never became firm (which it was on whatever cheap food he was eating at the breeders). It alternated between runny and mushy. I'd read similar reviews on various websites, but decided to try it anyway (everyone's experiences are different). Although I have no way of knowing this, I wonder if some of the fancier dogfoods overdo it with the flax and greentea---it would certainly give me the runs.  Anyway, I think it's a good food and may work well for some dogs, but we've had to transition off of it to Merrick puppy plate, which, although it has similar ingredients, seems to be firming up the poop.

She had terribly smelly and often very loose stool, including occasional diarrhea which made both of us miserable. She started wanting to go outside to eat grass, so I knew something was wrong in her tummy.<br /><br />I decided to switch dog foods and started doing some research. Looking over ingredients, figuring out the price per day of food for different brands, etc...<br /><br />I found that as far as ingredients, the food appears to be very high quality. More meat, less filler, more quality ingredients. As far as pricing, this food came out to about $1.02 per day, whereas IAMS was only about $0.50 per day. Definitely a big price difference, but hopefully it will prove worth it for my puppy's health. I also looked at Innova puppy which looked comparable and came out to about $0.96 per day.<br /><br />1 DAY: I brought the bag home and even before opening it she showed marked interest in it's contents. I opened up the bag and she started chewing on the cut away strip of bag; it was obvious she loved the taste.<br /><br />**Big point in this 30 pound bag's favor, it is resealable.<br /><br />I mixed a handful into her IAMS and she was much more eager to dig in. For now, this looks promising, though costly. Resealable bag, quality ingredients, puppy likes the taste, twice the cost of IAMS.<br />Based on day 1: 3/5 stars.<br /><br />1 WEEK: She has now worked her way to all Wellness; she hasn't had any diarrhea and her stool and smell seem to have improved. The resealable bag still seals. Based on the apparent improvement in her bowel functions I would rate wellness 4/5 stars.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be even more improvement after she has been on Wellness for a month and away from whatever was making her ill in Iams. I am guessing it may have been a food allergy.<br /><br />1 MONTH: Diarrhea recurred several times, so it didn't turn out to be a miracle cure food. Bag still reseals. Stool/gas smells worlds better than before.<br /><br />What it boils down to is:<br /><br />+Higher Quality Ingredients than most brands<br />+Resealable Bag<br />+Significant Reduction in smell of stool/gas from Iams<br />-Twice the cost of Iams<br /><br />Final Rating<br />4/5<br /><br />Update: I've worked my way through the bag now and I also narrowed down what was causing her loose stool/diarrhea after a particularly bad day. She would refuse to drink water until I offered her my bottled water; she is now on purified water and wellness dog food and her stool has firmed up, not a single day of irregularity since.<br /><br />Oh, and the resealable seal still seals; down to the last kibble.

review/summary: My dog loves Wellness!
review/text: My 5-month-old puppy had lost interest in his Iams Puppy food, so I was on the lookout for a tastier brand of dry puppy food.  I read the reviews of Wellness on Amazon and said, why not, let's try it.  Now we are hooked--Dexter LOVES his Wellness!  He gobbles it all up in one sitting (he used to eat a kibble here and a kibble there with the Iams).  He seems happy and healthy and looks great too (shiny coat!).  He doesn't have any specific health problems (I saw in the reviews that some dog owners tried Wellness to treat allergies and such) but I am hoping Wellness will keep him on the up-and-up.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: I spent a lot of time researching premium puppy foods and settled on Wellness. I wanted a food that didn't contain corn or wheat and other non specific meat products. My 14 week old puppy had no trouble switching to Wellness, in fact she is no longer picking around her dry food like she was on the previous brand I bought. She hasn't been on it long enough for me to have noticed a change in condition or coat, but i'm confident it will. My only complaint is that the so called 're-sealable' bag doesn't actually reseal.

review/summary: Better than average dog food
review/text: I don't know the source of the info posted by one person about Wellness being bought out so cannot determine if it is true or not. But, that said, it is made in the USA and has a good list of ingredients in the top 5. Also rated 4 out of 5 stars by more than one dog food analysis site. It is not like Purina in any way, which in some cases is 1 star, depending on the specific food ingredients. BTW we can buy it for less where we live than price offered by Amazon.

review/summary: Could not get firm stool with Wellness Just for Puppy
review/text: I had my Airedale Terrier puppy on Wellness Super Mix Just for Puppy from about 10 weeks to 14 weeks. During this time I had loose stools to no stools (i.e. the squirts). It was very frustrating. The ingredient list looks great and I was looking forward to feeding this kibble but it did not work out for my puppy. I switched her to my adult dog's kibble out of frustration and suddenly perfect poops. My adult eats Wellness Core orginal. I asked my vet if it would be ok to continue feeding the adult food to the 14 week puppy and she said it was fine.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy a small bag of Wellness Just for Puppy at first and if you don't get good stools then switch to something else immediately - don't wait around like I did. Not every food is going to work for every dog.

review/summary: Dog doesn't like it.
review/text: This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day. That is until we switched to a different dog food (Wellness core). As soon she tried her new food she ate the whole bowl! It's only her third day eating the new stuff and she's already visibly gained weight. It's kinda sad to realize that she's just been forcing herself to eat this food.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because there's nothing wrong with the ingredients that I know of, but make sure your dog is willing to eat this bland food.

review/summary: Good healthy puppy food
review/text: We bought this for our mini schnauzer. She was on a cheaper brand when we got her and was going to the bathroom about 3 times a day. When we switched her to this it cut that back to about once a day. It is much healthier and has less filler product. She seems to like the taste. It also fits well in a kong, so we put that in there with a little peanut butter and she goes nuts for it.

review/summary: My puppy loves it, good for your dog
review/text: Got my 1st puppy 4 weeks ago and wanted to give him the best that I can. After thorough research, many people recommended Wellness. I purchased it at Petco and my puppy loves it. He's pretty food motivated so I do not know whether he will discriminate against any kind of food. It does leave my baby with stinky breath but nothing a breath freshner dental chew can't solve. I will feed my puppy Wellness for the rest of his life, if he continues to like it, which I hope he does.

review/summary: My Puppy likes Purina Better
review/text: My Puppy was on Royal Canin but we switched her to Wellness Pupy b/c I eventually wanted her on Wellness Core but she doesn't seem to like it.  I have to mix the can with it in order for her to eat it.  She was with a dog sitter for a week while we were out of the country and she came back with her food container full.  She seemed more solid, like she'd gained a lot more weight in just a week.  Apparently she ate their dog food and wouldn't touch her more expensive food.  Now that she's home, she's gone back to barely eating it.  I'll try another brand after we finish this bag.  I'm sure the nutrition in it is great  but if I can't get my dog to eat it, what good is it?

review/summary: My Frenchie Loves This Food!
review/text: I've been feeding my French Bulldog puppy Wellness Super5Mix Just for Puppy since I brought my him home with terrific results.<br /><br />Wellness passed the puppy taste test with flying colors and my pup loves dinner time! He happily scarfs-down his entire meal during feedings. The individual pieces are small enough that even at 12 weeks he as able to safely and easily eat this food.<br /><br />Wellness claims that their food is "fit for human consumption" and while I'm not keen on testing that claim the ingredient list is impressive. Real pieces of meat - not byproduct as in cheaper foods. No fillers like corn and wheat which can cause allergies are present at all. Also, Wellness doesn't use any dyes in their puppy food. The food is a nice consistent brown color.<br /><br />My puppy has a nice healthy coat, isn't itchy and best of all he has plenty of energy.<br /><br />Wellness is a bit more expensive, but in my experience it's worth every penny to keep my pup happy & healthy.

review/summary: Loose Poop
review/text: I liked that the ingredients list was full of healthy things and had no corn or fillers. My puppy liked the taste. However, I'm rating this a 2 because while on Wellness, he had the runs. His poop was always super wet and mushy and sometimes it would be all liquid. I've tried the Eukanuba Natural Wild Salmon puppy food and he likes that, it's also healthy without corn or fillers, and his poop is firm and normal.

He is a rescue and I wanted to give him something really healthy and to be honest all the dog food recalls in the past kind of scared me so I did my research and am pretty satisfied as is my dog.

The past two weeks, hoewever have been tough.  After ruling out a possible infection, I determined that the this product was causing diarrhea to my dog.  When reading the nutirent information, this kibble is very rich in protein and fat.  I think my dog is stating to change and the food is no longer agreeing with him.

Thankfully Amazon handled it really well and very quickly refunded my money and I pitched the bag.

review/text: I have a Boston Terrier who has been on this product for quite some time. I tried a bunch of different foods before this, but they all had various problems--and she had a very sensitive stomach. This food works wonderfully for her and I've had no problems with loose stools.<br /><br />One thing to be sure of, if you're transitioning to this food, is to not do it suddenly--that may cause problems with the dog (including diarrhea). My vet advises slowly transitioning over to a new food, blending it in the old, and taking 1-2 weeks before the new food fully replaces the old. Completely changing the food can have a bad effect on some dogs with sensitive stomachs.

review/summary: Pug Puppy and Cat Hate Wellness
review/text: I recently purchased this puppy food at my local feed store. I usually buy another brand called Nature's Recipe: Chicken, Sweet Potato and Pumpkin which is grain free and my pug puppy seems to really like it. However, noone sells it locally and I have to drive an hour away to the bigger city to get it. After running out of my puppy's fave food and not wanting to make a long drive, I settled on this puppy food by Wellness. As soon as I poured it in her bowl, she took one sniff, backed away and then looked up at me with her funny little pug expressive face. To be honest, even though it is dry food, the appearance was very unappealing. I thought I'd give it a day because after all Wellness is not only a very expensive food, but is a highly rated brand. For that one day, her bowl remained untouched and my little puggie was constantly begging for our food during our meal times. Needless to say, I made the one hour drive to replenish her favorite food.<br /><br />I had the exact same experience with my cat as well. I ordered a huge bag of highly rated Wellness cat food some time ago and after reading all those reviews about how other people's cats just go crazy about the stuff I thought for sure my cat would like it. One day my cat walked to her bowl, looked up at me, back down at her food and hissed at it. I got the message. She hated Wellness. I'll never buy it again.

review/text: My puppies were on Nutri Source which is also a nice food but I wanted something I could get more easily. The first pup I transitioned over to Iams but he tired of it quickly. The positive reviews on Wellness prompted me to try it and I'm very glad I did. He gobbled it down, first bowl. The second pup had a bout of diarrhea, even with me mixing the old and new food together to get her used to it. I'm not sure if the food was the cause as my other dog also had the runs at the same time, but they're doing well now and enjoying their Wellness diet. I love that Amazon has this on prime delivery. I've also switched my cat over to Wellness but he never tells me anything so I'll assume it's acceptable for him.  :)

review/text: Previously, I fed my collie puppy with Purina Pro Plan, but after suggestions from friends who also own dogs, I decided to try out Wellness. The most distinct difference is that this food doesn't smell, the texture and the size is more suitable for a puppy to thoroughly chew before swallowing, and my dog likes it better than Purina. Also, the puppy's feces no longer smell and it makes much less of a chore to clean up her mess. It's been 2 months since the change, and my puppy is doing very well.

review/summary: Will Not Feed My Puppy Anything Else
review/text: After adopting our lab/boxer mix, Nero, we quickly found out that he was very particular about what he ate.  We tried everything, but still he wouldn't eat.  We went for a couple of weeks like this.  We started worrying and even took him to the shelter/vet and asked what we should do.  They only said, "don't worry, he will ear eventually."  We tried everything from Eukanuba, to Science diet, you name it we probably tried it.  We ended up with a cupboard full of bags that had less than a cup of food taken out of each.  He eventually started eating a little, I guess just enough to have something in his stomach, but not nearly the amount he should be eating.  It was pretty stressfull, as this was our first time actually owning a dog.  It got to the point where we'd walk him, and people would comment about how skinny he was.  Sad, I know.<br /><br />Finally someone recommended we try Wellness.  Now, I will say that we were a little hesitant at first, because it was a bit on the pricey side.  And we really didn't know that much about pet food.  We figured, you know, he's a dog, so long as he's not eating table scraps, it shouldn't matter that much (read: we were very ignorant).  Boy were we wrong, and since then, we've come a long way.  After checking out the Wellness site and really doing some research, we decided that it was worth it.  So we bought a little bag to, you know, try it out.  Just in case Nero didn't like it.  To our surprise, he loved the stuff!  Scarfed it down like I've never seen him do before.  My boyfriend and I both stood there silently while we watched him eat a whole bowl of food for the first time.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that we went online and bought a whole 30-pound bag.  I love that my dog loves this stuff, and I love that it's also good for him.  I mean, this stuff is human-grade.  HUMAN GRADE!<br /><br />People are also always commenting on how good our dog looks, how shiny his coat is.  It's definitely noticeable that he's eating well.  We saw his sibling who, sadly, is still in the shelter, and you can tell the difference between the two dogs, just by looking at their coat, and I know it's because of Wellness.<br /><br />And because of that, I will NEVER feed my dog anything else. Ever!

review/text: I was given Iams by the breeder when I purchased my 12 week old male Maltese puppy. After reading ingredients I wanted to do a change over to the Wellness and he loves it ! I had a lttle bit of the Iams left over so I mix what is left to the Wellness. He eats the Wellness first every time. I chose the better food for him and smart puppy chooses it also (: Happy !

review/summary: Gave my English Bully Bloody Diarrhea!!!
review/text: I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands. After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made. My little bully's stool was never firm. It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day. I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy. The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life. Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food. I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case. I started the "at home remedy" of pepto bismol and a bland diet. The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well. BJ fasted for 24 hours. After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!! This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!

review/summary: gave my puppy the runs
review/text: My puppy liked the taste of the food, but he had the runs the entire time I fed him Wellness. Never had it before this brand, and as soon as I switched to a different brand, he was fine again. Would not recommend.
