review/text: I have not been able to find ribbon candy in the stores for a while now.  After seeing this being made on a TV show I ordered it immediately and it arrived at my daughters in 3 days in time for Christmas.  It was better than expected.  Very colorful and very thin.  A Christmas treat from the past.

review/summary: A Christmas tradition
review/text: One of my friends asks me for this every Christmas, and I usually have to search for it.  It is available from various sources on the Web, but hard to find in stores.  Be aware that all ribbon candy is not the same.  This brand of thin ribbon candy (Sevigny's) comes in 7 ounce and 9 ounce boxes.  There is a warning on the box that it is fragile, and the company will not guarantee it against breakage - a possible reason that stores will not carry it.  There is a range of prices, depending on the supplier.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: False advertising on the box. I bought a 7 oz. box showing off a gorgeous picture of beautiful holiday striped candy. I opened the box to find five pieces of plain ALL ONE COLOR ribbons of candy: Yellow, green, white, orange, pink, and. and one single piece was orange and white. Plain boring Lollypop flavors. Plus the orange solid and the orange with a white stripe were exactly the same orange flavor.<br /><br />Where were the gorgeous waves of mixed bright holiday colored ribbons as the photo on the box shows off? This is not what I expect when I spend money on ribbon candy. This company pretty much has had the market cornered for years, and years ago used to put out a good product of beautiful candy. Like everything else these days, it's been dumbed down to plain and boring. The only thing that looked like Christmas candy, was the ribbon shape.<br /><br />When I was a kid I remember my mother buying ribbon candy and they looked like the box photo and had rich flavors like the above, but also spicy flavors of wintergreen, peppermint, and anise and hot cinnamon. The current boring lemon, lime, orange, weak cinnamon, and an indistinguishable flavor in white ribbon, are not worth the money. Buy a cheap bag of suckers and save your money.<br /><br />If they still make other flavors they should package 12 shorter ribbons of mixed variety instead of 6 longer ribbons of common lollypop flavors.

Ribbon candy brings back memories of wonderful holidays of the past.

review/summary: Nostalgia
review/text: I usually find Sevigny's Ribbon Candy at Walmart around Christmas time. My Nana always had Ribbon Candy when I was a child. It was so pretty and I was always excited to have a piece. It always tasted like Wintergreen and to this day, I hate the flavor of Wintergreen probably because of that candy. I bought it out of nostalgia and I'm glad that I did. Very few of the pieces were broken but I don't mind that as I usually break the pieces up to fit them into an apothecary jar for decoration. There are other flavors now like lemon, lime and orange which I prefer. Of course, after a while being mixed together in the apothecary jar, all the ribbons tend to take on the wintergreen flavor. I mostly use it for decoration though so I don't mind. My teenagers and their friends grabbed a few pieces one day and were kinda disappointed at the wintergreen flavor also. I said welcome to the club. It's for decoration.

review/summary: looks good, tastes meh
review/text: They had this for $2.29 at CVS (which used to be SavOns). It seemed like a Christmasy thing so I bought it. There are six big pieces inside. One of them was broken in half, but I didn't mind. The candy looks pretty and it tastes so-so. It's not one of my favorite kinds of candy, but I bought it to celebrate Christmas. I think I haven't had ribbon candy in many years. I don't remember seeing it around until today at CVS. I think they should use better tasting flavors in this candy. They're really not very good flavors. A couple of pieces were licorice, which I don't like, and one piece was spearmint, which I really hate. I hate anything that is spearmint flavored. There are many much better flavors that they could have used. They really should improve their product.

review/summary: Monin banana tastes like real banana, compared to the others
review/text: Hello -<br /><br />I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I wanted to offer my viewpoint on this in the hopes that you'll pick Monin over the other banana coffee syrups.<br /><br />During a biannual visit to a cafe in Portland, Maine (Breaking New Grounds on 11 Essex) I tried an interesting concoction: a mocha with banana. I really thought it was incredible; heck, caffeine, chocolate, and banana? I had two.<br /><br />Then, I drove back home near Boston and decided to order mocha with two shots of banana at the local coffee shops.  Unfortunately, Starbucks doesn't have banana, nor does a local hip cafe (The Diesel).  I tried my old favorite, 1369, but their syrup brand tasted like fake bananas. Something similar to those chewy "Now n' Later" candies.<br /><br />My wife read up on some syrups, and surprised me with a large bottle of Monin banana for XMas.<br /><br />It's really good! It tastes like real banana, and I'd bet it actually is, in some really concentrated gourmet form.<br /><br />Now I'm the guy who totes a big bottle of the stuff into Starbucks now and then, shares some with the dudes behind the counter, and I'm good to go.<br /><br />Try Monin!<br /><br />-g

review/text: These snails are the best quality I have ever tasted outside of a restaurant and from a can and at a much better price than I have seen them for elsewhere. They are a higher price than other canned escargot but their smoothness and flavor are worth it, especially if escargot are a special treat for you. I have never found grit or parts of shell in them either.<br /><br />These do not have to be stuffed into shells, I simply put them in a small oven proof bowl, after rinsing well and shaking the water off in a colander - with chives, garlic bits, a tiny bit of garlic salt and place pats of butter on top, pop them into a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes and they are ready.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: Tastes ok, good for ya!
review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/summary: No taste or flavor
review/text: I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.

review/summary: tasty Maybe beneficial
review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

review/summary: Menopause Relief
review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

review/summary: A must have if you have painful heavy periods
review/text: I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.
