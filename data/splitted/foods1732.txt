review/summary: Lame
review/text: I was very disappointed with this product. It doesn't have a blinking light or clicking noise to let you know it's working. After much effort, we found out that the product didn't even work. I may have just gotten a defective one, but I was still disappointed that it lacked a way to tell you if it was on.

review/summary: It works
review/text: It took us some time to figure things out. Once you rig it up right,it works great.  We used two wires, one chest hight for deer and one lower for the brave Bambi that was getting through. Not only does it keep the deer out, but the raccoons, squirrels and kept the dog from peeing on the tree by my hammock. Now there is peace in our land!  Next year maybe there will be some tomatoes.<br />LD

review/summary: The only solution
review/text: I have several dogs, but only one in particular who has always been the escape artist, whether jumping, digging, or squeezing through posts.  Since the day we got him this dog was escaping almost daily.  Concrete under the fence, taller fences, nothing could keep him in the yard.  Fearing for his life because I have trigger-happy neighbors, I bought this and strung it along the perimeter, about a foot from the fence.  Since installing this 2 years ago, the dog has not escaped even ONCE.  It delivers a strong enough shock to create a strong aversion, but not enough to cause injury by just touching it.<br /><br />WARNING: It is a CONTINUOUS SHOCK, so if you have pets that are small, stupid (cats), or old and feeble, do not leave them with this wire unsupervised, because it can KILL them if they get stuck on it.  I have occasionally discovered a dead bird or squirrel on mine.  If you have pets like this, I would suggest turning the wire off when you can't supervise (I've been able to turn mine off for months at a time without the dogs testing it again), or buy the intermittent version instead.<br /><br />This thing really serves its purpose well, and I always recommend it to anyone having trouble containing their dogs.

review/summary: Be wary using this fence charger around small animals
review/text: I bought one of these to use in a small pen to train piglets to electric fence before putting them out to pasture. Since they had never been in an electric fence before I had to put ElectroNet woven fence up to keep them from charging through it the first couple of times they got shocked. Well, they got tangled in the fencing and unfortunately it killed both of my 7 week old registered Tamworth piglets before I even got their registration papers sent out. I only had them here for a day. Now I am out $600 and have to find a charger with an intermittent charge so I don't kill the next 2 piglets I buy. Not only that but I'll have to drive over 10 hours to buy more piglets if I buy from the same breeder...

review/text: 5 strands of a couple hundred feet worked through the rain, an ice storm, etc.  Really got it to protect chickens from neighborhood cayotes and dogs which broke through the strand and haven't seen it since.  BUT the fence will ELECTROCUTE, did zap some growing Rooster (even though I had explicitly told him to stay away), at least I can find them now though, instead of disappearing, but you probably want a lower amp fence, it's not everytime as I've seen them fly through it, and only been the last couple of days that they got fried. Fence has been up over a month.

review/summary: Irresistable!
review/text: As soon as I saw the box I went, WOAH that's small, but it was densely packed and very misleading. Each caramel was so rich, buttery and smooth. Simply delectable! That wasn't the only thing though, the amazing unique taste of the Fleur de sel was tantalizing and made my entire mouth salivate to capture each and every changing flavor of this wonderfully surprising caramel. To call this a "candy" would be an understatement and a shame. I will ever eat another caramel and forever compare it to this product, and I'm sure it will fall short.<br /><br />I purchased the Lavender (spelled incorrectly on Amazon as Laveneder) and the subtle honey lavender made for warm tingly sensations. I felt that these caramels were not too sweet as they were offset by the salt hints. Will definitely buy again, and they included samples! How wonderful! (My toddler had the first piece out of the box, and I have never seen him enjoy something so much with all the lipsmacking sounds he made!)

review/summary: Sandy texture
review/text: Looking at the other reviews, I have to wonder if the the box I bought was a dud.  However, it's the only one I have ever (or will ever) buy, so I'll have to judge it off of this box.<br /><br />The texture of these caramels was extremely sandy. The first flavor that hits you is salt, followed by a slightly sour taste akin to condensed milk, finished off by an overwhelming sweetness.  Not once did I enjoy the creamy mouthfeel or the complex flavor I associate with a good caramel.<br /><br />For the price they charge, I expect delicate, balanced flavors with proper texture. My box tasted like the caramels crystallized during the cooking process, ending up more like a praline than a caramel.  I would have been better off buying a bag of Werthers.

review/summary: Strange Flavor, Bitter Residue
review/text: This soup had a strange, gritty texture in my mouth, like when you get a mouthful of sea water, and it left an unappetizing residue at the bottom of the bowl.  It also came out darker than most mulligatawny I've had in the past, with a bitter ingredient I didn't recognize, a flavor that lingered in my mouth, and not in a good way.  I can't say I hated this soup, it was palatable, but I won't go out and pick up another pack any time soon.

review/summary: Delicious, authentic, and filling
review/text: The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  Their version of mulligatawny is quite good and I have had worse in restaurants.  The yellow lentils make it a little more filling than some of the other varieties.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I make it as directed but add a finely diced apple or carrot to the pot.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tamarind, toor dal (yellow lentils), onion, salt, ghee (clarified butter), coriander, sugar, mint leaves, curry leaves, pepper, and spices.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains ghee.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup, which would be a little over half a cup per serving, which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 60<br />Calories from fat 15<br />Total fat 1.5 g<br />Saturated fat 1g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol less than 10mg<br />Sodium 800mg<br />Total carbohydrate 10g<br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars less than 1g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 6%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4g of sodium.

review/text: I bought these to be given on the car ride to school as a breakfast snack for my 2 and 4 year-old. We've tried other Earth's Best cereal bars and the kids have always liked them. However, these are really bad tasting. Overpowering vanilla flavor and SUPER sweet! My 2 year-old son is a vacuum cleaner, so he seemed to like them. But my 4 year year-old daughter thought they were "gross". I would recommend the fruit bars instead of these (they are not that messy either).

The generation before these has a single flavor that literally made me retch. The fish flavored jelly beans are SO AWFUL that you will gag.<br /><br />You will.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, only have a few really awful ones.

review/summary: The flavours are not lies!
review/text: These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

review/summary: NOTICE HOW small THE BOX IS!!!
review/text: I didn't pay attention when I ordered these jelly beans, and was shocked at how small the box really is.  Only 1.2 ounces.  I paid WAY too much for them, but I hope my daughter, who is a Harry Potter nut, will enjoy them.  Currently, Amazon has 2 boxes of these available for a better price than 1.

review/summary: EXTREMELY SMALL BOXES! VERY DISAPPOINTING
review/text: Just received these two boxes which I purchased to go in my son's stocking for Christmas, but the boxes are so small, I regret ordering them, especially for $10! BE WARE! These boxes are about the size of a cigarette lighter. (I bought a box of these years ago and they were a regular size candy box, so i had expected these to be about the same size.)

review/text: A few human flavors mixed with some amazingly gross and disgusting flavors.  Im not going to tell you about them, find out yourself.<br /><br />I tell you though,  HOW Bertie figures out how to make them taste so realistic is scary.  My kids and I had a great deal of fun with these.<br />(actually the fun is not over.  Mama doesnt know the nasty beans have been mixed in her regular beans, and she never reads reviews  hehheh)<br /><br />Easily worth the 4.50 I paid for the 2 pack

review/text: My son loves the Harry Potter books and movies so he had to have these as soon as he knew they were available. The box was very small and had only about 15 beans in it. There were several duplicates so he did not get one of each flavored, which was a bummer. I also think the price and shipping cost is outrageous for the size.

This is just what Bertie Botts supposed to be. But don't try it if you are NOT OK with awful flavors.I took a VOMIT one thinking it was cinnamon...and blueberry flavor tastes like dishwasher. I give it a five star because it is perfectly awful, but don't buy it if you haven't decided how much you can take...just don't!

These are Jelly Belly jelly beans with flavors like vomit, soap, ear wax, booger, etc.  My son swears a bubble came out of his mouth after eating the soap flavor and drinking water.<br />Great for all Harry Potter fans that enjoy a good laugh.

review/summary: Bertie Botts' Beans
review/text: I was told in a previous review that these beans were not good. They were right! Some were awful, and my kids enjoyed every miniute! During a Harry Potter themed birthday, we had an "every flavoured bean tasting" The dirt and grass were pretty realistic, but the vomit was a bit coconutty in taste. (Hmmm. Makes me wonder.) Anyway, they were not all meant to be delecious, yet some were (think, Tutti-Fruity) I would def give them a go again should we have the urge.

review/text: When Harry Potter first made its debut we had bought a bag of the Harry Potter Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans for our children. Yes, they were perfectly disgusting... as they should be... and the kids loved trying to get people to eat vomit and rotten egg flavored jelly beans. Now we are at the end of the Harry Potter era and we purchased these for Christmas stockings. Still just as disgusting but who knew how SMALL each box was. 1.2 oz per box seemed acceptable but for $9 plus shipping????? At most they should have cost .50 to $1 per box. We won't be making that mistake again!

review/text: Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!

review/summary: The cats certainly like it
review/text: I've got 4 cats and every one of them likes this food, which makes things much simpler than when we were buying several different brands/flavors. Like most cat food, this food has pretty much everything they need, but it seems to be gentler on them than others we've tried - while there's still the occasional throwing up (they are, after all, cats), it seems reduced with this food over what we'd tried before, which was pretty much everything from Eukanuba to Meow Mix. Additionally, these size bags are pretty much the perfect size for our group - large enough that I can just drop a whole bag into the feeder and not worry about it for a number of days, but small enough that it doesn't go stale before they've finished it.<br /><br />The only negative here is that Amazon doesn't always seem to be able to keep it in stock. Several times, I've needed to order it and they've been out of stock and I've had to go to local sources for it. I do wish Amazon (or their supplier) would get their act together here. Also, I wish this fell under the "subscribe and save" program, especially since it's something that gets used up on a very regular basis.

review/text: A wonderful lady in my old neighborhood made sure our family was always stocked with her homemade pomegranate jelly. Growing up, I rarely ate any other type of jelly. Since moving away decades ago, I have searched store shelves and farmers markets for an adequate replacement to my neighbor's jelly with unsatisfactory results. That is, until I tried Skylake Ranch's pomegranate fruit spread. It has the perfect sweet/tart balance and smooth texture that works perfectly on toast and in recipes. Even my toddler loves it on his PB&J's! I have stopped searching because I have found (sorry, neighbor!) the best pomegranate jelly, and it's made by Skylake Ranch.

review/summary: my go to alternative to coffee
review/text: Being a student, I am constantly searching for something that is going to keep me awake and alert throughout the day and even the night. Coffee and 5 hour energy definitely does the trick but I hate feeling jittery, all to crash at the end of the day.<br /><br />My grandpa actually gave me some Puerh cause he was trying to cut back on coffee and said it might help. I have never been a big coffee drinker so the flavor was a bit intense at first but i've grown to like it.<br /><br />What I like most is it keeps me energized throughout the day but I'm not shaking and spazzing out like I would be after taking shots of energy.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for something not as intense as an energy drink or coffee but still needs something to keep them awake or alert.

review/text: My wife bought this tea at our local grocery store (Wegmans). I've never been a fan of tea at all...more of a coffee person. She got me to try the Numi Emporer's Puerh. I love it. It's got a slightly malty and earthy flavor. I also pick up a scent of hay or straw when I smell it, but not a flavor of it. There's no real after taste which is probably a good thing. Good stuff.

review/summary: The real deal
review/text: I first tried Puerh tea 5 years ago and ever since was willing pay for the luxurious experience.<br />It's hard to describe like trying to explain what a truffle tastes like.<br />Very earthy and savory .<br /><br />I am exited I found this Numi brand it is difficult to get that whole leaf taste and this tea bag tastes like<br />it was prepared with the whole leaves and from a very good quality . I was expecting it to be somewhat of a knock off or similar to an Oolong but this is the real deal and I do not have to go through all the fuss to prepare it without the tea bag now.<br /><br />Puerh Tea tastes better when the leaves or Tea bag is reused up to 5 times. Just make sure the bag dries completely. This is the way the Tea connoisseurs recommend drinking it. I personally use my leaves or tea bags 4 times with this type.<br /><br />I love this and will repurchase again.

review/summary: A truly bizarre tea experience
review/text: While I originally purchased this product knowing it was not a typical black tea, I was struck by just how odd the flavor of the brewed tea is to my palate.  Far from the relatively straightforward nuances of an English breakfast black tea, the 500 year process resulting in this tea engenders some flavors I am still unable to identify.  My first impression is that of an oyster-like scent, though upon drinking it this tea is still quite tasty and has no unpleasant aftertaste.  I would recommend this tea only to adventurous tea connoisseurs who are ready for a departure from your typical black tea, and are prepared to sample a range of flavors that is truly more Chinese than Western in it's composition.

review/summary: Current Favorite Among Energy-Lift ("Upper") Designer Teas
review/text: The search for caffeine alternatives takes on new meaning in this elegant, rich, and satisfying blend.  Although Numi's "Puerh" is a black tea, and does have some caffeine - in smoothness of buzz and taste it's way above Tazo's "Awake" - though the buzz does not last as long - maybe five hours per cup at the outside. I also rate it above Bija's "Yerba Mate" - a golden tea, the best over-the-counter, commercial Yerba Mate I've found, again on the basis of body and taste.  There is a bit of Amazon Rainforest's "Shipo Treasure Tea" texture to the drink - sans the "muddiness", and it seems to provide as much energy boost at about half the price.

review/summary: Rich & Satisfying
review/text: Although a fan of citrus tinged (Earl Grey & Lady Grey) teas, I must say that Numi's "Emporer's Puerh" is quite unlike any other black tea I've tried.  A malty flavor and dark black color (as dark as coffee) are at once noticeable.  It lacks the aftertaste found in a traditional breakfast blend, of which I am not particularly fond.  This tea is a nice change of pace from Earl Grey and for any tea afficiando is definitely not to be missed for its unique flavor and color.

review/summary: The most delicious tea on the market!
review/text: I love Emperor's Puerh. I stopped drinking coffee about 1 year ago and this is the richest tea I have ever had. It is delicious and has full flavor but is not bitter or acidic like many black teas (e.g. Earl Grey or English Breakfast). It also is very easy to digest.  Uniquely, you can leave the tea bag in the cup or pot and it gets stronger but never bitter. I can't say enough about it. I also can't buy it fast enough. My fianc&eacute; (a coffee-aholic) even loves it. There is nothing else on the market like it.

review/text: I was recently introduced to Puerh tea by a friend of mine who shared it with me in the form of a tea brick - it had an incredibly bold taste and was so dark it looked like black coffee. When I purchased this Numi tea I was hoping for the same boldness of the Puerh tea that I had in brick form - unfortunately - even with two teabags in a mug - the flavor wasn't nearly as strong as I was expecting.<br /><br />It's not bad for the price though.

review/summary: Numi Organic Tea Emperor's Puerh, Full Leaf Black Tea, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 2)
review/text: I have been drinking Numi Organic Tea Emperor's Puerh since 3/2012.  I did see it on Dr. OZ show and that is why I started drinking it initially.  I love this tea!  I am a tea drinker to begin with so if I find a good tasting organic tea at a good price I will continue to drink it.  It does have caffeine in it so if you are not a caffeine lover it wouldn't be for you.  I normally drink 2 - 4 shots of espresso every morning.  It has gotten to the point where all I want to drink is 1 tea bag of Numi Organic Tea!  It tastes good and has enough caffeine to give me the boost in the morning that I need.  It's also supposed to get rid of fat cells that are hanging around waiting to be filled again!  I can't make any claims about that.  I have lost a good amount of weight and have not gained any of it back.  So maybe my fat cells are going away when the fat leaves!  Whatever you are looking for, a good tasting tea, the claim that was seen on the OZ show, this tea is very special and I think you will enjoy it!

I'm not a coffee drink, usually. However, I have recently taken up the habit.<br />This coffee is the second best coffee I have ever tasted-- next to Panera's. When I got home, I immediately got online, and ordered this coffee from the Wolfgangpuck.com website. I make this coffee in a "Black and Decker DDCM200 Dual Personal Coffeemaker, black and stainless." This coffeemaker has two black and stainless steel travel mugs. I buy the coffee in the "Pod" form, and it tastes just fine.
