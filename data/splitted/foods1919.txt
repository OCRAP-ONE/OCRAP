review/summary: A Sensational Dark Roast
review/text: The Maxwell House Cafe Collection French Roast is a sensational dark roast! The taste is pure amazing! It tastes just like a Starbuck's coffee without the Starbuck price. I bought 32 servings for only ten bucks! It was like a buy one get one free deal! I love major deals and this coffee was so worth it. I'm evewn buying it at the regular price of ten dollars for 16 servings that is how good this coffee truely is.

review/text: This is my absolute favorite coffee and all I ever purchase for my Tassimo Coffeemaker, which I also purchased at Amazon.  In fact, now that I can make a fresh cup of coffee every time I want some I find I enjoy the coffee a lot more throughout the day.  If you like a dark, bold coffee this one is for you.<br /><br />I'm always amazed at how quickly I receive the order once I place it.  The only drawback is that it is a little less expensive at Meijer.  While I appreciate the convenience of the delivery I will be watching and comparing prices to see if it willo become more beneficial for me to buy it at the store.

review/summary: Maxwell House wins again!!
review/text: I am giving this product 4 1/2 stars because I can't give it a perfect 5.  The Starbucks brand is a lil stronger and taste a lil better but most will not be able to tell the difference, but for half the price, this is a no brainer for me.  I like the Maxwell House better than Gevalia brand also.  This is a good medium roast, not too strong but still has the caffeine kick needed to get me through the morning.

review/text: French roast Max coffee is good - not as bitter as Starbucks K or V - I sometimes add an espresso disk to the same cup.  Still love the Tassimo Machine, too bad Amazon's prices are so high for the discs except for this particular one.

review/summary: Good, but not great.
review/text: The selections of coffee for Tassimo are quite limited. I first tried the Maxwell House French Roast and found it okay, but nothing special to write home about. It is a bit stong and slightly burnt, which is not to say bad, but requires a bit of getting used to. I guess that the old saying 'you get what you pay for' is true. Maxwell House is Maxwell House whether in a can or T-Disc. Do not expect anything more. As an aside, I now am buyin Starbucks Verona T-Discs as well as Gevalia Signature. They are both a bit pricey, but taste wonderful. The extra expense is quite well worth it for the extra quality and flavor.

review/text: This is the worst product I've tried yet for my Tassimo: it uses the small size disk to produce a 'full' [by Tassimo standards] cup of coffee. If you could burn water, this is what it would taste like: the smell and flavor of ashes, with no real taste of coffee at all.<br /><br />If you are looking for a REALLY bold, flavorful coffee with no burnt taste, go for the Starbucks Kitamu instead. It uses the larger disks for the same amount of water, definetly worth the extra money.

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/text: don't be fooled and misled by believing these chips are "healthier" or "better for you". Same fat grams and calorie content...but what is worse, is that they taste stale, not enough nacho flavor and are so hard!

review/summary: Deceptive packaging-it does have GMO ingredients
review/text: Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting " no genetically engineered ingredients" on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back.  Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'd<br />rather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/summary: If you want fiber, don't buy!
review/text: I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!

review/text: I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these.

The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom.  I kept thinking that it was "just that one bag..." but it was all of them.  I had eaten too many of them to send them back.  Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!

The Amazon vendor was no longer shipping so they were not replaced. I thought I was out the cost of a case of corn chips and still hungry.<br />  But...........<br />Upon hearing my concern, Amazon found a vendor and sent a new shipment at their cost next day. Those chips are absolutely perfect! Amazon's responsiveness, service and customer care is exceptional!

review/text: I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.

review/summary: Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.
review/text: I have noooo idea what the "blech" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.

review/text: Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

review/text: I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.

review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

review/text: I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

review/text: Be warned that these chips have NO SALT.  That is what I want, so that I can taste the interesting flavor of this unique variety of corn, unadulterated by unhealthful sodium.  The blue color is not a artificial chemical coloring, but healthful anthocyanins.  This corn is a great source of these compounds, which have been demonstrated to have immense and healthful benefits.  Highly recommended, especially for corn lovers!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]

review/summary: Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher Parve. Made with organic yellow corn; canola, safflower, or sunflower oils [all organic and/or conventional]; and sea salt. Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/summary: Great Flavour - Excellent Find!
review/text: I've been hunting for snacks which taste good, but don't have BHA,BHT,EDTA,hydrogenated (partially or otherwise) fats, artificial colors and a myriad of other ingredients which are known to be "bad" yet they are still allowed in food production.  I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these.  My children one which likes spicy and one which doesn't (third is too young for this kind of food) love these.  They are great straight out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or bowl of chili.<br /><br />I initially found these in our local PCC and Whole Foods.  I'm glad Amazon carries them.  Price wise I'm saving at least $1.00/bag by buying through Amazon instead of from my grocery.

The blue corn version is equally good if not better! If you think the guiltless one's are good,these will leave you speechless. There is NO comparison. The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy.

review/summary: Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.
review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: Garden of Eatin' Tortilla Chips, Blue, No Salt Added, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)
review/text: This is a good product, BUT, buy the larger bags.  They are the better value.  These are excellent for anyone who must limit their salt intake.

review/summary: Healthy tortilla chips
review/text: Chances are you will be dipping them into something savory enough. The very low sodium content makes this the perfect chip for the healthy conscious. They are not always 2/$4 @ the grocery store, so I thought this large box of 12 was reasonable.

review/summary: Our favorite chips
review/text: These chips are the whole family's favorite. They are just the right size to share, but not so big that they go stale before they are gone. Not greasy - very crispy. What more can be said about tortilla chips?
