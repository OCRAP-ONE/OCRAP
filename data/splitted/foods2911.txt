review/summary: The best thing for cat's teeth
review/text: Although it may seem just a tad precious, our vet recommended this for a young cat who doesn't brush.  He has clean teeth, fresh breath, and I hope will have all his teeth all his life.  Plus, both he and his girl friend love the taste!

review/summary: Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard
review/text: I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I "transitioned" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of "transitioning" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.

review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo.

review/summary: Excellent for good health of cat
review/text: After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.

review/summary: Good Food
review/text: Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him "Friskies" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!

review/text: Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that "stuff" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.

Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.

I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to "improve" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is.

There are 2 otherss.  1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great.  the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive.  I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best.

He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.

review/summary: Bought this for the Fiber
review/text: Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...

review/summary: My kitty LOVES it.
review/text: The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/text: I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.

SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.

review/summary: Excellent cat food
review/text: My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a healthy pet, you should do a combination of dry and wet food.<br /><br />The critics have unrealistic nutritional expectations if they are only feeding their animal dry food.

review/summary: Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!
review/text: I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!

review/summary: Close call!
review/text: I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.  The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!

review/text: No seriously, this is ridiculous, $45 for a bag of corn for obligate carnivores? brewers rice, corn gluten meal? wheres the meat?<br />Not to mention unnamed animal fat which could be anything including roadkill and euthanized shelter animals. There are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/text: I've ordered this product twice, and I was pleased both times.<br /><br />It comes in a sealed plastic container, wrapped in the green plastic typical of Amazon food orders. The sour strips are soft and fresh. There's no particular flavor to them - just sweet chewy strips covered in sour crystals.<br /><br />The only downsides to the product are common to all sour strips in general: they leave citric acid crystals everywhere, they get hard if left out in the open, and they can cause mouth or stomach pain. Be careful, eat in moderation, and you'll enjoy these for a long time!

review/text: I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

review/summary: Not a Gluten Free Product
review/text: I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.

One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten.

review/text: My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.

review/summary: Great for those on a limited diet
review/text: My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat, egg and milk.  I was so upset when I found out but a little relieved as I started finding foods he can eat.  Yes, they are crumbly but they taste good, my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions.  Since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies I don't mind some crumbs!

review/summary: Just Terrible.
review/text: We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.<br /><br />(I won't throw the box away.  I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)

review/summary: Makes a nice gluten-free strawberry shortcake.
review/text: Nana's cookies are good eaten plain.  They are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour.<br /><br />The cookies are individually packaged.  I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact.

review/summary: Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)

review/text: My 2 year old eats the Chocolate Munch Cookie and LOVES them. I bought them not because they were gluten free, but because they are sweetener free. He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone. I have found that with the subscribe and save discount I can get the boxes cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sunflower, Sprouts and Whole Foods.

review/summary: Disappointed in texture
review/text: It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...<br />As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the "crunch", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full.

review/text: I tried the Nana's Bananas cookie bars for the first time this week. I love them! I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon!

That doesn't bother me.  I have been gluten-free for five years and have tried near everything.  Nana's has become part of my weekly grocery list.  They are easy to take on the go.  I think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go.  It can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten-free to be found.

They are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie.  I do not personally like the texture, but the chocolate flavor is good.  I will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies, but not someone who can have regular cookies.

When I order a case of these I always think, "man that is a lot of cookie bars!  I am probably not going to be able to finish them all."  Probably being the operative word.  Well low and behold (with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more.  If you are adding more whole wheat to your diet, these work.  If you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet, these work.  If you order them and don't like them: you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult!  They are fabulous!  To eat them is to love them.

They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!

review/summary: Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!
review/text: I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.

The taste of these bars is very banana-y<br />but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!<br /><br />PS<br />If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!

review/summary: My kids LOVE them
review/text: When I found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs, it was quite an adjustment.  Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most "treats".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love).

review/summary: NOT GLUTEN FREE!
review/text: After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.

review/summary: Ingredients are not up to date!
review/text: In the past I have purchased these cookie bars through Amazon and have had good business. However, Amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars. It is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods I purchase. I am not happy with Amazon's business this time. Ingredients change often! Amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website.

review/summary: Love Finn Crisps, but this item is false advertising
review/text: Don't be fooled by the picture!<br /><br />The picture is of the 7oz package, but what is actually shipped is the 3.5 oz package.<br /><br />Yes, the title says 3.5oz, but the picture is misleading.<br /><br />18 3.5 oz packages for ~$30 equates to 9 7 oz packages, or more than $3/7oz; that's not a very good deal at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Otherwise - shipped quickly, and Finn Crisps are definitely a good product.

review/summary: DELICIOUS
review/text: These are ABSOLUTELY delicious. They are very crunchy and tasty. This is also my favorite flavor. I used to buy them from a store. They retail for $3 per box or so. These end up costing about $1.30 per pack. I was very excited about the deal. However, they turned out to be a smaller size packs than what they sell at store individually.<br /><br />I am not so sure if it is such a good deal after all. However, the product itself is ABSOLUTELY delicious. I use them as snacks. Buy them here or at your store. Highly recommended.

review/summary: i'm told it's very tasty...
review/text: My sweet Golden Retriever is a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.  His appetite is pretty poor right now.  He's abandoned his premium dry food that he's eaten all of his life and was eating some canned varieties, but I wanted to find a dry food that he could also tolerate.  I found this food and figured that he might find it more appealing, considering the ingredients.  I am relieved to find that he likes the food a great deal.  After a week or so on this food, I offered him some of his former brand of dry food and he still wanted nothing to do with it, so I'm satisfied that he really is fond of this food and will continue with it as long as he's still around.<br /><br />I'm giving him small portions in the morning and evening and then some canned food at lunch and it's worked for him so far.  I am grateful I no longer have to beg him to eat!<br /><br />I do recommend researching this and other foods before deciding what is right for your dog.

review/summary: My Pug Puppy's Favorite
review/text: My six month old pug will not eat any other dog food I've introduced--not even a different blend of Nature's Recipe(Farmstand Selects: Turkey with Real Fruit and Vegetables). I've given her Wellness, Canidae, Taste of the Wild--the latter two she tolerated, but she absolutely refused to eat the Wellness. However, she loves this particular Nature's Recipe formula so much so that I finally bought a huge bag of it at Petco because she was going through the smaller bags rather quickly. That's when I threw in a small bag of a different above mentioned Nature's Recipe Formula with the larger bag of her fave. She won't even touch the smaller bag. (The nice thing is I can return the smaller bag at Petco and get a full refund. That's Petco's policy for opened bags of pet food your pets don't like.) This formula that my puggy loves drastically reduces her smelly gas and that's great because for a tiny thing she can clear out an entire room! I still like to experiment with her food because I want to know that there's something else she likes should she get bored with this one, but so far this one has the winning formula!

Don't get me wrong Jack's Links are great and superior to these, but if you are  on a budget try Trails Best.

review/text: I am not much of a jerky fan, and when I tasted this I nearly gagged, but my kids (ages 10, 13, & 17) just love it.  It is very sweet and tender (two attributes I think jerky should not have), but for kids it is a quick snack that satisfies them and is better for them than candy & cookies.  They are begging me to order more!

review/text: There is not much to say about this wonderful item. You don't buy a gallon of TABASCO unless you really love the stuff. The Garlic Flavor Tabasco is ideal for foods like spaghetti or Hamburgers (If you haven't tried it on your burger go do it now).<br /><br />IF YOU BUY THE GALLON TABASCO YOU WILL NEED THE REFILL KIT ALSO, That's something they don't tell you prior to purchasing. So go out and spread the HOT & FIREY goodness to the entire world.

With the subscriber discount, the cost of this product is as low as I have found anywhere else.<br /><br />I like the fact that this tea is caffeine free -- this allows me to drink it through my work day without feeling jittery. I also love the taste. As for the medicinal benefits -- there's no way to verify them personally.

review/summary: If the price seems too good to be true...
review/text: While this is certainly better than what I can buy in the grocery store, it really isn't a very good quality balsamic.  It does not have that thick, syrupy, sweet taste that allows balsamic to be drizzled over fruit.  It tastes too vinegary to be used for desserts and dipping bread and all the things good balsamic is used for.  For me, this turned out to be a cooking balsamic, albeit more expensive than what I buy at the grocery store.  I would not buy this again.  If the price seems too good to be true...

review/text: I first purchased this vinegar while on vacation and it was expensive, so i used it bery sparingly.  I finally ran out and went on line to try to find it, and of course, Amazon had the exact product, AND it was much cheaper.  So I ordered a couple of bottles and i can use it however i want as i have a way to reasonably replace it.  The vinegar is wonderful and i am afraid addictive.

review/text: Cat litter sure has improved over the years. The last time I had a cat was quite a number of years ago when all you could really get was Jonny Cat. So no matter what my apartment would always have a cat box smell. ick.<br />Well this cat litter was amazing. I have 3 cats in a small apartment and nobody would know by the smell! This litter clumps exceptionally well, so it is really easy to keep the box clean. I am amazed at how well it controls the odor. I think this one clumps better than most of the other brands.

review/summary: Great product - no more infections!!!
review/text: I have a cat that is prone to frequent UTIs / bladder infections. After numerous trips to the vet, I decided to treat her holistically. The first thing I did however was change the type of litter - and almost instantly - no more problems. I think that the perfumes / dyes that "mask" odors can also be irritants for the cat. I highly recommend this product!!!!
