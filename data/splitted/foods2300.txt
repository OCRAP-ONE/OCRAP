review/text: I got this after hearing about the healing properties of honey. I had some nasty sores on my leg. Put this on and it stung like heck but it did help speed up the healing process. Not a bad tasting honey either. I keep this with my first aid stuff. Saved me from being sent back to the hospital with the sores.

review/summary: I believe in miracles!
review/text: My 86 year-old mother spent 22 days in a hospital and rehab facility for bedsores on both hips. Anyone who knows about bedsores knows there are four stages. 1-4. My Mom had two stage 3's and one stage 4. The hospital did not do much other than keep her hydrated and on antibiotics. Nine days later she was transferred to a rehab facility. Much the same. Just changing of dressings for the bedsores. "They will take a long time to heal, if at all." I was at a loss for words. Her prognosis...only fair. To make a long story short...along came Wedderspoon Manuka MF16+ Honey. One and a half months later, they are completely healed! Praise the God of ALL creation for this marvelous, miraculous stuff! Be sure to order at least MF16+ for full beneficial properties.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy, and Anti-bacterial properties for skin
review/text: After reading about honey for wounds by Dr. Peter Molan (University of Waikato, New Zealand), I decided to purchase this honey with its anti-bacterial properties for treating a bad wound in order to prevent scarring using gauzes and skin-safe surgical tapes after cleansing with hydrogen peroxide (low percentage, like 1%). I have never seen a wound heal with such minimal scarring despite the depth and severity of the wound! I come from a family of medical doctors and everyone is impressed and asked about these results, including my own doctor!<br /><br />-Manuka honey has an antibacterial property due to the release of hydrogen peroxide which can kill bacteria.<br /><br />-UMF = unique manuka factor<br />This is rating system that measures non-hydrogen peroxide antibacterial potency of manuka honey. The range is 0 to 30 but typical manuka honey has a rating of 10 or more. The higher the rating, the higher the anti-bacterial activities. This Wedderspoon Manuka Honey has a rating of 16+<br />Here is the UMF rating rubric:<br />* 0-4: Not detectable<br />* 5-9: Maintenance levels only (similar to table honey and not recommended for special therapeutic use)<br />* 10-15: Useful levels endorsed by the Honey Research Unit at The University of Waikato[citation needed]<br />* 16 and over: Superior levels with very high activity.<br /><br />-Extremely effective in aiding: Acid Reflux, Heartburn, GERD, Stomach Pains, loose stools<br />I like to eat spicy foods and used to rely on heartburn pills. My stomach condition got worse recently, and certain foods (even if they were NOT spicy) started triggering the acid pains. My chest began to have acid-related pains. This honey has really helped me to get off of the acid reflux or heartburn pills and my stomach is functioning regularly.<br /><br />-Raw honey = doesn't use the sterilization process using gamma radiation.<br /><br />-Chemical and pesticide free, Antibiotic and GMO free<br /><br />-Never feeding the bees sugar<br /><br />-USDA Organic certified to have no additives.<br /><br />-Has a very strong floral taste and unique flavor. I personally love it.<br /><br />-More viscous than other honeys you can buy at the store. You have to spread it on breads. I enjoy this in tea and on various breads and cakes.

review/text: I found the taste of this honey to be almost medicinal, but so were the effects.  I had had the honey around for a couple of weeks when I came down with a sore throat and decided to take the honey for a test drive, so to speak.  I used the honey 3 times in one day (1 tsp each time)...and the next morning I felt 100% back to normal.  Would I have recovered that fast anyway from whatever was causing the sore throat?  I don't know, but I do know that I went from feeling bad to feeling normal overnight.  I am a big fan of Manuka honey now.

review/summary: Heaven on Earth
review/text: Wedderspoon Raw Organic Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar<br /><br />Just opening the jar, before I even tasted it; I knew that this was Heaven on Earth.  The Bible often refers to heaven as the land of milk and honey.  This too me always seemed rather blah and not much of an incentive, until I smelled this honey.  Then, one taste and I was there. (Thank you Weederspoon for illuminating the Bible.)<br /><br />I bought it for my health.  I did not know, that it would make my taste buds sing "hallelujah!". I felt physically better in less that 24 hours. It is the best honey product on this Earth. The aroma is intoxicating. I put the honey in my tea, but I also ate a spoonful for an instant health kick. (Be fore-warned; you will want to eat the entire jar.)<br /><br />It can be used on skin eruptions, pimples, ulcers etc.  It can possibly save diabetics an amputation if their wounds are treated with this honey instead of endless rounds of antibiotics that are not working.) I would use it sooner than later.  (There is a tendency to only try alternatives as a last resort.)<br /><br />If you are just a gourmet and not a health-nut: this is the honey for you. I never want to see a different honey product again.  Only Weederspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+ will do it for me.

review/summary: Manuka Manuka Manuka!
review/text: This honey is like a cure-all! Worth every penny.  It's tasty, but we don't use it on toast or for baking because of the price.  We mainly use it for illness/injury as an anti-biotic. Works great to heal cuts and cure sinusitis, etc, or simply boost the immune system.<br /><br />Raw honey has monocytes that stimulate white cells to produce inflammatory cytokines to kill infection. Manuka honey in particular works through the TLR-4 (toll-like receptor). TLRs are involved in innate immunity.  Really good stuff. This brand is high quality.

I also give this to my kids to help keep up their immune system. I was kicking myself when I didn't bring it with us recently on vacation and one of them got sick! We were joking that I forgot the "super honey" at home ;) It is really benefical. Even though it has a thicker consistency my 2 and 4yr old prefer it over the processed honey found in most stores. I do wish it came in a differnt type of container. Not sure about plastic? Especially when your target market is people who are super health conscious. Most likely they avoid plastic, keep that in mind!

review/text: I have had numerous allergies ( seasonal, and environmental )for years. I have been on three different medications, year round,  at the same time for these allergies. Now, I take 1/2 teaspoon of honey in the am and half teaspoon at night and I don't need any of my allergy medication. ( Zyrtec, Nasonex and Mucinex) During the fall pollen/mold time, I might need my Zyrtec and Nasonex for a few weeks, but then I can stop. It is excellent honey and worth the money. It also quickly cured my son's cold sores.

review/summary: Great for cleansing the face
review/text: I have rosacea and many believe that with rosacea comes demodex mites. I'm not sure if this is true for me or not, but I do know that honey is one of the only things that calms the irritation of my face. All raw honey will do this. However, this manuka honey was something else. I not only noticed a very apparent calming result the next day but I also noticed that the oiliness of my nose was greatly improved as well!<br /><br />My guess is that the antibacterial properties of the manuka honey worked against the natural bacteria present alongside demodex mites and gave my skin some reprieve. I cannot do any kind of chemical topicals at all, so I am trying to boost my immune system from the inside to deal with the mites naturally. However, this is great for clarifying my skin and helping my immune system along so it doesn't have to fight as many things at once.<br /><br />One thing to note was that my face generally seems slightly redder after using this compared to normal honey. I'm guessing that this honey is 'stronger' in it's antibacterial properties and might be a bit harsher on the face. But the next day was such an improvement, a little bit of extra redness right after washing it off is not a problem at all.<br /><br />I will say it and say it again: We should be washing our faces with things we can EAT. If not a bunch of manmade harmful chemicals is being absorbed through your skin and your body has to work hard to deal with these toxic substances. Don't force your body to deal with even more than it has to. Go natural. Go with something that your body doesn't mind absorbing.

review/summary: Dogs best friend
review/text: My dog had an infected tick bite on his neck. It was about the size of a nickle and looked so bad I was sure we would be going to the Vet. I took a finger full of manuka and rubbed it on the infection. I did this twice a day and made sure to keep dirt and other things from getting stuck in the honey. After about 4 days it looked a thousand times better and decided we didn't need to go to the vet. I figured I used less than 5 dollars worth of honey to treat his infected wound and if we had gone to the vet I am sure the bill would have been close to what I paid for the whole jar of honey. This stuff is the best, it saved me money and the time it would take to go to the vet. I also make a pre-work out energy drink using the honey. I take a spoon of honey and mix it with some lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon and water. I put all the ingredients in to a bottle with a lid and then just shake until the honey is dissolved. One of the most practical things to have in your house for both people and pets! Also when I go camping I use it for first aid and eat some when I need the energy. The latest jar I have received was from Health and Beauty pros and it is also batch #13. The quality of this particular batch is just the same if not better than all of the other jars I have had.

review/summary: Manuka Honey great for healing leg ulcer after surgery
review/text: I recently had surgery to remove a dead vain in my lower right leg that caused a ulcer. A friend of mine recommended manuka honey, saying it helps keep the skin moist (which in my case would promote skin growth), among other things. I searched here on Amazon, and found this Wedderspoon Organic Manuka Honey. I had sticker shock when I saw the price, but after I read all the positive reviews about it I purchased it. I applied it to my ulcer everyday, for three weeks after my surgery and my ulcer was completely healed. **** Note I am a 25 yr old, non- smoker, so if you're older, or a smoker it might not work quite as well. However, based on my experience with it, I recommend manuka honey to help with hard to heal leg ulcers.

review/summary: Amazing - It worked in 3 days!
review/text: Was suffering from extreme pain in the gastric region and nausea for weeks. It was hard for me to attend public functions without being sick...I have no medical coverage for now and ordered this honey.<br />According to instructions on jar.... 1-2 tsps of honey prior to eating. I am guessing that this creates a coating of the stomach intestine or whatever so that it's antibacterial properties can go to work. Who knows! All I know is that I am completely fine now!! The honey tastes wonderful! I have eaten organic honey with comb from Union Square that I purchased from a beekeeper who harvests his own honey...although it was nice to know it was organic, it was still very sweet. Store bought honey is very sweet too...this honey is sweet but mild so that you can enjoy it without being overwhelmed.<br />Also, the packaging is in a plastic container. There have been many reviews where people have complained about it no longer being in a glass container, but if you read earlier reviews, people were complaining about receiving broken jars of honey so that is how they remedied the situation.<br />Oh, and I only take the honey 1x a day before breakfast and it worked! Do not hesitate to buy!!

review/summary: Working so far!
review/text: Let me first say that I love honey, and I truly believe in the healing powers of the magic golden liquid. Those out there who have never experienced any honey other than the clover honey so common in the U.S. have never lived. It was when I lived in Yemen for three years that I discovered my love for honey, because it was there where I discovered Sidr honey, which is absolutely, hands-down, the best honey I have ever tasted in my life.  There you can get it for about $60/kilo ($28 or so per pound)...if you get it in Europe or the U.S., expect to pay $150/kilo or more.  In my opinion, it was worth it, and I consumed at least 1/2kg (roughly a pound) per month.  Sidr, like Manuka, is quite potent, and so long as i ate it, i never was sick: no stomach bugs, no head colds.  Meanwhile those around me without the honey were constantly sick with GI infections.<br /><br />That brings me to Manuka.  I have recently started experiencing H.Pylori-like symptoms (dyspepsia stomach pain).  I do not trust most doctors anymore for any GI issues, because my travels around the world have brought me my fair share of GI bugs, and the doctors almost always fail to help. Three things I've always used that NORMALLY work: Oil of Oregano (good for giardia, e-coli, entamoeba hystolitica, etc), Grapefruit Seed Extract (good as an antiseptic and water disinfectant), and Sidr honey (good for preventing bugs).  However, whatever it is i have this time has not responded to any of those.  So, after extensive research, I was encouraged by what i read about Manuka...plus I love honey and i've always wanted to try it. So i ordered some.  Although I still have not received my shipment from Amazon (i just ordered it a couple days ago), I found the same exact honey (Wedderspoon Active 16+) in my local organic food market, for only $32 ($5 less than Amazon). Because i wanted relief from the pain NOW, i was willing to buy a second bottle.<br /><br />I've only started taking it today, so I will post a follow-up in a week or two.  But let me just say, this is some STRONG honey.  You can smell the antiseptic nature of it, and you can taste it (almost a hint of pinesol). It is very thick (somewhere between regular clover honey and honey butter) and somewhat creamy.  Flavor-wise (beyond strength), it is pretty good.  However, it is absolutely nowhere even close to Sidr on taste...I devour Sidr off of the spoon...this stuff I would only consume for medicinal reasons...and I'd also say that Tupelo tastes better as well.  Having said all that, medicinally, a spoonful (straight) of this stuff hit my stomach like a freight train, partly because of the acidic nature of honey, and partly because it was going to work. The first round made me feel a bit light-headed as well.  Both of those cleared up shortly.  About 2 hours later i started experiencing a lot of mucus draining in my head (similar to what i get when i take oil of oregano), so I knew that it was in my bloodstream working on other matters as well.  By the time i consumed my second dose (this time on a bit of a muffin--gluten free and dairy free), my stomach was already starting to feel a bit better.  The second dose, possibly because of the muffin as a buffer, didn't hit my stomach as hard.<br /><br />For those with h.pylori: Please note that I also have an order of mastic gum on the way. Based on everything I've read, mastic gum seems to be the most effective cure.  I'm hoping that between mastic gum and munaka, i'll beat this thing. I don't know if Manuka on its own is strong enough to kill all cases of h.pylori.<br /><br />To conclude:<br />- Taste:  Do NOT buy this for taste. It tastes good, but if you're going to spend $37/pound, find yourself some Yemeni Sidr honey...if you can find it in a very raw form, it is also quite a strong medicine.  Also, Tupelo honey at about $7/pound tastes better than Manuka.<br />- Medicinal Properties: This is some potent stuff...the most potent honey i've ever tasted. I've got high hopes, and it's possible that once my dyspepsia is gone, i'll keep an emergency bottle of this in the cupboard (honey doesn't really go bad)<br />- Rating: Worth all five stars I gave it. I can't say it'll cure cancer, but it seems to be working on my stomach.<br /><br />Good luck.

review/summary: Manuka Honey...
review/text: Manuka (tea shrub) is a type of honey found in New Zealand and Australia. 16 is the UMF=Unique Manuka Factor which also can be found in factors of 12 and 20. The higher the UMF, the more medicinal value. Most honey sold in US are treated somehow either by filtering, diluting, blending, pasteurizing... which removes pollens which identify where the honey was produced and without pollens, honey has no medicinal value. This honey is so superior that once consumed, it helps allergies due to pollen content and more and externally can be applied to the skin to treat any condition. Wedderspoon is a quality brand from  New Zealand. You certainly pay a price but you do receive superior grade product when comparing to the worthless honey sold in grocery stores even when it is labelled as fancy grade A which hardly means anything since it may have come from China... Amazing taste of honey unlike any other honey. This is a superfood and a super medicine. double Bravo.<br /><br />Furthermore... After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin can not be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound, applying Neosporin softened the scab, removed the scab, delayed the healing process of the wound which caused some scaring on my body. That was the last tube of Neosporin I ever used. Now, the only way that I treat any wound regardless of the size is 1) washing it with water 2)allowing it to dry for couple of minutes 3)applying Hibiclens few times a day for few days depending to the size of the wound 4)applying Manuka honey 5) applying almond and castor oil. Hibiclens is expensive but alcohol by itself although inexpensive, does more damage since it burns the skin and does more scaring. Manuka Honey is expensive but is the best healer of all. These are all expensive natural products but do the trick since help the scab do its job. Almond and castor oil help with removing any black spots, scars and moisturise my skin.

review/summary: Delicious, medicinal honey
review/text: Granted, this honey is on the pricey side, but I have to say it's more than worth it. My husband had been trying all kinds of ways to tame his ulcerative colitis for months, but the only thing that worked was this raw organic manuka honey. The only other things he used with it were a product call Sera Vera and some probiotics. He still needs to watch his diet somewhat, but he has not had loose stools or blood in his stools since he went on this raw organic Manuka honey and Sera Vera routine. Now, if he eats something that does not agree with him completely, he will get gas but no blood or diarrhea. This is a very big relief for both of us. We really wanted to avoid having him go on meds. That is just a vicious circle and we were aiming at curing rather than just controlling symptoms. We seem to be headed in the right direction as we are adding more and more foods back into his diet slowly and he is starting to gain his weight back. He loves the taste of the honey and not only eats it on its own, but also on toast several times a day. It has helped heal his gut, it stimulates his appetite, and it satisfies his cravings for sweets, which is great, because he is not eating any sugar at all right now, because sugar depresses the immune system.<br /><br />I have tasted the honey too and I love the taste. I am so glad we found this wonderful resource.

review/summary: Was miserable for 3 1/2 months with GERD
review/text: I have been through it all...Athletic 34 year old 6'3 180...competitive cyclist/triathloner....Could not understand why all the sudden I have acid indegestion and major heartburn after drinking even water.  Tried to just live with it for 2 months.  Woke up every morning with this weird acidic feeling in my stomach. Ended up in the hospital, thought I was having a heart attack one night.  Went to GI doctor, did endoscopy found nothing.  Said probably irritable bowl syndrome. I basically got to the point of a month of eating toast, bananas, white rice, nothing but water.  I am serious, I did nothing but bland stuff and it didn't matter.  So, I tried Prilosec for 28 days straight, and ate about 50% of what I used to eat (tacos, spicy food, milkshake here and there, and felt a little better, probably because I was enjoying my food again... but still felt constipated.  Stopped Prilosec (after 28 days) completely and did a Zantac 150 if I couldn't take the bloating/hurt feeling.  Looked online for help, someone said try Zypan digestive enzymes and another said Manuka Honey.  I bought them both from Amazon and decided to try the honey first to see how it did.  Well, I have been taking a Table spoon on a half piece of white bread before breakfast and an hour before bed for about 5 days now and I feel 90% better.  I am having more frequent movements also, so I assume that the honey is healing intestines as well as stomach lining.  This past weekend, my wife and I shared a cheesesteak stromboli with marinara sauce, etc. for dinner.  Before bed, I did the tablespoon of honey and was fine all night and the next morning.  If you are suffering, give it a shot, I'm super glad I did.  I hope to get to the point, where I just do it once in the morning.  No clue how it works, or if I'm just healing slowly on my own?  But, I really don't care as I feel better.  Good luck, I have not even bothered to try the digestive enzymes, because this honey is doing something for me!

review/summary: Tastes good, but I wouldn't order during the summer again...got hot!
review/text: First off I didn't notice any mediciney smell or taste as some reviewers stated.  No bitterness. It's very pleasant flavor wise, although the texture is a bit grainy for my taste.  I only removed one star for that because I'd prefer a smoother texture as with YS Raw Honey.  Maybe that's normal for manuka raw honey, but for me it doesn't feel very pleasant taken by the spoonful.<br /><br />That said, I only bought this for the alleged health benefits. At this price it sure wasn't for taste alone. Unfortunately, the mail man left it on my front porch out in the sun, and it was very warm to the touch when I opened it.  I did some research and hear that when honey is heated to over 96 F it starts to lose nutrients, and enzymes at 104.  I'm sure my jar was at least 120 degrees when I brought it inside.  The sun beating down on the box made it super hot.<br /><br />I didn't remove a star for that, but beware of ordering this during the summer.  If so, make sure you're home so it doesn't get stuck in the hot mail box or on the front porch like mine and heat up.  If anyone has more info about heating honey and exactly what happens to the health benefits, please comment on this review.  The information I'm finding on this is all over the place, from the honey "dying" at over 96 degrees F, to it being fine up to 160 degrees. It seems like one site will contradict another, but the overall consensus seems to be that the magical properties of honey are destroyed with heat.

review/summary: Best Active Honey
review/text: Ignore the price because this organic honey from New Zealand is worth every dollar! It has helped heal wounds, kept those annoying winter colds & sore throats away and on top of all that it has given my skin a lovely glow.  PLUS the taste is extraordinarily smooth and sweet. It is by far my favorite natural healer, cold minimizer and honey product ever. My teenage daughter loves it too.  I have it on monthly auto ship and I'll never be without it. Take a tablespoon twice a day when you first feel that sore throat coming on and you will be amazed at the ability of this honey to stop the pesky colds and coughs right in their tracks. Love this stuff.....

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased this product after reading many of the positive customer reviews.  One review said that this product cleared up their allergies and they threw all of their prescription drugs away.  I bought it for that reason and I was happy to say that it cleared up mine as well.  I usually take year round allergy meds.  The Manuka honey gave me the freedom of not having to put prescription drugs in my body.  I am particularly allergic to juniper so I'll have to see if it helps during our juniper season. I might have to take supplements at that time, which I normally have to do anyhow, but for now I'm free and clear of any other seasonal allergies!  I am so grateful for this product and it's delicious too.  I am now on a monthly plan and have been saving money on every jar.  I'm taking roughly 1 teaspoon per day to rid myself of seasonal allergies.  At this rate, a single jar will last about one month.

review/summary: HEALS Pressure Sores!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I wanted to wait to see how the product worked before writing a review.  I am the caregiver for my 88 year old grandfather.  He is pretty much bed bound.  He suffers from dementia so explaining to him that he needs to turn and to keep sleeping/laying in different positions is hard.  He would forget or keep lying on his back.  So of course he developed a sore on his bum.  My neighbor who is a PT assistant told me about Manuka Honey.  Well, I logged onto Amazon and read the other reviewers who purchased the Wedderspoon brand. I decided to give it a shot and bough it that evening, it was delivered the next day.<br />Before using the honey I was using many other types of products, creams, lotions, special bandages and nothing seemed to work. My Hospice nurse stated that bed sores are hard to treat and some won't go away.  Well I was not having that.  I told him about the honey and stated that I was only going to apply that and nothing else.  What's the worst that could happen? Him having honey on his bum?  I applied twice a day with loose gauze pads.  Sometimes 3 times but only when I changed his diapers.  I used a teaspoon or so at a time.<br />Within a few days I could see a difference!  Each day it got smaller and smaller and less deep.  The Hospice nurses and C.N.A's were amazed. They now recommend the Manuka honey.  I used the whole bottle but it HEALED the sore and I have pictures to prove it!<br />If anyone else is dealing with pressure sores or bed sores do not hesitate to buy it.  It's a great all natural product that works! You do not have to worry about harsh chemicals on delicate skin. I cannot say enough.  I also used the wonder gel extreme cushion to prevent any more sores from forming. :)

review/summary: Great for skin and delicious on fruit!
review/text: I bought this honey after a friend suggested it to me to help calm my skin. I have mild but persistant acne and have been looking for ways to clear my skin without it being too harsh. Previously I had been on benzoyl peroxide 2% and it had helped my skin, but made it rough and discolored. I went off of the BP and started looking for other ways to combat my acne.<br /><br />I use the Manuka Honey as a mask (occasionally mixed with Aztec Indian Healing Clay, but often times just by itself) and it has done wonders with my skin. It's calmed my active pimples down greatly. I use it about 3 times a week and I leave it on for about an hour each time. I find it best to place the honey on strips of paper towel before sticking it on your face. This will help with the dripping.<br /><br />I also love to drizzle it on fruits or in teas! It's as delicious as it is helpful!

review/text: I have had stomach issues for as long as I can remember.  I have acid reflux and IBS.  The doctors I have seen give me acid reflux medication and say to use an elimination diet.  Well, the medication would not work, and they would say, take double the amount.  I have eliminated foods down to about 10 things I eat to avoid stomach problems.  This is  no way to live.  After being told about this honey, I read reviews and researched it online. I decided to give it a try.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I have been taking it for about one week, and I feel better.  My digestion is improved, and I know my acid reflux is better.  It seems to sooth my stomach and digestion, and it helps with IBS.  I have been very happy with this product, and I hope you are too.

review/summary: This worked for me!!
review/text: This is my first review of any Amazon product to help other customers. This product really worked for me. My blood test revealed positive H-pylori infection after my trip outside the country. But I believe that was due to my prolonged (more than 3 years - Started with Omeprazole 20mg and last I was on dexilant 60 mg) use of acid blockers for my acid reflux. My stomach pain did not go away even after 2 rounds of antibiotics. After reading other customer reviews, I ordered this product. I took a teaspoon twice a day (once before breakfast and once before dinner). I finished 2 jars of Manuka honey now. My stomach pain is gone and also my recent breath test revealed negative. I am also taking align probiatic and mastic gum 500mg before my breakfast daily. I am almost off of all the acid blockers.

review/summary: Eczema on my Toddler
review/text: My son was 20 months when I started using manuka honey on his eczema. He had it really bad on his feet mostly where his ankle is and where the bend happens. I would apply an ample amount of manuka at bed time and put socks on his feet. I did this for 2 months and I havent had to do it again. Its now been 3 months since I stopped applying it and it has yet to come back! Not only has it not come back but his skin is SO soft in the area where it used to be so rough and dry! This stuff is miraculous! He also had mild eczema on his arms and legs and for that I used Nordic Naturals fish oil products for kids.. It has worked wonders for the rest of his body!

review/summary: works well to prevent acid reflux...
review/text: I have dealt w reflux for most of my adult life (I'm 41) I've had problems w swallowing food due to esophageal erosion and narrowing from stomach acid irritation. I've tried a lot of different products and have used PPI's on and off before. They all have negative side effects most doctors wont bother warning you about. I haven't found any side effects from this product and it works. I almost never have any reflux anymore. I take a small amount 20 min or so before breakfast and I'm heartburn free for the day. I just take it straight without bread or a cracker. Not sure if it would prevent reflux if I ate a super spicy meal or pepperoni or not, but I usually avoid that stuff anyhow. If you have chronic reflux due to constant stress and anxiety I'm not sure if this stuff will help you, but for controlling mild reflux it does work very well. I've been taking it for a few months now

review/text: I certainly didn't know as much about honey as I do now after researching, buying and using Wedderspoon raw organic Manuka honey.  A teaspoon a day in green or organic tea or vinegar and water is the amount that seems to give me more energy and, best of all, seems to give me some immunity to contagious diseases.  I cannot tolerate an antibiotic internally; I believe the antibiotic qualities of Manuka honey provide healthy assistance to my immune system.  The fact that honey will never spoil tells us something very important . . . and it also tastes good!

review/summary: One of the 2 best honeys in the world!  Helps my acid reflux!
review/text: I had read a few articles about Manuka honey, and it's supposed medicinal and therapeutic uses. I've had undiagnosed acid reflux for years now (perhaps it's something else?), and i've been battling it by drinking lots of water and trying to cut down on or eliminate the 'trigger foods' that bring it on. After about 2 days of use (3 teaspoons a day), I noticed my condition start to subside quite a bit! I would have never have believed it myself, but the Manuka honey was helping to quell my acid reflux events. This honey has a rather interesting taste, both sweet and a tiny bit 'medicinal' or bitter. The small hint of medicinal taste does not detract from the overall good taste though. The other great honey I discovered is Greek honey. To me, it is the best tasting honey in the world, and almost as effective for my acid reflux as the Manuka honey.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy
review/text: Them bees sure spit out a delicious concoction eh? Ok that's not the best image of honey but it is what it is! It's delicious bee spit, fantastic stuff! The honey you buy in supermarkets is mostly devoid (fancy vocabulary for does not have) of nutrients since it has been purged through the heating process. You want natural, organic, raw honey like Wedderspoon's honey. Like yogurt, it has active cultures in it, which is good for you. A lot of people do not like the concept of living cultures in one's food, thinking it's gross or harmful. But I tell you what... if you did not have the friendly bacteria living in your intestines then your pooper would have one heck of a time my good friend! Also, raw honey has antibacterial properties, which is good for getting rid of the bad stuff in our body. Wedderspoon gives you not 1... not 3... but 16+ active cultures! They sure are generous with their cultures! Also, for the ladies, honey is great for the face. A lot of girls use honey to make a honey mask. You get distilled water, a bit of honey, and make a paste out of it. Mix well and apply to your face. If some of it slips downward, you can catch some with your tongue and get a little snack :). I put my honey on my loaf of bread mainly, but sometimes I get inspired by Pooh Bear and go at it standalone with just a spoon. Let's just say you definitely want some bread. Make sure you keep this thing away from the sun as the UV light from the sun will kill your active cultures. Reduced cultures = reduced nutritional benefit. Here is the summary:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Organic and raw, not processed<br />-16+ live cultures that are good for you<br />-Can be used to make a honey mask as an external facial mask for the skin<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Does not come free<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTES:<br /><br />-Keep away from sunlight, the UV kills the active cultures.

review/summary: Super... Healed Inflammation & Helped GERD
review/text: I don't want to go into gross detail, but I did have an open pore that occasionally became painfully inflamed.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a bug bite with a permanent pin-prick sized bite "hole/mark", as it never did go completely away, but when it repeatedly (2-3x a year) swelled up to the size of a quarter (hard to the touch and very painful) I finally decided to seek medial advice.<br /><br />My Dermatologist explained it was a pore. She could make an incision to clean out the debris of dead cells, but suggested a surgeon who could completely clean & cut out the core of it all to avoid further occurrences.<br /><br />Not feeling so cozy about that, I searched online for alternatives to cleaning cell debris, I forget the exact key-word search I did, but I came to a website that talked about the HEALING qualities of MANUKA Honey for all kinds of ailments & diseases from internal such as intestinal issues, ulcers, Crohn's disease  to  external skin problems including those caused by Diabetes, burns, and so much more!<br /><br />Didn't take me long to be convinced this ACTIVE honey is worth a try. I found a good deal right here on Amazon and purchased Manuka jars on a regular schedule.<br /><br />IT DID HELP! Wasn't instant, but it did work.<br /><br />I spread  Active 16+ Manuka Honey  on and around the area of the inflamed pore. I then covered the area with a piece of gauze and used medical tape to hold it in place. I did this mornings after my shower and evenings before bed.<br />I treated the inflamed pore for 16 days till it was cleared up.<br />It flared up about a half a year later, so I repeated the whole process again. It's been almost a full year since I've had my last flare-up.<br />At some point in the future I may decide to have the core of the pore surgically removed, but for now I've not had problems for so long, I'm definitely content to leave it as is and treat naturally again if necessary ;)<br /><br />I also learned that Manuka Honey is good for the gut too. So I started taking 1 tsp before meals and noticed reduced GERD symptoms within a day!<br /><br />We now keep two Manuka Honey jars in the house. One labeled "medicinal" stored in our medicine cabinet and the other is kept with our daily supplements in the kitchen.<br /><br />*All the best to your health*<br />:)

They may still have the symptoms but it wont be as bad or you may experience shortened sick days.  This is a must-have in our home!

review/text: I got this when I unexpectedly broke out with a cold sore on my upper lip and was researching the internet for a good way to treat. By the time i got this my cold sore had cracked between the wet and dry part of my upper lip and was very unpleasant. However with the honey not only did it disinfect, it moisturized, and made the healing process so much faster. Instead of waiting for a week or two to heal, it was healed after 3 days of applying it throughout the day and before sleeping. I am very pleased by this honey and is also considering buying the lip balm they have...although a 10 pack seems quite a lot to buy at once.

I mixed it with warm water and gave it to him internally (much to his dismay) and slathered it on the wound.  So far, so good.  Shipments were always prompt and product arrived intact.

review/summary: Heals Eczema
review/text: I use honey to moisturize my face, to soothe my throat and to unclog my pores. But this honey, got rid of my eczema. About a year ago, a quarter-sized patch of eczema appeared on my back. It was itchy, dry, and a little flaky. So I took to the Internet in search of a holistic and chemical-free solution (I believe chemicals only further exacerbate the problem). And every organic website recommended honey. So I tried store-brought. NOTHING! But soon, I discovered organic raw honey. But it only helped a little. The itch lessened but the size of the eczema patch began to grow. About a month ago, I ran across a website that claimed this particular brand to be a wonder drug so I sucked up my displeasure with paying $34 for honey and purchased it. I put it directly on my eczema everyday for about 2 weeks and one day I realized it was gone. My boyfriend touched my back the other day and said, "That rough patch of skin you had right here is gone. What did you put on it?" My reply: HONEY, honey. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

review/text: In using it and sharing it with family, I've seen this honey fix stubborn skin issues like fungus, flaky skin, itchy skin and calluses. I've even seen it help with stomach issues and post surgery nausea. But really, the repairing of skin issues with topical application is just stunning to me. I am a believer for life.

review/text: Besides enjoying it straight out of the jar, I also applied the honey to my face after shower, and then washed it off after a few hours. My skin became glowy and smooth, and I also noticed less breakouts, it's like it instantly heals everything. I am amazed. I wonder how it is going to be after a week or so? I probably won't have to apply foundation anymore to cover the unwanted spots, the skin will become perfect naturally.

My stomach was so upset.  I read the directions and put 1 tsp. in a glass of cool tea.  Anyway, in about 15 minutes, I didn't feel as sick to my stomach.  However, the truly amazing thing was the taste!  If medicine would all taste this way, I know quite a few children that would be less inclined to fight taking it.

review/summary: very poor packaging but good product
review/text: It has very distinctive odor and taste, a little sour I say. I have it with hot water as a tea in the morning (for my stomach) or put on paper cuts clumsy me get sometimes. Either way this works fabulously.<br /><br />Reason for one star off is because of the packaging. I ordered two and one of the jars came half open. Honey was all over the box and the jars. It seemed like the white cap wasn't sealed tightly. The pink sticker/label you see in the picture was intact and prevented the white cap from falling off completely but it still was a mess.<br /><br />Overall I like the honey and will get it again but if the packaging doesn't improve I'll have to find some other sources.

It also seems to help digestive problems, i started taking a tablespoon a day preventatively and was pleasantly surprised to be the only member of my family not laid low by a heinous stomach bug that swept through our home. I also love that this stuff doesn't have to be chiseled out of the jar like some raw honey. totally with the money, and this is the cheapest place to get it that i have found.

review/summary: Nice manuka honey
review/text: I am now finishing my third bottle of Wedderspoon manuka honey. So far I have been very happy with it. I take manuka honey daily for its presumed health benefits, however unsubstantiated they may be. It seems to keep me healthier and makes the duration of a cold shorter. That may be all in my head, but so be it ... that means it works for me! ;-) Regardless, I have tried a number of different manuka honeys over the years. This one is not quite as thick as others, but it is not runny either, and is does have some substance when scooped up with a spoon. The flavor is moderately sweet and not medicinal. It tastes similar to other manuka honeys that I have used. The price is very competitive, particularly with the "subscription" discount. I am finding this to be a quite satisfactory and good tasting honey and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.

review/text: Whole Life Salmon treats are not only made from US caught fish they are also processed here in the USA!<br /><br />The size of the treat is a little large, especially for cats, but it can be easily torn or broken down to a kibble size. This leaves a lot of dust/particles on the bottom of the bag. Don't throw them away. Dump them into a bowl add water and now kitty has a nommy moist salmon treat!<br /><br />Keep an eye out for bones (another good reason to tear the pieces into smaller sizes).

review/summary: The cats freaked out over this
review/text: I'm not a fan of fishy smelling things personally, so giving the cats a fish-flavored treat ranks about 50th on my list of things I would like to do. But the reaction from them made it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Mack, my cat who isn't that much of a foodie, stood on his his legs and mrowed to try to get closer. Tamir, our girl kitty, had her eyes dilated and her whiskers totally out and ran around in circles a few times in the 8 seconds or so it took to open the package. They REALLY wanted their treats.<br /><br />While the reaction on the chicken-flavored ones is about a four and the reaction on this one is an all-alarm five, I will likely purchase the chicken one in future, just because I hate touching the fish one, and I also noticed the kitties were liking treat time so much that they kept wondering if perhaps treat time might also come now, and now, and at this other time in addition. But you can see - the product does exactly what it's supposed to. The cats love it (it's in big chunks that they can gnaw), I know it's healthy real food with only one ingredient (salmon), and it certainly makes them feel happy and special to get to eat it.

review/text: My kitten adored these treats. She gobbled them up. As she's a baby, I broke up a chunk of salmon in more manageable bit sized pieces. They broke apart fine, not crumbly at all. I tried to give her a second helping of a smaller chunk and she was so ravenous for this new flavor, she took it form me before I could break it apart and she was able to bite off pieces no problem. These are definitely a keeper! Though pricey, I had a bag of Whole Life beef treats and they last over 3 months. Well worth the quality too!

With a little hemp or almond milk, it is delicious.  I don't even sweeten it.

review/summary: An anti-organic skeptic convinced!
review/text: I'm not one to get caught up in this organic stuff. In fact, I frequently avoid it. I just like a good 'flavored' coffee. I sampled another Teccino flavor at my father's (who got it because of the non acidic properties) and I liked it. So, when I saw the chai flavor I thought I'd give it a try. I first made it with the same ratio of coffee to water that I usually do to make regular coffee. Wow, I'll never do that again. This stuff is strong. So, I read the instructions and cut back to almost half of what I use for regular coffee. I love the flavor. And, if you're a penny pincher like me. Using half the amount per pot vs coffee can be a big savings. Teecino being caffeine-free is a nice bonus. I've stopped buying coffee. Teeccino is now my drink of choice.

review/text: I really like the Teeccino products.  I used them to wean us off of coffee slowly, and we've been completely caffeine-free for two months now.  Since I prefer my coffee black, I like a bit of extra flavor.  This flavor, however, is very strong.  It has actually been too strong of a chai taste for me to enjoy it black.  It is wonderful with some stevia and cashew-milk, though.

Based on this flavor I've ordered more from the same company and I'm sure they will be just as excellent.<br /><br />I make my drink with a a 65/35 mix of herbal coffee to 1% milk. Very good! Two sweeteners and I'm off to work.<br /><br />Herbal coffee might not be the norm, but for those with health or religious concerns, it fits the bill perfectly. I would highly recommend it.

review/summary: Old-Fashioned Gumball Bank
review/text: Santa left this gumball bank under the tree for my 6 year old daughter who is crazy about gumballs and gumball machines and she was very happy to find it.  When I first took it out of the box I surprised that it was smaller than I expected, but it's still big enough.  I bought a 20 ounce container of sugarless gumballs and it filled the gumball bank about halfway up.  I used a nickle to test the coin-turn knob mechanism and found that the gumballs jammed about 2 out of every 5 tries.  The gumball machine can be adjusted to allow only one or several gumballs to drop at each turn and I adjusted it so that 2 would drop since these gumballs are pretty small.  It seemed to work o.k. after that.<br /><br />The only problem with it and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the knob is too hard for my daughter to turn all the way by herself.  I have to turn it the rest of the way for her.  The bank aspect is great, it holds a lot of coins, it's easy to get the money out once the gumballs are all gone, it's easy to re-fill with gumballs, and the directions say you can fill it up with other candies besides just gumballs though we haven't tried anything else.  You can adjust this bank to give gumballs without having to insert a coin (any size coin seems to work fine) but we want her to save some money so she has to use a coin to get gumballs.  The head is made out of what seems to be fairly durable glass (not plastic) and the base is all metal painted fire-truck red.  I will probably add a drop or two of oil to the knob mechanism since it seems to grind a bit when being turned.  It's not what a millionaire would buy for their kid, but it's cute and colorful, and it works alright - just hard for a kid to turn the knob.

Beware of the gumballs on the market, we have tried two different brands now and both seem to have about a 60 second taste-life.  The gumballs from the 'yellow box'...don't remember the name...have been the worst since they go tasteless AND get hard very quick.<br /><br />Daughter loves this and works it easily.  It take pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters...which is great.  The top red piece screws on and off...you can use a quarter more easily to do this than a screwdriver.<br /><br />I would recommend.

review/summary: Old Time Gum Ball machine
review/text: This is an old time, mechanical gum ball machine that takes any coin or you can set it to work with no coins at all. The only things I found that I did not like were the part were the gum balls (I am using it for M&Ms) come out is even with the bottom. If it is sitting flat on a table, you cannot get your hand under the chute to scoop the gumballs or M&Ms into your hand. You have to set this up on something about 2" thick with the chute hanging over the edge. The other thing is, when the items fill the chute and you flip up the plastic cover, you have to use a finger to scoop out the items onto your hand. It is a one or two at a time process because the plastic cover does not flip up completely out of the way. But, for the price, it is great. I have it in a senior center and a sign that says "One Cent buys you a little bit of heaven". That's for the M&Ms we have in there. We always make sure we have a roll of pennies to make change. They all love it and do not mind the two little things that I just mentioned.

review/text: I dinged this one star because the first one I received had a defective coin mechanism.  The replacement works great and I adjusted it to dispense 2 carousel gumballs at a time.  The glass globe and metal base are nice and heavy.  The chute is a little small for my large fingers - but it is my daughter's machine so I won't complain too much.  The bottom (not visible) is all plastic.  This is where you get the money out of the bank.  I would be really impressed if it had been all metal as well.  I suppose it should be fine if my kids aren't too rough with it.<br /><br />The little screw that allows you to adjust how much gum or candy comes out is threaded into soft plastic.  It felt stripped to me after just one adjustment (done carefully by myself), but it is holding.  Parts are available at low cost if needed from the manufacturer, but this is just another place where they saved money to make this machine cheap for us.

review/summary: Huge hit for my 5yr old!
review/text: My daughter has been waiting patiently for her 5th bday to come so she could finally have gum.  We bought the gumball machine along with some gumballs and she was super excited.  The machine is very easy to use(even my 3yr old can get the money in and turn handle with little trouble).  It accepts all coins and you can change the amount of gumballs that come out.  Very sturdy.  The top is glass and needs to be handled with care but at the age of 5 she knows to be careful.  Love it!<br />!!

review/summary: Works as described
review/text: Got this for fun, filled it with Runts. It's fairly easy to fill/refill via the top, and the coin functionality works well! Pretty fun to put coins in, twist, and have the candy fall to the bottom. Made of metal and glass, so it's pretty solid.

review/summary: Love the machine...but...
review/text: The product is exactly what I wanted - looks good and is soooo much fun - and the email responses from the seller were timely and informative. I had trouble disconnecting the coin mechanism so it would work without having to insert a coin. I followed all instructions and even advice over the phone. When I was still unable to disconnect the mechanism from the unit using excessive force, I emailed the seller for additional suggestions because I did not want to break the machine. I never got a response from the seller and am still not able to disconnect the mechanism.

review/summary: Sturdy and decorative
review/text: I purchased this gumball machine to dispense candy at my office.  It is sturdy and easy to work- just add candy in the top and remove coins as necessary.  I was able to follow the instructions to take the machine apart to control the amount dispensed and allow it to dispense without coins ("freeplay") in about 20 minutes.  The most this machine will dispense at a time is about two small Cadbury chocolates, which works for doling out chocolate to my co-workers. :-)<br /><br />The machine was shipped quickly in sturdy packaging and arrived intact.  The medium model was about the size I expected.  I might get the smaller version if I was going to use this for decoration at home.

review/text: this is a  very well built gumball machine  its metal and glass very little plastic  on it, its great that you actually need a coin to get the gumballs as well.  the only thing i would say bad about it is that the bottom is made of plastic and  it is to easy to get at the door to get the coins back, i would maybe like to see a lock of some kind on the machine but thats only a minor thing other wise very happy with this product

review/summary: Good Gumball Machine
review/text: Got this gumball machine/bank for my nephew. It was a big hit right away. The package was delivered very quickly, it's just the right size--small enough to sit on a table top without taking up too much space, but large enough to hold a substantial number of gumballs--sturdily constructed, easy to get up and running, and is easy to operate. Highly recommended if you're in the market for a gumball machine.

review/summary: Great product & fun
review/text: Wonderful product - our kids love using it.  We fill it with glass "jewels" for the kids to earn as part of a rewards program for good behavior, helping out, etc...  They earn pennies, then get to collect their jewels from the machine. It's a fun novelty the kids enjoy, so it serves as motivation to do good = win-win. All $$ from gumball machine gets dontated to charity by the kids, and the kids turn in their jewels for prizes/special trips, etc.<br /><br />The machine is high quality- metal/glass construction, nice old fashioned look, easy for the kids (4 yrs & 6 yrs) to operate.  Looks nice on display. Our 'jewels' are smaller than gumballs, but bigger than M&Ms - we set the machine to the smallest opening in hopes of only getting one jewel out at a time, but two come out many times.<br /><br />Fast shipping & packed well - so no damage upon receipt. We would recommend for candy, decoration, treasures or whatever fun you come up with.

review/text: I ordered one of these gumball machines for my 4 year old son for Christmas.  It arrived with a broken glass (i'm sure from the delivery) unfortunately.  I was pleasantly surprised to have them contact me immediately after my email to the company.  The sent out a replacement part immediately with no questions asked.  The company was very professional and quick to get back to me.  I would definately order from them again.

review/summary: Cheap price, cheap product
review/text: I was so excited to find a good sized gumball machine for my classroom for this price.  Unfortunately it doesn't work.  I took the hole thing apart and played with it and someone tried to help me fix it.  One of the pieces inside doesn't work properly and it seems like even if I got another one the same problem would occur.  The coin either gets stuck or you put one coin in and then the next time you can turn it without a coin.  It works fine if you leave it on the setting where you don't use a coin.

review/summary: Awesome product! Must buy!!!!
review/text: So this gumball machine was bigger than I expected and that first put me on to it! My friend has one so I wanted to get one also. Anyway it's 12" tall and is made of glass, die-cast metal and the smallest bit of plastic. Great materials used in this product! One tip though. BUY GUMBALLS WITH THIS MACHINE!!! this does not come with candy. This machine is so much fun and takes Quarters, Nickles, Dimes and Pennies. The only thing I want to add is that sometimes even after putting the coin in no gumballs come out  but this can be easily fixed!  Please click this link for a video review made by me!

review/summary: A very good product
review/text: I have not purchased this brand from this company yet, but I am quite familiar with this product as a number of my friends, who I cook with, use them.  These are a bit smaller than the normal size therefore are more suited for appetizers than for the main course.  They are quite strong and very easy to work with.  If you make an error, they let you off the hook.<br /><br />My friends have been delighted with the service this company offers and they have found them, i.e. the company, very easy to work with and more than accommodating.  If you have never used spring roll wrappers, you need to read the directions carefully or work with someone who has experience with them.<br /><br />Having used the product and having dealt with people who have purchased these wrappers, I feel very comfortable in recommending them.

review/summary: Good but...
review/text: I really liked these spring roll wrappers. They're so easy to use and they really taste great. My only problem was that I tried to make a lot of spring rolls so that I could take some to work for lunch and after they're refrigerated, they paper goes back to almost its original consistency. So when I went to take a bite of one at work, it had a hard thick shell around it instead of the paper thin wrapper I was hoping for.<br /><br />Now, this is the first time I have purchased and/or used this product so it could just be that I'm stupid and everyone else knows that you have to eat these right when you're making them. But I had really hoped to be able to save some for a later date so it really disappointed me.<br /><br />But I still really love the wrappers but I just learned that for them to be as good as you want them; they need to be consumed right after being used.

This product contains fresh, fine rice crackers.<br /><br />The only reason this does not get a five star product review is simply that there are too many wasabi peas in the mix, not enough crackers, especially the flavorful golden ones. Also, the Supermarket price of 5$ is just outrageous. The Amazon five pack price is closer to fair.<br /><br />I recommend eating these rice crackers while drinking grean tea.

While many of these may start out as natural like high fructose corn syrup once being corn, it is the processing later that turns it into anything but
