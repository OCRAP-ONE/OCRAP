review/summary: THIS IS IT!
review/text: If you have been looking for the "REAL" theater popcorn flavor, you found it!<br /><br />Very good popcorn. If you use all of the package's ingredients, you might end up with popcorn on the salty side, but that can be adjusted by not using the whole content of the salt package.<br /><br />I have several people tasted this popcorn and they all agree that it tastes like movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I definitively recommend this popcorn.

review/summary: Nice flavor - but extremely salty.
review/text: I purchased the 2.5 bags for my  new Whirley Pop pan. I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie.

review/summary: one chocolate tea to outshine all others?
review/text: I love chocolate and I love tea and it seems only natural to me that the two should be combined into something delicious. Which chocolate tea is the best? I tried four - two loose and two that are pre-packaged in sachets. The four I tried included: Tisano Cacao Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, SerendipiTea ChocolaTea , Guayaki's Organic Mate Chocolatte <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CXRKM">Mate Chocolatte Tea Bags</a>, Zhena's Chocolate Chai - Red Herbal Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>. I like aromatic teas that are packed with flavor and are distinctly chocolaty. Based on these points, here is how I ranked these four teas:<br /><br />SerendipiTea ChocolaTea -- This is my second favorite chocolate tea. It is a loose, black tea so it has caffeine. Before brewing, it has a sweet chocolate smell. Both taste and smell are very much influenced by vanilla. While it has a very rich body, I consider it leagues away from the Tisano Cacao Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a> in terms of raw chocolate taste. The product is about sixteen dollars for 8 ounces. The user needs about a teaspoon of the tea for a full bodied cup. Steeping time is four to five minutes. Ingredients: chocolate, vanilla, rooibos, black tea. According to the product packaging, this product contains trace amounts of dairy. The product reaches the user in a recyclable box.<br /><br />Tisano Cacao Tea - This tea trumps all other chocolate inspired teas I have tried. It tastes like a watered down hot chocolate. The tea has a very rich, dark chocolate smell. It is a loose tea so you will need a tea ball or brewing basket (I like the Finum brewing basket <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU">Finum Goldton Filters</a>.). The steep time is 4-5 minutes. The Tisano Cacao Tea had the smallest number of ingredients - 100% organic cacao shell. The product comes in a small, reusable tin. In terms of cost, expect to pay about fifteen dollars for four ounces. A serving size is three teaspoons per 8 oz cup of water. It is dairy and sugar free and the packaging indicates that it has less caffeine than green tea or decaf coffee. The packaging indicates that this is a product of Venezuela, Peru, Dominican Republic and Ecuador.<br /><br />Zhena's Chocolate Chai - Red Herbal Tea: If you are in a rush and don't want to fool with loose tea, Zhena's makes good tea. Whether this particular blend can be called "chocolate chai" is debatable in my world. If this were a blind tasting, I would never guess this was intended as a chocolate flavored tea. The first ingredient is cacao powder but than followed by a fairly long list of additional ingredients that seem to cancel out the chocolate. I taste a lot of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. This is a tasty tea but largely absent of chocolate flavoring. This tea would make a great dessert tea as it is caffeine free. I drink it fairly frequently in the evening. It also comes in a tin that can be refilled with other tea, pencils or knick knacks and/or recycled. Ingredients: Cacao powder, rooibos, cinnamon, chirory root roasted, ginger, chocolate flavoring, licorice root, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, shortbread flavoring, orange peel, pepper. This product is about six dollars for a tin with 22 sachets and the product made in the United States.<br /><br />Guayaki's Organic Mate Chocolatte -  While this produces a decent cup of tea, out of the four I tried, this was my least favorite. This is a pre-packaged tea that is not as chocolate flavored as I had hoped. Other ingredients overshadow the cocoa flavor. There is a fairly strong stevia aftertaste. If you are a yerba fan, this tea might be great for you since there is a subtle hint of cocoa. I will also note there is no dominant chocolate scent. According to the product packaging, a tea bag contains the caffeine equivalent of 1/4 cup of coffee. Because the product comes in tea bags, you don't have to fool with brewing baskets or tea balls. The brew time on this tea is fairly long - about seven minutes for a good cup so you may need to cover your mug to retain heat or accept that you will be drinking a possibly lukewarm cup of tea. This product is about six dollars for 16 tea bags. It can be found at many grocery stores and on third party sites for this price. Ingredients: yerba mate, cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon, stevia and clove. Each tea bag is individually packaged and all come in a box that can be recycled.

review/summary: Delicious Tea!
review/text: I took a chance buying this tea since there were no reviews.  One of my long-time favorites is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRIA">Bigelow Vanilla Caramel Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, but sometimes my family and I just want something lighter than a black tea.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The Davidson's Tea comes in one large box with a clear resealable bag filled with the tea bags.  These are not individually wrapped, so if you are looking for an on-the-go tea, you may prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00542YRUI">Davidson's Tea Single Serve Coconut Vanilla, 100-Count Tea Bags</a> (which is right now less expensive per unit) or be prepared to carry these in your own baggies.  The bag and the box close back up nicely, so storage is no problem.<br /><br />Taste:<br />We brewed this tea for about 3 minutes.  Everyone had something different to say about the taste of this tea, but what we agreed on was that it was fantastic and became our new favorite!  I thought it tasted like a macaroon, my husband said it smelled like cheesecake, and my mother said it reminded her of chocolate!  In any case, those are all yummy things, so no problems here.  One of this tea's ingredients is rooibos a.k.a. "red tea," which is naturally caffeine-free.  I have tried other rooibos teas that have had a strange sweetness to them, but somehow this blend gets it just right.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very delicious tea that will no doubt disappear quickly in our household.  I'll definitely be reordering this, and I recommend it highly if you enjoy vanilla dessert teas and rooibos.

I would recommend, however, not making it with warm milk, but with hot water and only a little bit of milk or whatever dairy-free creamer you prefer, because it tends to be overwhelmingly heavy, even when made with skim milk.

review/text: This product is excellent!  This is one product that actually lives up to it's label because I have discovered too many times in the past, a "spiced" cocoa turned out to be way too sweet and not spiced at all - this product is different.  I use milk as directed and even with the milk, which normally cuts the heat from chili, the chili has a definite bite in the back of your throat but it is a good bite!  I cannot recommend it highly enough BUT be warned - this is a real spicy cocoa so be prepared for the chili bite!!!  Bottom line - I will definitely buy more of this product.

review/summary: Eye-yi-yi!
review/text: I am a BIG cocoa fan.  I don't like coffee (an unexplainable birth defect) and so I am always searching for new cocoas to add to my repertoire of hot chocolates.  While on travel in Oregon, I came across this spicy cocoa in a local specialty shop.  I bought the adventure-in-a-can because I'm always up for an adventure (unless it involves coffee).  Anyway, I was surprised by its "kick".  I could smell the spice the minute I lifted the lid.  A month later, I have grown very fond of it.  You can tone it down by mixing it with a milder cocoa if you feel like it kicks you into the next room...  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because my quest for the perfect cocoa would be over and, for Pete's sake, we can't have that!  Enjoy!

review/text: A relative gave me a can of this cocoa as a Christmas stocking stuffer last year. This has a slightly spicy kick to it and isn't too sweet.  It's definitely not the bland, sugary syrup that I had when I was a kid.<br /><br />I haven't had hot cocoa in many years but now I'm hooked. This has real cocoa. I bought this on a subscription plan; it is that good.  I prefer it with skim milk.<br /><br />If you haven't had hot cocoa in awhile, you should give this a try.

The bubble gum variety of B-Fresh is noticeably softer than their other varieties; it might not be quite as soft as artificial bubble gums, but for an all natural gum it's surprisingly easy to blow bubbles with. Fun, delicious, and healthful!

If you want to know its effect on the teeth read "Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye!" written by a dentist who says this stuff has been shown to not only NOT cause damage but actually repair teeth. Worth checking into and you can buy Xyletol on Amazon.  Tastes virtually the same as sugar by the way. No funky taste like some of the "fake" sweeteners.

review/text: Our family has gone through a makeover in the way we purchase foods. Thanks to Amazon Prime and subscribe and save we have made a concerted effort to buy foods that contain more natural ingredients and avoiding chemicals and preservatives found in most food products produced by major food companies.<br /><br />This B-Fresh bubble gum tastes terrific, is fun to blow bubbles with and is a much better choice than the junk that is sold in stores. Most major brand gum has either aspartame, sorbitol or both. This is a short cut used by most companies that is bad for kids and adults alike. This B-Fresh gum uses Xylitol which is a natural sweetener that is actually good for your dental health.<br /><br />My kids think this is the best bubble gum they have ever had. I just wish the price would come down. $15 for 50 pieces is expensive but worth it. My guess is over time as it becomes more popular economies of scale will take place.

review/text: I've been buying from Willoughby's for about 4 years anyway, so seeing 5 lb Kenya AA at Amazon was a boost to my coffee habits! Their Kenya AA has the aroma, and the robust good flavor of any great cafe. None of that "burnt" coffee taste of SB's. So if you're a coffee snob, this coffee will become one of your favorites. You can also get other great coffee from their website. They have special roasts, only available on limited basis and, of course, at higher cost. You even can find out more about the coffee plantations they buy from. Thumbs up. I'm on my 4th out of 5 quart-size ziplocs where I'm keeping this coffee and it's remaining fresh and wonderful. Make sure you parse out the coffee into airtight containers until you're ready to grind! (Yes, use a burr grinder.)

I don't know if I'd choose this over Mr. Big, but it's nothing something I'd pick up again.

review/text: I had the pleasure of first enjoying one of these candy bars when I was studying architecture in Paris during the summer of 2003.  They were absolutely delicious, however, upon returning to the US, I could not find them anywhere.  I looked for them for a few years with little success.  I recently looked again and found them on Amazon.  I ordered a box of 12 bars and am currently enjoying them.  They are made by Nestle and so good, I am not sure why they are not available in the US.  Do yourself a favor and try one.

review/text: The description stated 1.83oz bar but we received the smaller 1.5oz bars.  No time to make any changes to order as these were received just in time to put into our Christmas stockings.<br />These did not taste as nice as the fresh (and larger ones) bought back from England two months earlier. Maybe Lion bars, like beer, are best consumed at their place of origin!<br />Will not be ordering Lion bars from this source again.

review/summary: An awesome diet root beer!
review/text: I don't know what the other people have been drinking, but I find the Sodastream diet root beer product to be amazing.  Like all the other Sodastream products, it is made with Splenda instead of Aspartame/NutraSweet.  Wonderful flavor, tastes like a sugared root beer!  There is NO bitter taste associated with it... not sure what the other reviewer was tasting, maybe they had a bad bottle.  I realize root beer tastes vary from person to person -- but this is a very smooth and pleasant taste.  It doesn't have the "bite" associated with some root beer products.<br /><br />I love it.  It has replaced diet caffeine-free cola as my late-night drink of choice.

review/text: The diet rootbeer is not as good as the other diet flavors, such as diet grapefruit, which had a nice flavor. Diet rootbeer is bitter. The flavor is also weak, compared to the other diet flavors. If you add more to get the full flavor, the bitterness of the after taste is horrible. I would not recommend this flavor to anyone, so very disappointing.

It is one of my favorite flavors from Sodastream. Good thing is the Sodastream gives you samples and this is one of the samples you can try. I let my relatives try it out and they all love it as well. There wasn't any after taste which is a plus to me. I do not like Splenda but I do not taste it in this syrup which is a plus for me.<br /><br />I would recommend at least trying it once to see how your taste buds like.

review/summary: Starting here and not going anywhere else!
review/text: I just got a new kitten (ten weeks) from a shelter/foster environment. I was informed he was eating Purina Kitten Chow under their care. My boyfriend is big on eating non-processed, gluten-free products as a human and insisted that cats (he's raised 6 from kittens) should also eat as natural a diet as possible. He pointed me towards several brands that offered grain-free dry food. I picked this one for the simplistic graphics on it's packaging. Right now he is on a 2/3 Kitten Chow, 1/3 Before Grain mix to gradually introduce him to Before Grain.<br /><br />When I got him a few days ago, the fur on his back was dry feeling, almost reminiscent of hay. A few days with even just 1/3 Before Grain, his fur is super soft and silky feeling. I can't stop petting him! If he has a healthy coat, I can't imagine what it's doing to his little growing insides. I can't wait to switch off the Kitten Chow for good. As a new cat supplies consumer, I'm not sure how this is priced compared to similar grain-free dry cat food, but it looked comparable. But so far, this product is great!

I originally bought the Salmon flavor and now I'm trying the Tuna flavor. I highly recommend it. AND, with grain-free foods you will see a substantial decrease in hairballs!

review/text: I have two female Siamese kittens who love this food. When they get into the closet where I keep it, they chew through the bag. They are mostly on a canned food diet, though they still get a little dry food each day in a food ball (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CG40O">PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball, Blue</a>), and they love it. They always come running when they hear the rattling of the food in the ball (if they're not already there watching me fill it up). I have the chicken and salmon dry foods, and though they love both, they seem to like the salmon slightly more. Unfortunately, the salmon is a bit more smelly. I definitely plan on purchasing this product again.

I paid around $11 for this 4 lb package of Morton Salt. Don't do that. You can just go to the grocery store where 1 lb Morton Salt package retails for about 89 or 99 cents. So I could have bought a minimum of 11 lbs of this salt for $11 vs. 4 lbs that I ordered online. Unless you can't get to a store and need to order online, you can save money buy buying it locally.

With one exception, we have been very happy with the Sprout products.  Much better than the Gerber Graduates which are full of sodium.

Some of Sprout's other flavors were big bust, but this one is a winner.  We shake a little sea-salt on it, as it is very low sodium, and the flavors really come out.  I would like to say it is on par with some thing made at home and then slight chopped up.  In other words there is a slight amount of texture to this meal both from the meat, vegetables and pasta.  A definite five star meal when you do not want to cook or going some place where you'll  need more than just a bottle.

While my son likes it and it tastes close to the real thing with strong flavors, I find Sprout baby stage 3 baby foods to be quite oily in general compared to the others.<br /><br />I've tried Sprout's mac&cheese, minestrone, beef lasagna and holiday turkey.  Eat it while it's still at room temp and it leaves a thick oily feeling on the roof of my mouth.  Heat it up in a container and I see runny oil that I'm tempted to drain out.<br /><br />They do taste good though.  Food that taste like the adult food but oily (Sprout), or "beef dinner" that taste only like veggies with no hint of beef (others/non-Sprout).

review/summary: Surprisingly good.
review/text: These taste much better than most shelf stable oriental style foods available in the USA.<br /><br />They use some kind of 'soft cans' a couple of multilayer metal-plastic pouches, one containing about a cup of curry and veggies (almost entirely bamboo shoots), the other a slightly lesser amount of steamed rice.<br />Note that these are not dehydrated foods, you could just eat them straight from the package in a pinch, like K rations. Handy kit for hurricane and other emergency stores. The packaging works really well, leaving the product relatively fresh and tasty even after a year or so. I have to wonder if this has been irradiated, to keep it so nicely without preservatives. (I wouldn't mind, I think irradiating foods is a great idea for some applications.)<br /><br />Spaa claims that one 330 gram (~12 oz) package serves two, at 300 calories each, with 150 calories from fat (all coconut milk I'm sure.) I'd disagree, the amount of food in the box is less than you'd get in a small lunch portion at your favorite thai place for perhaps five to nine dollars. They are also more expensive than a lot of shelf-stable meals, based on Amazon selling them for about $3.00 each in cases of twelve. (I don't recall what we paid at the supermarket.) On the other hand the high quality ingredients, ease of preparation, and excellent flavor make them worth a few dollars more than pot-noodle.<br /><br />I'd have to say this might be the best shelf-stable thai style food I've had, surpassing the fresh curries I've been served in some thai restaurants. Then again those aren't the restaurants I keep going back to ;)

review/text: Amazing deal as of 8.25.11 but as mentioned in an earlier review, it needs to be cut with World's Best to be effective. And despite its claim to be scent free it has a distinct light perfumed smell which does not hide or disguise smell.

review/text: "Scoop Away" cat litter works very well, clumping, and holding in waste, while being free of perfumes and dyes. My cats don't mind it and it is a great deal when order through Amazon and shipped with a Prime membership. I also like that the UPS guy carries it up my steps onto the porch.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Two boxes of Litter were opened prior to shipping!  Not good!
review/text: I ordered Kitty litter by mail as it was the same price as pet store, plus no shipping cost! When it arrived two boxes were opened, and I mean this was not rough play by UPS, the boxes were literally opened and about one quarter of the contents were gone in each box. It took us a while to undue all the boxes after finding the first one and this was so deliberately done. Each box was seperately wrapped, and the reason I ordered this type of box was because the quantity is supposed ot be greater for the same price as other brands. Someone truly is literally stealing Kitty Litter out of boxes, then shipping the rest in orders. They were open at the perforations on the side of the box, the way you normally open Kitty litter boxes, not from mishandling. You would have to see it to believe how much someone just plain stole 1/4 of the litter from each box. Crazy! Not happy about this at all!

review/summary: awful
review/text: I bought this product because I thought it could be healthier for my cats, and other reviews made it sound like it controlled odors the same as other litters.  Sadly, this product was awful.  I have 2 cats, and within 2 days the litter box smelled like cat urine.  I scooped the litter and added fresh litter, but the smell never left.  I have a large litter box and can go 5-7 days usually without any strong odor becoming apparent, so I was very unhappy with this litter.<br /><br />I threw all of the litter out within 1 week, and will never buy this product again.  The smell was just awful, and I ran through litter way too quickly trying to cover up the smell of cat urine.

review/summary: Helps your blood pressure* and tastes decadent
review/text: This brand of chocolate (the dark chocolate 100 gr) was used in a study which showed it to reduce high blood pressure. I don't know if other chocolate does the same thing or not. Probably does. I sure don't recommend you eat a ton of it. I only eat one to three squares. But the taste is wonderful. The outside is not too hard or too soft - just right and the inside is soft and luscious. It's really a treat. If you love chocolate, give it a try. It's not too sweet but it is sweet enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutcheson

review/summary: Instant Butter Flavored Grits
review/text: I remember getting hooked on grits many, many years ago when they had to be cooked from scratch.  A person would add a small amount of grits to quite a bit of water with lots of stirring to keep them from getting lumpy and voila almost a taste of heaven.  I am sure that variety is still available but nowadays with everyone in a big hurry to get nowhere, we do not take time to really enjoy cooking.  Everything has to be fast, fast, fast so we now have instant grits right along side of many other quick to prepare foods.  I hate to say it but instant grits taste just as good or better than the grits that seemed to be hours in making (at least in my memory).  I have purchased one case of 12 count boxes of grits and now am almost out.  Time to start thinking about replenishing my on hand stock.  To me the butter flavored is the best.

review/summary: I thought that I would eat them, but I found another purpose for them!
review/text: I was looking for tootsie pops to replenish my supply. I am diabetic so when I found these miniature pops, I thought it would be a good thing. I mean, there were 200 of them! Turned out that my friend wanted some to, so I ordered a bag for him. He wants to stop smoking and that it would be a good idea to have something to put in his mouth. After a few pops, I realized that I would never get through all of them. What would I do? Around holiday time, I came up with an idea what to do with then. I decided to make holiday bouquets with them. I bunched up 4 lollipops (different flavors) and taped them together and tied a ribbon around them and curled the ends. It looked like a bouquet of flowers except with lollipops! I made 52 of them and gave them as gifts to the nursing home staff where I am living. Everyone was so touched by the unique gifts? They were easy to make and so affordable! It all worked out in the end!

review/summary: Tiny Tootsie Pops...One or two biter
review/text: These are very tiny tootsie pops. I purchased them for those moments when I have a sweet tooth. They are 50 calories per pop. It is very hard to just suck on it without biting into it, just like a regular tootsie pop, so I personally end up biting it and then it's gone in one or two bites because it is so small.  Still, I keep them in my desk drawer but seeing as though there are 200 I am probably going to give some to my nephew and nieces or they will last forever!! All in all, it's a good way to satisfy a sweet tooth without consuming a lot of calories and it's nice to go old school every once in a while and grab a tootsie pop! How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a MINI tootsie pop?...(CRUNCH!!)...The world may never know.

review/summary: No real (vegan) cheese, just a little tiny, very little tiny seasoning sprinkle
review/text: With all due respect, friends, this product seemed to me greatly misleading.  This is no real (vegan) cheese for one to prepare a sandwich or a vegan pizza.  It is just a little--very tiny little--sprinkle that resembles "cheese".  The photograph is quite misleading.  It suggests that we are purchasing something like a cheese pack.  This is not the case.  We are talking about a very, very, tiny bottle (similar to a medication bottle) with not even a handful of "cheese" sprinkle.  It is strictly speaking just a seasoning, not actual, melting, substantial vegan cheese.  Since they sell this cheese-seasoning for over 24 dollars (with shipping) for 4 tiny little bottles, one actually pays 6 dollars a piece...!  How's that!?  I tried to give it a final chance and poured an entire of one of those little bottles over a bread slice in the toaster, just to see what would happen with a little heat.  The thing turned into black ashes.  Six dollars directly into the trash container!  I felt deceived, to say the least.  So, if you are looking for actual, substantial, eatable, melting vegan cheese, try elsewhere (for example, in the US, Daya vegan cheese is my first choice--but there are a few other options and more are being launched in the market).  Peace!  Go vegan!  One day, as we hope, there will be no such a thing as vegan cheese any longer, as all cheese will be vegan, and children will not even know, by then, that there was a time in human journey in which we had to struggle to leave our fellow animals in quiet and peace!  Best regards to all from Brazil!  Claudio

review/summary: The One and Only
review/text: I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online).<br />I love the TASTY HEAT that this product puts into my curry dishes. It is versatile, as I have used it to make beef, chicken, and pork curry (haven't tried to make seafood yet, but soon). This is so much cheaper (per ounce) and tastier than the impotent crap that they put in small fancy glass jars that they overprice and try to pass off as a great product. These companies (can you say Thai Kitchen) that manufacture those imitations probably survive here because most people don't know that they can buy MAE PLOY which is 100 times better. Not only is Mae Ploy tastier, it is also so much cheaper to make sauce with. All you have to do is add coconut milk (less than $1 for 14 a oz can) and/or a little fish sauce(not for me) to match (actually overmatch) the mix that the imitators sell. I also love the fact that I can vary the potency of my sauce because it is not pre-mixed with coconut milk. I once purchased a unauthentic crappy product out of desperation when I first returned to the U.S. in 2007. I used the whole jar (11 1/2 oz) and payed about $5. It was so weak and flavorless. That will never happen again as I keep it well stocked. One jar of this lasts me about 4-5 large curry meals (I always make enough for leftovers as I use two or three cans of coconut cream). So if you make a smaller amount it could last you 8-10 meals. They even make a 35 oz size of Mae Ploy that you can find (google it). Just make sure that you seal up the plastic well before using again (I also refrigerate it after opening).<br />Bottom line though is that this is the BEST and the ONE and ONLY Curry Paste that I will ever use. I never order curry when I eat out because I know it will not be as good as the one that I make at home. Thanks to MAE PLOY RED !! Thanks for reading. Read up on this product and then try it out, you won't be dissapointed.

review/summary: Best brand for Thai red curry
review/text: This is my favorite brand of Thai red curry paste.  We use it to make thai curry at home, because it's soooo simple to make.  Chop 1 onion into chunks, heat up 2 tbsp. of canola oil in a wok or dutch oven, toss in the onions and stir for a minute or so until translucent.  Take 1 tbsp of Mae Ploy red curry paste for a mild curry (use 3 tbsp. if you enjoy spicy foods like jalapenos) and stir into the onions, stir and heat for a minute, then pour in half a can of coconut milk, stir again, and turn heat to medium, toss in 1 lb. of cubed meat (beef or chicken or pork or duck), 2 lime leaves, a few dashes of fish sauce, stir to mix well. Turn heat down to simmer for 15 minutes, add chopped bell pepper strips, bamboo shoots and 2 handfuls of fresh basil, simmer for another 10 minutes. Pour in the remaining half of coconut milk, stir to mix well, then turn off heat immediately. Remove the lime leaves. Serve with steamed rice.<br /><br />The other reason we love Mae Ploy brand so much is because it's the only brand available here locally that has NO MSG, NO PRESERVATIVES. Thank GOD for Mae Ploy !!!

review/summary: Afraid to try it at first but it's THE BEST
review/text: I've only ever used the curry pastes they sell in my local chain supermarket. It comes in a tiny jar, is $7, and has such little flavor I almost need to use an entire jar every time I make curry.<br /><br />After doing some Amazon searches for curry paste this one seemed to have the most, and best, ratings. And it has  A LOT of paste in the container! So I ordered it. I figured if Thai folks use this curry, it must be good.<br /><br />And it is! It's the best, and now my curry rivals that of the local restaurants. We don't go out for curry anymore, since it takes less than 30 minutes to make one that tastes just as good.<br /><br />The container is huge, and it will take months for me to work through it even if I make curry once per week.<br />When I first smelled the curry I was a little afraid to use it. The spices are definitely in there, and I started to sneeze from the chili! But I tried it and all the scariness of the curry went away. It smelled amazing, the amount of kick was perfect, and it was not overwhelming.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and I will definitely stock up. This is cheap, free shipping with Prime, and it's the best curry paste I have ever used.

review/summary: Thai Red Curry Paste...
review/text: Now, I have made many times; shrimp with *long cellophane thin noodles, in a Thai red curry coconut sauce. It was simple to make, but I am certain I left out some ingredients. I never tried the yellow or green curry paste yet. It tasted good to me the way I was making it, so I make it that way as often as I can, which is a couple times a year or more, for about ten years now.<br />All I did was;<br />In a large bowl of fresh, cold water, I would place the cellophane noodles *(we called them 'corn starch noodles), in until they were soaked for a couple minutes giving them a bath, submerging them and then, whilst they were soaking I put in a large frying pan, or wok, 1 can of each: Coconut Milk & Coconut Cream, stirring in as much Red Curry paste as I would like. I learned not too much, because it gets hotter the more you put in. Stirring until blended well and on a medium heat I then added my noodles and cooked them only a few minutes, until tender. Then, since shrimp only take a couple minutes to really cook, no longer than 5 minutes, I would toss them in at the end and serve. That was all I did. Like I said, I saw recipes after I made this and they always add this and that extra, but the simple way I made it was fine for me. To each their own, but it was good. :o)I didn't even need salt or pepper!

review/summary: Great taste, heat and convenience.
review/text: Since I love Thai food and there are no Thai restaurants in my area - AND I've had to go gluten free, which spurs me to investigate all sorts of new-to-me cuisine - I ordered this paste which incorporates the ingredients that are both hard to find here, and difficult to process. (Just TRY to get some galangal around rural parts of New England!)<br /><br />So then I had to learn how to use it. I think... I got it. To jazz up some already-cooked chicken tenders and millet, I used a teaspoon of this Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste, maybe a quarter cup of coconut milk, fresh minced gingeroot (the kind available in US supermarkets) and a couple of teaspoons of ground cumin. Mixed all those together, added my chicken and millet, bopped it in the microwave, and wow, I thought I was transported to a good Thai restaurant in spite of the non-traditional millet in it. The red curry paste has the elusive ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, shrimp paste with Kaffir lime already mixed together so adding the other parts is simple. Wonderful taste, wonderful heat.<br /><br />BTW I carefully cut off one corner of the heavy plastic packaging so that I can squeeze out what I need easily. And it does say to refrigerate after opening, although I suspect the red chili would preserve most anything, including me.

review/summary: Beware it is *hot*
review/text: I bought this curry paste for a recipe and followed the recipe instructions and failed to look at the recommended serving size on the container.  HUGE mistake!  My recipe called for 3TBSP, while the side of the container lists 2tsp as the recommended serving size.  Even after trying to dilute the sauce it is way too hot.  The taste is fabulous but it is HOT, next time I will know to start very, very slow.

review/summary: Mae Ploy Rocks!
review/text: My niece turned me onto Mae Ploy red curry paste and I was hooked. One of my signature dishes now is Thia Curry using what ever protein and veggies I have on hand. It is always delicious. I tried using another brand (Thai Kitchen) once my Mae Ploy was gone. It was not the same. Unfortunately I couldn't find Mae Ploy locally so I had to go on line. Ordering it through Amazon I was able to get it reasonably, though it did take a while for delivery. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Very Authentic!
review/text: I love cooking Thai food at home, but all I can get at my local grocery store is an Americanized version of curry paste -- bland, no heat, barely recognizable as curry. Mae Ploy is the real deal -- intense flavor, VERY spicy and completely authentic. My friends can't tell the difference between my red curry chicken & takeout from a local Thai restaurant now that I've switched to this brand of curry paste. I'll never go back to buying it from the supermarket!

review/summary: Good Flavor and Quality
review/text: This is an item I just cant find at the local supermarket.  Decided to buy online and was pleasantly surprised. I think it is a little too expensive for the quantity (14oz does not go very far for the Thai dishes that I make), but the quality of the product was very good and I have now purchased this a couple of times through Amazon.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: This is my favorite red curry paste currently on the market. I enjoy each of the Mae Ploy curry pastes in their own applications. I really like the red curry for making peanut sauces and soups. I've tried many a powder and paste, but this brand seems to have the best flavor. I also really like that there are no artificial ingredients.

review/summary: Best Red Curry Paste I've Ever Used
review/text: I love red curry. In efforts to recreate my favorite restaurant dishes, I've tried red curry pastes from Thai Kitchen, Trader Joe's, Berkeley Bowl, and Mae Ploy. Mae Ploy blows the competition out of the water - I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The only caveat: the price on Amazon seems to be higher than the price in stores ($1-$5?). Do your own comparison.<br /><br />Happy eating!

review/summary: The Good Stuff, Minus the Packaging
review/text: I can confirm that this is the exact curry paste used in many Thai restaurants - I've worked in one where this was the case.<br /><br />I don't particularly enjoy the smell of this product, but the taste is quite good and will produce a nice result. The minor problem is that the actual paste comes packed in a vacuum-sealed bag that itself is stuffed in the tub. This doesn't make much sense to me; why not just seal the tub itself? The paste can be easily popped out of the bag, however.<br /><br />This is a cost-efficient way to produce curry at home. Using three tablespoons of paste for each curry, you'll get about eight uses per 14oz tub. Try it.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor. I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand. Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types.

review/text: My favorite is the Mae Ploy Panang style curry paste, but the red is an excellent choice. Not as hot as the Panang, but great classic red curry flavor.
