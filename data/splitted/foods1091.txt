review/summary: Low fat, high fiber meal replacement bar
review/text: I eat a high protein meal replacement bar every day for breakfast, and I have lost several pounds.  The bar is high in protein, which does keep you fuller longer.  By lunchtime I am usually pretty hungry, but I can hold out until lunchtime without a problem.  They are a bit dry, so I always have a drink on hand while eating them.  The chocolate flavor is great, not that cheap tasting chocolate that usually comes with diet products.  The bar has a nice chew, but isn't overly chewy, nor does it stick to the teeth.  They have a good flavor - not the best bar I have ever eaten as far as taste goes, but better than tolerable for sure.  These bars are lower in fat content to some of the Slim Fast meal replacement bars, which is why I tried them in the first place.<br /><br />This high fiber bar will keep you feeling full for several hours, and replacing a meal a day with them does create results.  Following their diet plan of two meal replacement bars a day with three snack bars will more than likely increase weight loss from the few pounds I have lost eating one bar a day.

review/summary: Tastes like candy bar, yet nutrition is comparable to other protein bars
review/text: I'm always looking for protein bars because protein makes you feel fuller longer and I have an "on the go" schedule.  I tried all 3 flavors of these bars because they were on sale.  I was NOT disappointed.  When I bit into the first one (double-chocolate), I did a double-take because it was so good.  I had to re-verify that it was a protein meal bar because NONE of the others I've tried were this good.  Not chalky, not too dense, just like a crunchy kind of snack bar.<br /><br />I then figured it must contain much higher calories than the others out there because it was so good.  Not allowed to paste urls here, but Google this: "Nutrition Bar Comparison Chart, Arranged Alphabetically by Product Name."  It's an AZ govt list of meal bars.  It didn't include the Special K bars, so I had to write it in, but this stacks up against the others.  10g of protein, 5 of fiber, 170 calories.  Also contains vitamins, which is required to be allowed to be called a "meal replacement bar."<br /><br />I normally have mine with 8 oz of skim milk for breakfast, which gives me 18 g of protein in one meal.  (I'm told to aim for 25g/meal)  It satisfies me till lunch and sometimes I have to skip lunch because of a busy schedule so I repeat the bar with the milk and am usually good till just before dinner.  My teen son claims it satisfies him for a few hours too.  He loves them too.  We went through them so fast that I came to Amazon to see what kind of deal I could get on them.  They have a subscription plan which saves quite a bit of money.  I started with 6 boxes and we're already running low and that was a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Few notes: if you're trying to keep sugar and fructose out of your diet, this isn't for you.  It's got those, but again, the total calories is 170/bar, comparable or less than the other protein bars out there.<br /><br />Also, for some reason, Amazon charges about $1 more/box for the double chocolate and the strawberry.  I did like both flavors, but the DC had slightly more calories and fat so to save on that and the extra buck per box, I went with the chocolately chip for my subscription.  It's still delish.<br /><br />Price-wise: if you opt to not do the subscription, the $15 price ($5/box) is still the best I could find.  These are running about $7-9 per box in the stores.<br /><br />This is like the best-kept secret out there!!

review/summary: Kellogg's Special K Protein Meal Bar Chocolately Chip
review/text: This ABSOLUTELY blows away its competition on the basis of taste!  Imagine eating a yummy candy bar, without being guilty of short-changing yourself on nutrition!  I compared the nutritional content of this product with that of two products in the same category produced by other manufacturers.  This product rated last of the three, in that respect.  (The other two candidates, while also resembling candy bars, were relative duds in my taste test).  I'm NOT claiming that a steady diet of these would be a healthy/appropriate diet for anyone--but moderation is a wonderful thing & so is this product!

review/summary: Tastes great, almost too tempting
review/text: I've eaten one of these each morning for the last few weeks and I have found that for the most part they keep me satisfied until at least close to lunch time (might be hungry the last hour or so).<br /><br />The chocolate chip is my preferred flavor amongst the ones I've tried. The taste is close to a candy bar and the texture makes you feel like you're eating something relatively substantial. Some of the other breakfast bars I've eaten try to go light on calories and end up being either dense and small or very airy and you don't seem to be chewing much of anything. I think these have found a better balance.<br /><br />If I had one negative comment about them it might be that they're almost a touch too tempting. If I'm on a restricted calorie diet I always find that my will power is lowest late at night and early in the morning (really whenever I'm tired) and sometimes having just one bar for breakfast is difficult and I find myself nearly running out the door to avoid having another. If you find yourself in the same boat and are trying to control your calorie intake it might be helpful to have something less tempting on hand. If not these are a pretty good breakfast option that can help to control your appetite and get you to lunch with your calorie deficit intact.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />Tasty bars<br />Good texture that makes you feel like you're eating something substantial<br />Perhaps a bit too tasty if you have trouble having sweets in the house

review/summary: A Tasty Meal Alternative
review/text: I originally bought these protein meal bars for myself as a quick breakfast replacement, but my young son started eating them as "chocolate bars" when he sort of went on strike and stopped eating typical breakfast foods.  He is an extremely picky eater and these bars have been a real lifesaver in terms of getting him some of the basic nutrition he needs!  He eats these once or twice a day, for breakfast and/or lunch, along with yogurt and cheese, and I feel just a tiny bit better about his nutrition than feeding him Pop Tarts or cinnamon rolls (which is all he would eat otherwise).

review/text: Taste is in the eye of the beholder I suppose...all I can say is I really enjoy these bars.  I think they taste great especially in comparison to other protein bars I have had which are on the market.  And they are quick and easy.

I have lost 50 pounds cutting out the garbage, eating at regular intervals and eating a very high fiber diet and these bars have been an integral part of that regiment.

I also love the value that you get from buying a 3-pack through Amazon.  I have ordered these 5-10 times prior, and they were usually so incredibly fresh.  However, when I ordered them most recently in early 2012 they were stale to the point that they were inedible.  As this appears to be an issue with more than my order I am quite hesitant to order again.  Maybe there could be some sort of quality control in your warehouse?

It is not vinegary, so, while it does have a subtle flavor, it is an excellent choice if you only want to make foods spicy without noticeably changing their already pleasing flavor. For instance, this sauce is fabulous on a good grilled hamburger, barbecue and spaghetti. Let me warn you, though. I only put 3 to 4 drops of it on a burger. You go splashing it all over supper and you'd better have a plan B. The good news is that a bottle of it lasts a long time.

review/text: I first had this at a local Mexican restaurant and went crazy for it, even though I thought I might die of the heat.  I am a huge, yet disciminating, fan of hot suaces in general but this is by far my favorite right now.  I can handle a lot of heat as a regular hot sauce eater but this stuff is on a different scale than what you can get at the grocery store.  My husband won't come near this stuff.  It is so good I want to pour it on whatever I'm eating but it is sooooo hot I have to find that threshold of barely tolerable heat before it's so much I can't take it.  Of course, with continued dosage I can do more over time.  Our Publix and Kroger doesn't carry it so I have to go to the mercado/taqueria and can only get the 4 oz. version so this time I actually bought three 8 oz. bottles here on Amazon (fiendish, I know).<br /><br />The flavor is excellent, uncomplicated and straight forward like fresh green habaneros blended with a bit of salt and a bit of vinegar.  It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it.  Also, the color is fabulous.  I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green.  Love it.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch.  The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.<br /><br />So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people.

It does have some heat to it but the flavor of this sauce is really nice as well.  It is quite thick and when used at the rate of a tablespoon in a bowl of chili, you may notice a slight sweat forming on your brow.  That is what I am looking for when I eat spicy foods...

review/summary: Pretty Good Hot Sause For Soups & What Not
review/text: I like this hot sause also, not as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOMQ9E">El Yucateco XXXtra Hot Kutbil-ik Mayan Style Habanero Hot Sauce - 4 oz</a> tho. I have a hard time eating this sause when its dumped over a plate of Mexican food. I use to to heat up weak salsa, add a little kick to soups and what not. The flavor is good, but theres just something about it. I have alot of both sauses stocked up for survival / food storage reasons. It's something to have on hand during hard times. I buy mine from out local Mexican Tienda which we just got not too long ago, anyways if you want to try something hotter then this sause give that Mayan sause a try and be careful with it.

review/summary: Good flavor, great with Mexican dishes
review/text: El Yucateco makes a bangin' sauce.  It's fairly thick and sticks well to food (not too runny).  It's sweet, and it's got a little bit of kick to it.  I'd give it a 4/10 for heat, a 7 or 8 for flavor.<br /><br />My only issue is that it only tastes good on Mexican food.  I've tried it on pizza and eggs (staple hot sauce foods for me) and I was left disappointed.  But on a taco?  This hits the spot.

It's not vinegary like Tabasco and it's thick kinda like ketchup. The green color is quite bright and appealing.<br /><br />I give it four stars because it has preservatives and artificial colorings.

review/summary: Quite Hot -  If you want pure heat this may be you your sauce. Yet there are even hotter ones but do you really care?
review/text: This GREEN Habanero sauce is quite potent. Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.<br /><br />The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.<br /><br />This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Habanero Pepper, Salt, Acetic Acid (a chemical component of vinegar), .... etc<br /><br />Conclusion: There is nothing special about this sauce beyond its considerable and concentrated heat. While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.<br /><br />Yet that my be all you want. A potent heat source and this one certainly meets that mark!<br /><br />If you decide to order this sauce --- Watch the seller's shipping charges which can often be excessive and won't drop even if you order multiple bottles at the same time.<br /><br />I'd pass on this hot sauce because of its lack of character - 3 stars is about right. But if you are looking for just pure heat then give it 3 or 4 stars or even 5 stars.<br /><br />If you want even more heat then look for a Habanero sauce that does not list water as its first (therefore major) ingredient. There are other Habanero sauces which are even hotter but I'll confess I'm not a big fan of tasteless but ultra hot chile sauces.<br /><br />Tastes do differ so you may want to try this one. In all fairness I gave it three stars because it offered pure heat without any obvious flaws.

review/summary: Darned good for a packaged cookie
review/text: Unlike some of the other reviewers here, our packages of cookies arrived intact, sometimes even overly packaged in that unique-to-Amazon way.  Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies.

In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.<br /><br />The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.

Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house.

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Coconut Cookies not so yummy - but Amazon was great!
review/text: I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies "best if eaten by date" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great.

review/summary: Superior to Chips Ahoy!
review/text: I used to buy Chips Ahoy! brand cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood. It had been years since I even tried a Keebler brand cookie and one day I found them on sale. I found that Keebler Chips Deluxe originals are thicker, fresher, more crumbly (although very few if any were broken in the package), and overall much more melt-in-your-mouth delicious than Chips Ahoy! originals which were thinner, a little harder, and almost a bit stale-tasting. If I remember correctly, the Chips Deluxe cookies package has 2 ounces more in it. I've never been a fan of the soft batch.

Often overshadowed by Chips Ahoy's Chewy Cookies in marketing and sales, "Soft 'n Chewy" cookies from Chips Deluxe are worth trying if you enjoy cookies that are, well, soft and chewy. I would say these are just as delicious as Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but they are also thicker and usually cheaper. Pick one up today and the people in the house with sweet tooths will gobble them up quickly.

review/summary: 1 gram of trans-fat per 16 grams of cookie!
review/text: As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook "nutritional epidemiology", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."

review/summary: Nice healthy food -Udate - New grain free flavors!!
review/text: I like this food for my dog. Avaoderm seems like a repudable company. Dogfoodadvisor is a good website to go to to find good information about all kibble and wet food. My dog likes this food, and did very well on it. Her coat was super soft and she had lots of energy. I just noticed during the summer months her urine burned the grass. After some reading on the subject I found that high fish and beef diets can increase the uric acid in dogs and cause burn spots on your grass. Once off the fish and beef soley foods the urin grass burns stopped.<br /><br />Update: Avoderm just came out with a revolving grain free line of kibble. Turkey, Duck, and Trout. My dog is on the Turkey and loves it. She is allergic to Chicken. Even though this has chicken fat in it, it's the chicken protein she is allergic to and chicken fat does not contain the protein. I buy thick slices of fresh, low sodium turkey at the deli and top the food with peices of turkey and she eats everything. I could barely get her to eat once a day and now she is eating 2 -3 times a day and seems to be enjoying it. So far Petsmart, and Webers is the only ones carrying it. I give the Turkey a 5 stars!!!

review/text: My chihuahua/dachshund developed a horrendous skin allergy which got worse when he went outside. He scratched so much, we took him to the vet for a shot, prednisone and antibiotics. I had read about the benefits of Avoderm, and already was feeding them this dog food. I also have a miniature schnauzer. I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them "All Stages no grain" dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased.

review/summary: Healthy, restorative dog food
review/text: We have an old Jack Russell who started exhibiting stress-related problems after our other dog died. Her skin was looking bad and she was chewing on her own feet and legs. I suspected that depression was suppressing her immune system from the loss of her housemate. So I ditched her garden-variety lamb/rice dog food and got her this grainless salmon potato blend instead. It worked! She stopped chewing herself and the skin irritations from that cleared up. She still has some other bumps but she is generally very improved and no longer presents stress-related behaviors or symptoms. Best of all, with this food her poop stopped stinking. Salmon! Go figure.

review/summary: Very Good Dog Food For Dry Skin & High Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to almost all major ingredients in almost all dog food. I feed him RAW food but it's getting kind of expensive. He doesn't like eating chicken. Which is the cheapest of all RAW food. He is highly allergic to beef, turkey, duck, egg, wheat, soy, barley, sweet potato, and his list goes on =( So its very hard to find a dog food that has nothing he is allergic too. Have tried so many brands it's unbelievable. Because even if one item is on the very bottom of the list he would break out everywhere for days. his nose turn pink etc. I feed him raw food which he loves and has no problem at all but we travel & sometimes its very hard to have raw meat with you. So it's just a bit easier if he ate kibbles. His poop is solid hard with Avoderm Salmon Grain Free. His coat is shiner & soft. The only thing I don't like about this is that Peas is the 1st ingredients on the list. Also tomato pomace is a controversial ingredient most people say its a by-product remaining after processing tomatoes into juice, soup and ketchup.<br />But so far my dog is very happy eating this and he can't wait until it's time for him to eat.<br /><br />But I will keep looking for something better which is really hard unless I make my own dog food which I don't have time for =(

review/summary: LUV THE MAYO BUT NOT THE PRICE!!!
review/text: There's no way anyone over at Amazon can justify the price for this stuff.  It seems there's not enough competition in the mayo business these days and Hellmans/Amazon has taken full advantage of the deficit.  While the mayo is great compared to just about all other brands, there is no justification for the price other than the shear lack of competition.  Someone needs to start making real mayo like this.  Its very basic in content and is good for that reason.  The simple process for making it though also make the price unacceptable.  Seems like all sorts of items being made today fall into the same snakepit of greedy business'  I for one refuse to pay this kind of bucks for this kind of product.  Walmart won't even carry it anymore because of its price.  I recommend you get a good mayo recipe and make your own for a lot less money.

review/text: The "most critical" review says:<br /><br />Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange!<br />The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry!<br />- - -<br />A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different. As stated above, they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare. I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags. I wondered how they could do this. What I got before was 5 flavors, 4 tea bags each. Yes, 5 times 4 = 20. How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags? Well, I found out today when I received the package, the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags, being two of the better flavors, Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion. Doh!

review/text: I am a big fan of Celestial Seasonings fruit teas and I can say the same about the sampler. However, the product is not as described, as you will not receive the Cranberry Apple Zinger or Tangerine Orange Zinger. Instead, you receive Wild Berry and True Blueberry, the latter being a flavor that I'm really not fond of. The proportions are also not equal, as you receive 4 teabags in 3 flavors, and 3 teabags in the more popular flavors (Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion, two of my personal favorites). Also, the price has increased from around $15 back in September to almost $18 as of today, and it isn't worth it for the limited variety.

review/summary: MIsleading Description
review/text: The tea's fine but the flavors shown in the item picture and listed in the product description were not the same as received earlier in the week.  Cranberry and Tangerine were replaced by Wild Berry and True Blueberry. I called this to Amazon's attention after receiving mine.<br /><br />Now the photograph appears to have finally been updated but the "Product Features" is still reading:<br /><br />"Includes four bags of Raspberry Zinger, Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, Cranberry Apple Zinger, and Tangerine Orange Zinger"<br /><br />At least they're making an effort so this review is based on the tea itself.<br />It's pretty good but personally I think the flavors of most of the Celestial Seasonings fruit teas I've tried thus far are somewhat weak unless brewed for a full 5-6 minutes.  The peach especially benefits from a little extra time, after which it becomes very good and most soothing - more peach pie than fresh peach.  The no individual packaging is nice and convenient but, really, would a couple inches of string be that much of a strain on the environment?  Really, really hate having to dig the bag out with a fork.

review/text: I bought this sampler specifically because I already love the cranberry-apple flavor and thought I would like the others too.  Well, the package I received did not include the cranberry-apple (as listed in the product description) and it also did not include the tangerine flavor which I was looking forward to trying.  Instead it has blueberry and wild berry, both flavors that I'm not excited about.  I have tried a few of the flavors and they are pretty strong, fake fruit taste which is not what I was going for.  In the future I am going to stick to the cranberry-apple, which is delicious.

review/summary: Not worth the money!
review/text: Though the tea itself is good, the buyer pays in two ways for the privelege of having multiple flavors: first, they charge more for this box and then they give 2 flavors in each individual box one less tea bag - this results in a net loss of 24 tea bags overall as there are 6 individual boxes in each large box.  I feel that one or the other would have been sufficient, but the two together is just too much to pay for the convenience of having several flavors on hand.  However, if you want to get it one time to check out the different flavors to see which you might like to purchase later, then it is a decent deal.

review/text: I love tea.  There are lots of flavored teas, but the only flavored ones I really like are the fruit ones.  Therefore, this box of tea is what I buy.  So many variety packs have at least one or two flavors that I don't like.  But this box has only has flavors that I do like.  My favorite is the peach, and then the black cherry.  Next is orange, raspberry, and cranberry apple.<br /><br />I love this particular tea.  It is perfect because of all the lovely flavors.  They are all rich and fruity - the perfect amount of flavor.  Like I said earlier, the peach is my favorite flavor.  I am a peach person - I love fresh peaches, but can only get them in the summer.  Peach tea is heavenly.  The other flavors are awesome, too.

review/text: These teas are so yummy and a great introduction to the Celestial fruit teas. Individual tea bags are placed into larger wrapping in the box. When you unwrap the larger wrapping, the teas smell so fragrant. The teas don't come with individual tea tags, which I thought was kind of annoying at first because I would have wanted to take the tea bags out once they steep, but in consideration of the teas being eco-friendly, alright! My favorite among the bunch was the passion tea.

review/summary: A great variety of warm fruit flavored teas
review/text: I was never much of a hot beverage drinker until recently.  In fact, these are the first tea bag products I have ever tried! But I must say that the Fruit Sampler is both a great variety and great value.  Each of the flavors are distinct and aromatic.  I typically combine 1 packet of Splenda, 8 ounces of boiling water and 1 tea bag to a ceramic mug and wait about 5-10 minutes for the flavors to seep while the beverage cools.  When I reach the bottom of the mug, I often pour in an additional 8 ounces of water and a bit of sweetener and the second cup is equally flavorful! My pleasant experience with these teas caused me to expand out a bit and try some other flavors and varieties as well (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LQU">Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red Tea</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OII">Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice Tea</a>).  I am especially partial to the blueberry and cherry flavors.  These teas lend themselves well to additional little seasoning.  For instance, I sometimes add a bit of lemon or orange peel or perhaps a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg to give them a little extra pizzazz.  Overall: I'm very pleased and continue to keep my pantry stocked with these refreshing and flavorful beverages.

review/text: Nice relaxing fruit tea to enjoy on the porch or at work.  Product is caffeine free.  I purchased on a whim looking at the ingredients: hibiscus, chamomile, rose hips, orange peel, blackberry leaves, sounded great but did not expect fruit flavorings.  I guess I thought it had dried fruit in it?  This tea is good and it makes me sleepy.  The package has a good variety but after sampling all the flavors I don't think that fruit "flavored" tea is for me.  I prefer the organic green.  ***UPDATE***  After continuing to drink this tea to use it up, I discovered that it is growing on me.  I think I will purchase again in the future.  Thank you Amazon!!!

review/text: I liked being able to get a whole lot of tea in one go, it comes with a lot of tea with some variety. Each type of tea is put in its own cute little package inside the tea box.<br /><br />I am not partial to the flavors. They seem to artificial to me. Without sweetener, they don't have much flavor, and with sugar they taste a little like kool-aid. The berry flavors were the best, the peach is not palatable.<br />NOTE that the product description on this page is (currently) INCORRECT. Go by the picture for the flavors included.<br /><br />A single tea bag could be used for two cups of tea, but was best for only 1 cup, maybe a cup and a half.<br /><br />All in all, convenient package, I like the variety, but only so-so flavors. I would not purchase any of the teas individually, and will not restock my tea cupboard with the sampler.<br /><br />Update 1-7-11:<br />I have tried a couple new variety packs, and recommend either this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE">Stash Premium Green Tea</a> variety pack, which has some fruit flavors that are delicious, or this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92">Stash Premium Herbal Tea</a> variety pack which I like much better than the Celestial package.

review/summary: tastes ok
review/text: I bought this item on a deal and because it had good reviews. I am not very impressed by this. The taste is ok. I have tried 2 flavors. The taste is very artificial and close to same. I would not recommend to buy it.
