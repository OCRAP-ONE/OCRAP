review/summary: Not that great
review/text: These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed.

review/summary: Pretty Good for what is is
review/text: For what is is, this cookie is pretty good. Does it taste like the soft, under-baked, buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe? No, however it does satisfy a sweet tooth. In my opinion these taste just like a "less sweet" version of the chips ahoy brand I ate as a kid.

review/summary: Just like Snickerdoodles!
review/text: This cookies are really tasty and I will definitely be reordering.  I ordered the package of 16 small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free, and I'm glad I ordered this product. If one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable. The little bag of 4 cookies helps me with portion control because if I had the whole box I would probably plow right through them.  They are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony Snickerdoodles; there is no weird aftertaste as with many GF foods. (I have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland; they would be good with coffee.) I've even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but haven't tried that yet (would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags).  The cookies are very crispy, so if that is an issue for you, take note. (I know my false-toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them, but I believe he would think they were worth it!)

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!

review/summary: Very tasty cinnamon thins
review/text: These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low-fat, fattening, gluten-free, low carb, etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten-free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you "dunk" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.

review/summary: Yummy, little crunchy cookies
review/text: If you have serious food allergies or gluten intolerance, you probably bake your own (and aren't reading this review) -- but what a joy to find Dr. Lucy's cookies in Starbucks recently!  Yes, these are boxed cookies, not to be confused with homemade, which is the sterling standard for me.  But given that, they're lovely!  The body of the cookie is slightly bean-flavored, since that's what the flour blend relies on; but it's not an obtrusive flavor.  Just a bit tangy.  The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea. Our favorite is the chocolate chip variety, but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also.  If you're not allergic yourself, but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are, then I'd encourage you to go for it.  You'll find you munch on them, too, because they're just yummy, little crunchy cookies.

review/text: I discovered these at my local Starbucks and loved them. The sugar cookies are wonderful, have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste. The easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste & remind me of Christmas sugar cookies. The chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite. It's so hard to find gluten-free snacks that taste great and don't leave you yearning for a " real " snack. Buy them !

review/text: I have 15 documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies.  These are the best allergy friendly cookies I have tasted yet!  I tried them for the first time today.  I needed to use up a Starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store.  Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland, dry, grainy taste of most GF cookies. Also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products I have tried.  You will not be disapointed in these.

review/summary: Crispy Airy
review/text: These are fabulous! I saw in an online review of Dr. Lucy's cookies someone complaining about broken cookies when they arrived. Yes, some of the cookies will be broken, though not a lot. I think they break because of their unusual texture. I wish I knew the trick of making a cookie like this. They taste great, but a big part of what I just love about these cookies is their texture -- it's that airyness and crispness. Personally, they are addictive. I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat -- one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!

I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago, I ordered another box of these and the Sugar cookies (they are wonderful, too!) and I even ordered the Oatmeal ones so I can try those and see if they are as good as the others. I highly recommend these!

review/text: My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!

review/text: I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies - there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!

review/text: These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating.

review/text: These cookies are the best.  They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream.  The reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something I can't taste at all; these are yummier than all the wheat-based commercial sugar cookies I've tasted.

review/summary: Truly the best!
review/text: As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.<br />I do like Pamela's brand Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.<br />And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.<br />But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.<br />Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.<br />No problem here though, only 1.5-2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.<br />I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint.

review/text: Dr. Lucy has created an absolute masterpiece. These cookies are delicious for everyone. There are so many additives in today's food, that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural.  You also have the feeling that you can trust this product, since you know that she created this for her own child. The calorie count is less than other cookies, and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do. I highly recommend this product, as well as her other cookies. While I do love chocolate chip, my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: What a Treat!
review/text: I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product!

review/summary: Run...Don't Walk to Purchase Lucy's Cookies
review/text: As a relative of a child with severe food allergies, i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit.  Until i heard of (then tasted) these gems! Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies, they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy, i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware, you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)

review/text: Absolutely delicious cookies - crisp & crunchy, but not hard; sweet, but not too much so. Since a lot of the gluten-free foods I've tried have left (IMHO) something to be desired, these were a very pleasant surprise. The grandkids love them too - a true test of cookie goodness.<br /><br />I can buy these locally for about $3 per 5.5 ounce box. I offer this info so that buyers can decide if Amazon's current price, whatever it may be, is a bargain.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie.

They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea, Hands Down!
review/text: When I first picked up a tin of this tea it was at a local health food store, and completely on a whim because I felt like the blend was interesting. I wasn't sure what to expect with rose flavored tea, but upon brewing my first cup I knew I'd made the right choice. Almost immediately, the boiling water I'd poured over top of the tea bag began to turn this really rich reddish pink color... almost identical to the darkest pink on the front of the tin. Also I might add, the aroma was absolutely divine! I was definitely able to pick up the delicate rose scent underneath the more pronounced raspberry, and the taste of the tea was very similar.<br /><br />What I really love about the Republic of Tea blends is that no one flavor ever seems to overpower the others in my opinion. This is the case with far too many other brands, and if one flavor completely buries something I was looking forward to tasting that just ruins the tea for me. What you get with this blend is an insanely delicious hibiscus tea (I'd go so far as to say it's the best of their hibiscus line in fact) with a pronounced but not overpowering taste of raspberry along with the rose overtones. Each flavor really complements the other, and nothing feels out of place. It's just simply perfect in my eyes.<br /><br />If I could compare this tea to anything, I'd probably say it reminds me a bit of Celestial Seasoning's Raspberry Zinger but with a hint of rose, and perhaps less zing... although this tea far exceeds that description. It's something that has to be tried to be appreciated, and because it's a limited time seasonal release (what could be better for Valentine's Day than some of this tea!) you'll want to stock up soon!<br /><br />And if you're a huge fan of this blend like me and you're looking for a better deal, visit the manufacturer's website and pick it up in bulk. At around 18 cents per bag, their 250 count offering is a frugal way to assure you can enjoy this tea year round!

review/text: Does not replace powder but i find they are convenient for quick trips out of the house. I think these at least twice as expensive per fl oz when compared to powder so we only use them when we go out and do not have/want to go through the process of mixing powder and water.<br /><br />Not sure, but i will assume that some kind of preservative is used in the nursettes that allows them to keep for so long, so i just feel better using powder more often than not.

No better way of showing people how much you love them than by giving them pure, delicious food, including healthy quality deserts. Yes I said healthy deserts, if you include fruit, whole grains, eggs and milk in your deserts you are taking care of the sugar craving as well as sneaking healthy food in. Try a homemade cereal bar made with organic sugar. YUM.

review/summary: This gum is really great!
review/text: If you have problems with Aspartame (which is in every gum out there...not just sugarfree gums) and you love to chew gum then SteviaDent is really the only option unless you want to eat TicTacs.  It is really good although quite expensive, but completely worth it to me so as not to compromise my health.  I chewed every gum out there and lots of it, but had recently started to notice a painful lump on the roof of my mouth. My immediate reaction was...of course cancer, but I had 2 dentists and an oral surgeon check it out and all confirmed it was not. Not only that, Aspartame upset my stomach to the point that I had an extreme amount of bloating and gas every day.  I didn't initially attribute either of these things to Aspartame, but when I started to notice the lump was bigger and more painful upon chewing my old gum, I started doing my research and Aspartame turned out to be the culprit. I ended up ordering a case of the SteviaDent and pitched everything I owned that contained Asapartame.  The lump on the roof of my mouth disappeared within 2 days of not ingesting aspartame and my stomach bloating and gas completely went away.  Worth spending the extra $ until more gums start making their product with Stevia instead of Aspartame.

review/summary: Stevia sweetened?? Not really, don't be deceived.
review/text: Here are the ingredients that are on the label:<br />Ingredients: Gum Base, Maltitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol, Glycerine, Natural Flavor, Gum Arabic, Stevita Stevia extract, Resinous Glaze, Soy Lecithin, Carnauba Wax<br /><br />This is NOT a stevia sweetened product, not as one would expect with something called "Steviadent" and with "Stevia Dietary Supplement" on the front of the package. Stevia shows up #8 on the ingredient list even AFTER Glycerine, Natural Flavor, Gum Arabic. And the term "natural flavor" can mean anything at all. The manufacturer doesn't have to tell you what it is because it is considered "proprietary information"--could be ANYTHING, most likely something artificial, unnatural and most probably, something unhealthy or else the manufacturer would be proud to list it openly.<br /><br />I made the mistake of ordering this gum without checking the ingredients first. I even popped one into my mouth. It was pretty bad both in taste and texture; had to throw away the rest.<br /><br />There's another sugar-free gum that has less nasty ingredients:<br />It's Xlear Inc. Spry Xylitol Gum<br />Ingredients: Xylitol, gum base, natural flavor (spearmint oil), vegetable glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin, beeswax.<br />It still has Xylitol in it which some people's systems can't tolerate but generally most people can and so far, research shows that the only "side effect" is loose bowels in some people. That might be a plus for some folks!<br /><br />Spry Gums have a much nicer texture and taste in my opinion and come in several different flavors and in jars of 100 and even 600. So the savings is phenomenal.<br /><br />Made with non-GMO Xylitol made from corn.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Xlear-Peppermint-Sugar-100-Pieces/dp/B000COIT8Y/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1342563776&sr=8-4&keywords=Xlear+Inc+Spry+Xylitol+Gum<br /><br />PS: there are much better stevia products available anyway.

review/text: Just like the other reviewer, I got all the aspartame out of my life.  I did not realize it was one of the major causes of migraines, which I had a problem with for quite a while.  Since cutting out aspartame and most processed foods, I haven't had a single migraine.  But I had also quit smoking years before that and haven't been able to live without gum since.  I used to chew Trident with Xylitol (instead of aspartame), but my holistic doctor tossed that out, as all the chemicals in mainstream gum are also migraine triggers.  So, I tried every natural gum I could find.  This is the only one that is actually in the ballpark with mainstream gum.  One of the other reviewers said that the flavor was weak and didn't last long, which compared to Trident, is true.  Trident et al. use chemicals to overpower your mouth with flavor.  Steviadent is a more mild flavor (just give it a couple weeks and your tastebuds will get used to not being overpowered and enjoy the calm mint flavor).  Compared to all the other sugarless, natural gums, Steviadent blows them out of the water.  The other natural gums I tried, lose their flavor immediately then taste like rubber and become really stiff.  Steviadent maintains its flavor and when the flavor fades, it stays soft and just tastes flavorless, like any mainstream gum.  So, if you are looking for a chemical-free, aspartame-free gum, this is the best one currently available.

review/text: The taste is fine, but the flavor is a little weak and does not last long.  Additionally, there seems to be variations in the strength of the flavor between pieces in the same pack.  I have had 10-12 packs of the stuff.  Maybe their quality control will get better with time or maybe I just got a bad box.  I suppose if you are a big gum chewer the slightly bland taste is acceptable to avoid the refined sugar or artificial sweeteners, but I think I'd rather spend my money on something else.

review/summary: Great gum with no sugar, aspartame, or sucralose!
review/text: After years of pressure from my wife, I've finally agreed to give up all artificially sweetened products.  I didn't want to add more refined sugar to my diet, so I assumed that I would simply have to do without many products.  One of the main reasons I resisted this change is because I am a frequent gum chewer.<br /><br />I discovered SteviaDent on Amazon via a Google search, read the ingredients, and decided to give it a try.  I had low expectations because I've been very dissatisfied with other sugar-free, aspartame-free, or sucralose-free gums.  To my surprise, SteviaDent is a much better product!  The mint flavor is good and long lasting.  The texture (mouth feel) is much more like regular gum than other products I've tried.  I'm very happy with the product.  This gum has satisfied my craving and makes my wife happy since I am no longer chewing sugar, aspartame, or sucralose!<br /><br />The only negative I've experienced with the product are the frequent and large percentage price changes on Amazon.  I've delayed orders or purchased elsewhere when the price is high at Amazon.

review/summary: best of all I have tried so far
review/text: I decided to trust other reviewers and buy this product, as I must chew something while studying and food was just getting me pudgy.  Most aspartame gums just give me migraines, and I worry about eating a chemical that cancer thrives on, so I have been trying to find natural items to chew on.  This gum is almost too strong at first and reminded me of Altoids in flavor for the first five minutes or so, after that it mellowed out, and within a half hour was barely there...just a hint remained.  Enough to not want to throw it away, though it wasn't as good as it had started out being.  The consistency of the gum is the best of the various brands I have tried.  If anything it is too soft for the first half hour, but I prefer too soft for too long over chewing rubber after a few minutes, as had happened with all of the other brands I tried.  And sadly the consistency does not lend itself to blowing bubbles.  I will likely buy this product again, and will ask my local stores to get it in as well.  It seems equivalent in price, and better in quality than most natural, or even chemical-laden gums.

review/text: I am pleased to report that this product is super when it comes to the safety of your health.  Not causing health problems is very important to me and my family and friends.  I have been telling everyone I know that chews gum that this one is not only safe but does not lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight.  I chewed on serving for three days and it was still going strong.<br />Also, when I was not feeling well from a dinner out that was over powering with garlic, I sucked on a piece and it seemed to calm my stomach down big time.  I also like to flavor my water, so I put a piece in a cold bottle of H20 and it was great....Especially the peppermint.  The gum even tasted better when the water was gone.  This is a great gum that has also controled my sweet tooth and I don't have the craving for sweets like I did before.  I truly believe I could write a book on this fantastic gum that was developed by the second healthiest country in the world.  Have a great life and a great day.<br />Counselor Counselet<br />Millard's Blueberry Farm and Art Studio<br />and author of: BORN TO TESTIFY that can be purchased at Barnes & Noble warehouse.

review/summary: A gum without aspartam
review/text: I just got my package. It's a 12-pack, each pack contains 12 gums so you'll have 144 gums for $15, which is about $0.10 per gum. It's the same price as regular gums, however the big plus for the Stevita is the complete absence of aspartam, an additive for sugarfree products which is terribly nocive and toxic. They put stevia instead. Stevia is not toxic, according to several studies.<br /><br />Seriously, check out independant studies about aspartam. If there is one thing you can do for your health, it's first removing aspartam. And it's not that hard. It was for me about gums, but no more!<br /><br />About the product itself : it has a good taste but it doesn't last a long time. Moreover, the gum looses its consistency really fast.<br /><br />But definitely the best alternative so far!

review/summary: Mush - it disingrates in mayonnaise. No Chunks.
review/text: I just tried this brand after after having not had it for a long time. It seemed to disintegrate in mayonnaise. It is the consistency of baby food. It dripped out of the sandwich even though I didn't use a large amount of mayonnaise. On the plus side there were no off flavors.<br /><br />I have been getting my tuna at Costco, they have Kirkland(house brand) 7oz cans. There are huge, solid chunks of real, white tuna meat. They are hard to break up with a fork. This is by far the best tuna I have had in a can, but I get it from Costco more because the size is better to make a couple of sandwiches, instead of the normal one and a half or so I can get out of  5oz cans. This Bumble Bee brand was just one sandwich for the same 5oz. I don't know if there is more water, or the consistency just meant the tuna didn't go that far because it broke down. Maybe the next time they shrink-ray the tuna and go to 4oz cans, the extra large family size will be large enough to get two sandwiches out of? As for now I am going to hold off on buying from a supermarkets until I can get at least a 6ox. Until then it is Costco. Note: My rating has nothing to do with the size issue, that is just a bonus rant. I can't mention tuna without getting mad about the size of the cans, although actually getting a can of mush is much worse!

review/text: I BOUGHT A CASE OF THESE PEPPERS AFTER TRYING SOME THAT A FRIEND GAVE ME. SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO THESE PEPPERS DURING SHIPMENT.  I AM GUESSING THEY GOT FROZEN ALONG THE WAY.  THEY ARE INEDIBLE!!!  I HAVE TRIED 4 OR 5 CANS OF THEM AND THEY ALL ARE EXTREMELY SALTY AND TASTE HORRIBLE.  I WOULD LOVE TO SEND THEM BACK AND GET SOME CREDIT OR TRY ANOTHER BATCH. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE.<br />THANKS<br />ED SESSIONS

review/summary: Incredible!
review/text: My family loves these peppers!  They were so mild, but still had enough flavor to taste like a jalapeno pepper.  I wish I could find them more often.  They are very hard to come by.  If you like mild peppers, these are excellent.

review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: If you are looking for a good chocolate chip cookie taste, but want to limit your snack to 100 calories, then these cookies are for you. No, they don't taste like chocolate chip cookies having hundreds of more calories, and it would not be realistic to expect them to. But for a low calories snack they are quite good, are not too hard or soft, and have a satisfying taste.<br /><br />Shop for price. These are expensive to start with for the amount of cookies you get, and the current price on Amazon is higher than the eighteen dollars that I pay when these are on sale at my local supermarket.

review/summary: Good product, but poor customer service
review/text: I love this peanut butter, but was not well treated by this vendor.  When I received my order, one of the jars was broken and peanut butter had leaked all over the rest of the order.  I contacted the vendor to request a replacement jar or a credit; my request was totally ignored.  I will continue to buy this product, but not from this vendor!

review/summary: Classic treat but why pay double for shipping
review/text: Moon Pies are a classic treat that taste great. And why not? They are essentially graham cracker cookies filled with marshmallow cream (Fluff) and dipped in chocolate. Amazingly, not even unhealthy! No cholesterol or trans fat. 220 calories but we all have to live a little and each one is bigger than a hockey puck after all.<br /><br />So let me cut to the chase:<br /><br />Both sellers here charge as much for shipping as they do for the product! That effectively doubles the price of a 12-pack box to more than fifteen dollars.<br /><br />Here's the solution. I found Moon Pies in all three flavors (Chocolate, Vanilla, Banana, though I only buy the original!) at the Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores which are attached to the restaurants. The cost? Four ninety-nine plus tax for the same sized box. That was last year. Also, Chattanooga Bakery (they invented the Moon Pie eighty years ago) indicated these are available at many Wal-Marts across the country. Buying locally would prevent some of the shipping damage (i.e., melting) some people have reported.<br /><br />If you are not located near a Cracker Barrel or Wal-Mart which sells these, you can buy them direct (moonpie dot com) for six bucks per box plus shipping.<br /><br />Enjoy!
