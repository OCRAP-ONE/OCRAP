review/text: What can I say? It's a freaking huge gummy bear! I mean, thats it! It's brilliant! All the calories of 90 gummy bears, and half the packaging! It's practically environmentally friendly! When I cut into it I feel like I've just gone hunting and caught a blue raspberry gummy bear in the wild and trapped it. Love it, will continues to eat it until my doctor advises otherwise. Also, don't drink water after eating some of it. It WILL expand in your stomach and become very unpleasant feeling.

review/summary: Really Great!
review/text: This is the first protien powder I found.  I thought it was OK.  I tried others, they did not dissolve as well, had more gunk in them I didn't need, and tasted bad.  Really, you can drink it with just water.  It tastes like milk, mostly.  Easy to get used to.  I usually put it in milk.<br /><br />Another thing, this is not just for bodybuilding.  I had a nagging shoulder injury for months, after I started taking extra protien, it healed rapidly.  It really does make a difference for soft tissue injuries.<br /><br />I also find that it kills my appetite.  It's 100 calories (180 with milk), but I don't feel like eating anything else for hours.<br /><br />Check the nutrition info, and how well it dissolves; this is the only choice.

review/summary: Great taste, Good for lean muscle growth
review/text: This is my go to source of a clean protein. It is comparably low in calories, carbohydrates, and sugars which makes it great for building lean muscle. This is not the supplement to take if you want to bulk up and gain mass. The natural-unflavored version that I always get tastes a lot like milk when mixed with water, and does not have chemicals or artificial sweeteners which a lot of other brands use to make their product taste better. The only complaint I have is that the powder doesn't mix very well with just water, and requires a lot of mixing especially if you follow the recommended amount- which to me seems like too much.

review/summary: Builds muscle? Yes. All natural? Yes. Delicious? Ugh, no!
review/text: I wanted to buy a whey protein that didn't have artificial sweeteners and was all natural. Jarrow makes great products. This whey protein has 17g of protein per scoop. It's sweetened with Erythritol which is a sugar alcohol. It's in small amounts so it shouldn't affect people sensitive to sugar alcohols much. If anyone is wondering, the amount of sugar alcohol from what I understand, can give you gas and laxative effects. It's also sweetened with the sweet leaf stevia/rebiana which is calorie free.<br /><br />My only gripe with it is the taste is horrible! Yes, I chug it down fast, but it tastes and smells like cherry cough medicine!

review/text: This is a great product that normally is not available at nutrition stores or discount stores, given that it has NO flavor. The other Whey proteins on the market are either Strawberry, Chocolate, or Vanilla - and make your drink taste nasty. Having the option of no flavor is wonderful, your other ingredients come out of the drink when mixed. Outstanding product and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is actively needing to take protein for dietary or workout purposes.

review/text: I'll admit on the advice of my trainer I was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment. I was pleasingly surprised by the taste though. It's difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me. It also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein I was lacking.

When I went to my doctor he suggested that I drink the Jarrow Formula Whey Protein shakes as they are low in sugar content and high in protein.  Once I tried the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XH6SD8">Jarrow Formulas Whey Protein, Berry, 2 Pounds</a>I found that I loved the berry taste.  Usually when I try to find this flavor in the stores they are out or don't carry it, but I have had success ordering the berry flavor online at Amazon.  If you like berries, I just know you will like the taste of this shake!

review/summary: mmmm Milkshake
review/text: I got the 1 pound french vanilla flavor. I haven't tried a lot of protein powders but the few that I have had either a very grainy texture, were chalky or just plain unpleasant. Not this powder though. I mixed mine with cold milk and threw it in the bottle shaker. It dissolved easily, no clumps or grainy texture. It tasted like a vanilla milkshake and along the same lines for consistency. There were no hardships trying to choke it down with big gulps.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because after I finished it up, it eventually made my stomach hurt a little from the sweetness. But I have a sensitive stomach so it will take a few more shakes before I'm used to it. I might try the unflavored next time but I'll wait and see what my reaction is after I've finished the whole pound. This will definitely be a second time purchase though.

review/summary: Yeach
review/text: Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something).

review/text: Warning - the reviews below apply to a previous recipe which used Cinnabon cinnamon - I agree it was fantastic.  As of March 2012 the one they're selling (at least in the stores) has changed.  This one is not nearly as good - it's still a mild (not candy-store) cinnamon but nothing special - definitely not worth the inflated price being charged here.  They may still have a few old ones left but if you're reading this much beyond the date of this review and are looking for the old formula you want to be sure to confirm.

review/text: I picked up these when the local pet store stopped carrying the thin bone shaped Little Bitz chicken and rawhide chews. The Beefeaters Little Bitz Small Round Chips are circular wafers of rawhide backing with a hard dried meaty topping. I was reluctant about getting these because they are about 1/4 of an inch thick though they don't seem to be more than an inch in diameter, and well I wasn't sure if it would be too big for my teacup's bite. My picky pooch seems to do ok with them though sometimes the cracking sounds she makes scares her but she cant get enough of these. I prefer the similar product by Beefeaters that are thinner less chunky. These are great for smaller breeds. But be warned they give my dog terrible gas. Only recommend these if you really love your fur babies and won't mind the smell.

review/text: I love my Galangal powder from Whole Spice, use it in many recipes instead of black pepper since I cannot have black pepper. I like the economic bulk package from Whole Spice.  I keep a glass jar of the powder handy for cooking and refill it from the bag, as needed.  I do keep the open bag and the jar in the fridge but you may not have to do that.

review/summary: good gluten free fairly "clean" dog food
review/text: I have searched for a gluten free organic dog kibble and so far this is the closest I have come. The organic kibbles tend to have oats in them. This food, since it is venison, I assume it is fairly close to organic. My dog likes it in addition to his raw food from Woody's.

review/summary: Organic high quality "raw" food diet
review/text: Go to their website and read about New Zealands standards. It is all organic and their beet is not a sugar beet but a healing type beet. It is an organic holistic raw food. It is the first dog food my allergy prone min pin can eat and has stopped chewing her paws and ears have cleared up. However. feed less than recommended. It is more bioavailable. Her last dog food she got 1/2 cup per meal. I fed her the same and she gained a pound in 1 week. Cut back to 1/3 cup per meal 2x a day. It is very expensive but best quality ingredients and no fluoride. Most dog foods have fluoride in the bone meal and animal meal means ground up bones where the fluoride is stored in animals raised on fluoridated water. NZ meal is pure freeze dried animal and NZ does not fluoridate their water, use pesticides, herbicides or growth hormones/antibiotics. Dogs are developing bone diseases, bone cancers and cancers due to fluoride poisoning. Stop giving dogs fluoridated water, too(filters do not filter out fluoride. RO does). Google and find the food cheaper and sent to you free from some web sellers (petdirectdotcom)

review/summary: RIP OFF !!!!! DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!
review/text: This product was not at all what was shown. Product not as pictured! Fruit snacks came in tiny packages not the larger bags as pictured. I would not purchase from this seller it was a total rip off. I was charged more then 10X what you can buy this product for at any Albertson's or Safeway Grocery store. Unbelievable!!!! They show a picture of the larger bags to make you believe you are getting 8 larger bags and then when you receive the product it is 8 small child size snack bags for more then $10 when they sell for a little over a dollar a box at your local grocery store. I own several business' and if I ran them this way I would be out of business in no time.<br /><br />Completely disappointed!

review/text: I try to have reasonably healthy snacks. I think that this product qualifies. Peanuts are a pretty good food. This honey roasted version, by Planter's, has a nice taste.<br /><br />The pluses: sodium is relatively low; fiber is pretty good. Down side? A bit more saturated fat than I would like.<br /><br />But this tastes good. It is a lot better than fried snacks.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a satisfied customer.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25SO4">Luzianne Gumbo Dinner, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />When I was in New Orleans for the first time twenty years ago, a friend recommended this product, which is made in Louisiana, as an easy way to get the taste of gumbo.  Since then, I've used it many times, although I can also make "real" gumbo.  Don't worry about it being too spicy--the red pepper is in a separate packet and you control how much you want.  You supply the meat and water, they supply everything else.  You can supplement it with your own sauted peppers and onions and make it with chicken broth instead of water.  But even if you just make it "as is," it's a great, economical, and warming meal for lunch or supper.  If you have the time, serve it with homemade cornbread.

review/summary: I like it!  :-)
review/text: It seems to have more peppers and other vegetables in the mix than other brands of Gumbo mix and I really appreciate the seperate packet of red pepper which allows you to regulate the spiciness to taste.  It also seems to be less 'gooey', for lack of a better word.  Could this be from a different (better) roux recipe?<br /><br />Some other brands tend to have their powdered ingedients "clump" together when cooked, necessitating your making a pre-cook mash in order to insure even distribution....not so here.  Even an admittedly inexperienced "chef" (chortle) like myself was able to have it come out perfectly the very first time....if I can make it come out well, anyone can!<br /><br />The directions are very easy and at the same time more helpful and specific than those included with other brands, but there's one thing that people unaccustomed to spicy foods might wish to consider....the directions call for you to add 1/2 of the red pepper packet contents into the pot at the outset, and the rest later on to your taste.  If you are particularly sensitive to spicy foods you may wish to consider adding a little less than 1/2 of the packet the very first time you cook this.  I didn't find it overly spicy when cooked according to the recommendations but the red pepper was definitely noticeable, and so I'm including this little suggestion for people who are more used to very mild foods. I loved it when cooked just the way the directions called for, however.<br /><br />Please be advised that this review is biased due to the fact that I'm happily eating Luzianne's gumbo as I write this review!  :-)

review/text: Blue Ridge Jams is fast becoming one of my favorite companies. And I'm fortunate<br />enough to live close to one enough of their retail outlets in St. Augustine so I<br />can always sample something new.<br /><br />My whole family grew up eating pepper jelly on a cracker with cream cheese so of course<br />thats what I tried first...instant bliss. The habanero is a perfect compliment to the<br />natural sweetness of the pineapple, and delivers a nice long but very mild burn. But<br />the real treat was finding out I could make pineapple shakes with this stuff, probably<br />the best thing I've had in my entire life! This stuff is addictive, very addictive.<br /><br />This is a company that prides itself in quality and creativity. And accounting for the<br />fact that they only make their products in small batches of 18 jars at a time, they have<br />developed a product line that is very extensive and includes jams and jellies, pickled<br />products, chow chow, relishes, and even 13 different kinds of salsa. Check out their<br />website at blueridgejams(dot)com for the complete line including high res photos.

And it's quite caloric, as well.  However, the picture of this gourmet treat finally DID get to me, and...after returning to this picture and this product several time.....couldn't resist it any longer.  For me, it was my "royal treat", to celebrate the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton!<br /><br />Well, my package arrived a bit after the wedding, (today, actually) --but that's because I ordered it a bit after the wedding, (May 6, to be exact.)  I kept reminding myself how expensive this really is, and how even the Queen saves money whenever, and wherever, she can....but it was no good.  I had to at least TRY this stuff...at least once...<br /><br />The package, marked "Perishable", had stood out in my hallway for a few hours, as I was out this morning.  Upon opening the outer cardboard box, then the inner styrofoam box, (repleate with cold-bags, to keep the pershable food inside fresh),  I came across a small brown-cardboard box which held my Smoked Salmon Mousse.  Inside, was not one big package, as I had expected, but, instead -- to my delight -- sixt small black plastic tubs!  It seems, happily, that no matter how much you order of this Somoked Salmon Mousse, it will always be packed in these elegant little black plastic tubs.  The black contrasts nicely with the Smoked Salmon Mousse peeking through both sides of the large yellow label, that almost -- but not quite -- covers the food within.  The label says "Terroirs d'Antan" in big letterss, and I take it this means "land" of Antan, (and not "terrors" therefrom),<br />as "terre" means "land" in French.  Three ducks on one side and one rabbit on the other side of the central "Terroir's d'Antan" are "inhabiting" the yellow label, and we can see, in the far right distance, a huge building that looks like a French chateau -- and, indeed, right below this, in smaller letters, are the words,<br />"The selection 'Terroirs d'Antan' revives ancient recipes from the vearious terroirs of France.  Enjoy."  But further down the label, it is revealed that the product was 'Made in USA - Distrib by Optimus, Inc., Miami Fl  33138.<br /><br />The larger box in which this individual serving, (actually, containing 3 servings -- 7 ounces), black plastic box came, described the contents as being "Packed in Aspic".  And so it is.  When the vaccum-packing, transparent plastic covering is removed, there still is another transparent layer to be removed.  My own experience with "aspic" had heretofore been, mainly, with learning of the title of a movie, "A Dandy In Aspic", starring the late, (and really great), Laurence Harvey.  I have yet to see the movie -- and have never, really, known what 'aspic' is, exceptthat it is some sort of foodstuff.  Well -- I discovered, upon taking what must be aspic off the top op of the salmon mousse, that it is similar to the temporary, plastic 'dots' that are sometimes used to keep products on cardboard backings, but are (somewhat) easily removed.  A type of transparent jello, actually -- about 1/8 inch thick.<br /><br />Well, finally I had the mousse in front of me, and it was time to eat it!<br /><br />The flavour was milder rhan I had expected -- perhaps because "Cream Cheese" is the first ingredient.  The smoked salmon flavour DOES come through, on occasion, and it is a nice, dark, smoked salmon flavour, indeed!  But there is far too little of this wonderfully rich smoked salmon flavour here.  (Maybe my taste buds came upon a "pocket" of the salmon that had not thoroughly mixed with the cream cheese.  In any event, this product should have been labled as "Cream Cheese and Salmon Mousee", because "cream cheese" is the first ingredient listed, and "smoked salmon" is the eighth ingredient listed, (out of 17 ingredients), and "spinach" is the fourteenth.  (This product was made in the USA, remember -- and if I remember correctly, ingredients here must be listed in descending order.  But -- does this<br />"in size" order apply to titles too?  If not, it should...<br /><br />The smoked salmon mousse has, again, a very MILD flavour.  it tastes very UNsimilar to the NY-type "lox" I had hoped it would.  Here, the amount of cream-cheese SO overwhelms the amount of smoked salmion, that it ALMOST tastes like exotically spiced, and flavoured, cream cheese!<br /><br />The little black "tubs", however, are definitely re-usable.  Of a size similar to restaurant trays for artificial sweetner, they are happily made of "No. 5" plastic.  According to an "Organic Gardening" article I read a while back, ONLY No. 5, or No. 6 plastic are safe to reuse.  So, these little black tubs can be used to hold sugar and artificial sweetener packets, stray coins, business cards, tea-bags, or any other similar object(s).  They can also be used as "portion-control" containers, as they hold not-too-much, and not-too-little of any food -- including, (for reference), about five rounded tablespoons of tuna spre<br />trays for<br /><br />"Vita" foods, (available in New York's Waldbaum's supermarkets, and probably other areas as well, sells a someked salmon and cream-cheese spread, at 8 ounces for under $3.  Ir does not have spinach, chives, eggs, tomato, or many of the other ingredients in this Smoked Salmon Mousse, sold by GourmetFoodStore. It comes in a white, round plastic tub.  As it has more smoked slamon in it, it tastes more like smoked salmon to me.  As it's kind of inconvenient for me to go to a land-based store, I certainly hope Amazon will offer this VITA product, and others, (like their herring in wine sauce), soon.  otherwise, I'll save up for, and load up on, this Vita product when next I go to Walbaum's.  The 'Smoked Salmon and Spinach Mousse Pate - All Natural," being reviewed here, DOES have more "snob" appeal, and DOES come with those nice little space-saving black tubs.  But, unlike the Vita smoked salmon and cream cheese spread, it has more smoked-salmon taste.  And that, when all is said and done, in the end, the main thing that matters in foods, doesn't it?<br /><br />P.S.  One More Plus:  The "GourmetFoodStore" catalogue which is included with every pruchase is an education in gourmet food, all by itself.  Did you know HOW MANY types of smoked salmon there are?  HOW many types of caviar?  Whether you buy anything (else) from "GourmetFoodStore", this catalogue is not only mouth-watering...but very educational!  Made on fine "slick" paper, and filled with beautiful cloured photos, (and also high gourmet-food prices), it is a "gourmet" catalogue in more ways than one!  Thanks, GourmetFoodStore!<br /><br />One More Minus:  Sadly, my food came packed in "peanuts".  No -- not the edible type of peanuts....the STYROFOAM type of peanuts!  It's impossible to open ANY package packed in styrofoam peanuts, without getting at least some of these innocuous-looking, but incredibly annoying little pieces of styrofoam, all over your floor! GourmetFoodStore is not the only manufacturer/ seller who does this of course....but one would think, with the wonderful, (and espensive) gourmet products they sell, that this up-market marketer would pack their food with something less annoying to the customer?  Of course, there IS the TINY advantage in having something packed in peanuts...one gets forced excercise picking up these small, but aggravating, strofoam peace-of-mind-destroyers, off the<br />floor.  OK -- a few calories are used in this way, and, if you are female, you can imagine yourself to be Ruth, (from the Bible), doing some gleaning.  However, I prefer to have MY fantasies when I desire to have them, and to excercise when _I_ decide to excercise, and NOT have these things suddenly and unexpexctedly forced upon me when opening up a package -- especially from such a luxury-goods emporium as GourmetFoodStore truly is.  Perhaps a $1 charge for having one's goods "not to be packed in peanuts" might be applied?  (PLEASE don't make it more than $1!)  Bubble-wrap and similar plastic space-fillers are SO appreciated by customer!  And less aggravation leads to less buying of calmatives and pain-relievers....possibly allowing for MORE money to be spent at GourmetFoodStore!  Please consider these "suggestions for happier custumers", dear GourmetFoodStore.  Thanks!

review/summary: Great for bread!
review/text: Regular bread flour is missing some of the elastic wheat protein that produces a better quality bread.  By adding Vital Wheat Gluten to your home-baked breads, you will produce a better quality of bread--better texture, less crumbly, and more like bakery-quality bread.  Experiment with amounts; I use 1 teaspoon of Vital Wheat Gluten per cup of flour.  However, even just 1 additional tablespoon of Vital Wheat Gluten per 1.5 lb loaf of bread turns out a better loaf.  For the amount of gluten used, this item is certainly worth the cost.  Keep your gluten in the freezer to extend shelf life.

These bite sized treats are perfect for training rewards or as 'just because' treats.  The size is appropriate for the smallest to the largest dog.  The quality is good.  The dogs seem to enjoy them.  The price is right in the 20# boxes.  The only down-side to these purchases was that on both occasions, the large plastic bag that contains the treats was not closed with a twist tie or anything of the sort.  It could have been a major mess and I would guess that the treats would have stayed fresher.

review/summary: GREAT FLAVOR  (big bag)
review/text: I needed a small amount of Star Anise for one recipe.  My friend said I wouldn't be able to find it in a normal grocery store.  He knows a lot about the food world so I didn't even bother looking.  Amazon, of course, came through as always.  The stuff is great, and the recipe came out perfectly.<br /><br />I guess I misjudged how huge a 3.5 bag of star anise would be.  There is no indication of the size of the bag (9" X 5") or the number of cups that the bag holds, which I didn't measure, but which is much bigger than I thought it would be or what I needed. (Most recipes call for anywhere between half a teaspoon to a couple stars). Now I have a lot left over, and had to look for recipes to use it up.  Not a big deal, and it is a fun, exotic flavor adventure, but I will be happy when the bag is finished.  I went to ShopRite a few weeks ago any saw a tiny bag of star anise, with exactly as much as I needed, for 99 cents.  Oh well.<br /><br />If you love it, and use A LOT of it to cook with, then this is perfect.  I will probably cook with it again since I now know how, but I will opt for the smaller, ShopRite bag each time.  It's just not something I use often enough to need a bag this big.

I thought I'd be getting a package of 8 mochi that were around 2 inches big since that is what I'm used to seeing. Instead it's 8 packages of 8 individually packaged mochi which are about the size of a dollar coin. The filling looks nothing like the package and is, in fact, kind of a gross brownish color.<br /><br />All in all they taste alright. Definitely not the best, but they are edible. The low rating is mostly for the confusing quantity and size and the deceptive picture.

review/summary: Well Packaged, but....
review/text: As you can see in the photo, this small bag has 8 individually well packaged pieces of very small mochi, about 1.25 inch x 1/2 inch, 52 calories each. It has the usual, good, soft mochi texture. The strawberry flavor of the mochi is light and "perfum-ie" as the best way for me to describe it. The filling in the middle is not like the picture because it is more flat but if if you bite it in half lengthwise (rounding it out), it's like red gelatin with a white ring around it, with the center part being very sweet. Being so small, you would pop the whole thing in your mouth and savor (or not) your 52 calories. As a whole, I really like the other flavors  and types of "Royal Family" brand mochi in the multi-pack and order it though Amazon's great "subscribe & save" program, but I guess I'm not a perfume type guy, (when it's in my food) ... so I'm going to pass on this flavor.

I expected a good strawberry flavor but you can barely detect it. They look good in the picture but they have hardly any "strawberry" filling and you are left chewing on this tasteless sphere. Now texture wise , so weird. Kind of like a marshmallow but more rubbery??? I took a chance and tried something new. Will not be purchasing any more Mochi in the future. Tho I may not really eat the rest of them, they are kinda fun to squish in your hands when bored.

review/summary: Absolutely Divine! But.....
review/text: This syrup is divine.  There just aren't words enough for me to describe the taste.  Takes me to island in an instant.  I made pancakes and topped them with some cut up bananas and this syrup and went back for seconds, and considered thirds.  All that said, it is a very small bottle for the price, which I think is quite steep.  I was able to make homemade that tasted exactly like this, for a third of the cost and the recipe made just as much, probably more.  I am not saying this to discourage anyone from buying this, because it is an excellent product.  If  you are the least bit savvy in the kitchen you can make your own in a jiffy and save yourself the green.  BUT, if you are not, then I would whole-heartedly say buy this syrup and make a double batch of pancakes because you are going to want to go back again and again.  (You also might consider buying two bottles since you will empty this one right away!)

review/summary: Tasty Hawaiian Syrup
review/text: I had purchased this on a trip to Maui and loved the taste but was sad to use up what I had purchased.  I was so happy to find this on Amazon and that they shipped this product to MD.  I love the taste, the only thing reason I gave it a 4-star was because when I received my last purchase, the syrup looked old; there were large solid chunks when I opened the bottle...this wouldn't happen if the syrup were produced fairly recently.

review/summary: Pleasant, mild, sweet
review/text: This is a nice, lightly-flavored, not too sweet coffee. The Caramel Vanilla Cream (also Green Mountain, also in a K-cup) is definitely rounder in flavor and stronger on the vanilla notes, but this is a pleasant, nice coffee. Not too strong.

review/summary: GOOD coffee. BAD price.
review/text: Don't buy this coffee here!! You're paying more than the retail value!! K-cups should average out to be about 50 to 65 cents a cup MAX.

review/summary: Okay, but not as good as Gloria Jean
review/text: Weak French Vanilla (especially if you make a travel size cup for work).<br />I prefer Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme, it's a little darker and much smoother (not to mention cheaper).
