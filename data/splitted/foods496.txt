review/summary: Love the vanilla, wanted to try different flavors...
review/text: First, I definitely should have paid more attention to the size, because these are tiny, and for the price, I assumed I'd have more product, but never mind that, it was my mistake, I should have paid more attention.  On to the flavor.  I have been a fan of the vanilla for a year or so, and figured I'd give the rest a try... I was a little disappointed.  I mix these with plain water or sparkling water, so maybe for a different use, they would be good.  I felt like I had to add so much to catch the actual flavor of the chocolate raspberry, lemon, and orange, that it was waaaaay too sweet.  I'll just stick to vanilla cream from no on

review/summary: Love the flavors
review/text: I really love all the different flavors, however, I have found that the Stevia liquid is only good if you use just a few drops in your cold beverages, for example, I add the Chcolate Rasberry to my sugar- free, morning protein shakes, and they taste wonderful. But for my loose leaf teas, I use the powder packets.

review/summary: What flavor?
review/text: I can not taste any flavoring in these, I put many drops into the water, increasing by increments and all it did was make the water sweet, there is no flavor here. I don't understand how others have tasted any flavoring at all because I sure didn't, I so wanted something all natural that would taste good but this is just drinking sugar water so now I have to find something to add some flavor to the water. These work well with tea, since there is no real flavor here you taste the tea and it makes it sweet enough.

Each bottles also lasts for few days so for me they are totally worth the price.

review/summary: Love this tea
review/text: I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the White Ayurvedic Chai with the  Samurai Chai Mate and they taste fantastic together. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out to find your favorite. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one. They use German rock sugar (which they sell) and that costs a little more. Most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea and drink happy.

review/text: If you're not from Minnesota you might not know what Caribou Coffee is; quite simply it is some of the best coffee on the market.  It has a delicious smokiness to it that is not overpowering and does not taste burnt like Starbucks.  Coffee is not supposed to taste burnt!  The Caribou Blend is their "middle" roast that has made them what they are and is very well balanced.  It has an amazing flavor and is easy on the stomach too, as I personally have difficulty with some coffee roasts and digestion.

Ha.  Try calling the corporate office and speaking to a live person. Ha.  It ain't gonna happen. After 3 weeks of periodic calling and only getting voice mail on both lines, leaving messages with never getting a call back, it is evident that the customer service department and the corporate receptionist, if they even have one, at Caribou Coffee hide behind their phones.<br /><br />It is a myopic company which disregards that time honored adage that, "if word of mouth is the best advertising, it can also be the worst..."

review/summary: The Best Crackers Ever!
review/text: These are my all time favorite crackers. They're so delicious that they can actually be addictive. After you have eaten 2 or 3 a strong very good flavor starts to accumulate on your tongue. And you start to crave more of that great flavor. And then, the more crackers you eat, the more you crave another.  -<br /><br />The bad part is that these can be difficult to find. I first discovered these at local supermarkets about 10 years ago. But then, after a few years .They disappeared from all of my local stores. Then, about a year after they disappeared from local stores, Amazon started to carry them. But Amazon is often out of stock on these. Including a recent period when Amazon didn't have any for over a year. So if you want any. You have to grab them as soon as you see that any are  available.  -<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when Amazon recently made them available thru Subscribe and Save. Aside from the lower price and free delivery. Maybe that's an indication that Amazon now expects to always have these in stock.  -

review/summary: Useless but all true facts
review/text: ****<br /><br />April 29, 2012<br /><br />These Cheez-Its from Sunshine Biscuits, which is owned by Kellogg's, are advertised on the box as being "Creamy & Mild."  If by creamy is meant that there's a texture that's creamy then this half of the "creamy and mild" claim is false.  These are crackers, and they've been intentionally baked so as to remove water.  They are crisp throughout.  They do not deform in response to sufficient pressure but rather they crack, which I think is why crackers are called that.  They are not a liquid in any sense; they are a quite dry solid.  And to me a texture that's described as creamy must be to some extent liquid, which these are not at all.  Brie is a creamy cheese, cheddar is not.<br /><br />Speaking of cheeses, these crackers contain three types.  The one listed first on the list of ingredients is white cheddar, followed by cheddar, and only then by mozzarella.<br /><br />And they are mild.  There is no burst of cheese or any other flavor when you pop a few in your mouth and crunch down.  So the second half of the "creamy and mild" claim is accurate.  I'm sure we're all different, but for me the biggest hit of flavor is just BEFORE I crunch down.  Try it: Just before you start chewing them, take a sniff through your mouth and nose and you'll smell a lovely odor of cheese.<br /><br />****<br /><br />You probably want to know why the manufacturer is called Sunshine Biscuits.  The company was founded by one Jacob L. Loose of Kansas City, Missouri, who with the profits it generated built and lived in what is now called the Loose Mansion, which is quite an extraordinary property on the south side of Armour Boulevard just east of Main Street, which you can Google.  It's a good three stories tall and comes equipped not just with walk-in closets but a walk-in safe, a carriage house, a kitchen bigger than a two-car garage, and more rooms than you can count.  No kidding.<br /><br />For several years the Loose Mansion was owned by my aunt Sue's not-for-profit educational enterprise, called The Teel Foundation, and during that time it was used for some of the scenes in the 1995 movie "Truman" starring Gary Sinise, and from which it, the foundation, benefitted because the movie crew left behind a really nice and really huge table that was used in scenes where Truman's cabinet met, so if you want to see that table you'll have to watch the movie.  And the reason I say I'm not kidding that it has more rooms than you can count is that Sue owned and operated her foundation from that mansion for over a year before she realized there were rooms she had never once entered.  This is a very big house.<br /><br />Anyway, Jacob, who also funded one of the finest parks in Kansas City, called Loose Park, was married to a woman named Sunshine, so now you know.<br /><br />****<br /><br />You also probably want to know just exactly how many of these Kellogg's Sunshine Cheez-IT Mozzarella Cheese, 13.7-Ounce (Pack of 4) by Cheez-It crackers you can buy for one share of Berkshire Hathaway stock.  I've read all the previous reviews of this product to date, and I see no mention whatsoever of any attempt even to ask this question, not to mention answering it, so let me fill in that hole for you, because as you know from so many of my own previous reviews on Amazon I do strive to be thorough.<br /><br />As of the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange on April 27, 2012, Berkshire Hathaway class A shares (ticker symbol BRKA) are worth $120,925.00 each.  That's right, it will cost you over $120,000 to buy just one share of Berkshire.  By comparison, one share of Kellogg's (ticker symbol K) at the April 27th close will cost you $50.35.<br /><br />I weighed ten of these crackers and arrived at 3/8 ounce.  I added ten more and arrived at 3/4 ounce, so we can be pretty sure each cracker weighs pretty close to 3/80ths of an ounce.  The inverse of 3/80 is 80/3, which means there are 26-2/3 crackers per ounce.  There being 13.7 ounces of crackers per box, we now know there are 365-1/3 crackers per box.<br /><br />Now we need to know the price of such a box, and here I get confused.  According to the Amazon page I'm looking at right now a pack of four of these boxes costs $29.97, which is $7.4925 per box, which seems like a lot to me.  When I just now used Google Goggles on the UPC bar code I was led to a store selling these for $2.88, which is the price, rounded up to $3, that I will use in the remaining calculations.<br /><br />$120,925 divided by $3 means you can buy 40,308 boxes (and have a dollar left over).  40,308 boxes times 365-1/3 crackers per box is the answer we've been so eagerly seeking.  For one share of Berkshire.A you will get nearly 15 million crackers.<br /><br />14,725,856 crackers, to be exact, will weigh 552,219.6 ounces, or 34,513.725 pounds, which is over 17 tons of crackers, not to mention the weight of the waxed paper liner and the box.<br /><br />That box is 9 inches tall by 6-1/4 inches wide by 2-3/8 inches deep, which means it occupies 133.59375 cubic inches of volume, which -- trust me on this -- means that 40,308 such boxes will occupy 3,116.259765625 cubic feet.  (Or don't trust me on this.  If you come up with an answer that's different by even a single digit anywhere, please do leave a comment.)<br /><br />If we assume a typical room whose floor-to-ceiling height is 95 inches, we can fit exactly 40 of these boxes laid flat in a tower, because 95 inches divided by 2-3/8 inches equals 40.  That tower will occupy 133.59375 times 40, or 5,343.75, cubic inches of volume, which is 3.09244791666 cubic feet, where the sixes repeat forever.  So the next obvious question is what the other two dimensions of the room must be to hold all 40,308 boxes.  Well, it's obvious to me.<br /><br />The number of 40-box towers necessary to make up 40,308 boxes is simply the latter divided by the former, which is 1,007.7 such towers.  The footprint of each tower being 56.25 square inches (9 inches times 6-1/4 inches), that number times 1,007.7 such towers is 56,683.125 square inches of floor space.  The square root of that number means if the room is square the walls will be just a touch over 238.08218118960519973573719117007586000668448380401921 inches, which with your permission I'm cavalierly going to round to 238.  238 inches divided by 12 inches per foot is 19.8333 feet, which I'm even more cavalierly going to round to 20 feet.<br /><br />To contain the number of $3 boxes of Kellogg's Sunshine Cheez-IT Mozzarella Cheese, 13.7-Ounce (Pack of 4) by Cheez-Its you can buy for one share of Berkshire Hathaway class A stock as of April 27, 2012, which is 40,308 boxes, you'll need a typical-height room that's 400 square feet in area.  Coincidentally, that's about the size of the two-car garage we mentioned earlier.  So, now you know.<br /><br />****<br /><br />If you've read this far you might be wondering about some of the conversion formulas I didn't show, so here's the complete set.<br /><br />To convert SQUARE INCHES to square feet, divide by 12 raised to the power of 2.<br />576 --> 4.<br /><br />To convert SQUARE FEET to square inches, multiply by 12 raised to the power of 2.<br />72 --> 10,368.<br /><br />To convert CUBIC INCHES to cubic feet, divide by 12 raised to the power of 3.<br />5,343.75 --> 3.09244791666.<br /><br />To convert CUBIC FEET to cubic inches, multiply by 12 raised to the power of 3.<br />3,116.259765625 --> 5,384,896.875.<br /><br />If you're wondering how I managed to derive 50 decimal places in that calculation of the square root of 56,683.125, I used a wonderfully useful program called Wolfram.  In case you're further interested, that particular answer is expressed by Wolfram to many THOUSANDS of digits, so aren't you glad I didn't show them all?<br /><br />Based on all the foregoing, I award this product 5 stars minus 1 for calling it creamy, which is, I'm pretty sure, equal to 4.<br /><br />****

review/text: Mozzerella cheese is a favorite in our house, and we love the original flavor Cheez-its too, so I thought I'd give these a try. The box arrived in perfect  shape, so I was surprised to find about half of the crackers were either crushed or broken. The crackers have a nice Cheez-it crunch, but the flavor wasn't quite what I was expecting. They have a bit of a tangy, cheesy flavor; it's not bad, just different. (It reminds me a little of the White Cheddar flavor.) Good, authentic mozzarella cheese, to me, has a creamier and milder flavor. They might be good though, with different kinds of dip, or served with tomato soup. I like the idea that there are other varieties of Cheez-its available, but for now, I will probably stick with my favorite, the original.

review/summary: Good flavor in this tasty treat
review/text: I didn't realize Cheez-It had so many different flavors. I think it can be a slippery slope. For example, Doritos makes a bunch of flavors, but none are quite as good as two of their oldest flavors: Cool Ranch and Nacho Cheese. The other flavors are usually pretty good, but I tend to stop liking them as much before the bag is empty. What about the Mozzarella Cheez-Its? How do they stack up?<br /><br />Rather than just give you my impressions of the Mozzarella Cheez-It, I decided to share these with some coworkers. Here are the taste test results.<br /><br />Tester 1, Female, 60s: "Mmmmmm," she said after the first couple crackers. The words "good" and "tasty" came up and she remarked they have a totally different taste than the original Cheez-Its.<br /><br />Tester 2, Female, 30s: She got a funny look on her face and said, "Weird...I'm not sure...Not bad...Not as good as the original Cheez-Its." After a few more crackers she somewhat changed her tune and said they were quite tasty.<br /><br />Tester 3, Female, 40s: She didn't love them but thought they were "all right." She also preferred the original Cheez-It over the Mozzarella Cheez-Its.<br /><br />Tester 4, Female, 40s: She ate one carefully and started nodding. After a few more she commented that she preferred the Mozzarella over the original flavor. She liked the flavor a lot and said she'd definitely buy them.<br /><br />Tester 5, Female, 40s: She liked the smell of the crackers and also commented, "Mmmmmm," while raising her eyebrows. She liked the "buttery" flavor and commented she liked them better than the original Cheez-Its. She also eyed the nutritional information and approved of the zero sugars.<br /><br />Tester 6, Male, 50s: He enjoyed the "very nice mozzarella taste," and the "nice light flavor." He commented that he could eat "a lot more of these" and that he'd definitely buy them.<br /><br />Me, Male, 30s: I liked their aroma a lot. The box says "creamy and mild" and I'd agree. The first cracker's flavor really coated my palate like a sharp cheddar would but without that overpowering, strong taste. The texture of the cracker was enjoyable, too: very crisp. Also, the mild flavor of the Mozzarella Cheez-Its doesn't leave you with stank breath. I think they're on par with the original flavor Cheez-It which is not my favorite cracker snack, but I do eat them from time to time.<br /><br />Eating contest: Tester 2 and I had a contest to see who could fit more whole Cheez-Its in their mouth at once. Tester 2 fit 15 and I fit 22.  I bring this up because a serving size is 1 ounce or 25 crackers (150 calories, 7g of fat, 180mg sodium, 19g carbs). That should give you a visual of how large a serving size is.<br /><br />These crackers are a winner. They have a good flavor that isn't overpowering but also won't get boring. Some testers thought they'd be great in a party mix with other Cheez-It flavors.<br /><br />I received this box of crackers at no cost as a member of the Vine Program.

review/text: I absolutely adore Cheez-Its and eat about a box each week.  While these Mozzarella snacks are good, in my opinion the Four Cheese, Cheese-Duos, the Spicy, Baby Swiss, etc. are just a bit better.  Perhaps it's because Mozzarella is such a mild cheese that the cheesy flavor doesn't come through as well as it does in the other products.  I'm glad I tried them, but I won't buy again because I like the other Cheez-It products better.

review/summary: Better than the original
review/text: I have never been a big fan of the original Cheez-Its although others in my household seem to love them. I really enjoyed this Mozzarella variety much more than the original flavor, although it was a bit strong and overwhelming.  For the general public, I would give these 4 stars. However, I changed my way of eating over 6 months ago and no longer eat foods with additives, preservatives, trans fat and other non-healthy ingredients (basically, most processed foods). If you fall into the category of being one who watches for this stuff as well, be aware these have enriched flour and a number of additives and ingredients you probably do not want in your snacks. I am happy to report there is no trans fat or high fructose corn syrup, which seems to be overwhelmingly prevalent in many processed foods today. Overall, I would eat these if I had to or really needed a snack and other options were not available.

review/summary: Very tasty, but very crumbly
review/text: When I first opened up the box, I was chagrined to find that about half of the contents were broken crackers. Still, I'd ordered crackers through the postal service and some breakage is to be expected, right?<br /><br />The whole crackers were near the top, so I nabbed one gently between forefinger and middle finger and lifted it out of the box. Before my fingers cleared the packaging, the cracker had snapped in two.<br /><br />They're delicious - somehow creamy, despite having the pleasantly mealy texture of a good Cheez-It - but exceptionally fragile, making them unsuitable as a snack in a child's lunch or, frankly, the lunch of a fully grown adult with an unpadded lunch box. They're nice to eat out of hand and make a fantastic substitute for breadcrumbs when grilling up chicken or pork.

review/summary: Mix up your cheese-it flavors now and then.
review/text: I found these to have a good Mozzarella taste but they still retained that distinctive cheese-it cracker taste underneath which I liked. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on them so why not get a box and see for yourself? I did notice that MSG is listed in the ingredients. I don't believe that original cheese-its have it so that is something to keep in mind. Overall a good product that I like and will purchase in the future.<br /><br />I'd also like to note that mine were shipped smart post and I wouldn't recommend picking the cheapest shipping option when ordering. By the time the cheese-its got to me I'd say that only 1/3 of the box was whole crackers. The rest were broken down into a fine crumb mess. The box didn't look badly beat up, so I don't know what the post office does but it is definitely detrimental to the cheese-its.

review/summary: Two Thumbs Up
review/text: I'm a fan of Cheez-Its.  However, I do prefer certain flavors over others.  For example, I personally don't like Baby Swiss flavor, but I do like this Mozzarella.<br /><br />First cracker, I found the taste of these Mozzarella Cheez-Its to be very mild.  It reminded me a little of the Baby Swiss, not in taste comparison but in that it's a very subtle cheese taste at first.  However, the more Mozzarella Cheez-Its I consumed, the more I tasted the Mozzarella flavor.  After a handful, I was in Mozzarella heaven.  It leaves a good after taste, too (unlike Baby Swiss).<br /><br />So, if you like Cheez-Its, and want to try a flavor that's not spicy, not tangy, and not 'in your face', then I recommend trying the milder, mellower Mozzarella cheese flavor.

review/text: I'm not a huge fan of the original cheez-its, but these mozzarella cheez-its are wonderful.  They're made with both mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and you can definitely taste the cheddar.  But the mozzarella gives them a milder, butterier taste than a normal cheddar cracker.  They are also not too salty, which is often a problem with cheese crackers.<br /><br />At 150 calories for 25 crackers (a few handfuls), this is a great snack.  They take the edge of your hunger without filling you up with empty calories.<br /><br />They are a little greasy, so you'll want to have a napkin or a sink hand when you eat them.  The crackers in my box were almost all broken, which made it a little harder to eat them.  But those are relatively minor drawbacks, and this is certainly a product that I'll eat again.

review/text: The product description calls Kellogg's Sunshine Cheez-IT Mozzarella Cheese, a satisfying snack and claims that ..."regular snacking helps prevent overeating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day."<br /><br />Forget regular snacking.  With Cheez-IT Mozzarella it's munching mania.  The snack is like an overly salty bag of potato chips, and everybody knows about the (false) prospects of having "only" one.  "One more" is the mantra of Cheez-IT Mozzarella.  So incredibly addictive, it is a definite staple for the average American's couch potato stash.<br /><br />Taste wise, although billed as "100 percent real Mozzarella cheese," they have a chemical sting (you know, the one that Americans complain about, but secretly love).  However, the cheesy flavor is distinct, the texture of the cracker ... Cheez-IT ... all the way.  Keep them handy along with the other growing varieties of Cheez-IT crackers for the ultimate binge-snacking escape.<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE

However, since the ingredients were not visible, I was unaware that the product contained MSG (monosodium glutamate) to which my entire family, me included, is allergic. So, I asked my neighbor if any of his household was allergic or sensitive to MSG-monosodium glutamate and he said no. So, they became my test group for the CHEEZ-IT with Mozzarella. Three boys high school and college age and their father, they reported as follows:<br />21 year old: "Excellent Mozzarella flavoring. I liked it with ham added as a cracker snack."<br />19 Year old: "Wow! Pete thanks, we all liked it and like my older bro I too made cracker and ham sandwiches of it!"<br />12 year old: "it was good but a little too salty for me, so my brothers and dad ate most of it."<br />Dad: "It was good and I joined the boys only I added an Italian ham to it, the spicy Capicola and it was great."<br /><br />There you have it, only one hitch, a suggestion to Kelloggs, RE: I read said that, more than 27% of people are sensitive to or allergic to MSG (monosodium glutamate), so any company or restaurant that uses it is automatically shutting off a sizable segment of their market.<br /><br />I agree, why cut out ANY of your market just to use a cheap substitute for spices'? I give it 3.5 stars which rounds out to four stars above, I took off 1.5 stars for the MSG added because it limits the marketability of the product and because we could not eat it.

review/text: We're a household of Cheez-It fans, so everyone was excited to try the new mozzarella flavor.  First of all, we were disappointed because many crackers had broken during shipping, so there were lots of crumbled bits scattered throughout the box.  However, the ones that remained were tangy and tasty.  They don't have quite the same texture as the regular cheddar flavor and do crumble a bit more easily.  However, this is a nice blend of salty and cheesy.  If you like the regular flavor and want to try something new, give these a try.

review/text: These Mozzarella Cheese-it's could be better<br /><br />Sure, They are cheesy, but they are not mozzarella cheesy. at least not to me. They tasted more like a white Cheddar and that was a major disappointment<br /><br />Second, they left a really bad aftertaste that reminded me of drinking diet soda and that was really unpleasant.<br /><br />I'd just stick with regular Cheezit's or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN40">the Hot & Spicy</a> ones. These need improvement

review/summary: Mostly Cheddar but Still Good
review/text: The ingredients show cheddar cheese as the primary cheese in these crackers, and mozzarella is less than 2%. Therefore they taste more cheddar than anything else. Having said that, they were crunchy, cheesy, and every bit as good as other flavors. Friends and family members were equally impressed. Another hit for CHEEZ-IT.

review/summary: Pretty Flavorful
review/text: My family loves Cheez-Its in general, so I was excited about the prospect of the mozzarella version. We were definitely not disappointed!<br /><br />The quality definitely fits with the Cheez-It brand name. It is a rich cracker with a good amount of flavor. The texture is the same as original Cheez-Its. My family enjoys these for both snacking purposes and cooking purposes.<br /><br />As for the mozzarella flavor - well, it does work. I'm not sure that I'd automatically think mozzarella if I were blind-folded and asked to identify the cheese. But, when I use it for cooking with a dish that works well with mozzarella but not some other cheese flavors, this product fits the flavor well.<br /><br />While I'm not sure that these are the snack crackers I'll automatically keep in the pantry, they are some that I will buy for specific cooking or snacking purposes. All in all, a pretty enjoyable product.

review/summary: ~~the more you eat the better they taste~~
review/text: When I first tasted these I could only muster up an "okay".  Then I had a couple more and they tasted better.  After I had about 20 or so I realized that I really like them.  They are a completely different beast from the cheddar cheez-it's.  But they are quite good.  The taste is very light and it's a not an "in your face" kind of flavor.  If I hadn't tried the chedder jack flavor first I might even go so far as to say that they are my favorite next to the original flavor.  If they ever get on my Safeway's shelves I'll pick some up.

review/summary: Cheez-It crackers are a favorite with us
review/text: Cheez-It crackers are a favorite in this house.  Everyone was eager to try the new Mozzarella flavor, so the box was open the minute it came in the door!  They did not disappoint, everyone likes them just as well as the other varieties we have tried.<br /><br />I will say, though, that this is where I find myself holding back from saying they are amazing.  They tasted pretty much like the other white varieties we've had, I couldn't taste any special difference in these being made with Mozzarella.  If I had been given a handful without seeing the box, I never would have known what flavor they were.  I prefer the original cheddar, that's my favorite.<br /><br />Still, my kids had to be limited to one serving, they love Cheez-It crackers in every variety!

review/summary: Nice Change from Cheddar
review/text: I enjoyed this product.  After eating so many of the Cheddar flavor, it gets to be too much.  But, with this flavor, it was a milder and I could eat more than a few and not get sick of the flavor.  My family enjoyed it as well.  My wife, who isn't a big fan of the Cheddar, really liked the taste of these. Lighter and crispy.  I recommend this this product because it is a nice change from the Cheddar.

review/text: the mozzarella taste is mild but I can taste it. It still tastes like a cheez-it mostly and that is why I gave it five stars...because cheez-its are awesome. orginial is of course the best but this is still pretty good. If you like original cheez-its you will like this because of how much like an original cheez-it it tastes. They make a great alternative to the white cheez-its if white cheez-its are your bag.

review/text: I really love Cheez-ITs. I can sit down in front of the tv with a box and before I know it, it's half gone. But these were different. I don't know why, but I expected just a little more from this box, and yet it seemed to fall just short of hitting the nail directly on the head. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed them, but they left an odd after-taste in my mouth that I honestly wasn't that crazy about.<br />Not much else to say, but I do hope that this review helped you in one way or the other.<br />Enjoy.

review/text: Like with every other flavor of Cheez-Its (or cheese crackers in general), I'm addicted. These are really tasty. Everyone in our house (including our 3yo son) liked them. The only problem was that half the box was crumbs, I assume from being tossed around during shipping...so that was a bummer.

review/text: This is a very mild and surprisingly flavorful selection from Cheez-It. I had this with a sandwich and they also go great with Tuna.Since the flavor is less 'cheesy' than the cheddar varieties, for instance these make perfect accompaniments for more flavorful foods. Still a healthy way to snack, and a 'different' approach to crackers with the mild flavor. Really enjoyed these!

The mozzarella flavor was just too light for me, making them taste more like plain old crackers instead of cheese flavored as I'd expected.<br /><br />They're not horrendous, just too lightly flavored for me.

review/summary: Ok, but you should probably check them out at your local grocery
review/text: First: purchasing crackers through the mail is a dicey proposition. These arrived and literally half the box was crumbs. So a small portion of the three stars above (which would be 2.5 if I could) comes from the fact that it was difficult to find a whole cracker in the box. (If this happens to you, do what we did: use them as crumb topping on a casserole).<br /><br />Second: At 5 dollars a box, they ring in at nearly twice the price of the same product at my local grocery...so you should probably check out your local grocery if you need to get your cheez-it fix.<br /><br />Now, on to the flavour--we didn't get creamy or mozzarella from these. They tasted fine...just not like the cheese whose name they wear. (The best flavours are original, the duoz with the smoked cheese flavour, and Swiss). There is too the problem of powdery residue on your fingers after snacking...a big plus of the original flavour is a total lack of this (and a much more cheesey flavour).

review/summary: Chees-ee Cheez-its
review/text: I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the new Mozzrella Cheez-its. I had become rather tired of the old flavor, finding them to be a little on the dry side. But the new flavor is definitely worth trying - a product I would certainly purchase the next time I'm at the grocery store.<br /><br />The new mozzarella flavor is bold and distinct, and I found myself eating them with a glass of wine, something I would not have thought to do with the old flavor. And they went very well with a glass of white wine, though I'm sure they'd be every bit as good with red.<br /><br />My only disappointment was when I received the box of crackers - mostly crumbs. I'm not sure Amazon is used to dealing with fragile food items in their shipping, but hopefully Kellogg won't have the same issue when shipping to stores.<br /><br />This is definitely a product I would recommend. It's on my grocery list already and I can't wait to introduce it to my next book club.

review/summary: Something the whole family likes, but has MSG
review/text: It's not easy for us to find items that everyone in the family likes.  We have one very picky eater, and another "sort of" picky eater.  One of them never liked Cheez-its ever (the regular kind) but was willing to try one of these. They all liked it!<br /><br />The mozarella flavor is mild, and not overwhelming. It makes for a perfect flavor enhancer to the standard Cheez-It cracker.<br /><br />Only problem is that it is seasoned with MSG (monosodium glutamate). This is something asthmatics are told to avoid, and with three asthmatics in the family, it can't be on our grocery list, unfortunately.<br /><br />We all enjoyed the flavor though, and think most other folks will too.

review/text: I like the MOZZARELLA flavored CHEEZ-ITS, but I can't really tell the difference between this flavor and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN9K">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, White Cheddar, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> one.<br /><br />These seem to have a saltier flavor than the regular CHEEZ-IT, which is what I like, and there's a slight powdery texture to the squares. Also, they do have a somewhat milder cheese taste than the original. You can eat them with a sandwich or soup, or just out of the box by themselves.<br /><br />And since these are baked, they make a better alternative to chips, a serving size being 25 crackers, which I would estimate to be about one and one-half medium-sized hands full.

review/text: I was excited to try these out because I so love the regular ones.  I found that eating them by themselves isn't as good as eating them with a sandwich.  I think the mozzarella cheese is just a bit too strong for me without adding in something else.  The crunch was great as well. I wish Cheez-Its could be made a little less salty though.  Overall, a nice product but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to but this flavor.  The standard flavor still is best to me.

I like the fact that they aren't messy when you eat them - there is no need to wipe your fingers after each piece. Before now I've not tried any other flavors of Cheez-It's and was curious about how the Mozzarella flavored Cheez-It's would taste especially since I like Mozzarella (and Cheez-It's!) I found them to be a bit of an acquired taste - good but not as good as the original flavor. I wasn't sure I'd like them when I tasted the first one, but once I got used to the taste I enjoyed them. The mozzarella flavor is good - subtle and not overwhelming. It is good but in the end I prefer the taste of original Cheez-It's.<br /><br />Mozzarella Flavored Cheez-It's taste good but I'm not sure I'd buy them.

review/text: If you're looking for a nice mild flavor in your Cheez-Its, you'll like this flavor.  I liked the smell when I opened the package and liked the taste - these crackers have a nice smooth taste with no weird aftertaste. I don't find the taste to be bland - it's just a very mild and light flavor (which makes it very easy to eat a lot of them in one sitting). I can see munching on these crackers by themselves or when you don't want the cracker to overwhelm other items that you're eating. If they were a bit lower in fat content (7gm for 25 crackers), they'd be perfect.

review/summary: Something Different
review/text: I enjoy CHEEZ-IT crackers. However, now instead of just the regular cheddar flavor, there are a wide variety of CHEEZ-IT flavors. Recently, I tried the new SUNSHINE CHEEZ-IT MOZZARELLA crackers. Mozzarella doesn't have a very strong taste, but it is distinct and can be tasted on these crackers. Personally, I think there are too many artificial cheddar cheese flavors out there and enjoy snacks that have a cheese flavor other than cheddar. I enjoyed these CHEEZ-IT MOZZARELLA crackers and will buy them in the future instead of the original flavored ones.

review/text: I really didn't like these as much as I like the White Cheddar. These have a kind of mild, salty, cardboard kind of flavor. I expected more of a cheese flavor, but it was kind of a fake flavor to me. Now I know that there is not much of a flavor to Mozzarella, so I don't think they should have even tried to duplicate it. On the other hand, my 18 yr. old son thought they were pretty good, but he also likes Burger King and McDonalds too, so there ya go.

She likes the mild mozzarella flavor, and, though, this may not be what Kellogg was going for, she felt that the milder flavor didn't make her breath stink as much as regular Cheez-Its.<br /><br />As for me, I didn't like the initial smell and taste. Kind of...I don't know...sour? Or too sharp or pungent. Once I ate them, the taste was very mild, and not at all like what they smelled like, so, that was a plus. But while these were a nice change, I find I still like Cheddar Cheez-It's best.

review/text: I was really looking forward to a nice mozzarella cheese taste. Instead I got a very bland tasting cracker that did not even have a hint of a mozzarella flavor in it. Then I looked at the list of ingredients to see if mozzarella cheese was even listed. It was--but so far down that the amount in these crackers is negligible, and certainly not enough to affect the taste.<br /><br />Bottom line: These crackers do not have an unpleasant taste, just a very bland nondescript taste. These are not something that I would recommend.

review/summary: Mild, But Not Mozzerella All
review/text: There is no doubt that Cheez-It has made some really classic crackers for all to enjoy. They have had a winning formula for the past several generation with great cheddar crackers that seemed timeless. When I heard they were going to make a mozzarella cheese cracker, I was very skeptical, and it didn't feel like anything that seemed like it was anything that extraordinary. I was right. The first taste of the new mozzarella Cheez-It crackers, reminded me of just how much they tasted like the classic Cheez-It crackers, and I was right. These Cheez-It crackers, taste like the classic cheddar taste of the classic crackers they have been known for definitely. In fact, they are actually made with a mixture of white cheddar cheese into the crackers. Not all mozzarella cheese. They taste alright, but not anything that was a wow factor. If you've loved Cheez-It crackers over the years, I suggest you give their new mozzarella cheese a try.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: C+<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: Why does it taste so salty?
review/text: I was excited when this product came in the mail. I love the original Cheez-it. It is dangerous for me to buy them because my snacking can easily get out of control with them.<br /><br /> A 13.7 ounce box of Cheez-It was much bigger than I expected.<br /><br />The little crackers are crunchy and after you chew for a while they taste creamy but then very salty too. I checked the box, it only has 180mg of salt so why does it taste so salty. I checked the salt in the regular Cheez-it and it is 340 mg. I can't figure out. Why does a craker with much less sodium taste saltier than one that doesn't. I have to watch my sodium intake and sure enough, the next day my fingers were swollen and it was difficult to take off my ring.<br /><br />I had my husband taste it too and he thought the crackers tasted salty and sour.<br /><br />Occaisonally, I will brush off the salt all off the top of a cracker and offer it to my cockatiels. They tasted it and spit it out. Wise birds.<br /><br />Also, even though the box was packed with big air pillows, there was a lot crumbling in the last 1/3 of the box. Down there it was mostly crumbs.<br /><br />I would not buy it, I just don't like them.

Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYNTZ8">Cheez It Baby Swiss Crackers, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN22">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Duoz, Sharp Cheddar & Parmesan, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN9K">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, White Cheddar, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavors were good, my particular favorites were the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZXFWP2">Cheez-It Snack Mix, Baked Snack Assortment, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317ERWQ">Cheez-It Baked Snack Crackers, Italian Four Cheese, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> flavors.<br /><br />Now Kellogg's has added a new Mozzarella Cheez-Its flavor, and I couldn't resist trying them. I have to say they aren't bad, but they aren't even close to being my favorite flavor. I think one of my favorite parts of the Cheez-Its experience is the bold flavor in their crackers, and the Mozzarella flavor is a bit too mild to suit me. Like I said, they aren't bad, but I wouldn't say they are great.<br /><br />Of course, something like flavor is a really subjective thing. Other people may prefer the mild flavor of the Mozzarella Cheez-Its to the bolder tastes in their other offerings.<br /><br />In all honesty, after discovering the Italian Four Cheese flavor, no other Cheez-It really comes close for me, with the exception of the Snack Mix, which is really completely different from just a Cheez-It.<br /><br />Do I recommend the Mozzarella Cheez-Its? I think they are an interesting flavor and are worth trying yourself. Everyone's tastes are different, and although I prefer the other flavors, you might very well consider the Mozzarella your own favorite.

review/summary: Nothing special just okay
review/text: I found the Cheez-It Mozzarella Cheese crackers nothing special and just okay in flavor. For me they tasted somewhat sour, with a hint of cheese and the bare whisper of salt. My daughter says she likes them as she liked the crackers as they tasted a bit cheesy and salty.<br /><br />So there you have it: My taste buds were not awed by the flavor while my daughter loved the flavor.<br /><br />Recommend with caveats given.

review/text: I have always been a fan of CHEEZ-IT crackers.  The white cheddar has always been my favorite, especially the low fat ones, but these new mozzarella cheese crackers are really tasty too.  My husband likes to take these in his lunch, and he likes the kind with the jalepeno pepper flavor.  This is a great product and a new flavor that most all people enjoy.  Lets face it, if you like pizza, you like mozzarella chees.  We both would highly recommend them.

review/summary: PASS! - I'll stick with the original
review/text: The good thing about a cheese like cheddar is that is packs a lot of flavor in it.  This translates well to secondary products like crackers.  Mozzarella - not so much.  Mozzarella is so mild that when you try to put it into a product like a cracker, it will inherently have a too mild flavor, so you'll need to enhance this somehow.  The easy thing would be to add salt, but Kellogg decided to use spices.  This makes the product taste closer to "Ranch dressing" more than cheese.<br /><br />The product is also marked as "Creamy & Mild".  True enough but just what the heck do they use to make a cracker taste "creamy"???  It is kind of weird to me.<br /><br />I'll stick with the original.

review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: These Mozzarella flavored Cheez-it's are a bit more mild than the White Cheddar ones which are my usual choice. I'm not sure I'd pick out the flavor as a mozzarella cheese, the milder flavor was good, but not distinguishable or immediately identifiable as being like the cheese it's named after. Kind of a creamy aftertaste that reminds me of mozzarella. I think I'll prefer the Cheez-It's with a bit more of a flavor to them. I don't find anything bad or off about this flavor, but to me, there isn't anything special there either.<br /><br />There were a lot of crushed crackers in the box, more so than when I buy them from the store. As a snack, Cheez-It's are a favorite- they just always seem to hit the spot.

review/text: The new Cheez-It Mozzarella flavored crackers are great tasting. The crunch was transformed into a creamy cheese flavor as I greedily shoveled them into my mouth. I had to shovel them, because the crackers were broken into crumbs when I received them. This however in no way detracted from the flavor or deterred me from the swift completion of my appointed task. Wait, I think I missed one. Mmmmm

review/summary: These are great.
review/text: I love cheez-Its from the get go but these mozzarella cheese ones are truly scrumptious.  They claim they are creamy...... and they really are creamy tasting.  From the first cracker in your mouth you think 'creamy'.  Sooo DELICIOUS!  There is 180 mg of sodium per each of 13 servings/box at 25 crackers per serving.  They do have 7 grams of fat/serving but no trans fats.  From a diabetic point of view, the 19 grams of carbohydrates and 150 calories/serving is a lot even with zero sugars and 3 grams of protein per serving.  I try to restrict my consumption to one or two serving each time I grab the box for a snack but I have to admit this is really hard to do.  They just taste so darn great!  If I have a complaint, the only one I have is that this product contains monosodium glutamate, MSG.  I am highly allergic to this well known neurotoxin and MUST be very careful with my intake of this dangerous chemical.  It is on the very bottom of the ingredients list so hopefully there is not a hugh amount of it in these crackers.  Since I just ate them, I'll know if there is too much MSG if I develop a headache and lock jaw type symptoms tomorrow.  Makes me wonder WHY put it into this delicious snack in the first place?  I do highly recommend this scrumptious treat if you can tolerate the MSG.  I'll have to limit my intake due to the MSG.

review/summary: Awesome, can't get them away from the kids!
review/text: I always was under the impression that kids would prefer the regular version of Cheez-its, you know, the orange, cheddar kind.  Not so!  These were grabbed so very quickly that the box turned into a blur of red!  They say they're creamy, weird for an ad campaign for crackers, but they're really not kidding!  Creamy mozarella can be sensed throughout these little bursts of flavor, and once again, the kids just go nuts for them.  SO glad we tried these, definitely a "keeper" in this house.  They arrived fresh from amazon, unbroken, and packaged well.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Something Old, Something New
review/text: My OLD favorite, was the "Original" flavor Cheeze-It, which had a strong cheddar flavor, and lots of crunch.<br /><br />My NEW favorite is the Mozzarella flavor Cheese-it, because it has a true mozzarella cheese taste, as well as that old time crunch that everybody in my family loves.<br /><br />We generally eat the Original flavor as a snack right out of the box, or along with soup (tomato soup, in particular).<br /><br />The Mozzarella flavor as a plain snack, right out of the box, was good, but we still prefer the original, (thus the 4 stars) but I used them in  the following ways as well:<br /><br />--topped a caesar salad with a few crackers (in place of croutons, and that worked great, taste-wise.<br /><br />-- topped off some tomato soup with a few crackers at the dinner table, and that didn't work quite as well, taste wise.<br /><br /> --crushed approx. 2/3 cup  of these and used them as a bread crumb coating for a baked chicken breast parmesan, topped with tomato sauce. Very good, since the mozzarella flavor really came through.<br /><br />Nutritionally, and calorically, they are about the same as the original flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say if you like the old, original Cheeze-It flavor, you'll enjoy the new mozzarella flavor too.

review/summary: Nice Cheese Crackers
review/text: First of all, one must keep in mind that the regular flavor Cheez-IT isn't necessarily the best tasting snack food around.  These Mozzarella crackers cleverly offers a combination of acidity and creaminess.  The end result is a pretty good immitation of Mozzarella cheese flavor.  The overall impression is quite positive although the degree of saltiness is also high.  Mozzarella cheese isn't by itself of strong enough flavor so saltiness ends up being part of the overall flavor profile to promote general satisfaction.  I am ok with this product as the flavor is actually less artificial than the standard version Cheez-IT crackers.

review/text: Cheez-Its are a guilty pleasure of mine, so I jumped at the chance to try this new flavor. What a flavor it is! Zesty, and really pronounced. Everyone in the house loved it!<br /><br />But getting them shipped to you might not be the best purchasing method, since our box was easily half crumbs. They tasted so good, though, that I didn't want to just toss them out. So I decided to tinker and crushed them up to use in place of Panko bread crumbs when making Parmesan Crusted Chicken breasts. YUM! That was such a success that I decided to use them in place of the bread crumb topping on homemade Mac & Cheese. Another winner!<br /><br />Unfortunately, my local commissary isn't carrying these yet. I'm pestering the manager, though. They're just that good.

review/summary: Different But Still Yummy
review/text: I have always been a fan of Cheez-It so I was really excited to try out the new Mozzarella Cheese flavor and I have to say how happy that I have. It definitely has that cheese taste that is all baked into a tiny little cracker, which is one of my favorite qualities of Cheez-It's. But the mozzarella flavor has a smoother and more subtle yet creamier taste then the normal cheddar flavor and I can honestly see myself using this in salads and soups since it would compliment my food better then the normal crackers. But it also satisfies my snack factor so give it a try!

review/text: It seems to me that Cheez-It has always gone for bold flavors. These are not that at all. These aren't horrible; they taste like pretty mild-flavored Cheez-Its. I'm not sure exactly what they were going for here in choosing Mozzarella for their newest flavor. Such a mild cheese would be hard to impart into a cracker. And I don't think they've been successful here. While these taste good, they do not taste anything like Mozzarella. The mild taste might be an appeal to some who just want a slightly-cheesy cracker. But I think most Cheez-It fans will be underwhelmed and prefer the bolder flavors Cheez-It is known for.

review/summary: What does it bring to the table?
review/text: I like Cheez-Its. I mean, I reeeaaaaally like them, so I never buy them because I don't actually need to eat any Cheez-Its. Seriously. They are a snack food that does not repay the calorie cost with sufficient nutrition, so I probably only eat them twice a year.<br /><br />But free Cheez-its, sent to me for review? This I had to try.<br /><br />I like crackers and I chowed through a few of these in search of an answer to the only question that matters, which is, do these taste  like mozzarella? Well, if mozzarella were dry, crispy, and charged with a faint chemical aftertaste, then I would say, sure. Kinda. I guess. But no, they do not taste like mozzarella in the way that regular Cheez-its taste like cheddar. I think this is because cheddar at its best is dry, sharp, and a little grainy. Mozzarella doesn't translate well into a cracker, as it's a melting cheese.

review/summary: Crunchy Crumbles
review/text: I received a cardboard box from Amazon that rattled. They sent the Cheez-ITs with no padding in the box! Upon opening the package, I saw crumbles with a few whole Cheez-ITs.<br /><br />They taste like salt, fat, sugar and mild cheese flavoring. Mozzarella cheese doesn't have much flavor, so it is logical that the Cheez-ITS don't have much flavor. So, why did my husband and I eat the whole box? Because they're salty, crunchy and loaded with fat. They don't taste great but they taste good. However, I think the original Cheez-ITS are superior in taste. I'd buy them over the Mozzarella flavor any day.

review/summary: Well done, Cheez-It.  Well done.
review/text: It's certainly a fun exercise trying to come up with spin-off products that are as popular or more popular than the original product. Such mainstays as Diet Coke and Honey Nut Cheerios are usually the only ones I can think of before I A.D.D. myself off to another topic.<br /><br />What was I talking about?<br /><br />Oh:  Mozzarella Cheez-Its.  I've been eating Cheez-Its since I was a kid, and it's usually better to not have a box around as it's hard for me to stop eating them.  "White Cheddar" Cheez-Its are, so far, the only spin-off product that I like as much as the original, and these new Mozzarella Cheez-Its come in a close second.  With a similar look and feel to the White Cheddar variety, they do indeed have a slightly more "creamy & mild" (as advertised on the box) taste, but, frankly, aren't too terribly different. The ingredients even show "white cheddar cheese" higher up on the list than mozzarella!<br /><br />No worries, though.  We don't buy this kind of product for its old-school Italiano cheese authenticity, nor, certainly, for its healthful benefits (btw, fat, salt and other bad things are similar to the other Cheez-It varieties). We buy it because we like the way it tastes, and those that like regular Cheez-Its and the White Cheddar variety as their guilty snack cracker pleasure won't be disappointed.

The Sunshine bakers manage to get<br /><br />the flavor listed on the box into their crackers, and as usual they taste great.<br /><br />These crackers serve me as double duty. First of all as a satisfying snack, and also<br /><br />as a replacment when I am out of croutons for a salad. It does not matter what<br /><br />flavor you use, the crackers are just the right size for salads. Or to float in a<br /><br />bowl of tomato soup. The new mozzarella flavor crackers are perfect for this.

review/summary: Quite tasty but high in fat content
review/text: As is unfortunately the case more often than not, if a food tastes really yummy then it's probably not very good for you. These crackers have a nice, creamy taste to them and they pack 7 grams of fat per serving. Yes, that is fewer grams than potato chips, but for a cracker I think that's pretty high in fat content. The taste, however, is very good and these would make a good snack if consumed in moderation. One concern for me was the state of the crackers I received. I tasted these as part of the Vine program and the box I received was very smashed up and the crackers were partially obliterated. If I were buying these crackers, I would have been upset about their smashed-up condition. Perhaps it would not be a good idea to buy these in bulk until you can verify that shipping of these crackers won't damage the product.

When I say my boys liked it, wha tI mean is that's what they said in response to my question. Since then, however, they haven't clamored to have it again, whereas they continue to ask for pistachios for snacks.
