review/summary: Product fine, packaging not great
review/text: This is a quick and easy way to make fresh bread. But, even though the four bags came in a sealed Bob's Red Mill box (inside an Amazon packaging box), one of the four bags was opened and spilling when it arrived. I'm hoping this was just a fluke.<br /><br />This bread mix produces a nice-looking loaf in the bread machine. Although it's 10-grain, I don't think it's 100% whole wheat (the first ingredient is something like "enriched flour" rather than whole wheat flour). It definitely has the lighter, chewier texture of a less-than fully whole wheat bread.<br /><br />This was ok to have on hand when I don't have time to make my own whole wheat/grain bread, but I'm going to try the whole wheat mix next time to see if it's better, as I prefer a denser whole wheat/grain bread.

review/summary: Tasty Halva, Brittleness makes it a Messy Snack
review/text: This is a great tasting Halva. Lately, I have been purchasing foods imported from Greece to help bolster the flagging Greek economy. Fortunately, I was quite satisfied with this Halva as it is as good as any purchased in gourmet grocery stores in Chicago or NYC. Unfortunately, it is loaded with fat and fat calories so purchasing it in a one pound block can be hazardous to your diet. Additionally, it is brittle so it requires a plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. Ideally, the Halva should come in individually wrapped snack-sized portions so that mess would be minimized while fostering portion control. Limitations aside, this is a delicious snack for those with the appropriate will power.

review/summary: Great for vegan dogs and owners alike!
review/text: We have two dogs.  And they both LOVE this stuff.  (But one doesn't count because she'll eat anything.)  Our vet said that the other dog needed a special diet due to a severe wheat/corn/soy allergy--she was constantly itching, biting and digging at her skin.  As a vegan myself, the thought of feeding her sweet potato/duck/salmon food was SO wrong, but of course, I conceded because I wanted my doggie to be happy and comfortable.<br /><br />Long story short, I went out of town and the dog sitter accidentally mixed up the foods and gave v-dog to my allergy-ridden pup.  When I returned from my trip and discovered the error, I expected a big itchy mess, but she was completely fine!  No more itching, no pink irritated skin, nothing.  Even our vet agrees she's not special needs anymore-- apparently, v-dog helped her build up an immunity to all that ailed her.<br /><br />And all of us have been vegan ever after.  :)

review/summary: BEST dog food out there
review/text: Since my dogs transitioned to a mostly Vegan/Vegetarian diet, their health has really improved. They used to eat Wellness Lamb & Rice (dry and canned) - I was told the meat that Wellness used was "human grade" -- as opposed to the usual slaughterhouse slop/floor waste and euthanized shelter animals rendered for dog food. I never quite believed it ... and, being a long-time Vegetarian and now Vegan, it didn't sit well with me to feed this to my dogs.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided to change their diet, as well. I initially mixed in their old food (Wellness) with the V-Dog and the Natural Balance Vegetarian dog food.  This took about 2 weeks.  Since then (about 6 months ago), I would say they are definitely reaping the health benefits.  They no longer have runny stool or diarrhea, nor do they have gas. Also, some skin issues have cleared up. In addition to the health improvements, my dogs really LOVE the taste of this stuff. The kibbles are a good size, too.<br /><br />I understand that V-Dog is coming up w/a new formula at the end of January 2012.  According to their website, the "new formula is wheat, corn, soy and gluten-free, and slightly higher in protein at 24%."  I can't imagine how they can improve upon what they have right now, but I'm looking forward to (my dogs) trying it.  I would recommend ordering directly from the V-Dog website (www.v-dogfood.com) - the shipping is free and it arrives w/in a couple of days (as opposed to "business days" or a week or two like some "free shipping" deals).<br /><br />Try this dog V-Dog Food - your dogs will love it and you will feel good knowing that you are not feeding unhealthy and unethical slaughterhouse waste to your best friends.

review/summary: Best dog food - vegan or not
review/text: After my dog lost interest in her food (Wellness chicken and rice), I looked around for an alternative that had really great ingredients with a comparable price. As a vegan, I thought I would try V-Dog, even though my dog is very picky, so I wasn't sure if she'd like it. The ingredients (the base is pea protein, with other delicious, healthy things like blueberries!) are top quality - there's nothing in the ingredient list I wouldn't eat - and the price is comparable to Wellness. I was surprised that my dog LOVES this food - she eats it right after I put it in her bowl, something I've never seen her do before. Her chronic skin problems have gotten significantly better, her coat is really silky, and she has lots of energy. For me, I love that it doesn't have a greasy, meaty smell or texture. I'd definitely recommend this to any dog owner - vegan or not.

review/text: I have bought from this company before. There is a major change in the SIZE of their containers. The description states "packed in large" containers.  FOR INSTANCE...Garlic powder (granulated). The last container was also "large" and rightfully so as it was 18 OZ. Today, I ordered the same product...and the picture caused it to LOOK like a large container but it ONLY had 10 oz of the item. You would NOT know the difference just by looking at the PICS.  This is all true for many of the product I purchased...Not a good thing to mislead consumers like this.

They are totally not worth it - I'm going to keep trying other products until I can find a good coffee. We miss our Senseo pods.

review/text: I compared so many different dog food brands before I settled on Blue Buffalo.  I used to feed my swiss mountain dogs Holistic anchovy until they changed the recipe to include pork and chicken meal (presumably to save $$).  Blue buffalo has none of that in it and it gets delivered to my front door in two days with Amazon prime.  Call me a nut but I always taste the food I feed my dogs so I can get a real idea of what I am feeding them, because lets be honest most of our dogs would eat anything that you put in front of them.  Lets just say that Blue Buffalo had a lot more of an authentic fish and oatmeal taste and texture than Holistic or Eagle Pack did.  I also add a little pro-biotic to their food to help with digestion.  I will be buying Blue Buffalo in the future for my boys.

review/text: In a household with two dogs, we have several requirements for our dog food.  We have a Great Dane and a Samoyed.  The protein levels and calcium levels are both important with a giant breed and this food falls into the right range.  With the glucosamine and Omega 3 in the food this one fit all of the nutrient requirements.  There are a few foods out there that hit all of those points.  Our Samoyed has a sensitive stomach as well - so something he both likes to eat and doesn't upset his stomach is important also.  As a side benefit - talking to other great dane owners, they are feeding much larger quantities of food than we are.  Less food to maintain an optimal weight provides two benefits - a lower food cost and they digest it well - which means less comes out the other end.

review/text: My dog is an 80 pound lab with epilepsy. A few month ago, he started having seizures again despite his medication. I decided to quit using cheap grocery store dog food and switch to "premium" dog food. Since I have switched to blue buffalo, he has not had a single seizure. I have actually started giving him less of his medication. His overall energy level has improved as well. I think this food has made a significant improvement in his overall health.<br /><br />The fish smell is strong with this food. Plan on putting it in an air tight container or your house will begin to smell like fish.

review/summary: Great product for dogs with joint problems
review/text: Our dog has hip dysplasia which is a fancy way of saying her bones in her hip joints rub on one another. This food has glucosamine and chondroiton in it which helps lubricate joints and helps to relieve arthritis type issues. This way, we don't have to provide her with additional supplements. Along with Adequan (an injection we give once month), her hip dysplasia is kept under control and she's able to be her normal puppy self.<br /><br />In terms of food quality, Blue Buffalo is high on the list and my dog seems to enjoy it well enough to eat it regularly, but not overeat.<br /><br />Packaging does seem to be an issue from the seller, since my shipment arrived with the box partially damaged and partially opened, but the bag inside was still ok.

review/summary: Finally something our 8 dogs agree on!
review/text: For complex reasons I am in charge of purchasing food for eight dogs of wildly varying ages, breeds, health and degrees of finicky eating habits. Blue Buffalo is the first and only food that ALL of them will happily eat while remaining healthy.<br /><br />Every other brand we have tried, from the boutique specialty brands to the purportedly "near perfect" brands our vet recommends has never seemed to agree with all eight dogs. We dealt constantly with at least one dog and often several of them getting sick, vomiting, being stricken with diarrhea or (in the case of the elderly dogs) flatly refusing to eat more than a mouthful of one brand of dog food after another.<br /><br />At one point I had actually resigned myself to cooking all of their food, which might seem reasonable if all eight dogs were living in one household, but as they are living in 3 homes several miles apart it became a huge problem for someone with a 60 hour work week.<br />Blue Buffalo has been a real find and a huge relief as all eight dogs have been thriving on it for over 2 years and are in better health than they have ever been.<br /><br />I noted several reviews discussing issues that their dogs had with loose bowels after consuming the chicken and rice flavor. I would venture to suggest that these dogs might be sensitive to the amount of chicken in the food, as consuming large amounts of poultry is a very common cause of intestinal distress and loose bowels in some dogs.<br /><br />The fish and oatmeal, sweet potato and fish and lamb and rice varieties have posed no problems at all (even for our 3 year old Lab who has some congenital bowel issues that make him sensitive to even the smallest treat containing corn, wheat and several other ingredients) so if you are considering giving Blue Buffalo a try, we have had great success with all three of them.

review/summary: fantastic
review/text: we have two companions.  both about 7 years old, one a chow-golden mix, the other a st. bernard-boxer mix.  about six months ago, the chow-golden started regurgitating his food (different brands: beneful, nutro, etc.) minutes after eating it.  after getting advice and doing my own research, we sussed that he had a cereal sensitivity.  i switched them to blue buffalo and he's not had an issue since.<br /><br />and other benefits are very apparent: they both love their food and are happy to eat it, their stools are a good size and firm, their coats feel better and their skin is healthier (less scratching and chewing).  we're actually not spending that much more on food, either.  we found that as we follow the feeding guide, they are getting a bit less in volume but the food is much more nutritionally dense.<br /><br />very pleased, and i wouldn't go to anything else for my pups! (they also enjoy the large breed chicken, but the fish and oatmeal is their favorite ... word of advice: you can absolutely smell the fish so likely best to get a nicely sealed dog food bin.)

review/summary: We only buy Blue Buffalo
review/text: We used to feed our dogs "regular" dog food, until we realized it had all kinds of by-products and things that not even us humans would want to eat. So we switched to Blue Buffalo. I usually buy whatever flavor is on sale that week, and they do really well with switching from one flavor to another...as long as we stick to Blue Buffalo brand. I have noticed with the Fish flavor, their coats are shinier. We wouldn't go back to any other dog food, BB is well worth the money.

However, yesterday UPS dumped four practically destroyed cardboard boxes on my front porch. One box was so damaged the dog food bag inside had the end torn completely open. Spent awhile sweeping up all of the spilled kibbles. So much for the convenience of ordering dog food online. From now on I will make a bulk purchase locally instead. That way I might be able to get a larger bag, and if not, at least it will be intact when I get it to the house.

review/summary: A nice step up from plain rice cereal
review/text: Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.

review/summary: A well-balanced meal for baby
review/text: We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food.

Maybe I missed that in the description, but in any case, everywhere I've read and according to my pediatrician, you're supposed to avoid cow's milk products before age 1 (why they make formula using cow's milk and not a much more digestible milk like goat baffles me and is a rant for another time--my son drinks the lactose free kind, in any case). I ordered another variety of "Wholesome breakfast" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them.

review/summary: Great Tasting, Fairly Spicy, But Watch Serving Size - Recommended
review/text: These Nong Shim "Bowl Noodle, Hot and Spicy" bowls are very good tasting and a little over the medium range of the spicy hot range. The spiciness is about right right for me, but no one else in my house can handle these.<br /><br />While they can not be directly microwaved, these are easy enough to prepare by following the directions. All you have to do is pull the cover halfway up, open and add the contents of the flavor packet, add hot water, and let it sit for three minutes.<br /><br />My only concern about these is that the nutritional information lists the serving size is listed as 1/2 the bowl (didn't notice that before we ordered them), which means you have to double the values if you eat the whole thing. A whole bowl then contains 380 Calories, 50 Carbs (too much for me), and 78% of your total daily recommended Sodium. I get around this by braking and removing half of the dry noodle bunch before adding the hot water.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I have been eating these noodles for a very long time.  It can be purchased in some Asian markets; however, it depends on the city.  The noodle is hot if one puts all of the spices in the bowl, so the hotness can be controlled depending on how many spices are dropped in.  Some vegetables that are dried moisten when water is added, and this helps add texture in the noodle.  I think there is some dried seafood or something in it as well.

review/summary: Not as good as it used to be
review/text: Nong Shim noodles were always my favorite noodles. Spicy, tasty, and relatively economical.<br /><br />However, Nong Shim has changed the packaging AND the taste of the noodles (probably for the American market).<br /><br />What you see in the Amazon photo were the OLD Nong Shim noodles. They were very spicy, had large veggie chunks, and were hearty and filling. The noodles came in a foam bowl with the blue, green, and red packaging.<br /><br />The NEW noodles (and likely what you will get if you order) are in a white plastic bowl (not foam). The packaging is dominated by white and the noodles are called "Hot and Spicy BEEF FLAVOR" rather than simply "Hot and Spicy."<br /><br />The taste is FAR less spicy than what it used to be. The veggie chunks are smaller, and the weird little (tofu?) red and white veggies are gone. Another reviewer said that the noodles are orange instead of the original red, and this is correct. The noodles are less flavorful and tend to get mushy after awhile. Even adding an egg or other spices doesn't really pump it up enough.<br /><br />So, while these are still good, they are not above and beyond the regular $.10 Ramen noodles like they used to be. All the raves about this product were likely about the original product imported from Korea. The new "Made in USA" version is not quite as satisfying.

review/summary: Super-tasty noodles, but I can also taste the bowl
review/text: I want to love these because I love Nong Shim spicy noodles, and I'm lazy, so I'd rather heat up a bowl than wash a pan.  I make these the usual way: add very hot water, recover, let stand.  But with about every third bite, I can taste the styrofoam-type flavor of the bowl.  It's an unappetizing flavor.  I seem to be the only one who has commented on this, so maybe I have gotten odd bowls or am smelling it rather than tasting it, but I thought I should mention it in case it helped anyone else.  It's back to the cook-in-a-pot noodles for me--which are great.

review/summary: Try Frying them!
review/text: Cook the noodles normally, but don't add the spices.  When the noodles are done, remove and strain out the water.  Heat a pan and add butter/margerine.  Add the noodles on moderate heat and allow the butter to coat.  Do not burn or overheat.  Open the flavor packet and add to the frying noodles, but not all of it the powder should absorb into the butter and moisture, and glaze the noodles.  Add your own beef, chicken or pork, green onions, and other vegetables to taste and allow the spice packet to coat the meat as well as the stir-fry noodle.  Cook until the meat is finished and remove.  Serve hot.  This works with Ramen also, but the spicy hot noodles seem to add that extra kick.  Yes, it has MORE fat, carbs, but the meat and vegetables also add some real nutrition and you can easily divide it up.

review/summary: Same price as in many grocery stores
review/text: I went to a couple grocery stores for price comparison.  A lot of stores carry this brand now that Asian noodles are getting popular. This brand is very good. I would like to just point out that this particular flavor has won the Chef Award for good taste. The award is shown on the lid. It is a well deserved.  Basically, the chef award is given to the best in class for any particular year. An independent panel reviews the taste of several products. The one with the best taste gets the emblem in the front. I've found the Chef Award seal to be pretty reliable so far.<br /><br />These noodles were very flavorful. Also, if spiciness is a concern to you, because Korean ramen tends to be hotter than a lot of American brands, you can easily cut down the spice by diluting the noodles in more water than recommended or by cutting down the amount of the spice packet you add. The flavor is still pretty good even if you dilute the mix by 1/3. It's just not as hot.<br /><br />I definitely plan on ordering some more in the future.

review/text: I used to eat these all the time when I was an undergrad. I'm so glad Amazon is selling them so I don't have to go looking for them in Asian supermarkets anymore (living w/ no car means trying to carry as little groceries as possible). It's a little pricier on Amazon even with the subscription price, which equals to about 90 cents per bowl, where as when I used to buy them at the Asian supermarket, I could easily find them on sale for about 70 cents per bowl. But anyway, you're paying for the convenience of staying at home.<br /><br />I love this flavor, despite the sodium and msg, which is typical of almost all instant noodles. It's medium spicy in my opinion, not as hot as the Nong Shim Gourmet Spicy Picante bowl noodle but tastes saltier and stronger than the Nong Shim Kimchi bowl (which is a little bit more sour compared to this). There are little dried fish cakes and onions floating around and it makes a great light meal :)

review/summary: Do not buy this product
review/text: Do not buy this product.  It is NOT the product advertised!<br /><br />I used to be a regular buyer of the Nong Shim Hot and Spicy Picante Bowl Noodles.  It appears that Nong Shim has made a change to their product offering and I have not been able to buy this product anywhere.<br /><br />A while ago, I made my normal order for the product and received a case of Hot and Spicy *beef* noodles.  This is a very different product than what is advertised on this page.  The new product has a flavor that is bland as compared to the original and in particular is much less spicy.<br /><br />In thinking that it was my error in the order, I went back and made sure to order from this link...and I still received the beef flavor.  At that point, I contacted Amazon about the error.  They refunded the second order and said that they would correct the page so that it has the correct info.<br /><br />Now, a few weeks later, it appears that they still have not corrected the product information.<br /><br />Please do not order this product from this link.  If you want to try the new beef flavor, search for Nong Shim spicy beef and you will get a page for that product.  But if you order from here expecting to get what it shows, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Finally, unrelated to my purchase here, I have started to see the new product on store shelves with the word "beef" removed from the cardboard outer wrapper.  I purchased one from my local store hoping that it was new packaging for the old product.  Much to my dismay, the inner packaging (ie. the lid on the bowl, which you cannot see before purchasing) still said that it is the beef flavor.<br /><br />It's too bad that Nong Shim has made this change.  I really enjoyed the old product, but I do not like the new one at all.

These bowls are quick and easy to make, are filling, and taste great!

As I eat these I have to stop periodically and suck air into my mouth to cool it off, and it makes my eyes pop open wide, but then I am right back eating more.  I just finished one and my mouth is still tingling.  I was happy to find these here on Amazon with the special discount on top of the subscribe and save discount.  Wonderful price.  I highly reommend these if you like hot stuff and even if you don't like hot stuff you still might like these.  If they aren't especially healthy, well, I don't want to hear about it, lol.

review/summary: Decent spice
review/text: Nong Shim Noodle Bowls are probably the tastiest out of all the cheap ramen noodle options out there.<br /><br />Spice- Hot & spicy flavor does have a decent kick to it. However, being a spicy-flavor nut, I add a little Sriracha to it as well.<br /><br />Noodles- The noodles themselves taste good even without the broth, and are better than Nissin and some of the other brands out there. Not too spongy.<br /><br />Dressing- As mentioned in one or two of the other reviews, I like doctoring up my ramen with an egg or add some leafy vegetables for some crunch. Mixing the egg into the broth thickens it, if that is what you are into.<br /><br />Bowl- Packaging is great because you can microwave the bowl. However, if you are Earth-conscious and do not like non-biodegradable packaging, this is not the best option for you. I usually add water and microwave the bowl rather than adding boiled water to the bowl.<br /><br />Nutrition- The salt content is terribly high, as might be expected. If you have congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, or other cardiovascular issues (or are scared you might develop either), you should stray clear from this product.<br /><br />Value- I have bought these on sale on Amazon in the past. Of course, subscribe-and-save is the way to go if you want to maximize value!

review/text: Nong Shim Korean Cup Ramen is good. But it's overpriced here on Amazon. I guess it's for those folks who don't have an Asian market or Costco nearby.  These should not be microwaved, regardless of the direction it states on the package.  You should pour hot water onto the bowl, or better yet, remove the content and put it in a regular bowl (non styrofoam or plastic).  But of course if you're in a hurry, just pour the hot water and don't microwave!!  To make it taste even better, add some rice. The noodles are thinner than the Shin Ramen ones. I enjoy taking a bite of the noodles and slurping the broth together. Quite yummy that way.

review/text: Since I hadn't tried Green Rooibos before ordering this tea, it was a bit of a risk to purchase 3 packs to start with. However, it turned out to be one of the best decisions (regarding tea) I've made. It's delicate, sweet, and overall delicious, especially since it's blended with Honeybush. Definitely good enough to drink on its own, without sweeteners of any kind! As an unexpected but not surprising bonus, my skin looked 10 times better when I had a cup every day. Green rooibos is full of antioxidants, and since my skin is VERY sensitive to foods, irritation, and inflammation, it was a relief to find something that improved it so much. I would recommend drinking this every day or applying it topically with a cotton ball if you have any kind of skin problems, and seeing if it improves your condition. It certainly couldn't hurt!<br /><br />Bottom line: I highly doubt anyone can dislike this tea!

review/text: Initially, I had thought Numi teas were a bit pricey compared to many bagged teas I had tried. Being an avid lover of rooibos, though, I decided to try this and also their red rooibos. Luckily, my local grocery store carried both. This has since become my first choice for green rooibos, despite the price. The addition of honeybush is the perfect complement to the tea's delicate flavor and every cup yields a relaxing sensation like any good rooibos tea should. Bottom line - if you're a fan of rooibos and you don't mind paying the price, this tea will not disappoint.

review/text: We love this coffee...have it on auto-delivery. Receive a larger bag than we can find in our stores here and it's less expensive. Considering I'm not paying for s/h, it's a win-win for me.
