review/summary: Meh.  My daughter eats most everything else... this isn't her thing.
review/text: I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite.

review/summary: Not as yummy as Earth's Best's other flavors
review/text: We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein.

review/summary: Our Baby's Favorite Dinner
review/text: The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.

review/summary: My daughter's favorite jarred food
review/text: My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!

review/summary: the only jarred baby food my son ate
review/text: From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.

review/summary: One of my son's favorites
review/text: My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.<br /><br />We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors.

review/summary: Baby loves it, but there is plastic in it
review/text: This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.

Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.

review/text: I recently ordered Edward & Sons Not-Beef Bouilon Cubes and confess that the flavor frightens me.  The taste is so close to actual beef bouilon that I have had to re-read the ingredients just about every time that I have used it.  Additionally, Edward & Son uses palm oil.  Palm oil has the same texture as beef fat and can be scraped off the top just one would scrape fat off of broth.<br /><br />The flavor is excellent for making seitan.  I have used it for the simmering broth as well as put 1/2 a cube into the actual seitan mix.  Very tasty.

Gives your vegan burgers a nice flavor and excellent in all of my sauces that are suppose to mimic a beefy flavor.  I guess the next thing I will try are the Not-Chicken bouillon at Amazon.  So glad that Amazon carries this as I can't find anything that comes close to it in my little meat and potatoes town. Thanks!

review/summary: Buyer beware: It does have MSG...
review/text: When I tasted this product, I was so impressed by the flavor. It tasted just like the Beef Top Ramen Flavor I enjoyed growing up. I bought this bouillon because the packaging said NO MSG. This was important to me because I avoid MSG at all costs. I recently realized this product has yeast extract (which always contains MSG). Another review mentioned that the company recently retracted the "NO MSG" claim, but too little, too late. I have already consumed and gifted away most of my 12 boxes with the understanding this was an MSG-free bouillon. If you are avoiding MSG, I recommend doing some research because there are about 50 different names that can be used to hide MSG in an ingredient label. "Yeast Extract" is the perfect example of this. There are a lot of other names for flavor enhancers out there that always or sometimes contain MSG. Unfortunately, I did my research about a year after I purchased this product, but hopefully this review will save some other health-conscience consumer from making a purchase they regret.

review/text: I bought these after I switched to eating all whole grains as an alternative to regular egg noodles.  They taste fine but they're really nothing special.  The noodles are also pretty narrow and I had hoped for something wider.  My biggest complaint though was how several of the bags (I think it was 4) popped open during shipping and I ended up throwing them out since I didn't want to use a product from an opened bag.  If they had a better way to ship these they might be worth buying again but as for me, I'm going to try to find another whole wheat egg noodle.

The products inside the tiny tub are dollar store quality (not to mention some were damaged)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P2WTRO">Bath Time Baby Gift Basket -Medium</a> and I would NOT recommend anyone purchasing.  Also, Amazon will not refund and when I call the number Amazon gave me, you have to leave a message for them to get back to you.  There is no live person you are able to communicate with.  Smells FISHY to me!

review/summary: For 100 Calories...they're fine
review/text: I've been trying to find good and substantial 100 calorie supplement bars because I am dieting. These are okay. I think the white chocolate raspberry is my least favorite. I much prefer the cookies and cream variety. They aren't very big. Maybe about have the size of a playing card and half as thick as a deck. These bars are covered in a light yogurt (or chocolate, depending on the flavor) coating which makes them less than ideal for hiking or leaving in your car because they get all melty and weird. They aren't bad or anything...they just aren't quite what I wanted.

I would get way too hungry with this as the only thing I ate for 6hrs.  They are about the size of 1.5 fig newtons.  They taste good though!  I like the creamy sweet white candy coating and real raspberry flavor-in fact they kind of taste like raspberry newtons-soft and chewy.  I would prefer stevia to sugar alcohols, but that is probably why the taste is so good with no bitterness.<br /><br />Nutrition:<br />Cal 100 (for a little bigger than a fig newton size bite)<br />Fat 3.5g<br />Sodium 50mg<br />Carbs 12g<br />Fiber 1g<br />Sugars "0"<br />Sugar alcohols 6g<br />Protein 6g

You can compare the prices and sellers for yourself.  One item not currently available, B000WMI6NY, is likely to be the best deals, since Amazon usually offers free shipping with purchases of a certain dollar amount.  The others, once you add shipping to the sale price, seem to me to be over-priced.<br /><br />First there were M&Ms, which are good.  Good enough for Reese's to take the idea and expand on it.  And Reese's Pieces are so good that M&Ms stole the idea back - and doesn't do peanut butter anywhere near as well as Reese's!  Like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces are little dots with a candy-coating; inside is a creamy peanut butter.  They don't compare with M&Ms Plain, but they beat the peanut butter out of M&Ms Peanut Butter!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Raw  Organic Cacao Powder
review/text: I have purchased cacao from wilderness family in the past years, and gave them a great review. However, with my last purchase a few weeks ago, I was very disappointed. When I recieved my cacao, it WAS NOT from wilderness family naturals. It was from a company I had never heard of-Organic Herbal Essence. It did not have the certified organic logo on it. When I contacted the seller, they said they "shared" a listing with wilderness family naturals. I have been buying from Amazon for years, and have never heard of this practice before. If it was stated up front that this was the company selling the product that would be different. I just thought I should mention this so that any other potential buyers would know what to expect when ordering this.

review/text: I love hot cocoa with whole milk and a little cream, add some honey, vanilla, old time childhood memories come back.  But the cocoa powder I've been buying from the health food store has something in it that makes me feel lousy within 1/2 hour.  I suspect it might be the dutching process, and natural cocoa seems the natural way to go.<br />I saw one of the other reviews for this particular chocolate and noticed they said it was mild, yet original.  I have had some cocoa powders that are natural and original, but incredibly sour and "acidic" if you will.  Some people may like that, not me.<br /><br />I tried this in my hot cocoa.  Had to vary the recipe because it is mild. But after I added a bit more powder, woo wee. Its the best I've had since becoming an adult.  Yes, I have to add some more to my chocolate cake too, but it is worth it.  And my feelings after about 1/2 hour?  Well, I stay stable and no drop off.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is mild. But that doesn't mean I won't get it again.<br /><br />I began to notice something else.  I started to crave chocolate like I used to.  I look at labels, and the high magnesium content in this might have something to do with that.  Any way I feel I have found what I need for the moment, especially with the higher nutritive content.  A chocolate snack with nutrition has got to be good, real good.

review/text: I love the bitter taste of chocolate, so I did some research on cocoa and found mostly positive reviews of raw cocoa. I did however find one negative review saying that theobromide, the primary stimulant in cocoa, is unhealthy and has similar side-effects as caffeine. I got the powder anyways to dispel the mystery myself. While I did have a small crash afterwards (after 3 tablespoons), the surge in energy that I felt was definitely worth it. It was not the jittery surge I was warned about, and the crash actually helps me sleep if I time it right. Not to mention the taste is so good (and yet mild) that I could eat it by the spoonful on its own. Thinking that was the end of it, I also ordered cocoa nibs. Terrible mistake. I don't know exactly why, but I got the exact side-effects I was warned about, not to mention the energy was lower in quality. This is definitely the better alternative.

It as a lighter taste, yet still very chocolatey, if that makes sense :)  It's probably one of the best cacao powders out there! I definitely recommend this product. The only thing that you might want to know, is that the packaging looks different in real life - but nicer! Mine came in a shiny greyish plastic bag - somewhat "sparkely." Not a bad thing, it was nice.

But anyway this stuff is the best, so just buy some & you will be hooked & you will never use that (Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix) ever again. Plus you can cook with this & even put in your coffee or make chocolate candy out of it. What I am trying to say is this is your total replacement for other chocolates out there because this is simply the best. Go & get some!

I was very lucky and found organic raw Cacao powder,(on Amazon.com) that comes from Peru. It was only $10.00 for a pound , except that free shipping got me again! My order was separated into almost all single packages. Which a course had to have shipping charges when the price of the items in their packages was not enough for the limit of (guess what) free shipping. I paid as much in shipping as I paid for the product. But, who do I know in Peru to go to the grocery store and pick up some Raw Cacao powder and drop it in the mail for me.

review/summary: Delicious, smooth coffee!
review/text: Hi, my name's Kat and I'm a coffee snob. We love this coffee. It has such a smooth taste. We do not like burnt-tasting coffee. To us, Starbucks and many others claiming a "bold" flavor are just over-roasted until they are charred. We love a strong, smooth, mildly roasted coffee. Coffee that is just toasted, not overdone. To give you a good comparison, this coffee is similar in taste, smoothness and richness to Dunkin Donuts Original whole bean, Pilon from Dominican Republic, Breakfast Blend (not House Blend), From Africa to Africa, and Brazil (all three "mild roast" from Starbucks), Magnum Jamaica Blue Mountain Blend, Land of a Thousand Hill's Rwandan Blend hand-picked, and Tim Horton's.<br /><br />The best thing about Cameron's Breakfast Blend is the taste! Add to that: Organic, Shade-grown, Rain Forest Alliance Certified, Fair Trade AND the price! With Subscribe and Save, it costs under 6 bucks a bag. You can't find another coffee with all that going for it! We LOVE it! Remember, though, if you like bold 'n burnt as in MOST of Starbucks coffees, this is NOT even similar... Enjoy your coffee!<br /><br />FEB 2012: Update. We've been drinking Cameron's Organic Woods and Water (whole beans) and it's even better than the Breakfast Blend! Wow! Enjoy! The only sad part is how expensive it's become in only a year, even with "Subscribe and Save" prices. It's gone from under $6 a bag to over $10 a bag! That being said, we still order it and love it.

review/summary: hearty soup
review/text: This is a good soup -- there is no doubt.  The corn, carrots and potatoes are plentiful (no skimping on ingredients in the cans I've tried).  Together, the ingredients make a thick and hearty soup that is perfect for a cold winter day.  I did not feel the need to add salt -- the corn is not bland in flavor and the soup already has a lot of sodium. Moreover, I felt no need to add crackers.  The soup can hold its own.<br /><br />Some posters have noted that this soup has a high level of fat.  It does -- 13g per one cup serving.  Fat, of course, is not bad in moderation.  In my quest for the perfect corn soup, however, I have found an alternative option. It is worth noting here for those who may have particular dietary considerations.  Imagine foods makes an organic sweet corn soup that has 3g of fat per 1 cup serving. The soup comes in a boxed container and is just a corn base.  There are no special flavorings. As a base, it is a good corn soup but when you add several cups of frozen corn kernels (and cooked potatoes if you have the time and desire), you can have a soup just as hearty and delicious as Wolfgang Pucks but with less fat and calories.  This option does require about five minutes more of your time (if only adding frozen corn).  Wolfgang Puck's soup is quick -- in two minutes you have a steaming bowl of great corn soup and you don't have to wait for kernels to thaw.<br /><br />If you are not looking closely at fat (or eat fat it in moderation) and want something quick, this soup is great.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative, I would take a little more time and build a hearty soup using the organic sweet corn soup from Imagine.

review/text: EDIT: At the time of this review in 2006, Amazon wasn't listing nutritional information on Grocery item pages.<br /><br />--<br /><br />First of all, it's great that Amazon is stocking food in bulk, but they really do need to include nutritional information on every item page.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients here, I saw that this soup contained "heavy whipped cream." So obviously, there was going to be a fair amount of fat in here. But, going by the tomato basil flavor, which also has whipped cream, I didn't think it would be *that* bad. The tomato basil is about 20% DV per serving.<br /><br />I ordered this soup, only to find out that it has 44% DV saturated fat PER SERVING, or 88% per can. Ridiculous.<br /><br />The Wolfgang Puck customer service E-Mail contact form also wouldn't give me the nutritional information before I ordered this item at Amazon because:<br /><br />"Thank you for your e-mail.  Unfortunately, the only nutritional information<br />available is that which is on the individual can.  Sorry."<br /><br />Now I'm sure the soup is delicious, just like all the other Wolfgang Puck soups... but that fat content is horrendous.

review/summary: Basil Lover's Dream
review/text: I adore Basil, let's just get that out there.  But I'm pretty frugal, let's get that out there too, so I've generally bought fairly low-end Basil, nothing all that fancy.  But given how much Basil I use, the Tone's (at $7.20 or $1.30/oz) worked out to be a good deal, so I thought I'd take a chance.  Oh, I'm glad I did!  This is good, sweet Basil, with none of the bitterness that sometimes affects dried herbs like Basil and Oregano, for example.  I'm prone to use a pretty heavy hand with Basil, sometimes removing the shaker top and just dumping, so I'm delighted I won't be running out any time soon. I couldn't find any expiration date on the bottle but it certainly seems fresh.<br /><br />My favorite recipe using Basil is my own version of one in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679767959">Heartburn</a>.  If you google "Linguine Alla Cecca Nora Ephron" you should be able to find the recipe from her novel.  For my own quick & easy version, I combine drained canned diced tomatoes (I like Furmano's) with olive oil, a halved peeled garlic clove, and plenty of dried Basil in a bowl. If you like it spicier, you can add red pepper flakes.  Cook linguine, drain.  Remove the garlic cloves from the tomato mix and discard - you're just going for subtle flavoring, not full-on garlic breath.  Pour tomatoes over pasta and mix.  Heaven!  For variations, I add things like chopped clams, chopped black olives, or capers, depending on what I've got on-hand.

The slices are smaller than regular bread, and it's a bit denser, but the texture and flavour are perfect.  I had french toast, and spread a fresh piece with jam and both ways were excellent!

review/summary: One of my two favorite gluten free breads.
review/text: Schar gluten free bread is one of my favorites. I usually alternate between this and Udi's bread. Schar has a great taste and a pretty good texture. It doesn't need to be toasted in order to be enjoyable. I like this bread for sandwiches. The only minor downside is that like most gluten free bread items, Schar is a bit crumbly and can fall apart easily. Many times there is one piece in the bag (which I buy from a grocery store, not Amazon) that is broken. Udi's has managed to avoid the crumbly texture, but for sandwiches and untoasted uses I generally prefer Schar.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon (6 packages for $48) isn't great. Even the more expensive store around me has it for a little less than that. I'd generally  expect to pay $5 per package, not $8. Although if you are rich or you simply can't get gluten free bread anywhere near you, Schar is a good choice.

review/text: The taste and texture of this bread is really pretty good, and yes a little better than Udi's Sandwich White, which is not bad itself.  A big selling point for me is that this bread at least has a couple of grams of protein and fiber, as opposed to any other gluten-free breads I've seen, which are all just basically empty carb calories...like eating junk food.

review/summary: Very good bread
review/text: This is a great bread.  I've tried quite a few brands frozen and packaged.  I think by far this one is the closest tasting GF bread to regular bread.  I'm very please with how long it holds up (freshness wise) and it also keeps well in the fridge.  Like any gluten free bread I've tried it can dry out.  We re-wrap in an air tight bag when we store.  The shelf life of unopened bread is a good time when you purchase by the case.  It's certainly worth the money - well spent on this bread.  Also Schar's rolls and noodles are great.  We've had no luck with their crackers.

review/text: Finally a bread I will eat! I have tried tons of bread store baught and mixed and have even used my bread machine with no luck. Finally I tried the Schar classic roll and I still wasnt fond of the texture so I was slicing them up and wasting half the bun because it crumbled and fried the rest with butter and cheese.."ie a grilled cheese" then I found the classic bread already sliced thinner and lets just say after popping this in a toaster and putting italian beef on top of it I hardley noticed the difference from regular bread. I give it the 3 out of 5 becuase of course it will never be as good as regular bread texture wise or flavor and I am hoping schar will continue to expand their line with bread made with more flavor ..ie garlic bread, faccocia bread ect. Still I am a big fan and will buy again!

review/summary: Takes a little getting used to
review/text: Since soy and anything made with casein is not an option for us, I was happy to find this mix.  This does not taste or smell like cheese (otherwise I would give it 5 stars), and we didn't like it when we first tried it.  However, since it is still pretty tasty in its own right, I tried it a few more times, with a few weeks between each time and eventually I found the right thickness for us (I also added a little more salt).  This is the case for pretty much all other replacement food items we've tried, because we are on a very restrictive diet which leaves us very few options in the ready-made/semi ready-made category.  By now (5 months later) my 5 year old probably can't remember how the real cheese tastes like, so as long as the food is tasty, he is happy.  As for me, I am happy to find one more item that can save me some time in food preparation.

review/summary: Great alternative for gluten dairy & casein free
review/text: This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods. We use both these individual packets and the boxes with the GF noodles - both are handy and great.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think you can get fake cheese or non-cheese to taste like the real thing?!? If you're looking for something to replicate real cheese or annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix and the other roads end products. It has a unique flavorful taste. We tend to alternate this stuff <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese than the Namaste but again, those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However, for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots, peas, corn, etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBSO">A. Vogel Trocomare, 3.2 Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten, dairy, casein free) - buy this, it's great!!!

review/text: I liked the taste and it was not hard to make but the Chreese had a terrible consistency.  It was thick and gloppy - not at all like a smooth sauce.  I made it three times with the same result.  It's possible I'm doing something wrong, but I believe I am following the directions to a T.<br />That being said, it does taste really good and definitely satisfies a cheese craving.  I will continue to use it, but probably won't serve it to guests until I can figure out the consistency issues.

review/summary: Pretty great
review/text: I love this stuff. Does it taste like cheese? It depends who you ask. My mom says yes, I say no, not at all. It has a vaguely cheesy flavor, but this wouldn't fool anybody. There definitely are vegan cheeses that taste like cheese (Daiya brand is decent, and Vegusto, to everyone I've prepared it for, is indistinguishable from real cheese) but they are often expensive and have lots of fat and calories. Chreese, on the other hand, is very cheap and has very little fat or calories. Also it contains fiber, protein, and vitamin b-12, which I think is just great. Actually, I'm writing this review while eating a grilled chreese on pumpernickel. And it's delicious. I've had both the gluten and gluten-free varieties, and they're both great - they taste the same.<br /><br />In closing, no, this is not identical to cheese. But it is really, really tasty, affordable, and nutritious.

Considering we are allergic to all things dairy, this is as close as we get to something cheese-like, so I am not complaining. I add more soy milk and soy margarine....and it has no cholesterol... So, if you can eat real cheese, enjoy. For those of us who cannot, this fills the gap.

review/summary: Might as well made it from scratch!
review/text: Ok, first off I need to mention I didnt but this b/c I need anything gluten or dairy free.  I bought this because I tend to "eat clean" for the most part and wanted a quick semi clean cheese sauce without worry of a ingredient list filled with junk (think of a dyed bright yellow clump of so called "cheese product") My idea was to use this as a cheese sauce for some Quinoa and broccoli, much like a cheddar cheese rice bake, sounds yummy right? Anyways when it came time to make the sauce I almost cried, it smelled like a strong soup base, (like bouillon cubes) The smell seemed to get slightly milder, but upon tasting a lick off the spoon I was more than tempted to trash the whole thing and just whip up some cheese sauce from scratch.  Instead I improvised and added about a handful of mozzarella cheese, a handful of cheddar cheese and and a half a cup of milk to the mix and while it tasted like cheddar and cardboard, my kids and I ate our dinner.  Was it worth it?  Nope, not for me at least.  Now I am sure if you NEED something like this for dietary reasons, such as having a gluten allergy or dairy allergy, then perhaps your taste buds are more "willing" but for me, this was a complete waste.

review/text: Road's End Organics Gluten Free Cheddar is surprisingly good. It does have a slightly funky flavor... but it doesn't have an off taste or a horrific aftertaste, as can sometimes occur with vegan cheeses. I once tried making vegan "cheese" for an alfredo using cashews&garlic... I only ended up with an inedible, mostly garlicky sauce. It's one that would drive away the sparkly vegetarian vampires of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031613290X">The Twilight Saga Complete Collection</a>.<br /><br />Road's End Organics' fake cheese sauce is perfect for mixing with macaroni. I was slightly unkosher in adding real, dairy cheddar cheese. It doesn't exactly taste like cheese. It has a slightly nutty flavor. It contains annatto, and one of the essentials of vegan cuisine, nutritional yeast. It actually works, while I'm still wary of the mac and cheese recipe in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825305845">Vegan Fusion World Cuisine: Extraordinary Recipes & Timeless Wisdom from the Celebrated Blossoming Lotus Restaurants</a>.<br /><br />It does have a more natural flavor than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1DSPE">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner, Spirals, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>.

The only downside to this review is the price has went up quite a bit since I first ordered them.

review/summary: These used to be really tasty...
review/text: Perhaps they've changed the recipe, but these simply don't taste like they used to. Moreover, they don't taste that great. (They now taste a bit flat and stale, for lack of a better way to describe it.)<br /><br />We used to rip through these pretty quickly. Now, we can go for long periods without eating them. And we always need something like a dip or hummus or salsa to eat with them.<br /><br />Bland. boring. tasteless. Snyder's, what have you done to them?<br /><br />Bring back the ones we loved!

review/summary: Tasted a Little Stale
review/text: These didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.  They are organic and made with whole wheat flour, so that was the positive!  We eat them with hummus and other dips.

review/summary: My favorite Rosehip Tea (German = Hagebuttentee)
review/text: My German teacher had this tea at her house.  Rosehip (Rose hip) tea is called Hagebuttentee in Germany.  This particular brand (Teekanne) sells this exact same product under the name FixButte in Germany, so if you've had Teekanne's FixButte tea, then this is the same thing.  I really enjoy the flavor of this tea and in particular this brand.  I often will put one packet of Splenda in it to help sweeten it a little, but it's also delicious as is.  The Amazon description says 2-count, but it's really a 20-count box.  I order the subscription, which is sold as a five box package and save 15%.

review/summary: Good value on delicious tea
review/text: We are not big black tea drinkers so this rosehip tea is one of our favorite afternoon teas.  I love the availability in the five pack as it keeps the shipping price low.  Nice flavor and we add just a spot of honey to ours.

review/summary: Game Changer
review/text: I was prepared to hate this kit as a gimmick.  But I was blown away and have to consider it to produce something superior to other kits and even to most restaurants.<br />As I was eating the butter chicken, I noted more flavor than I am used to, almost an overuse of cloves...which is not exactly a bad thing.  The result was butter chicken at home, at basically half the cost of going to the restaurant.  The texture was spot on, unlike the goopy or stringy stuff other at home kits produced.<br />As an indian food enthusiast who is normally competent in the kitchen but out of his league cooking the stuff, I can only imagine how good it will be for someone who can hack the recipe (like coconut milk instead of half and half? adding something to counteract the clove?)While the rice could have been spiced up too, it was a good amount of rice and therefore an appropriate addition to the kit.<br />The trick is that instead of one tub of goop added to the meat, there's three different stages of flavor insertion.<br />So yeah, I am going to be trying other products from these people.
