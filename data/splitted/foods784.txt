review/summary: Dry hot wings
review/text: I find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when I'm craving buffalo wings late at night. Sure they're not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor. They are very hot but delicious.

review/summary: Better than standard jerkey
review/text: I normally have beef jerkey with my lunch for some easy to transport protein. I decided to give these a try, bought them at the grocery store and they were great. Easy to measure and a lot less stringy than normal beef jerkey.<br /><br />I ended up saving a ton of money using amazons subscribe and save over using the grocery store. Definitely something I'll reorder.

review/text: These taste amazing! Best jerky I've ever had. They are kind of expensive, but once in a while Amazon will lower the price slightly and hopefully that happens when they are offering a 10% off Jack Link's products promo code. Anyone who likes jerky or is simply looking for a convenient high protein snack should give these a try.

review/text: Flamin' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites. The meat is tender, and the taste (based on the ones I've bought) are extreme with flavor. The only problem with jerky is the salt, and these have a ton of it. I wouldn't consume more then one bag a day, but it's your choice and body. I'll definitely be buying more in the future though, because these are delicious.

review/summary: Downright Addictive!
review/text: These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.  This ends up being a little over a handful for the entire package.<br /><br />Great to have on hand for those on the go times.

review/summary: Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets
review/text: I actually really love the Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets, however the 4 pack I received seemed to be old.  They weren't nearly as good as the ones I have purchased in gas stations.  Makes you wonder why that would be. These were tough and much drier then I expected. I have to say I will not order them again through the mail. If they had been fresher I would have rated them as I love them because I really do.

review/summary: dark meat
review/text: All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)

review/summary: Tasty jerky
review/text: I don't eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice.  Bag is enormous for what's inside it.  There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.

Buying the 4-pack from Amazon winds up being about half the price it would buying them individually from my local grocery (which only carries one or two of the types available in this pack) or even from the local health food market, which doesn't have the couscous anyway, where I live whole wheat couscous is hard to find!  I would definitely recommend this sampler pack.  I'll buy another as soon as my husband and I can get through our first-they last a long time, so it is a great value!

review/summary: FANTASTIC SOUP
review/text: I happened upon these organic soups at a new Earth Fare store that opened in our area. WOW. They're AWESOME. The best canned soup I've tried. I'm pregnant with our second child. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and I'm on a strict diabetic diet for this pregnancy. These are great because the entire can falls within my allotted carb allowance for lunch or dinner. The Minestrone is the BOMB. When I can't cook something wholesome for myself -- this organic soup really hits the spot. I feel good about eating this because it's organic (I'd feel better if it didn't come in a tin can -- but at least it's organic ingredients). I also tried the chicken and wild rice and it's also phenomenal. I will be heading back to that store to buy myself more of this soup. It leaves me feeling full and warm in cold Ohio winter weather and I make my post-meal blood glucose numbers. I have not seen it in other stores. I wasn't really looking -- but I will be now!

review/summary: Watch Your Salt Intake.
review/text: I always stock a variety of items on my kitchen shelves that might be used as an instant lunch in times when I'm in a hurry and don't have any time to prepare things. One of my long-time favorites is the Maruchan Instant Lunch cups and I presently have the beef flavor. They also come in several other flavors. The cost is minimal. They're real easy to prepare real. Just peel back the top, add hot water and let it set for about three minutes. Have a few things like cheese, fruits, meat along with your noodle soup and, viola, an instant lunch. Works real well and is tasty. My only reservation is the very high salt (sodium) content. It's listed at 1,200mg, which is about 50% of the daily recommendation. In one serving! Wow! It's an easy and quick lunch, but you'd better watch your other salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The Second New Flavor of the Quintessential Condiment!
review/text: This was the second modern variation on an essentially unchanged, bestselling product for more than 140 years.  Other flavors are:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZMOY">Orginal Pepper Sauce</a> (hot) (2500-5000 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIQV2">Green Pepper Sauce</a> (milder yet) (600-1200 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQI6Q">Garlic Pepper Sauce</a> (milder) (1200-2400 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG59I">Chipotle Pepper Sauce</a> (mild) (1500-2500 Scoville Heat Units),<br />Sweet & Spicy Pepper Sauce (mildest) (100-600 Scoville Heat Units),<br />but this is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQI8O">Habanero Sauce</a> (hottest) (>7000 Scoville Heat Units).<br /><br />Dueling histories of the McIlhenny Company are available: (authorized) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979780802">Tabasco: An Illustrated History</a> and (unauthorized) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060721855">McIlhenny's Gold: How a Louisiana Family Built the Tabasco Empire</a>, for those curious about how this most remarkable product and business empire came to be.<br /><br />Note: "A pharmacist named Wilbur Scoville invented the Scoville Scale in 1912 to measure the heat of peppers. A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/summary: WHAT'S A PIZZA WITHOUT ANCHOVIES ?
review/text: As far as I'm concerned a pizza just isn't worth eating unless it's generously decorated with anchovies.  However, I'm the only one at our house who feels this way.<br /><br />  On weekend nights we frequently order in from our favorite pizza place, and since I must have anchovies I keep these on hand to garnish my share of the pie.  (Never would dream of imposing my educated taste on others  ;-)<br /><br />  We've tried other brands - the ones packed in oil tend to fall apart; others have been tasteless.  These have a rich flavor and are meaty enough to hold their shapes.  They're the best we've found.

review/summary: Need a kitchen assistant
review/text: I tried these anchovies after watching several cooking shows where the celebrity chef towted the amazing wonders of salt packed anchovies.  So I ordered some.  The taste is good.....but the work to get them there is a pain in the patoot.  You have to rinse the anchovies, then clean and gut them.  They come as whole fish, only the heads are lopped off.  Scales, fins et all are still there. They are small so cleaning enough for use is time consuming.  Then they must be soaked in milk or water for several hours.  Then when you go to use them you find you still need to clean them further as you may have missed scales or fins with the initial cleaning.  Like celebrity chefs, if you have a kitchen assistant to do your grunt work then I recommend these anchovies.  Otherwise, save yourself some extra work.

review/text: I have been receiving Shock Hyper-Caffeinated Coffee through the subscription program of Amazon for over 6 months.  I love the fact that I don't have to remember to order--it just comes.  The coffee is very good.  It doesn't get bitter or taste "funky".  It says it is hyper-caffeinated; however, I don't get jittery or sleepless when I fix it.  I use the 1 tbsp/4 oz cup of coffee formula.  I drink about 1/2 pot and do not get an upset stomach.  Using this coffee, I don't feel like I need to drink an entire pot to stay alert through the morning.

review/summary: Not bad but nothing shocking
review/text: I have been waiting for years for someone to come out with high-caffeine coffee.  I even bought the Stok shots on Amazon to add caffeine to each cup but it can change the flavor a little.  So I could not wait to try this and bought three bags in one deal.<br /><br />The coffee is not bad.  I am a coffee lover and this is basically a standard roast (Folgers quality).  I like French Roast and this is not a dark roast or high quality bean from what I can tell.  I generally drink a pot each morning and this is not bad coffee.  But I will be darned if I can tell the difference between hyper-caffinated and regular coffee.  MAybe I am not a good subject as I drink so much coffee. But you would think drinking an entire pot of hyper-caffeinated coffee would give you quite the caffeine rush - it does not.  So for anyone really looking for the rush of caffeine this review will not stop you, but I suggest that if you can but a single bag instead of the three pack, do it.  Then let us know what you think.

I've tried a couple of hyper-caffeinated coffee blends and Shock is by far the best.  The flavor is not to strong, nor is it deeply intense and bitter like an espresso.  A nice blend of flavor and acidity with that extra caffeine bump to get a work day started.  I will say this, if you're sensitive to caffeine, this product IS NOT for you.  But if you like coffee, and you're looking for that extra jolt to help things get started, then buy yourself some SHOCK!

review/summary: Among the best capers I have found
review/text: I use capers in many dishes, including a meatless carpaccio, lox with cream cheese and bagels, and various salads and cold dishes (see my customer-supplied image at the top of the page for an example).<br /><br />The problem, and especially in the backwoods of central Florida where I live, is finding high quality capers. There are a few brands that are acceptable to me, but since discovering this brand I am a loyal customer for life.<br /><br />Key qualities of these include an excellent balance of acidity and saltiness (a little bite, but not obtrusive), and, of course, crunchiness. Compared to some other brands I have tried, many of which were very salty and not at all crunchy, this one stands out. And, of course, these are nonpareil grade instead of the gigantic capers that litter many supermarket shelves.<br /><br />If you want a real treat use these with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LM5VFK">Ortiz Atun Claro: Yellowfin Tuna in Olive Oil (7.8 ounce)</a>, Sliced, vine-ripened tomatoes, red onion, and, optional jalapenos. Drizzle with a high quality extra virgin olive oil and season with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BP3PF4">Herbes de Provence - Provence Herb 8 oz.</a> ... or a high quality lox with cream cheese on a bagel. If you know capers you will immediately taste the difference and notice the texture and crunch that only the best capers have.

I'm a fan of this flavor, although my wife prefers the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPKRW2">Garlic & Olive Oil Vermicelli</a>.<br /><br />One complaint: the angel hair pasta will start to clump together if you don't eat it right away, and as leftovers it also tends to congeal if left too long in the fridge.<br /><br />Over all, this is an easy, cheap, and tasty-enough meal. If you're sick of Ramen, buy some.

review/summary: Best Baby Food by Far and a Great Variety
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Antioxidant Variety Pack<br />We've loved this variety so far. I never noticed it when my son was eating baby food, but now my daughter has one at least once a day. They tend to be a veggie heavy variety and my daughter would rather have veggies than fruit most days. The only one in the variety she can't eat so far is the Banana Mango, because of an allergy to mangos, but I'm hoping to save those for a later date when she can tolerate it better.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this product was that when I initially was deciding to purchase it I couldn't find out what varieties were included in the pack. So for your information they are: Carrot Tomato, Sweet Potato Apricot, Apple Butternut Squash, and Banana Mango.

I figure the more flavors I can introduce him to now, the better--maybe I won't end up with a picky toddler! My baby loved all the flavors, and I even ended up buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2DGMC">Earth's Best 2nd Antioxidant Blend Carrot Tomato, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a> because in addition to him liking that one a lot, it's the only Stage 2 food I've found that has tomato in it.<br /><br />I bought this variety pack countless times, and I highly recommend it to other moms.

review/text: We like these because 1) they are organic and 2) they mix fruits and veggies together so baby gets the sweet taste of fruit (which he prefers) with the the extra health of veggies. The carrot tomato is the least popular in our household and the sweet potato apricot is the most popular. Our boy especially liked these when he was a bit younger - as he gets older, they seem to be a little too liquid-y for him. It would be nice if they made thicker purees. However, he still loves these and it is a great way for him to get his veggies. We love the subscribe and save so they just show up at the door and I am not always having to run to the store to get them.

Why it has to cost more than you pay in a physical store is beyond me considering you have to buy a whole case. And then the shipping charges, come on. Since I'm not a medical doctor I can't go into the specifics about how healthy it's supposed to be, but I would encourage you, if you haven't already, to look up the literature on the alleged health benefits of apple cider vinegar.

review/text: I've had much tastier creamy potato soup for a much cheaper price.  The other reviewer is right when stating Amazon's price is of the "32oz" at the stores.  The onion gave it an off taste and the texture wasn't as creamy as the others like carrot and tomato.  And..it was bland.  Too pricy for something so bland, with such little nutritional value, so high sodium..what's the point?  At least the carrot soups were high in Vit A.<br /><br />Also beware:  My boxes didn't have the snap seal on top which upset me.  I have to put a bag over them in the fridge.  NOT worth it!

review/summary: Terrible packaging of "new" boxes allows boxes to burst!
review/text: This is a great product but it is now in a "new" box different from the one shown.  4 of the "new" boxes burst  during shipping because the packaging did not adequately protect its vulnerabilities. 5 boxes had the plastic lids torn off the top but the seal seems intact for now.  3 seem ok.  Until they fix the terrible packaging of the "new" soup box, don't buy this unless you want to receive a cardboard box full of runny sticky soup and damaged soup boxes.  The box that is shown here is similar to hemp milk boxes I bought from Amazon that arrived in perfect shape.  Unfortunately I did not receive the potato soup in boxes like the one shown in the picture here.

review/summary: The Best Coffee For Your Buck
review/text: I've been a chef now for over 18 years and was very skeptical about ordering coffee, organic coffee for that matter, online. When we got it we immediately opened it and vacuum packed and portioned the coffee, it comes in a 5lb. bag.  Up until the very last bean, they were all full of flavor and taste so much better than anything I have bought in a store.  The roasting process does NOT burn the bean, it simply brings out the wonderful volcanic aromas surrounding Nicaragua.

We love that it is good for the workers (fair trade), good for the environment and ourselves (organic), and good for the wild life and ecosystem (shade grown) not to mention it is really cheap to boot...  there is just nothing I can find wrong with this coffee!  I will so note that it always smells like coffee when I open the bag and especially so when I grind it.  I have never had gourmet Nicaraguan coffee so I can't compare to that but compared to any other whole bean coffee I have bought this one is our favorite.

review/summary: Very good coffee, and good for the birds!
review/text: Very Good Coffee.  I use a French Press and it still does not not leave any kind of unpleasant flavour as an aftertaste.  However, I find, when you add a bit of half and half, you can actually taste the subtle flavors of this coffee even better.  A mild lighter roast coffee which actually means MORE CAFFEINE!  Delicious: great in the morning or mid-day.<br /><br />It is also good to know that it is shade grown and fair trade.  This means that the growers receive a fair price AND if it is shade grown there are other non-coffee trees around which means the coffee beans will have a better flavour, there will be a larger variety of plant species in the forests and birds can have homes and song birds that winter there have a larger habitat and diet.<br /><br />Enjoy your coffee guilt free!

review/text: This is probably the worst coffee I have ever had.  It arrived stale, odorless, a bag of lifeless beans.  It had absolutely no coffee smell when I opened the bag.  I always grind my coffee fresh on the spot and there was no aroma from the ground beans - bad sign.  The brewed product was equally lifeless - worse than ground Folgers from a can.  I returned it after the first cup. My bad for ordering such a large bag but I have have had good luck with organic coffee and this seemed like a good deal.  Bland, bland, dead stuff. Maybe other reviewers received a fresh product - I don't see how anyone who enjoys coffee could like this stuff in the condition received by me.

review/summary: Ghastly
review/text: I have been to Nicaragua, and I have had real, organic coffee there (some of the best was by workers in the vicinity of Esteli.  Real Nicaraguan coffee is earthy and fragrant with low bitterness and acidity.  One can thus jack up the quantity of coffee per pot and get as intense a flavor as one wants with no downside.<br /><br />I purchased this product with great excitement after the bags of coffee I took from Nicaragua were finished.  I was dreadfully disappointed.  Indeed, I would say that this is, as close as I can tell, anti-Nicaraguan coffee.  It has none of that earthiness and fragrance but plenty of bitterness and acidity.  It is completely, in other words, lacking in character.  Indeed, I think this is closer to Folgers than to gourmet coffee of any kind.<br /><br />I am aware that negative reviews tend to get panned.  But I want to make clear that I sought, as was given, a refund for this "unrefundable" product.  I said at the time that I would be posting a negative review to steer others away from this product.<br /><br />I will try with some other brand of Nicaraguan coffee in the future.  Maybe I'll just pre-pay to have the real stuff sent to me from that country.

review/summary: This is really meant for topical use more than a sweetener.
review/text: Errrr, I hate to tell you folks this, but this is made from the whole leaf, LOL. Check out the Sweetleaf website. This one is made more for topical applications. It won't hurt to drink it because it doesn't have anything harmful in it but it's more for skin irritations and such, that may be why you guys didn't like it in beverages.<br /><br />This dark concentrate is renowned for its ability to soften skin and help to smooth out wrinkles. Just apply, and after 30 to 60 minutes wash it away. It's worth trying on any skin problem. You'll be amazed!<br /><br /> Unrefined whole leaf concentrate made with water<br />- Helps pancreas<br />- May help regulate blood sugar levels<br />- Can be used as a topical agent for blemishes<br /><br />It's still sweet and you could use it that way, but since it's made from the whole leaf all those great plant phenols and stuff are flavoring the coffee;)<br /><br />It's a very easy mistake to make with Stevia.<br /><br />Having said that, I'll say this. Sweetleaf is the only company I've run across so far that doesn't add fillers and other sugars to their Stevia. I love Sweetleaf Stevia.<br /><br />Maltodextrin is a processed hydrolyzed starch used as a filler by a lot of companies. My question is why?<br /><br />There are a couple of other sugars they like to add too. Stevia is great all by itself. It seems as though they're determined to muck up a very healthy thing, sigh.

review/summary: Mix With Clear Liquid Stevia For Best Results, It's Delicious, With Hints Of Licorice!
review/text: Due to the pancreatic issues, I have long ago banned white sugar from my diet and searched endlessly for suitable alternatives.  Finally I narrowed my choices down to four: Grade B maple syrup, Xylitol, coconut sugar (all of which I still have to take in moderation if I have sweet cravings) and Stevia.<br />Stevia is the only one, that I do not have to worry about taking too much, as it never causes any spikes in my blood sugar, and unlike other artificial sugar substitutes does not have any adverse long term effects on my body.<br /><br />I drink quite a bit of Earl Grey tea, occasionally some coffee or Dandy Blend, and even though I can and do drink them often 'straight', adding just a drop or two of stevia makes the beverages taste that much more delicious.<br />Have used the Sweet Leaf brand, both liquid and the powder for years and always come back to it after experimenting with other brands.<br /><br />Even though highly concentrated, this is my favorite formula.  Used just like it is, it does have very strong, almost over-powering flavor and I can see how it would not be palatable to some.<br />What I have been doing with great success, is mixing this one with just clear SweetLeaf Stevia, either plain, or flavored (the Valencia Orange or Chocolate are my favorite).<br />Using about 50/50 ratio, or 1/3 of this Whole Leaf with 2/3 of the clear liquid makes a delightful tasting mixture with hints of licorice flavor.<br /><br />And yes, if you do NOT like licorice, don't get this, you will not like it.<br /><br />I also use this to make my own 'healthy' chocolate and am including my recipe.  (You can skip reading the rest if you don't have any interest in making it yourself).<br /><br />I LOVE dark chocolate, but the sugar in it just messes my system up too much, and even though there are so many different and intriguing and delectable chocolates available at Whole Foods and similar stores, the overwhelming majority still is sweetened with sugar.  (These days it comes masqueraded under such labels as "pure evaporated cane juice", "cane syrup" etc., but rose under a different name is still a rose, and any cane juice still is sucrose sugar, my nemesis).<br />So I finally started making my own and highly recommend to anyone with blood sugar problems (hypoglycemnia, diabetes, etc...) to do the same.<br /><br />All you need is 100% unsweetened chocolate bark (available online or in some natural food stores), some raw unprocessed coconut oil, and Stevia.  Optional additional ingredients that I like to use are Coconut Butter, raw cocoa powder, chopped roasted almonds, raw organic cacao nibs, natural vanilla, almond OR orange flavoring, and/or anything else you'd like to experiment with.  Some people like to use organic food grade Cocoa Butter, but I find it tasting mealy and somewhat 'off'.<br />Put all ingredients in the double boiler (a bowl inside a pot with hot water) and let it dissolve completely.<br />(The amount and ratio of each is thoroughly up to you, you can just experiment with it till you find your own ideal mixture, or have it come out a bit differently each time.  If it turns out to be a complete loss, you can always re-melt it and start over again.)<br /><br />Let the liquid cool off slightly and pour in small paper baking cups or better yet in a chocolate mold (many available here on Amazon).  Put in the freezer, and voila, you have your own, healthy, delectable homemade chocolate bonbons.  Once hardened, they pop easily out of the form looking shiny and beautiful and tasting like little pieces of heaven :).<br />I keep the batch in the fridge, since coconut oil dissolves easily at room temperature, and it also preserves the fresh taste lot longer.<br /><br />To sum it all up, Stevia has been my sweetener of choice, and this particular brand (properly diluted) is my favorite.

I like the level of sweetness in drinks sweetened with Stevia much better (mainly Celestial Seasonings products)and in tea or coffee I sweeten myself with the concentrate.  Highly recommend this.

Also mark the stuff fragile so the "unapoligetic" postal workers can't hurt it.

review/text: I was looking for a good, healthy "trail mix", and since this stuff had good reviews I thought I would give it a try.  It was a one-time only mistake.<br /><br />Looking at the picture of the package, and reading the description, it looked like a lot of almonds, pumpkin seeds, some sunflower seeds and berries...just like it says.  However, upon opening the first package, all I saw were sunflower seeds...lots and lots of sunflower seeds.  An average handful would be a overwhelming majority of sunflower seeds with some pumpkin seeds, maybe 2 almonds, a couple of raisins, one or two cranberries, and I'd only get a tiny blueberry or two every 3-4 handfuls.  I was really surprised.  If I had saw this mix in a clear plastic bag at the grocery store, I would think it was bird seed.<br /><br />Wondering how it got such great reviews, I read them (something I should have done prior to purchasing).  Lots of people were saying how much they love it, but not really saying anything about what was in the bag!<br /><br />As for what was there, it was OK.  I'm not sure what "dry roasting" is, but all of the nuts and seeds tasted raw...soft and a bit chewy.  I've got nothing against raw nuts, but since the description says "roasted", I expected nice, crisp almonds and seeds.  Not the case.<br /><br />If organic is your thing, then I'm sure you might like this mix for what it is.  It is healthy as well.  However, I am sticking with my Back to Nature Martha's Vineyard Blend Trail Mix...it's as cheap or cheaper (if you get it at the right time), fresh, with lots of big, chewy cherries and cranberries.<br /><br />If you look at the bag of the Back to Nature mixes, it is clear and shows you exactly what you are getting.  I am guessing there is a reason the Eden mix doesn't come in a clear bag...
