review/summary: rather tart and bitter
review/text: My first order of this jam was quite disappointing. It was tart and bitter, even if I added sugar to it. Perhaps it  was a bad batch or something. Notified amazon and got a refund. I have bought much raspberry jam over the years and this was a big disappointment to me.<br />The American Spoon brand Amazon had was superb in comparison to this brand. Jars very small and do not seem to provide 4 ounces at all in my opinion.

Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie.  But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one.  Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites!  Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now.  M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl!  Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: I just bought a bottle of La Choy Stir Fry Sauce (Original) and what a waste of money!!! The good news is that I decided to try it before adding to my meat and veggies. I was in such disbelief as to how bad this actually tasted, that I figured it just wasn't possible, surely its meant to be eaten with the meat and veggies. So i put some in a small pot and heated thoroughly... disgusting! I'm not trying to be mean, but I wouldn't feed this to animals. Somebody please tell me if I did something wrong.

review/text: I came here to warn other people to not make the same mistake I did. I bought this because my local supermarket stopped carrying the one I usually get and boy do I regret it. Although I am glad that I am not the only person who thinks this sauce is disgusting, I'm also sad that other people had to go through this horrible experience too. Let's just say that this sauce is gross by itself. How do I even describe its taste? Maybe like burned cilantro mixed with too much artificial sweetener? I can't even put into words how bad the taste was. Anyway, I tasted a little to see if it was OK and thought maybe it's not the best stir fry sauce out there but it would improve if I added it to my vegetables, tofu and noodles. Nope, the flavor did not improve at all. It was so bad that I ended up pouring the rest of the sauce from the bottle down the drain.<br /><br />Please do yourself a huge favor and do not waste your time, money and taste buds on this.

review/summary: Best mushroom "soup" I know of.
review/text: I have an unreasonable love of these little cubes.  They're easy to fix, completely portable (as in, you can take them camping with ease), versatile (I use them to flavor meat dishes, rice dishes, and pasta dishes, for example) and best of all, the mushroom flavor is just right.  Not too subtle, not too strong.  And it's not just some generic cheap white button mushroom flavor, either, but a rich, meaty mushroom flavor I associate with the more exotic fungi.  It might seem odd to rave on about some stupid seasoning cubes, but as a hard-core mushroom lover, this is one of my all-time favorite products in the kitchen, and an indispensible backpack item for cool-weather outings.

review/summary: Best Mushroom Boullion
review/text: As a vegetarian, it's sometimes hard to build complex flavors in soup.  Meat is very flavorful.  But these little cubes solve the problem for me.  The flavor is rich and authentic, and the intensity of flavor is just right - not salty, not to weak, not too strong.  I use these in barley soup, asian soup, "meat" loaf, "meat" balls, anything that needs a rich flavor.  They make a great and easy home-made ramen noodle bowl, as well.  These are better than any vegetable boullion I have found in any brand.  I wish they weren't so hard to find!<br /><br />One thing to note is that these do list MSG in the ingredients.  If you're sensitive to MSG, these are not for you.

review/text: If you have never tried these Telma cubes in mushroom you are really missing out.  I use them when making a pot of soup.  Doesn't really matter what kind.  You just have to know that you do not add salt until the soup is done otherwise it probably would be too salty.  It just takes your soup to another dimension.  Everyone that I tell about these cubes loves them.  You can also use in other things but just must be careful about salt.

review/text: Tender Bits are a variety of seitan/wheat meat and replace chicken breast in many recipes.  They are best prepared sliced and sauteed until crispy with olive oil and garlic, and spiced according to taste.  Prepared in this manner, they make an excellent topping for rice or pasta dishes, and are especially good when finished with barbeque sauce.  What's great about Tender Bits is that they can be kept on hand in the cupboard instead of the freezer, where many a package of seitan has met its untimely end.

So, gave it a try.  This has become my favorite Loma Linda product.  I add them to everything where I need meat or more substance.  I use in stews, pizza toppings if sliced thin, chili, spaghetti, even small tidbits in a salad.  They take on the flavor of the sauce they are in, but better than tofu because the texture is firmer. If texture is hard to get over you might not like them, but if that isn't an issue, this is a great product with so many ways to use it.  Great chicken substitute if you are in a rush.  Microwaves well.  I love them.

Finally, I caved into curiosity, and was it ever worth the wait.  These are just incredibly delicious.  I find myself eating them straight from the can, but they're much better when fried up with a little sriracha and soy sauce.  The five-star reviews are no accident.<br /><br />Don't expect a perfect chicken replica, like you can get in some vegetarian restaurants.  These have the consistency and flavor of a chicken dumpling, although they're pretty versatile.  Cannot recommend highly enough.

review/summary: Gentle Vegetarian Staple
review/text: I was going to call my review, "I Love These," but someone had already done that! I eat them from the can when I'm cooking with them. I cut them up for stir frys and soups, and I slice them for sandwiches. They're good instead of chicken in a sandwich, but they are small and can fall out. How about a tortilla with avocado spread on it and some lettuce, wrapped around some Tender Bits, whole or sliced? Add pepper and/or onion! Although I am a strict vegetarian, I have a sensitive digestive system, and I turn to Tender Bits when my system is irritated. I have been eating these by the case for years and am glad to find them on Amazon!<br /><br />Update: After being diagnosed with a small breast cancer, I learned that soy protein concentrate, a main ingredient in Tender Bits, is a controversial ingredient. To put it simply, foods with this ingredient are "processed food" and should be eaten in the amounts one would eat any processed meat or other food. Vegetarians should be careful about eating too much processed vegetarian foods. Soy has an important relationship to estrogen, which means that vegetarian women and especially those who have had estrogen-positive breast cancer should learn more about it.<br /><br />I have not had any Tender Bits in many months, but I keep a can on hand for special occasions!

review/text: The beautiful thing about Tender bits, is that they are so flexible.  They are great battered and fried, bread crumb coated, chopped up and put in a sauce, soup, stew, etc.  They have a very mild taste, so they go with anything.  They seem to be an excellent sub in any recipe that calls for Chicken, BUT they are not like chicken. Don't buy them thinking "Hey this will be just like chicken".  It's not.  They are their own entity, and a super yummy one at that.

review/text: I'm new to Veg lifestyle and dishes, but had to give thes a try and was very pleased with the ease of preparation and with the taste.  Though probably not exact, to me, they tasted very similar to chicken tenders.  I coated six in flour and fried as suggested, then I dipped them in ketchup which is probably cheating, but they were very tasty.  I would love to experiement with them and add spices and such to give them an extra zing, but they are very tasty and filling as is.  Amazon delivered very quickly.  They seem a little pricey at a little less than $4 a can, but I guess they go far, with six cooked, being 1/4 or 1/3 of a can.  I highly receommend them.

review/text: As a lifelong vegetarian I have consumed many "fake meats" over the years. The Tender Bits are among my family's favorites. While they have a pretty decent flavor by themselves, I often rinse, drain, slice and use in stir fries, soups, pasta salads, etc.<br /><br />This stuff is relatively healthy too, as far as being low fat and high protein. If you want to negate all that healthy stuff, try rinsing the Bits, rolling them in bread crumbs, then deep frying at 350 for about 4 minutes. Delicious! We Even my carnivorous guests enjoy it!

review/text: If you've ever eaten real meat, or you are currently a meat eater trying to go veggie, this is not the product for you.<br /><br />Putting aside that this stuff doesn't taste like chicken (forgivable because it isn't chicken); it does taste like a cross between cardboard box and dog food.  It's a sort of brownish color, a terrible texture (like when you cook chicken and there's a bit of cooked blood--imagine someone sculpting a patty out of that).<br /><br />I coated and fried mine.  It was so awful that none of us could eat it and we ended up going out for dinner.

review/summary: A gluten-free, highly nutritious addition to cooked cereal & baked goods.
review/text: Among the basics I keep in my pantry is this sprouted organic golden flax seed powder. Shelf-stable, it allows the home baker to make a gluten-free version of the Cornell triple-rich baking formula by substituting sprouted flaxseed powder for the wheat germ. (Unfamiliar with the Cornell triple-rich formula? It's simple: In the bottom of a one cup measure, put 1 T soya flour, 1 T dry milk solids, and 1 tsp wheat germ. Fill the rest of the cup with sifted unbleached enriched flour.) You can, of course, add it in addition to the wheat germ.<br /><br />I routinely add 1 scoop (2T) of this product to each 1-1/2 to 2 cups of dry whole grains when I make cooked cereal.<br /><br />While I rarely use commercial mixes for baked goods & pancakes, when I do, I add up to 1 T of this product per cup of mix.<br /><br />IMHO, the product has a pleasant, light aroma. No one at our table has ever found it offensive, either in cooked cereal or in baked goods. Vegans and vegetarians will like the fact that this product is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.

review/text: I love this product by Manitoba Harvest. I used it instead of whey in my blender drinks. It's great with a banana, ice, bit of soy milk, 2 tablespoons of the powder and agave...you can switch it up by adding cocoa or peanut butter to it too. With both of those add-ins, the hemp isn't really noticeable by taste (only with the color of the drink)...but after a while making it like that, I'm pretty used to the taste and can have it without the add in ingredients too.<br /><br />It's a great source of protein for people who don't want whey or, like me, don't want to overuse soy as a protein source.<br /><br />They have organic available in this product, but the regular one is made with out pesticides and isn't GMO...<br /><br />I have yet to try it in other things like sprinkled on salads (it has a gritty/nutty taste) or baked in anything...

review/text: Skip making brownies, walk right by the chocolate cake, taste one of these for a healthy and delicious (ok, somewhat ecstatic) experience of chocolate flavor. The "Dutched" Cocoa and Chocolate Chips gives this a deep rich chocolate flavor while the roasted soybeans give a little crunch, like almonds. These bars are naturally sweetened with cane juice and that enhances the flavor significantly. Fig paste almost makes these romantic. A touch of sea salt brings out the flavors perfectly and this is an excellent choice for indulging while maintaining health. Clif bars are still the best health bars on the planet! The Carrot Cake and Apple Cranberry are also favorites.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I have tried to stay off of sugar and white refined things for years but giving up the occasional sweet delights was hard.  This amazing "smart sugar" has changed my life and brought better health and freedom.  Not only have I been able to stabilize my blood sugar which is critical for my weight control and all disease for that matter as Jorge Crews so succinctly presented in his best seller, The Belly Fat Cure, but I have found that substituting Sweet Matters xylitol crystals for sugar in all recipes has completely stopped newly developing joint pain.  Since xylitol, unlike sugar, does not stimulate my pancreas to release insulin and is alkalizing in my system instead of acid producing like sugar,it has been a huge factor in keeping the inflammatory process at bay in my body. Oh yes, this smart sugar is huge in Europe and been the healthy alternative for years. Not only is it not bad for me but it has many health giving benefits. Got to love it!!!

review/summary: A must for children!
review/text: I have been a big fan of xylitol crystals for quite a while but now my children are having to deal with the sugar issue with their own kids. With so much refined sugar in foods today, what a great healthy alternative to use in baked good and any time you need sugar to sweeten what we are putting into little bodies. There is no difference in the taste of a great pumpkin pie - I actually got rave reviews for the best pumpkin pie ever this Thanksgiving. I highly recommend switching to Sweet Matters for the health of the whole family.

review/summary: My favorite sugar
review/text: Sweet Matters pure xylitol crystals is like gold to me! I started reading and learning about xylitol several years ago....I have been looking for a healthy all natural sugar substitute I could use the same as regular sugar for years. I finally found it in "Sweet Matters" pure xylitol crystals. I use it for baking, coffee, tea, and anything else you would use sugar. It dissolves beautifully and makes all my cakes and baked goods taste incredible!...and I know I'm making healthy sweets for my family. I Love this product and will always use in place of refined sugar. Anyone looking to change their health habits and eat healthy start with xylitol. People use and eat way too much refined sugar products. Xylitol tastes just like sugar but doesn't have the risks eating refined sugar does to our bodies. .

review/summary: I love surprises! (when they're this good)
review/text: I love perpetual kid! When I open the box the first thing I see is this four-eyed, green, duck-billed platypus, lobster alien finger puppet thing with staring back at me with a packing peanut in its mouth and the first thing I think to myself is "I love whoever took the time to put this in here".<br />Now for the part of me that is logical and not amused so easily: the package arrived incredibly quickly! It told me it would arrive around the 19th (the package tracker still says it's only been shipped, so they even pulled one past amazon), and here it is, in my hands on the 13th.<br />I would have been satisfied with half of the quality demonstrated by perpetual kid, I guess that just goes to show how low standards are at some places.

review/summary: Not what it seems: this is a fake bully stick
review/text: Beware: This is just man-made doggy junkfood.  I always try to give my dog natural minimally-processed chews and treats, she goes through a lot of bully sticks, pig ears, & himalayan chews. When I bought this, the label didn't say what it was made of & I thought it was a bully stick or other bit of dried anatomy like a large tendon. Nice that it's odor-free but the texture seemed unusual, it's sort chewy like a heavy dried dough, not tough & durable like a normal bully stick. My 20lb bicha-poo ate the WHOLE 12" stick in about half an hour. After looking it up online I discovered that this is not a natural meat product at all but a man-made "fake" bully stick. Ingredients: Potato starch, meat by product, corn starch, sorbitol, liver, cellulose, water, egg, lecithin, calcium stearate, titanium dioxide, caramel color, sorbic acid. I won't be buying a Chew-A-Bull again: Full of weird ingredients, not natural, and it does not last.

review/summary: Not as good as real bully sticks
review/text: Quick summary:<br /><br />* Dog devours these things in 15 mins - no joke, they claim to be tougher than bully sticks, but they aren't even close. Not sure what they are made of, but it's pulpy inside and the dog can get through it quickly.<br />* Dog seems to get the brown color off of the outside - it ends up looking like it's painted on, so only the white stick remains. Not sure what's up with that, but not natural.<br />* Dog simply doesn't like them as much as regular bully sticks<br /><br />I have a Beagle that eats everything under the sun, but she is kind of picky when it comes to bully sticks. She likes stinky ones, and these did fit that bill, but the reason I purchased these was to try to give her something to chew on for a longer period of time, and since they say "One tough chew" on them I figured they would last for a while, but they didn't.<br /><br />I have to say we're going back to regular bully sticks.

review/summary: Loved in this house!
review/text: I thought this was another strange creation - cheese and fish in the same cat food can.  So, I only bought 2 initially, just as a trial because, quite frankly, I thought it sounded a bit gross.  Not so!  Again, Garfield strikes again and this disappeared faster than the sardines version!  I now buy this on a regular basis and the Persian king couldn't be happier (unless, of course, he had it attached to him via an IV).  Great product, doesn't reek of odor upon opening, but a bit pricey here. Check out your local store first. Highly recommend!

review/text: I have to offset the one star, long winded review.  Anyone who has bought cat food in a store know what Tasty Treasures is.  My cats certainly know what it is!  We have been waiting for Amazon to carry it so I don't have to make the trek to carry it home.  This food is favored over all by my two youngest who lap down every last bite.  Even my dry food eater will have a couple of bites.<br /><br />So, while I've been waiting for Amazon to carry this product...and yes, call it cat food and not treats, please ignore people wanting to call their Congressmen!  What rot!  Do a little homework and feed your picky eaters this...they'll love it.

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.
