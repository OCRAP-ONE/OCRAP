review/summary: Great cat food. Shiny soft cats
review/text: I started feeding this mixed with their usual brand about 2 months ago and I love it. The cats like it, unlike the grain-free, and it is making their fur soft and shiny. One of my cats was getting very over weight and he's starting to trim down. And there is also less mess in the litter box.<br />  I love that it is made with real meat and healthy veggies. I wish I could afford to feed ONLY Halo Spot's Stew to my furbabies, I know it would be better for them.  I love this stuff.

review/summary: good stuff but too expensive.
review/text: Would give the full 5-star rating but for the high price. There's no reason they can't create and sell a 10-lb bag for $21.50 as with the just-as-good "Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Limited Ingredient Diet Green Pea and Duck Formula, 10 Pound Bag." Both products are good for cats with sensitive systems. The 3 cats here liked the pea/duck food a little better than the Halo, but just marginally. I would buy both, were the prices equal. Either of these foods is superior to Science Diet. It's worth mentioning that the cats ate less of the two products above than they consumed of Science Diet and with better all-around results. So those 2 foods go farther per dollar.<br /><br />DON'T judge cat reactions to this type of food immediately. They are often drawn to flavors added to cheap-ingredient foods but, in our case at least, as some months have gone by, the 3 guys are increasingly drawn to the healthier foods.

review/summary: Halo
review/text: I bought this product initially on recommendation of the Animal Site on-line.  You click the button and it gives free donations to charitable organizations.  It sounded very natural and healthy for my cat.  One cat had stomach issues, so I was looking for something to help calm his stomach.  This seemed about as good as I could find out there.  But it is expensive.  But it's better than cleaning up cat barf.  I buy it at Petco, as well as on-line.  Your cat might like it too.

review/summary: Good tea
review/text: I have recently gotten into loose teas, along with a friend of mine. Both of us enjoy the flavor of this tea. I gave it only 4 stars because of how fine the tea is. It easily fits through all of my infusers, and I end up with a lot of it in my mug/tumbler (a lot more than any other brand of loose tea I've tried). The only way I see around this is to use the paper filters for individual servings.

review/text: As a lawyer for primiarily Italian and French clients, offering a coffee is a serious matter! My clients' response to Weavers was "amazing" and "an American roasted coffee"??? One bag a week in my office is a minimum. Very full bodied, it is immediately distinguishable from any and all US competitors. For the first time I have stopped using sugar or milk ... the coffee speaks for itself. Bravo ... Bravissimo.

review/summary: Honestly, you MUST try this coffee!
review/text: With all of the big brand coffees out there, Weaver's is a diamond in the rough and smokes all of the other brands. I was Star Struck for many years but didn't realize that I was consuming an acidic, metallic coffee unnecessarily.  I came across Weaver's at a friend's house and was blown away.  2 years later, I am a convert and will never go back to  big brands that fail to deliver.  If you're going to bother to drink coffee (or better yet, brew it at home from whole beans), then try Weaver's organic whole bean coffee.  Do what I did -- I conducted my own taste test with my coffee drinking friends using several well known brands and Weaver's came out on top unanimously.  Give it a try. You'll never go back to the other brews.

review/summary: French Roast is probably the best coffee in the line.  Here is my 2 cents
review/text: I discovered Weavers at the Food Block party last year at warner Brothers.  They were serving samples and one of the employees gave me half a pound of the French.  I have to say this coffee is one of the best coffees I have tasted.  Smooth ! Low acidity and such powerful flavor.  Love it.<br />Ordered a gift box this Xmas, and discovered the TEA ! So excited.  I have tried the French, Organic blend and Astral.  I read the story behind it and loved how its hand roasted in the bay area.  All that aside, love it !  The shipping is  a lil high but worth it !

review/text: Based on reviews of the Weaver's French Roast Organic Coffee, I was looking forward to my first cup.  Sorry to say that I was disappointed.  I found the coffee to be "thin,"  and not full-bodied although I used 4 heaping spoonfuls to 3 cups of water.<br /><br />I've been trying different brands of French Roast since First Colony went out of business and thus far have not found a replacement.  The Weavers was the 4th brand I've tried from Amazon and since there are lots more brands out there, I'm going to keep trying.

review/summary: Excellent French Roast
review/text: I've ordered this coffee 1 time so far & it was excellent.  It's not over-roasted/burnt tasting & the flavor is very complex.  The beans are oily, black & I found no quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.  If you've always been disappointed in dark roast coffee, you may want to give this a try.  Another dark roast sold on Amazon that I like is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027Z8VES">Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Pouch</a><br /><br />I use the "pour over" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I use cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe.  I heat the water to boiling, pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, wait a minute & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.  There is a lot of crema, the beautiful reddish brown foam that develops on top of the beans, & it smells & tastes wonderful.<br /><br />I brew directly in to this carafe using this coffee cone (pour over method):<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a><br /><br />I use this grinder:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a><br /><br />I use this water kettle to heat the water:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><br />I use these coffee filters:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0BEYG">Melitta 626412 40 Count #6 Natural Brown Cone Coffee Filters</a>

review/text: This tea is outstanding!! When I first brewed a cup, I was concerned how light in color it was, thinking weak tea. Then I took a sip. Great!! I have other Nilgiri's, one from Tao of Tea and another from a local tea merchant, but this Davidson's Nilgiri is the best of the three, and cost a LOT less. The flavor is complex and I agree with another reviewer about the flavors in the tea. The body is medium to light, as compared to Assam or even Keemun, but very satisfying.

review/summary: Best I've tried yet!
review/text: My husband is from the area where this tea is grown. It's grown in Munnar, Kerala bordering on Tamil Nadu, Bodinyakanur is the town he's from. I understand this is also grown in Kodaikonnal as well. Both are hill stations and beautiful places to visit if you are ever in South India and want a break from the heat.<br /><br />I am very spoiled, I usually can manage to conjure up someone to send me real nilgiri. The last time I was in India I packed a whole suitcase full of the gold label nilgiri (the frost, 5 lb bags). Long story short, it didn't last as long as I hoped...we ended up having a few kids...and I didn't get back to get more. My inlaws bought me some but it was low quality definately not export quality. And, I ordered from misc. places online. I ended up stumbling on this and I am so so so grateful!<br /><br />This is the nilgiri I was looking for. It's so bold but the tea itself is light. I make ice tea out of it in the summer and everyone is always shocked when they taste it. It packs a punch! This is perfect of me, and I'm on subscription now so I don't run out. But, I'm thinking I'll need two of these a month now that two of my boys are tea drinkers too.<br /><br />I did find a few pieces of sticks in mine. I am not bothered at all. And, certainly am not deducting a star for that. I am impressed that I've found a good quality nilgiri at a decent price! I paid double for a very inferior brand!! Thank you so much for offering this, I am in heaven. And, tonight I'm making a curry to go with my Indian tea.

review/text: The tea tastes good, doesn't have a particularly complex flavor. It tasted bitter and unpleasant at first, but I realized that it was the Stevia I sweetened it with, not the tea. Since switching sweeteners I've been happier with the tea and I'll probably get more of this blend.<br /><br />Take care not to steep the tea longer than five minutes to prevent bitterness. I've been steeping it for four minutes and it's working out great.

review/summary: I Really Love My Crackpot!
review/text: *****<br />This little bowl is great--I use it for eggs and more because it's so handy and has so many design features that I like. First of course, is the built-in blade for cracking eggs. The whole bowl is melamine (a type of hard plastic) and the blade is too, so it's not anything you'd cut yourself on. But it certainly does help by providing a convenient place to crack an egg. I don't tend to be good at this and end up getting egg white on whatever I normally use, so this blade really helps and does truly minimize shell fragments. The bowl is sturdy too, so it doesn't rock when you crack an egg hard. Also, it doesn't move because of the non-slip rubber ring on the bottom. And the handle sticks out so that you can hold it while you're mixing whatever is in the bowl; the handle is nice and big and suitable for both right and left-handers.<br /><br />The bowl holds up to a dozen eggs and is safe for the dishwasher, but cleans easily by hand too (I don't have a dishwasher). It's such a nice size (1.5 quarts) that I use it for lots of different things; the handle makes it very useful. Plus it's yellow and white, just like an egg--too cute! I think kids would like this too--it would help them to learn how to work with eggs, it's fun and colorful, and it doesn't slip around. Great bowl!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Hatcho Miso or not Hatcho miso
review/text: Hatcho miso is made in Okazaki a town in Aichi prefecture in Japan, that's about 250 miles from Sendai for the over- excited. It is the most famous miso in Japan. Warlord Tokugawa (Richard Chamberlains 15th Century Shogun buddy) was it's most famous advocate. He drank Hatcho miso soup everyday. Japan's current Emperor is also a "customer"<br />The only authentic Hatcho is exported by Mitoku company. Eden foods are listed by Mitoku as an importer of authentic Hatcho. However, this web page proclaims in a couple of places that the product being sold is made from 100% American soybeans!<br /><br />It has a very earthy flavor. Salt content is fairly high, but, one doesn't eat a sufficiently large quantity to be much of a problem unless one has real health problems with any amount of excess salt.<br />Personally, I believe the benefits from eating miso products far outway the possible detriments.<br /><br />The price being asked is high for genuine Hatcho miso and ridiculously high if the product is in fact American made.<br /><br />Eden/Amazon need to clarify.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor.

review/summary: A lot of crema!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:22 Mins<br /><br /></span>WOW! This coffee makes a lot of crema. It is delicious, bitter but not too much and has a good balance of flavors. It is very good in milk but also as an espresso. We tried several brands and these are the first beans that make such a great crema (take a look at the video). The crema stays for a long time and it comes down also when you make an american coffee or when you mix it with milk.<br />We love the size of the bag, the fact that is fair trade and that we are supporting this local company in Seattle.<br />We have a De Longhi coffee machine that grind its own beans, so I don't know how these beans would be when a regular mocha is used. The same machine, doesn't make much foam at all with all the other beans we've tried so far (from Italy, from Africa, from Brazil...). We are very impressed and we'll stick to this coffee!

review/text: If you think teas is just for when you are sick, you are saddenly mistaken<br />If you think decaf tea is "weak", I urge you to try again with the Twinnings Irish Breakfast decaf. This isn't a herbal tea that tastes like your neighbors' old grass clippings. This is real tea.<br />This tea has a rich, strong flavor without bitterness. It has a more robust flavor than Twinning's English Breakfast, which is also quite good. This tea is quite good in the morning as a wake up for those of us who have to avoid caffeine. And of course it's great at night because it doesn't have caffeine to keep you up.<br />I recommend everybody and anybody to try this tea. It is yummy.

review/text: After moving to the US from England, I searched long and hard to find a decent cup of tea.  The usual US tea is weak compared to tea in England.  Twinings Irish Breakfast Decaf Tea has great flavour.  It's a very satisfying taste and the beauty of decaf tea is that even though it is stronger in taste, you do not feel wired.  I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: The best decaf black tea out there
review/text: Caffeine can often be a problem for me and I often like to have a comforting cup of tea in the evening.  I have tried most of the decaffeinated black teas out there and most are poor quality and/or very weak.  I'm not overly fond of herbal "teas," Earl Grey or green teas and this is the best decaffeinated black tea I've found, at least readily available in the States.  Though not as strong as the equivalent caffeinated Twinings version, it is pretty close and has a lovely full-bodied flavor without bitterness.  If you like your tea on the stronger side, simply allow a minute or so longer steeping time on this one(I tend to drink mine brewed strong with a bit of milk).<br /><br />I admit there are caffeinated black teas (including several loose teas) that I prefer over this one, but based on a lot of searching, this is the best of the decafs and I'm glad it's available for an evening cuppa. I still think there is room for improvement in this product area, but this one is pretty good and is definitely a step above the rest of the field.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: Twinnings Irish Breakfast is the best grocery-sold decaf tea I've discovered (yet).  I like my tea, apparently, extremely strong: for a normal mug I will use 2 bags of this stuff and let it steep for 8 or 9 minutes.  (Then I add lots of milk and a bit of sugar....yum.)  If you do the math this is about 6x more tea-steeping than recommended on the box.  With other brands, such as Trader Joe's Irish decaf, I will use 3 teabags and let it steep for 9 or 10 minutes, and it still won't have much flavor to it.  I think this is more of a problem with decaf teas than with my taste buds, for what it's worth.  When I brew a cup of caffeinated tea it just takes one teabag for perhaps 7 or 8 minutes to get a really nice strong cup of tea.  So, while this tea, to me, isn't up to the standards of a really good caffeinated tea, or to what you'll get in a nice tea cafe, it's good enough that I don't feel sorry for myself when I'm drinking a cup.  It's ridiculously expensive in my local grocery store ($5 for 20 bags, which works out to 50 cents a serving when I'm using two bags per cup!), so I'm going to start buying it from Amazon now.<br /><br />The English Breakfast variant is "okay", but I definitely prefer this Irish tea, with its stronger flavor.

review/summary: No bitterness in this full bodied decaf tea
review/text: Too often I find black teas develop an unappealing bitterness, but that is not a problem with this lively decaf tea.  I had every intention of ordering the decaf Earl Grey because I love bergamot, but my order was hijacked by an unleashed desire to try something new.  Most decaffeinated beverages produce a different flavor and strength from their unprocessed counterpart, but the full mouth flavor remains intact with this tea.  It is a combination of black teas and nothing else, no flavorings, no additions, and this is a wonderfully satisfying beverage for a purist.  The bag which is like the "flo-through" Lipton bags I remember from years ago is attached to a white cotton thread which appears to be knotted at the bag and the paper tag and there is no metal staple.  Each bag is in a fully sealed smooth paper pouch which is also biodegradable, another advantage.  I thought Twinings used light paper envelopes, so that was a fantastic surprise which I appreciate.  I have drunk it with a Splenda but intend to have it with skim milk as well tomorrow.  It was perfect with Trader Joe's Orange Cardamom cookies.  I'll definitely enjoy drinking this tea and recommend it highly, especially to drinkers of peaty Scotch beverages like Laphroaig.

review/summary: Flavor is good, but Eww, texture!
review/text: This review is for the texture snobs in the world.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, the flavor is great and the ingredients/nutrition are better.  Hold on, though:  there's a "but" coming.<br /><br />Remember the flavored instant oatmeal we ate before we knew what "organic" or "gluten" meant?  Brightly colored "banana" bits held onto their fake yellow color and their cubic shape long after the hot water mushified the oats for us.  We ate fake crap, and we liked it.<br /><br />We're older and wiser now, and want real bananas:  real bananas that we re-hydrate ourselves with our steaming hot filtered water for optimum health and enjoyment.<br /><br />Except that rehydrated banana bits don't stay in bit form.  Nor do they rehydrate to sliced banana consistency.  Nay!  Rehydrated banana bits taste like delicious, wholesome bananas, and have the consistency of runny snot.<br /><br />That's right:  runny snot.<br /><br />I love everything else about this oatmeal, but when I want to feel snot run down my throat, I'll go out and contract the common cold, thank you very much.<br /><br />Based on other reviews, this doesn't throw everyone.  Based on other reviews, you might love this oatmeal and shrug off the banana snot texture without a second thought.  But if you're a huge texture snob, I thought you might want to know what you're getting into.<br /><br />I will shudder and finish the rest of my banana oatmeal one snot-filled bowl at a time (unless I can't take it anymore, at which point the food bank gets a wholesome and delicious donation), but I won't purchase this again.  I think I'll slice bananas into gluten-free oatmeal the next time I feel a bananas-and-cream craving.<br /><br />Best of luck with your oatmeal experience, and thank you for pausing to read a different perspective.

We were ecstatic when we learned about Glutenfreeda's Oatmeal being safe for both of us. It had been soooo long since I could make a packet of flavored oatmeal in a jiffy. And with my daughter's corn-allergy, it has been even longer for her. We are now in heaven and love all three flavors, but my favorite is the Banana Maple. We eat it for breakfast, snacks, whatever. It isn't as sweet as we both like it, but a spoon of demerara organic sugar and we're both ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Anyone who can buy any brand or kind of instant oatmeal off the shelf just can not fathom our excitement, but it is truly a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy instant oatmeal again!!

Second, when the box is empty, and if you are big enough you can be stuck in it.<br /><br />This tasty meal in a pop-top can, reminiscent of C rations takes some strength and skill to open so you will not hear the sound of lids pealing back in the middle of the night and cats slurping the juice.<br /><br />Some cats rub on the hand that opens the can. Others wait until you are out of sight before you hear them devouring the tasty can innards. Bottom line is this product is part of a balanced diet and has yet to encounter any detractors.

review/summary: Cats Love the Friskies
review/text: Even though the cats love the Friskies, I cannot go higher than a 3 star rating because it doesn't have the best ingredients.  I feel better buying it over other brands even though I don't care for the artificial ingredients and by-products because to my knowledge, Friskies was not on the Cat Food Recall that killed peoples pets.<br /><br />As far as the price goes, I cannot figure it out but Amazon is a total rip-off.  At Petsmart these are .40 a can.  The price here is like .67.  It is not a deal!  Not one bit.  Now, if Amazon changes the price after this review to be comparable to Petsmart or even the grocery store for that matter, then that means they wised up.  It is for the purchase of 24 cans.  Two 12 packs.  NOT two 24 packs (like I thought).  To return them would cost like $10 so it's not worth it.  Do the math before you buy to make sure you don't rip yourself off!

review/summary: Cat loves this stuff
review/text: My cats diet is solid food. I bought this as a treat for him as he gets a little grumpy when we bring the dog in from long walks or trips to the park. I figured a spoon full would make a decent treat and each can would last about a week. At first my cat looked at me like I was nuts and he wasn't overly fond of the stuff. I thought that I would end up giving it to my friends who have a ton of cats as it wouldn't go to waste at their house. in the meantime I still kept giving my cat a spoonful every time the dog got to do something fun. My cat now loves this stuff and im ordering my second 24-pack. Highly recommend.

review/summary: I love my cats. but you can get this at the grocery store...and cheaper!
review/text: I love Amazon, but this is probably the first time that I am shocked at the price. Not how low it is, but how HIGH it is! I can't believe the price they want for this case of Friskies cat food. I live in a big city and have my choice of plenty places to go to get my cat food. The price at the local Petsmart is 47 cents (regular price) or 44 cents (on sale). Do you see my point yet? Even if I paid 47 cents a can, do the math .47 x 24 = $11.28! Amazon wants what? $18.94! I do admit that the pate is my cats favorite, as they don't like to eat the shredded or the fillet types of canned cat food. I highly recommend the types of pate that are in this case: the Turkey and Giblets is a BIG favorite with the kitties and salmon doesn't stay long on the plate either! I have seven cats with an age range of 4 months to 16 years old, and all they will eat is Friskies canned cat food and their dry food. I recommend these Friskies items, but you are better off going to the grocery store, Petsmart or even Walmart. I will love you Amazon until the day I die, but I won't buy my Friskies from you. :(

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Outdated cans?
review/text: I have been feeding this food to my cats for several years, and I recently a started buying them online from Amazon for the convenience (though the price is about the same as what I pay at my local grocery store).  The strange thing I've noticed is that since I started getting it from Amazon, they have been vomiting quite frequently after feeding them a can.  I don't know if it's just ironic timing and something else is going on, or if the cans I have been getting are old or outdated. I will need to check the expiration date on the cans in the next shipment that I get before I feed it to them.

review/summary: My Cats Love The Friskies Pates
review/text: My cats just love the Friskies Pates and will not eat any of the textured ones, like shreds, except the tuna and egg which Amazon does not carry.  I have six cats.  They all share one can each morning for breakfast.  The one can feeds them all with some left for seconds.  They have their regular Friskies dry food out all the time in the gravity feeder, but they enjoy their breakfast Friskies pates.  Won't go with another brand.  I'll stick with Friskies.  Be sure to choose the 24 can case of one flavor pate for about $9, not the one for about $18.  It is the same product and quantity, just a higher price.  Also use the subscription to save more.

review/text: I know that Friskies must have selected these three varieties for this case for a reason, but unfortunately, these are the very three that my cats have never liked.  They will eat them for a couple of days, then I get that look: "Lady, if you think they're so great, then you eat them!" So, I usually take them back and exchange them for something they'll actually eat consistently.  Not sure why these are so non-palatable, but well, try something else like their turkey and cheese.  That one is the house favorite!

review/summary: Wanted More
review/text: I was rather disappointed to discover that the box only included pasta and a powdered seasoning. Where are the veggies? Glad I didn't purchase this at the store. Saved about $.50 a box.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoy the Chicken Fried Rice variety, but think that it lacks in flavor (mainly in the chicken itself). So, I decided to marinate the chicken one day (for the life of me, I forgot what I used). Marinating your meat is key to a DELICIOUS Asian Helper meal because your meat at Chinese restaurants have been smoked, marinated, or something before other closing ingredients are added.<br /><br />Since I marinated the chicken with the CFR, I decided to do so with the Lo Mein without tasting it unaltered. IT TURNED OUT DELICIOUS. I marinated the chicken pieces in Kraft Asian Toasted Sesame dressing for a little over 3 hours. Poured that entire concoction into my 10in skillet and followed the box directions (adding 2 dashes of ginger at the end, the box calls for 1tsp). I stir fried a bag of PictSweet Asian vegetables (they have a light "Oriental" sauce) and tossed that with the lo mein. Not only does adding veggies make the meal complete, but it also increases the size of your servings.

review/summary: Decent-quality Bay Laurel
review/text: When shopping for Bay leaves, you must ask: Do I want Bay Laurel leaves or California Bay leaves?  The former have a mild, pleasant flavor that is faintly cardamom-y and very faintly spicy.  They are sufficiently mild and tasty that, several minutes after popping one in my mouth to verify the quality of the product, I'm still sucking on it because it's quite nice.  California Bay, on the other hand, has a very strong, medicinal taste.  If you have purchased dried Bay leaves in the past, you probably bought California Bay.  Cooking with Bay Laurel will be a different but, in all likelihood, very pleasing experience.  Serious chefs such as Jerry Traunfeld advise simply omitting Bay when California Bay is all that is available.<br /><br />This Bay, in particular, is of a suitable quality.  The jars come quite packed with leaves and the leaves themselves are generally not damaged.  There is nothing so miraculous about it that it necessarily deserves five stars by comparison to other Bay Laurel, but by comparison to California Bay, it deserves six.

review/summary: Tea Even for people who don't like Tea!
review/text: This is the BEST tea I've ever tried.  I personally love tea, but not everyone does. I recently gave a Tea Party style baby shower for my sister.  Half the guests, including my sister, didn't drink (or think they liked) tea.  I convinced them all to give 4 Red Fruits a try, and all but 1 RAVED about it.  My sister has since gone through so much of this tea she searched for it online and discovered the best price here on Amazon.  I'd always bought it at the grocery store- but not all grocery stores carry it, & this is a much better price.  If you are unsure about trying this flavor, I can promise you you won't regret it!  It's yummy!

review/summary: Lover of Twinings Tea
review/text: For those of you who love Twinings Four Red Fruits, there is a reason why Four Red Fruits has been disappearing from store shelves. Twinings has recently changed this tea's name and packaging. It's new name is Mixed Berry. Mixed Berry is the same tea blend as Four Red Fruits; only the name has changed.<br /><br />Twinings USA sells this tea at a good price. [...]<br />I recommend that you also try Blackcurrant Breeze (formerly Blackcurrant) and other Twinings flavors. Twinings has a wonderful line of black teas, herbal teas, and also rooibos teas.<br /><br />No, I don't work for Twinings of London. However I do love their teas!

review/summary: addicted
review/text: This tea has become an addiction with my husband.  He does not drink coffee.  He discovered this tea when it was included with a gift basket we won at a raffle.  From that moment on he has been hooked.  Our local store no longer carries it and in searching the internet I found it at a great price.  Thanks for continuing to supply the great products you do!

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Great berry flavor to this tea. The fruity flavor survives the brewing nicely.<br /><br />I make iced tea using half this and half Black Currant Twinnings tea (also sold on Amazon.com), and that creates the perfect blend when I'm in the mood for something sweeter. Give it a try!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Twinings Four Red Fruits tea bags make one of the best iced teas I have ever tasted. The Tea has an aftertaste that lingers, kind of like wine. The fruit flavour lingers. OK as a hot tea.
