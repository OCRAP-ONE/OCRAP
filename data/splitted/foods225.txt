review/text: Yeah, get in a rush and "combine to save" , looked at ticket later and found that we had paid 8$+ for shipping of a 3 dollar box of salt. Which we could have got at about 25 places in town. Will have to say it was well packed and arrived quickly. So they did deliver. Well recommended if you reallllly need salt and are in realllllly remote location. hehe

review/summary: Easy peasy, good taste
review/text: I really love this rice! I work days and go to class nights, so I have to put forth an effort to keep healthy, quick options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for me at all times. This stuff stores well in my desk at work, and all I have to do is bring a package of frozen veggies and some soy sauce for a really fast and semi-healthy lunch or dinner.<br /><br />As for the comments about the "plastic flavor", I've never noticed that. However, you don't have to keep the rice in the bag to cook it-- you can just as easily pour it into a bowl and heat it that way. I've cooked it in the bag (add a little mzithra cheese and butter- YUM) and other ways, too, and it always turns out great.<br /><br />As options go for "fast food" this is one of the healthier options I've found. I totally recommend this (probably not from amazon, though, you can usually get these packets cheaper at your local grocery store...)

review/text: I had nearly given up on my dogs learning how to use this machine.  I had seen so many dogs on youtube and people saying they figured it out in 5 minutes...I was thinking that my dogs were NEVER going to figure it out! They would scratch and scratch on it and just could not seem to reach up and hit the lever.  I would get so frustrated watching them that I would end up pressing the lever for them.  I think they had me trained! Finally, after 4 months, they figured it out! They are so cute working the lever.  This is a great toy and I would highly recommend it.  It is very durable and well made.  I think I enjoy it as much as my puppies do.

review/summary: not for our dog
review/text: Our dog has not figured out how to use this toy.  He loves food and eats it quickly if we put it in his bowl but is not particularly curious and tends to leave things he does not see as his alone.  For instance, he will not bother an open bag of dog food if it is in the pantry and easily accessible to him.  Our dog's brother has a similar toy and figured it out with few demonstrations.  Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.  It's easiest done with a screwdriver.  I don't think you should have to need a screwdriver to fill food but the way this is constructed, if you don't use one, the lid remains loose. You will need a small scoop or a funnel to not make a mess filling it.

review/text: I've been acquainted with Black Jewell popcorn since 1984. It is superior in a variety of ways. The "crunch factor" makes it preferable to "airy" popcorn. The absence of most of the hulls after popping also makes it a pleasure to eat.<br /><br />Most all the kernels pop thus adding both value and eliminating waste.<br /><br />But the MAIN reason I buy Black Jewell popcorn is that it just has that GREAT taste! Don't wait to enjoy Black Jewell, life is short!<br /><br />Hey! It even makes bad movies better!

review/text: We like this popcorn for its taste and texture.  Although it is black, it pops up whiter than other popcorns, and is more crispy IMO.  We used to buy it in stores, traveling about 15 miles to the nearest one.  However, it costs much less at Amazon.com when you buy two cases - no shipping and no taxes. The bags are always consistent in popping quality: 2min., 10 sec. in a 1200 watt microwave. It is a good product for a small gift on birthdays, when visiting friends for dinner and at Christmas time.

review/summary: Great tasting microwave popcorn - finally
review/text: I am a bit surprised to be writing such a high recommendation for microwave popcorn. I did not have too much of an expectation.  The popcorn is very flavorful and not overly greasy, buttery or salty.  The kernels pop a very bright fluffy white.  I also noticed that the design and material of the bag is quite different and this probably played a part in preventing the burning that I had experienced in so many other brands of microwave popcorn.  I also did not get a large number of unpopped kernels.  There were some partially popped kernels - but those are my favorite b/c they are so crunchy.

review/text: This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls.  However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to.  I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it.  I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!<br /><br />I ended up giving the rest of it away.  A very expensive taste test!

review/text: The hubby & and I have sworn off microwave popcorn for some time as, regardless of brand, it tends to leave an oily residue in the mouth and hulls stuck between the teeth, all followed by a night of indigestion depending on how much "stuff" that particular manufacturer adds to differentiate their brand.<br /><br />However, given the rave reviews we decided to try Black Jewell. It absolutely lives up to its reputation. It is flavorful, light and crunchy, with just the right amount of salt. - The hubby & I disagree on this point. He likes to add more salt.<br /><br />While there has been some variation, of the many bags we have popped, there truly have been few "old maids" as we used to call kernels that didn't pop, fewer hulls lodged in the dental work, and no cloying aftertaste.<br /><br />We're having a hard time keeping it on hand as we keep giving boxes away for others to try! :)

review/text: I'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands. I tried this one because the best, BKH popcorn has gone out of business. I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels. In addition to that on the average 99% popped. The Black Jewel had like 25% not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn. The popped kernels were very small, hardly nothing to eat. The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again. If anyone knows the BKH brand and can suggest one like it let me know.

These weigh 15 grams (1/2 an ounce) and are about 12 inches long. In comparison, the other, larger stix, were 30 grams (an ounce) and 24 inches long. Seems like they should have a different name. The only thing GIANT about these, was the disappointment on my son's face :(

review/summary: Ok quality but not super yummy for tofu
review/text: I bought these beans to experiment tofu making. They are okay and will make nice tofu but the taste and quality of beans could be better. I only used these to experiment and yes I did eat the tofu but I used higher quality beans for guests and friends' tofu. Also - can not tell if this is GMO or non-GMO - package does not say, which I think means it is GMO, which could have harmful effects to your health. I won't buy again since I don't know if it is GMO or not.

review/summary: Great Tasting Tea, One Cup At A Time!
review/text: I can't say enough about Keurig and their K-Cups.  I made the transition from a regular drip machine to the K-Cup machine two years ago, and I have never looked back.  I have recently expanded beyond just drinking coffee and the experience has been just as good.  These K-Cups taste just like making a cup of tea with the bag in the hot water.  The only real difference is that my tea is made a lot faster.  I use the different cup sizes to give the tea different strength levels based off my mood.<br /><br />Note: Sometimes, especially if you brew a lot of coffee, you may want to run the K-cup machine empty (without a K-Cup in it) since this will help flush out any leftover coffee grounds and/or "flavor".

review/summary: Pure Food For Those Who Control Their Diets.
review/text: I just had a bowl of split pea soup for a part of my lunch. It was Amy's Organic Split Pea Soup and it was quite good. It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: You gotta have these for your pantry!
review/text: I always keep a box of these around to add to soups and well, just about everything.  Great taste (actually a little stronger than fresh), excellent storage, great value.  they don't replace fresh mushrooms in everthing, but will in a lot of things. How many time have you tried a new recipe to find out that the stated 2-3 servings will only barely feed two people?  Bulk it up with delicious mushrooms!  You've always got some on hand and they aren't the two week old slimey ones in the drawer in the fridge!  I've bought from this vendor a number of times and I've always had good service and really good 'shrooms!  Oh yea!, I almost forgot DO NOT throw away the crumbs and dust in the bottom of the bag, that my friends is concentrated flavor.  Also, if you are making a broth based gravy add the soak water (flecks and all) to the dish as part of the broth or if you are cooking pasta, use the soak water as part of the pasta boil water.  This adds a lot of really great 'shroomy flavor.  Buy some NOW, you'll be glad you did.

The peas from JR Mushrooms & Specialties are the best I've had to date.<br /><br />I like my wasabi peas to have a little kick, so if you like them that way too these are the peas to get. The shipping was fast as well.  I even ordered some when I was in Afghanistan and they were delivered quickly and in perfect condition.<br /><br />As far as price goes, you can't beat it.  I usually order the 5 lbs of peas and it comes in either 1 large or 2 medium sized zip lock bags so you can take what you want and seal it up for later use.

review/summary: Love 'em - and they are hot!
review/text: Wow, I can't believe I just placed my fourth order for the 5 lbs. pack. Compared to the "Hapi" wasabi peas at the grocery store, these are about 27% of the price, a great savings. But there are other differences to consider. These peas are hotter, saltier and harder than the "Hapi" product. With the "Hapi" peas, there is no way I can achieve a good wasabi burn, even by the mouthful. But don't fill your mouth with these. Three or four at a time give me plently of heat. And around 8 to 10 of these at once leave me screaming for a quick and painless death - I love it!<br /><br />As others have noted, these peas are harder too. Not rock hard, but every once in a while I find one where it is simply better to discard it than risk any damage. I always chew on these gently, to avoid any issues. If you are a fan of burning your nasal hair with wasabi heat, try them! If not, better stick with the Hapi line. Both are good to me, it just depends on which mood I am in.

I store these in the big bag they came in, with a twist tie, and eat them out of an old can that I refill from the bag periodically. I snack on these at work and will be set for months! Only warning: the wasabi on mine is white, not yellow, not that it matters.

review/summary: Wasabi Pea Addiction
review/text: I have a Wasabi Pea addiction. Its not pretty, but its true.<br /><br />Having tried all kinds of Wasabi Peas, here's my review of these in context:<br /><br />- Hot 7/10<br />- Salty 7/10<br />- Wasabi Flavor 7/10<br />- Crunch<br /><br />Other than my annoyance that these peas have food coloring in them to make them look more Green, and the fact that they do not score the highest on the Flavor scale (meaning "how much does it taste like actual Wasabi...is the flavor well-rounded, etc), they are<br /><br />"PRETTY DARN GOOD." (7/10)<br /><br />The 5Lb bag probably would have been large enough to have let some of them go stale if you didn't divide it up into smaller bags...but I ate them in 1 month, and the flavor did not suffer in that time.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Stick to the Japanese brands unless you are cheap
review/text: In light of the glowing reviews and excellent dollar-per-ounce price ratio, I bought these. It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)<br /><br />But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi brand but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi brand, and most other Japanese brands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!<br /><br />To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi brand just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag. I had no idea how large a bag 5 lbs of peas would be, but it turns out it's about 3 macbook pros stacked on top of each other. That bag is HUGE!<br /><br />Anyway, this..mundane tasting wasabi pea may be healthier and more organic, I don't know. But it most certainly won't turn any nonbeliever into fans. (And may very well turn wasabi pea addicts, e.g. me, into a nonbeliever!)

review/text: Wasabi peas are one of my favorite snacks, and finding these on Amazon has allowed me to indulge often while getting a great deal. They are crunchy and flavorful, and with a good dose of protein and fiber, these make a great healthy snack that is satisfying too. Also good if you have a cold or allergies. These wasabi peas are really good, but they aren't the best I have ever had. I really like the ones that have a lot of wasabi coating on them, even so the whole pea is covered, and I find that with this brand, there tend to be many peas with minimal coating on them. I like to feel a split second of intense regret after putting a wasabi pea in my mouth and feeling my sinuses about to implode before the spice dissipates, and these will do that if you put a solid handful in your mouth all at the same time. Maybe I have been eating too many wasabi peas and have built up some tolerance. Nonetheless, they still pack a good spicy kick overall, and are really crunchy without being too hard. The price of these is fantastic and as far as I know, you can't find a better deal out there for this level of quality, which is good because once you start they are hard to put down. I get the big bag and store them in empty pasta sauce jars or plastic food storage containers, and I like to split some up into single serving bags to take on the go. Maybe I am a little spoiled by Amazon, but shipping on these was slower than what I was expecting, as it has taken over a week both times I have ordered - but that certainly doesn't mean I won't order again! If you are a wasabi pea lover like me, give these a shot! You will be in snacking happyland for as long you can make these last.

review/text: I've never typed a review before, but here goes:<br /><br />These peas are great.  I've had other wasabi peas and non compare to the taste from JRs.  Yesterday, my latest 5 lb bag arrived, and to my dismay it was covered in ants.  My wife emailed them and they offered to send another bag free of charge.  No hassle, and a quick response time.  Exactly what I want in a company I do business with.  Will order again!

review/summary: Great Peas At A Reasonable Price!
review/text: I have ordered four 5lb bags from this seller total, one on each occasion. I'd give a four and a half star review if I could, simply because the second bag of peas had quite a few hard peas inside. The other 3 bags have been consistently excellent! Unlike a few other brands I've tried, they taste very fresh, and very well seasoned. I will be purchasing more from this seller in the future, but I am always looking for new brands (that are comparatively priced) to try. If you have any you recommend, leave a link in the comments! A++ seller and A+ product.

review/summary: Move over Almond Joy and Snickers!
review/text: Unbeatable! I've been cruising the protein bar isle for years, and this product just took first place in my book! I relapsed on carbs when I had Odwalla's Peanut Crunch Bar (though yummy very high in carbs). Who needs to cheat when there are Kind Bars on hand. I do confess, I like this one so well that I haven't tried the others yet!<br /><br />I have read on other sites that if the supplier isn't rotating or selling enough to keep fresh stock on hand, you might get a stale batch. That is an unfortunate consequence when the food item is without preservatives, as in this case. I recommend that if you get a stale shipment you notify whom ever you ordered from, and request a replacement. These are not intended to be rock hard or chewy like taffy. Just perfect...

review/summary: Healthy food can taste good.
review/text: I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.  They're not TOO sweet... they just taste very natural - like you dipped mixed, raw nuts into honey and ate it.  They're very crunchy and satisfy hunger cravings very well.  I love to get these at Borders bookstore as a nice healthy snack option while I'm out shopping.  I looked here to try some of the other flavors, but I'm hesitant to stray from the Nut Delight because it seems the other Kind bars have more saturated fat and more grams of sugar.  The Nut Delight seems like the best option of the bunch.

review/text: All of the Kind Bars are simply delicious with large portions that satisfy any sweet tooth.  They average 12 carbs with plenty of fiber to bring the net carbs down to 8.  The ingredients are simple; nuts and dried fruit with a little honey, but each bars packs a great deal of flavor.  One taste will have you choosing Kind Bars over any candy bar.  Unlike other "health" bars that have hidden calories these bars are simply fruit and nut with nothing else added.

review/summary: Extremely crunchy
review/text: I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for, (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately, it did not suit me. On the up side, it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.

review/text: The Nut Delight bar is a mildly sweet, solid bar of whole nuts (even the brazil nuts are whole!) --bound together by whatever glaze makes them slightly sweeter than the individual nuts mixed together would be--yet you get few of the carbs you'd expect with such a treat.  It sure beats counting out nuts to find your limit!  easy to carry & easy to keep a few in the car for lunch on the go.  If you like nuts, you'll like this!

review/text: I first sampled this bar on a long drive from Albuquerque to El Paso.  It was the only thing I'd eaten since breakfast and it kept me going.  I then ordered a carton from Amazon and was impressed by the crunchiness and the good flavor from the assorted nuts packed in there.  If you've never tried this product, imagine a handful of mixed nuts held together with just enough candy syrup to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />One of my friends thought it was a little too hard in texture.<br /><br />Please note the very low carbohydrate content -- good for diabetics.

These nuts are very nutritious and the best part is that it is not too sweet.  This works as a candy bar, but really is a nutrition bar that is crunchy, sweet, and a great breakfast or break snack to tide  you over when you get the mid morning droops at work.  Most other nut bars are not as crunchy or overloaded with too much sugar.  Slip one in your pocket or pack and you are ready for a taste treat that is actually good for you.

review/text: My first shipment of Kind Almond & Coconut bars contained VERY solid bars that, although delicious, were just about unbite-able.  I cut them up with a knife to save my teeth.  The second shipment is not quite so crunchy, and my husband suggested warming them in the microwave if they're too crisp.  They haven't needed that special treatment, but they're still not as soft as the Almond & Apricot and Macadamia Nut & Apricot flavors.  Since all the flavors comprise one sweet that I can eat without triggering allergies, they will all remain on my automatic order list.
