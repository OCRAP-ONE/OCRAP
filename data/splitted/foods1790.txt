review/summary: Great Popcorn
review/text: Fast delivery.  Great Popcorn.  Used in a manual popcorn popper, one of those that you put on the stove top that has a crank on top.  Made with coconut oil.  popped a large bowl full with half a cup of kernels.  THe popped corn was large and nearly popped all the kernels with 3  or 4 left behind.  Good flavor.

review/text: I finally got around to popping this corn and I am upset with myself for waiting so long.  Very good, all but a few of the kernels popped and with a little butter on top and I was in heaven.  I was a little worried how it arrived just screwed on and with tape, but it seem to do the trick.  I hope I am luck with my next order.

review/summary: was "ANOTHER stale sob story"
review/text: I saw all the reviews, both positive & negative and decided to take a chance. Ordered this with a new popper. When I received it I proceeded to make a batch of ....chewy popcorn.<br />Thought it may be from new popper so made another batch 2 days later with the same results.<br />What a disappointment. I bought the air popper and this popcorn to get away from microwave popcorn only to get stale popcorn.<br />The return policy is vague for a product like this. When you proceed through the steps of returning it, your only option is to return for a refund, no replacements or exchanges. I'd rather just get another (fresh!) container of this popcorn.<br />Still can't believe they only had a small strip of tape from the lid to the container with no seals of any kind. How is this product supposed to stay fresh if it isn't properly sealed?<br /><br />UPDATE: I was put in contact with their customer service and they promptly shipped out another container of popcorn. Although it was more fresh than the first container, it still seems to have quite a few chewy pcs of popcorn in each batch popped. Maybe I'm spoiled from eating microwave popcorn for so long?<br /><br />When I finish this container I'm going to try a smaller sized container from a different manufacturer and see if there's any difference.

review/text: I bought this popcorn to go along with my brand new air popper.  We love popcorn, but need a healthier way to eat versus microwave popcorn.  I thought this was a good deal for all that you get.  I think this will last my family a long time.  We made popcorn about 3 times every week.  This popcorn pops well and is very tasty.  I am very pleased and will continue to order.

review/summary: Average (so far) popcorn but great customer service
review/text: They popped small, not all kernels popped and most were tough.  I suspect they were old but without a code date on the jar it's impossible to know.  Not the worse I've had but I won't be buying more.<br /><br />Update: Whatever the quality of the popcorn, I am a bit stunned by their customer service.  After my review was posted I got an email from them apologizing and giving me an 800 number to call for a replacement.  I was busy and didn't call.  So they called me!  They're sending a free replacement and they again apologized.<br /><br />I'll be happy to try the replacement and will upgrade my review if necessary.  If the usual product is anywhere close to their customer service then I'll assume I was just unlucky with my first jar.

review/text: I bought these kernals about 2 months ago.  At first they were really fluffy, but after about a month of them being open they are now kind of chewy after being popped.  They still taste fresh which is great, and my popper is still able to pop all but 2 or 3 kernals.  I do think these kernals are worth the money but I will be trying a different brand the next time I purchase kernals.

review/text: Pops up great in the microwave (a handful of kernels in a brown paper lunch bag folded up and taped shut for ~3 minutes) with almost no leftover kernels.  I'm a popcorn seasoning junkie, but this popcorn is so fresh and flavorful that a little butter and salt does the job.<br /><br />It's also been my experience so far that Snappy is a little less prone to getting scorched than grocery store popcorn.  Higher moisture content, maybe?  Either way, it's nice to have fewer unpleasant burnt surprises.

When you bite into this warm fluffy popcorn the taste is amazing, but after you chew on that mouth full for three minutes the magic is gone.

I'm 63 years 'young' now...and have been enjoying this for years.<br />When I found it in here, and free shipping!...I immediately bought it, and have been a repeat customer.<br />If you love Velveeta Cheese, then this is something you're going to love! It's so much better than the powdered mixes that you need to add butter and milk to.<br />This has the thick, creamy mixture right in a sealed foil pouch. You cook the sheels, drain, and then stir in the pouch of cheese.<br />Nothing could be simpler! I actually don't drain off all the water, because the cheese sauce is so nice and thick ;-)<br />I'm on here today to buy another 12 boxes. A wonderful product for those of you that love Velveeta cheese!

review/summary: Velveeta Shells & Cheese
review/text: If you're gonna make Macaroni and Cheese from a box, this is the way to go.  Velveeta Shells and Cheese can be prepared very quickly and has a very creamy taste.  That's because you're actually using the cheese sauce Velveeta is famous for and not that powdered stuff common with other boxes.  You will only need to boil water, put the shells in and cook until tender.  Once you drain the water, squeeze in the cheese and (I recommend) let it set for a few minutes, so the cheese can set.  I also enhance the flavor a bit by adding some sharp cheese.  I can't make enough for my preschooler.  We all love it!

review/summary: Very good item for a quick meal
review/text: I love how Velveeta makes a creamier, richer sauce than the powder mix in boxes so I ordered this.  I usually make my mac and cheese with a loaf version of Velveeta and my own noodles, but for just 2 of us, this seems a lot easier.  Good to have on hand for those moments you don't know what to make.  Smooth, creamy and cheesy.  An ultimate comfort food.  It's not my homemade but it's very good for what it is.<br /><br />I was worried about this product being on recall until I was notified that this version isn't on the recall list!<br /><br />From "The Simpsons": The recall is for the microwave version ONLY, and only the ones with "use by" dates between March and May 2012.

review/text: My family just finished a meal for which a course was this product.  In all my years of noodles and cheese eating, I've only once encountered something as tasteless and bland as is this concoction that Velveeta offers.  The noodles were of poor quality, the cheese (presumably Velveeta-based) is only enough to nearly coat the noodles.  If you're interested in poor quality with poor taste and poor texture this is for you.  I can get organic mac and cheese with whole wheat noodles and real, organic cheese for less than this item at the supermarket (or maybe even on Amazon).  All in in all, you can get 10 times the product for less any day.

I have never been a big fan of cereals - hot or cold - but in my recent effort to eat healthier I decided to try to find something that would pack the biggest whole grain punch for me while being quick and easy to make. Not only does this deliver on those requirements - but I get the added and most welcome bonus of it tasting great! No syrup, honey butter - or other things that detract from the healthiness required. Add to that the fact that I can get a 2 or 3 month supply for around $10 - and there is absolutely nothing negative to say about Bob's Red Mill 7 Grain! Enjoy!

Love to stir fry onions, garlic, fresh tomatoes and add seasonings , taco sauce or salsa , chili powder, ginger all in water. Then maybe some meat 3.5 ozs . Can slice frozen chicken breasts in processor then stir fry till done. Just a few minutes then rinse noodles in strainer and add to stir fry when everything else is done. You have a plate full of food and most calories are from the meat. Very satisfying. My husband has lost over 40-50 lbs and I have lost over 30 lbs. This is one addition to the rest of our lives. We can make this meal in less time then going for fast food. And even better make double portions for lunch the next day.

My wife didn't care for them and I will be finishing up the remaining packages on my own.  The texture is similar to a rice noodle but they have almost no flavor of their own.  The sauce didn't stick to the noodles as nicely as it does with regular pasta and because of this, the finished dish didn't look all that appetizing.<br /><br />I will try a red sauce next time in hopes that it will make for a better presentation. I give it a thumbs up for anyone trying to cut carbs.  My wife a definite thumbs down based on appearance and texture.

review/summary: Some things you should know!
review/text: I didn't realize these packages are full of water (didn't read enough info apparently). It is best to cut a corner off and drain all the water out over a screen of some type. I warn you, the water smells a bit funny. However, that smell does NOT translate to the noodle when in the meal so don't throw it away. The noodles are really really long and don't break as easy as normal pasta in your mouth so it is best to cut them up with a pair of kitchen scissors (i made them about 4" or less). The package says two servings and I didn't think that would be correct when holding a package in my hand. However, the noodles really have a lot of substance and it is definitely two servings when you add other stuff. Not what I expected (thought I would get a package of dry noodles that had more servings) but they are great and I love them! What a relief to get a good noodle for soups, Italian dishes, and stir-fry without any carbs or calories. I just wish I could get these every month on a subscription like with other groceries.

review/summary: WEIRD!
review/text: Wow, wasn't expecting this! The noodles and rice products were like slippery little worms and fish eggs respectively. The only product I related it to is the noodles used in a Hawaiian soup called "Long Noodle". They were slippery and unmanageable like the noodles in this pack. Now I used to eat that soup quite often so my appetite is much more expansive than my wife who needs this product for diabetic alternatives. She gave them away immediately!

review/summary: Filling!
review/text: This product is a lifesaver for us! We are on a strict form of the HCG diet and added these noodles to our maintenance phase. We missed pasta and it is a great alternative. I added meat and tomato sauce and found it very filling! I recommend these to others on the diet, or those who have gluten allergies. Remember to rinse, boil one minute and pat dry before using. You will notice a fishy smell when you open the package, but it goes away when you prepare them. Thank you for a great product...I just ordered the variety package and will make some more recipes with seafood and veggies!

review/summary: Great for HCG!
review/text: While it is true that these stink right out of the bag, the smell goes away with a rinse and they are great after! We use them on the HCG diet - mostly with chicken and shrimp. They take on the flavor of  your dish, so for us it has been Old Bay Seasoning (or a similar alternative), Garlic and spices and the chicken. We affectionately refer to them as "rubber noodles" but not because they are rubbery, as I might have thought. Just because they are more stout out of the water than run of the mill noodles and are really long! The kids, which are both still pretty small, really like them! They haven't figured out that they're not the usual whole wheat pasta we normally fix. :) And because they take on the flavor of the dish, it isn't hard to make something they won't eat. Great find and excellent choice for anyone on a diet or wanting to make a healthy alternative. A little more expensive than brand x in the stores, but worth it, in my opinion, for better health.

review/summary: Good alternative to pasta
review/text: I love pasta.  I love everything about pasta except the weight I've gained from pasta.  These noodles are a wonderful alternative to pasta.  You get a similar (not exactly the same) texture and you can use healthy sauces.  The noodles are little chewy/rubbery.  However, when I'm craving pasta and I know I shouldn't have any, the shirataki noodles are the best alternative.  These were a great find for me and my dietary needs/wants.<br />Note: you MUST rinse them.  I put them in a colander and rinse them for at least 10 minutes.

review/text: If you are expecting them to taste like regular pasta then yes you may be disappointed. They don't have much of a taste at all but they do absorb flavor pretty well and they are filling too! I have heard some people say they have a fish smell but I did not experience that. There is an odor when you first open the bag that is not so pleasant but I didn't think it was fishy. Once you rinse them off the odor is gone. I saute some garlic and peppers with a little olive oil and red wine vinegar and add the noodles in. They soak up the yumminess. I have also tried them with soy sauce and some Asian stir fry veggies... Delicious and satisfying!! I am definitely a fan =)

review/summary: Like Eating a Tapeworm
review/text: Like others have said, I really wanted to like these.  While I didn't expect anything approximating true noodles, I was not prepared for these.  This is only a noodle (or fettucine in this case) insofar as the shape is the same.  But that's where the similarity ends.  This is a translucent slimy tapeworm-resembling product that does not remotely resemble food.  I tried it with spaghetti sauce and cheese and the only thing that made it edible was mixing it with true pasta.  But of course that defeats the purpose of the zero calorie angle. While I was thinking perhaps this could act as a filler or stretcher for pasta to lessen the calories, I have to say it is not worth it.  I rather just eat the one or two forkfuls of real pasta than mix it with this.<br /><br />P.S.- You may want to put on a DVD of Fear Factor to give you courage to eat this-<br />or just that old Charlie Chaplin movie where he eats his shoe.

review/summary: Greenies Pill Pockets - Chicken
review/text: One of our cats needs both a thyroid and a "happy pill" (anti-depressant) 2x a day.  Never had any problems - until just this month - blood work reported that we needed to adjust the thyroid dosage -- except the new dosage is not produced - so the vet called around to pharmacies who make compounds-to-order ... the new meds arrived - and when I saw the "capsule" instead of little tablet that we were used to I went on line to find out what others were doing to get capsules down kitties.  We found Greenies, ordered them and in the meantime bought a can of squeeze cheese until greenies arrived.... my cat likes both ... thankfully.  He isn't much of a chewer .. so that helps...<br /><br />We give him his 'happy pill' first (it is little) and then a few regular treats with one thyroid capsule tucked into a Greenie Pill Pocket... it has only been about 10 days .. but so far he is clueless .. he noses the treats around to find the Greenie FIRST, barely tastes it, swallows and eats his other couple of treats....<br /><br />Going to order some salmon and duck ones right now ....

I'm buying them here next time for sure. These pill pockets are so kitty-delish that the cat who doesn't need medicine has been stealing the pill pockets (and medicine too...insert fist shake, eye roll and frustrated sigh...) left for her sick brother. Particularly now that I need twice as many: half to be used as a distraction bait/treat for the healthy cat, and the other half--a true pill pocket for the ill cat.

review/text: Well,the bad news is, I think my cat is on to me.. I was anxious to try these after reading the good reviews on Amazon. So I bought the treats at a chain pet store and paid a lot more. Anyway, I let my cat smell the bag first and she seemed very interested. Then I gave her one empty pocket with no meds. She loved it. So, when the time came  was for her next pill, I gave her one pill pocket with the pill and a regular treat inside.  She ate it,no problem.<br />Now, I  temporary had to give her meds everyday and she is catching on. She eats the treat and spits out the pill!! I do not know what I am going to do. I guess I will have to force it on her by syringe. Maybe she will go back to taking the pill pocket...

I think you need to determine your cat type before you purchase these, some cats don't care for treats. However, I stuffed the pill in, closed it up, and put it before my cat and he chomped it down. I was nervous when he bit into it and figured here is where he tastes the icky pill and spits everything out. But NOPE! He ate all the bits! I gave him two empty pill pockets for being such a good boy. And he's worm free now. I hope these last awhile, because I only used 3 out of the whole bag.

The second night we rolled a pill pocket thin with a rolling pin, even using a little butter so it wouldn't stick (he loves butter), wrapped it around the pill, and shoved it into his mouth and held his head till he swallowed it.

review/summary: the joys of pilling a cat
review/text: Especially when you have to cut pills in half.  Greenies definitely make the task of getting those pills into cats a lot easier.  I've used them for cats who will voluntarily eat the whole pill and soft pill pocket all in one go, and to wrap the pill (the pill pockets are soft enough so that you can break them apart and 'wrap' around the pill, stretching out the pockets that way and making the whole 'pill package' a bit smaller) and pop it down the throats of those who unfortunately seem to figure out that there's something in the tasty treat (often by chewing on the pockets) and saving them the taste of the pill (great for cut pills or any meds that can produce a foaming/drooling effect).  Anything that makes 'medicine time' less of a stressful time for anything involved is a wonderful invention.

review/text: When my cat was diagnosed with high thyroid, he was destined to take pills daily for the rest of his life, at least 5 more years.  I told the vet that if I had to give him 2 pills a day, the cat would hate me...Adric hates taking medicines of any kind.  It becomes a "I chase you around the house until I trap you in a room then corner you, wrestle a pill into your mouth, then hold you while you gag, then when I think you've swallowed it, I let you go and you cough up the pill" kind of situation.<br /><br />Then the vet told me about these pill pockets.  I use two pockets a day as Adric has to take a half pill morning and night.  So far, so great!  He happily chases the treat with the pill inside, chews it up, and swallows it.  I could see using these for the rest of his life.  He actually comes running when I shake the pill bottle and sits and waits at my feet.<br /><br />The amazon price is far better than my local pet store, and with free shipping, what's not to love?<br /><br />If my cat tires of these, I'll report back in the future, but for now, he's one healthy happy cat again.<br /><br />Note: I also purchased the chicken pockets, but haven't tried them yet.

review/text: My cat was extremely difficult to get pills into, I tried these and now the second I wake up I'm called over to the 'pill spot' by an impatient kitty.  I have two cats, one doesn't take any meds and I was tired of the sad looks when the other got his treat every morning.  Now I give them each a treat.  One likes the salmon and the other likes chicken.  If your cat(s) won't touch it, try the other flavor.  As others have said, if your cat is really picky it's best to use one hand to deposit the pill and the other to pinch the treat shut so they can't smell the pill on the outside of the treat, but it's never been an issue for mine.

review/summary: doesn't work for all cats
review/text: This is a great idea for giving pills to cats. I am sure that this works wonderfully with cats who love dry treats. My own cat doesn't like dry treats like temptations etc. I think its the smell because she eats her regular dry food but not the dry treat. Go figure. So it didn't work with my cat. Instead I crush her pills(please check with your vet first before doing this) and mix them with wet food. I tried giving these pill pockets as treats to my cat, but she still won't eat them.

review/summary: Worthy of a Nobel Prize
review/text: OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but these have made pilling my cats something that they actually look forward to, rather than an ordeal that ends up with one of us being mad, and the other with scratches. Just put the pill in the pouch, pinch it shut, and offer it as a treat. Done! She snarfs it down and looks for more.<br /><br />It works great with one of my cats who is the most difficult to pill (and, of course, the she's the one that needs 2 pills a day for her thyroid problem). It does not work as well for another cat - I tried both the chicken and the fish flavors with her, and she didn't care much for either. Fortunately, she's pretty easy to pill using a pill gun.<br /><br />If your cat like soft treats, chances are he/she will like these. If so, and you want the easiest pilling process possible, get these. Amazon charges less than half what my vet office charges, and also offers them in a 6-pack at an even lower per pouch cost. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Great idea, but my cats hated them
review/text: I think these are a great idea - hiding pills inside a tasty little ball of gooey chicken tasting stuff.  Because I could get them with free shipping via Amazon's Supersaver shipping (for orders over $25) I decided to try them.  We have two indoor house cats and two outdoor barn cats, and I worm them quarterly.  Usually I have to grind up their pills and hide the powder in wet food.  I tried liquid wormer but they could smell it in the food and wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />So, the Greenies arrived and I fixed one for each cat.  One cat smelled it a long time, but wouldn't eat it despite my pleading.  Two of them gave the Greenie a quick sniff and backed away after giving me a dirty look.  The fourth cat actually hissed at me when I offered it to her.  She's not the friendliest cat to begin with, but she usually takes treats from my hand.  The overall opinion from the cats seems to be "yeah, right!  Nice try!"<br /><br />Maybe the salmon flavor would be a better choice, but I don't think I'll spend the money to find out.  I'm giving three stars because it's a great idea, but if the cats won't eat them I'm back to the drawing board.

review/text: My cat is on a daily dose of Prozac due to anxiety and territorial issues, and the vet said that we should try these pill pockets as a way to easily give him medication without having to chase him around the house and cram a pill down his throat (only to have him spit it up later). He eats these like "treats" and has even ripped through the bag to eat the pill pockets sans medicine. These definitely are worth trying if you need to give your cat some pills. Also, the price on Amazon is great compared to my local pet stores.

review/summary: Life Saver for our CRF Cat
review/text: Our cat of 15 years was just recently diagnosed with Kidney Failure.<br /><br />Among the other things the vet prescribed to help her is a daily dose of Pepcid and an appetite stimulant which she takes every 3 days. She's not allowed to have a lot of protein (part of kidney failure), but the vet advised a little would be OK to disguise her pills in a small bit of food. We tried everything to get her to take the pills - tuna, cream cheese, regular cheese, cream, whipped cream, ham, turkey, baby food, etc. Although she usually loves all of these things (she comes running when we shake the whipped cream can!), she would not touch them when the pill was mixed in. We tried adding the pills whole as well as crushing and mixing them. No go.<br /><br />The vet suggested force-feeding her the pills. This includes wrapping her up in a towel while my husband forces her to open her jaw and throws the pill in while. I shoot a syringe full of water in forcing her to swallow the pill. Sounds pretty straight forward, but its not. Not to mention its stressful on us all. When we were finally able to get the pill in her mouth it actually started foaming!<br /><br />Needless to say, we were very frustrated and didn't know what to do. Then we found these. She loves them and hasn't even noticed the pill. We purchased both the Chicken and Salmon in case she gets bored of one flavor. We're crossing our fingers that she doesn't wise up. But they have literally been a life-saver!  Thank you Greenies!

review/summary: My cat and I are thankful...
review/text: Our cat is a 17 year old with thyroid and kidney issues.  He has to have his thyroid pills 3 times a day.  He used to eat them crushed in a small helping of Friskies Appetizers (tuna or salmon) which he ate dependably... but lately he'd become picky and not interested in the Appetizers any more.  We'd gotten to where we were doing the "gently pinch the jaw and shove the pill back" routine which neither of us liked.<br /><br />These pill pockets make getting him his meds easy and pleasant, and we're both happy not to have the thrice-daily confrontations.  It's a soft treat in the shape of a small cylinder with the top missing- tuck the pill in, pinch it closed, roll it around to make a ball and it's set.  We have used the salmon flavor successfully, and will be trying the chicken soon.<br /><br />To folks who find the cat is eating around the pill or can detect it... if the pill can be cut in half, do that and give two treats, a half in each.  (Check with your vet to be sure it doesn't affect the drug's delivery since some meds have a time release coating.)  Whoever thought of these was a genius.

review/summary: Amazing & Easy Way to Give Cats Pills!!
review/text: I purchased this item at a local pet store when I was on my way to the Vet to pick up some medications for one of my cats. One of the medications was a liquid, and the other was a pill, not a capsule. I was instructed to give my cat, Loki, half a pill every 12 hours.<br /><br />I gave Loki his liquid antibiotic first, and then followed it with a Pill Pocket that contained his medication. He had no idea that the pill was even inside the treat!! He gobbled the Pill Pocket down and looked at me expecting more Pill Pocket Treats. I have continued to follow his liquid antibiotic with his pill medication in a Pill Pocket as a "reward" for taking the liquid antibiotic.<br /><br />Loki is getting smarter about the Pill Pocket Treats, even though I only started his medications recently. To get around him sniffing the Pill Pocket and turning his nose up at it, I put other treats that he loves on the floor and put the Pill Pocket among them. He scarfs them all down, Pill Pocket included!<br /><br />One problem I had (that the Pill Pocket ended up solving), was the pill medication. The pill had a chalky consistency, and when cut, did separate cleanly into two halves. So sometimes I would end up with pill dust that would have to be halved and somehow inserted into a Pill Pocket. The Pill Pockets have a play-dohy consistency, and using this to my advantage, I flattened one Pill Pocket out and gently molded it into a bowl-like shape. I put the pill dust into the Pill Pocket bowl shape I had made, and then flattened a second Pill Pocket. I placed the second flat pill pocket over the top of the bowl-shaped Pill Pocket and squished them together, making one slightly larger Pill Pocket.<br /><br />Now, when Loki is called, he comes running into the kitchen for his Pill Pocket. And, since I'm sometimes forgetful, he'll come and get me, meowing until he gets his Pill Pocket (and medication).<br /><br />Pill Pockets are an easy way to get your cat(s) to take medications and are very versatile (as they are somewhat mold-able) to accommodate the type of medication (Pill or Capsule).

review/text: My cat was put on prednisolone for the next month, and for a week or two I was crushing her pill and mixing it with cat food every morning. To save some time, I decided to try these pill pockets out to see if they worked. Turns out that it worked perfectly! The pill is oval, so I squish the treat until it completely covers the pill, and give the pill to my cat while the other gets a regular treat. They both happily eat their treats, and I follow up with a regular Greenies treat to make sure that the entire pill has been taken.<br /><br />My vet's office originally suggested a pill shooter as a way to give her the pill if she had trouble -- I'm so glad to know that taking her medicine is now a happy experience for my cat, rather than a traumatic daily occurrence!

They are moist and you can wrap the pill pocket around the pill so there is no pill taste or smell.  I usually divide both the pill and the pill pocket in half so it is a smaller package, and she doesn't bite into the pill and pull it out.  She loves both the salmon and the chicken flavors.  I haven't tried the beef flavor, yet.

Just make sure the pill isn't showing anywhere or the cat will spit it out. My cat did that once; ate the pocket and I found the pill on the floor. My fault. Now I make sure the pill is fully covered everywhere and it never happened again. I am so grateful for this product!!! I have to pill my cat twice a day for hyperthyroidism. She hated it! We had to shove it down her throat. I felt just horrible. This is so much better. No more stress for any of us and my cat thinks she gets a treat twice a day now instead of being tortured.

Haven't had a problem at all, except his sister wants to partake as well, so I give her empty pill pockets from time to time.<br /><br />The vet charged $6.50 for a bag of 45 pill pockets - much less expensive on Amazon.com.

review/summary: AWESOME.
review/text: i wrapped the pill--our vet said to put them in food...but BOTH of our cats inhaled them without food.  i'd use them as plain old treats...way better than trying to 'pill' your cat.  AWESOME, highly recommend

review/summary: Terrific idea.
review/text: I have a cat that can sense a pill in anything and refuses to even try a<br />"snack" with anything hdden in it. I popped a pill into a salmon pocket, and "Voila", gone! The best ever for pilling a pet.

review/summary: Made recovery much less stressful
review/text: My cat recently had surgery and had to take a course of antibiotic pills. I was dreading the idea because he's a difficult cat to pill, and I didn't want to add more stress on him during recovery, but these treats made the whole process easy. I gave him a few without pills in them first just to make sure he'd eat them and to get him used to them. I never had any issues getting him to eat them with the pill in them. (I cut the pill in half and gave him two pill pockets at a time, since the pill was on the larger side.) It might also help to not give your cat or pet any food for a few hours before you administer the pill, so they're hungry enough to be less picky about it. I'll absolutely use these again in the future if the need should arise.

review/summary: My cat loves taking pills now...
review/text: My cat needs to take a supplement for joints as she's getting older. I found these at a pet store and they have been great. Now when my cat hears me opening the pill bottle and grabbing the pill pocket bag she thinks its time for treats and starts meowing excitedly. They go down no problem. Its Incredible! I have also bought these on amazon and it arrived quickly.
