review/summary: Wow and YUM!
review/text: We LOVE this stuff around my house.  I finally got my husband to switch from his sugary sports drinks to a healthy option.  His favorite is the Pink Guava.  I like it because it has a ton of potassium and other minerals that hydrate me well which is important as I am a full time fitness instructor.  It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.  I enjoy it more than other brands (and I've tried quite a few).  O.N.E. is by far my favorite.

review/summary: Watered Down Sports Drink
review/text: This is the latest foray into the "all natural" nutritional drinks market. Despite boasting "real fruit juice" on the packaging, the flavor is simply too watered down to notice. Having drank plenty of coconut water, this drink has barely more than a hint of it. Most likely, it clashes with the taste of the guava, which is also hardly noticeable. In fact, were it not for the label on the packaging, this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be. Speaking of the which, the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids, sans the accompanying straw. Also, this 8.5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost. Given the price for a pack of 12, it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck. The nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks, however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market. Overall, O.N.E. has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks. While it does offer fairly solid nutritional content, the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value.

review/summary: Taste's Good & Good For You
review/text: O.N.E. Coconut Water tastes much better, IMO, than sports drinks and electrolyte drinks sold in pharmacies.  I didn't really taste the coconut flavor or Pink Guava for that matter.  It has a light, not to sweet, flavor with electrolytes you need to replace if you've been sick or after exercise. The price is not to expensive and I like the single serve containers as most electrolyte solutions have a short shelf life after opening.  Coconut water is good and good for you.

review/summary: Good Nutritional Value, but Essentially Flawed
review/text: Everyone should drink more water, or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor, and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.<br /><br />I like the taste of coconut but I am only so- so on the flavor of guava. Still, I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut, it would be fine. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming, because you taste more guava than anything. Even then, the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.<br /><br />Nutritionally, O.N.E. Coconut water is very good, with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving, and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer, but it isn't too bad and, unlike other sweet drinks, you get a good deal of nutritional trade- off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied, I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.<br /><br />Along with the bland flavor profile, there is one other problem I have with this drink, and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box, which is ordinarily not a problem, but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed- in to open, but the manufacturer doesn't include a straw. Thus, you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then, you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.<br /><br />I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered, I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava, the taste is unexciting, and the packaging is flawed. Yes, you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isn't a complete bomb, but there are other, better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition, better taste, and more sensible packaging.

review/summary: Not a winner for me...
review/text: The taste is definately not my thing.  For me it started out bland and as the chill wore off it went downhill from there.  I had to force myself to finish the container.  I did not think that the listed health benefits of the drink made it any better than other drinks of the electrolyte replenishing variety on the market today.  I do like the design of the container and although I was tempted to suggest a straw would be nice it is not absolutely necessary and would just add to the landfills.

review/summary: The worst coconut water I've ever tasted
review/text: I have tried many brands of coconut water, including some flavored ones, but this one does not merit even one star.  It does not taste at all like coconut water --- WAY too much sugar and flavorings added --- sickeningly sweet. Very disappointing and truly a waste of my money.  Same was true of the passionfruit flavor. Yuck.

review/summary: Refreshing
review/text: O.N.E. Coconut Water is a refreshing alternative to soft drinks. A splash of pink guava gives this drink the sweetness and flavor you want without resorting to anything artificial. The 8.5 ounce serving is about right because this is a drink you want to savor with or without a meal, but definitely not guzzle. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better.

review/summary: THIS STUFF WORKS FOR US AND OUR DOGS LOVE IT - PERHAPS IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AND YOURS.
review/text: Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a brand and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same brand will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don't care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:<br /><br />If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!<br /><br />We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious "things" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and "things" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don't get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain't a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog's needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Not happy at all.....
review/text: Two stars is kind. I am not sure what is going on here as I have been using this dog food for some time now.... but the bag I just opened (from Amazon) is not the same as the last ten bag of this stuff. First off it is a different color??? and second the soft bits are hardly in this bag. The soft bits that are in the bag are hard and crumble in my hand. Now this may not be Amazon fault.... it could have been store wrong... or Purina has change the blend. Either way I am not happy nor is my dog. I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what. So right now buyer beware.<br /><br />10/04/2012 Just an update .... called Purina and the are sending me a coupon for a free bag and an additional discount coupon for my trouble .... but it will take 7 to ten days. My wife went to walmart today to get a new bag so my dog will eat again ;-)

review/summary: Dog likes it better than Costco
review/text: I often buy Costo's Lamb & Rice dog food; Costco used to carry Purina One and I bought Purina from Costco; now they no longer carry Purina. The ingredients of Costo's and Purina's appear to be much the same. However, my Siberian Husky prefers Purina; so, whenever I run out of dog food and going out to Costco is a hassle, I will spend more and get Purina.

review/text: I did lots of research in my quest to find reasonably-priced, 100% maple syrup.  I settled on Coombs Family Farms Grade B, and we have been so pleased with it!  I have two children under the age of three, and they love the rich and savory flavor as much as we do.  It has been a big hit at our house!  After trying this maple syrup, I'll never buy anything less than 100%.  We like this brand a lot, but the price was good and we were able to get the 15% discount in addition.  If they continue to offer it, we would buy from them again.

review/summary: Fantastic Flavor...Hooked!
review/text: I admit that for many years I only liked the "bad" stuff in the grocery store that was chock full of high fructose corn syrup and didn't have maple syrup in it!  I just liked the flavor.  Other maple syrups (which were Grade A) just tasted watery to me and didn't have that rich flavor I wanted.<br /><br />But since we're trying to eat healthier now and getting rid of stuff with HFCS in it I wanted to find a syrup that tasted really good.  And I've found it!<br /><br />This syrup is really flavorful, dark in color, and very rich.  I just absolutely love it.  Never again will I go back to using the fake stuff when the real stuff is so incredibly tasty - not to mention better for you!  Thanks Coombs Family Farms for making this.  It's fantastic!

review/text: We really like maple syrup. We try to get grade B for the darker color and stronger flavor, but grade A is also pretty darn good. This is a big jug (32 oz) and will last you a while. We transfer it to smaller containers that we can heat up for use at the table. This probably isn't a better deal than you can get at the grocery (with shipping) but it is a good value if you live far away from a larger town and can combine your maple fix with other orders to defray or avoid shipping charges.

review/summary: Thick and just the right amount of sweetness and maple
review/text: I started subscribing to this syrup this summer as a replacement for my usual Nature's Promise syrup.  I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).<br /><br />Consistency<br />Coombs is thicker than NP which allows me to pour a thin and controlled stream onto my waffles. I don't like to drown my waffles. I do tend to lose a small amount of syrup onto the edge of the container but I think that must happen with all syrups.<br /><br />Flavor<br />I think the flavor is a little stronger than Nature's Promise. Maybe more than a little stronger.  I'll admit at first I liked Nature's Promise better but I just had to get used to the stronger flavor of Coombs.  Now that I have I can't go back.  And I even tried just out of curiosity.  NP is tasteless when compared to Coombs.  Coombs is a perfect compliment to my whole grain waffles.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and sweetness which allows me to also taste the waffles.<br /><br />Bottle<br />I like the bottle.  The extra unopened bottle sits on a small wooden kitchen cart with some other things and it looks good. Seems to fit in.  Of course you have to refrigerate the opened bottle.  It's easy to use. It has a small handle that I think can fit most people's index finger comfortably. Then you grab the skinny neck with your thumb and middle finger.  It really seems to be very ergonomic.  Very easy to pour.<br /><br />Value<br />When subscribing it's like getting a free bottle of Nature's Promise for every two 32 oz bottles I get.  And because I can easily control the pour I can make one bottle last about two months and that is using it almost every day.<br /><br />Great product.  I highly recommend.

I'm knocking a star off because of the high price which reduces its value, but sometimes there are sales and coupons that make it a much better buy. If price were no object, then I'd give it 5 stars. Much better than pouring high fructose corn syrup with artificial flavors on your pancakes and waffles!

I hope he enjoys it because we're going back to our frozen fruit compote breakfast topping due to the amount of sugar in syrup. Yes, syrup *is* sugar.  But, fruit syrup is tasty too, with a side of nutrition.

review/summary: Price is good, but container is HDPE plastic
review/text: The price I paid ended up being 25% off what I would've spent at the grocery store on 32 oz of this brand in glass containers.<br /><br />However, with the price savings out of mind, I don't like that this comes in a HDPE (#2) plastic jug, simply because it is not reusable like glass is and HDPE breaks down easily with temperature changes over time, leaching into the product.<br /><br />Since real Maple Syrup only takes a dab for tons of flavor, even our large family of 5 won't get through this in a year likely (despite our weekly pancake breakfasts). This makes me wonder if the plastic molecules will start their leaching process and then we'll be eating plastic :-/ I think I'd rather get glass bottles in a smaller size - the savings isn't that great.

review/summary: a hit with the whole family
review/text: The negative:  Grade B syrup is normally 'mapley' with caramel notes. This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber. In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup. What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting. I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor. I would rate the Whole Foods Grade A Amber as a 4 star minus, and the Grade B as 4-5 stars. Having grown up in sugar maple country and bought syrup from the farmers in unmarked gallon cans ('store syrup' never entered our house), I have plenty of experience with maple syrup. [Tip: maple trees and maple syrup are 'organic' by definition. Farmers who tap trees add nothing. Don't pay more for 'organic'.] At our house we 'sugared off' every Winter. For those who know what I'm talking about, read on. For those who don't have any idea, you may be happy with this product.<br />The positive: This syrup is priced right (purchased at $17.31). It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing. It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars.

review/summary: First time buyer...mixed reaction
review/text: This is literally the first "real" maple syrup our family ever tried.<br />It was a good deal on Amazon, and I'm always looking for more natural choices to feed my family.  Overall, I like it.<br />My kids and hubby, however, have their reservations.  It is much thinner than standard "syrup" their used to, and the Grade B definitely has a strong maple flavor.  So if you like that, this is the syrup for you.<br /><br />Once this is all used up (I plan on baking with it as well), I plan on re-ordering the same brand,<br />only the Grade A.  Maybe that will ease them into true maple syrup a little easier!<br /><br />All in all, a great price and good syrup.  My family just isn't quite ready for the strong maple kick!  Three (and a half) stars.  Minus one star for super strong maple flavor and 1/2 star for too thin of consistency (for my tastes).  Best part is, the ingredient label!  If you force your picky husband to review his current imitation syrup in comparison to this, he'll be shocked.  100% pure maple syrup vs. Corn syrup, sugar, imitation flavorings/colorings, etc...  Go natural - buy real syrup!

review/text: This is only the second time I have purchased pure maple syrup.  The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A.  It lacked much maple flavor.  So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked.  We hate it.  It has a very bitter after taste.  I don't know what to do now becuase we don't like the grade B, but the grade A isn't strong enough in flavor.

review/summary: Great stuff at first, but not for long (see my edit within review)
review/text: I liked the flavor of this syrup at first, as did my wife.  It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the "store-bought" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />"People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?"<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking.

review/summary: Grade B Organic
review/text: There are generally 3 grades of maple syrup. Grade A is the first run - Mild in taste, sweet and with fewer minerals than the other grades. It is more expensive and less desirable (health and taste wise). Grade B is the second run with more minerals plus more maple taste. Grade C is the third run with even more minerals and an even stronger taste of maple and it's slightly less pleasant for most people.<br /><br />Maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins and Grade B Organic is my favorite, considering it's stronger flavor and higher nutrition content. Of course, Organic is the only way to eat food now, but that's another story.<br /><br />Coombs Family Farm provides a very satisfactory grade B organic Maple Syrup! I've used a lot!

review/text: There's maple syrup and there's maple syrup. My wife and I are from the East Coast (she from Vermont) and we've tried maple syrup from other regions and those just don't measure up to a Vermont syrup. Although this product does say some of the raw materials come from Canada, this is an excellent example of a Vermont Maple Syrup. As a "Grade B" product, it has the rich, deep-bodied flavor and color one would expect, but this one makes pancakes and waffles a different experience entirely. I would recommend the Coombs product highly to anyone who's looking for a top quality maple syrup.

review/summary: Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug
review/text: Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug:<br /><br />I remember when my grandmother would make pancakes, waffles or potato pancakes and the maple syrup was just so delightful to the taste. She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major brands of "pancake syrup maple flavored," would stop using high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.<br /><br />Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store brands.<br /><br />I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, "That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted."  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.<br /><br />A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life.

review/text: Living in Nebraska, we can purchase real maple syrup in the store, but I really like supporting family farms directly.  This way, I'm pretty sure that the products I purchase are top quality.  If not, I can go to the producer.  I'm no conniseuer of maple syrup like some people on Amazon are, but I can say this has a great maple flavor, the consistency is a little thinner than store bought, imitation maple syrup, but that stuff has artificial thickeners in it.  Remember, this is tree sap, boiled down to reduce the water and increase the sugar content.  Nothing more nothing less.  This syrup makes you want to lick the plate when you're done with the pancakes.  One note, they need to do something to better protect the black plastic cap on the top of the jug because mine was broken when it came.  The jug is sealed well, so nothing spilled.  Not a big deal, but someone picky might pitch a fit about something trivial. Buy real maple syrup whether from this company or another, you owe it to yourself.

Do you think we would not notice the price change?<br />Watch what you pay since the subscribes are changing so much.  Plus, even if I asked for it now, the policy is not to ship until my assigned date next month anyway.<br />For now, I am going with another product and wait to see if they actually send me a jug of this or just cancel my current subscription to force me to change to the more expensive offer.

review/text: My family (myself, husband, toddler daughter) gobble this syrup up.  In the right syrup, we prefer Grade B over Grade A (which has nothing to do with the quality) because we like a more maple flavor (Granted, some syrups are bad no  matter what grade. This is not one of them).  This syrup has an amazing dark caramely aroma and a clean yet very full maple taste.  I am so glad that we don't need to use a lot for each pancake or waffle so that it lasts longer!  I also use this to make granola or add it to plain yogurt for a healthy snack.<br /><br />Past reviews have compared this to table syrup, also known as imitation syrup, such as Mrs. Butterworth's or Aunt Jemima's.  Please know that these two products are nothing alike and therefore really can't be compared.  It's the ol' apples and oranges thing.<br /><br />I hope you will try this syrup and enjoy it as much as we do!  We treat it like a bottle of liquid gold in the fridge.

review/summary: Quality Grade B Syrup, Perfect For Cooking and Baking, Too
review/text: I love the taste of maple syrup. Well, that's not quite true. I love the taste of maple, period. :D<br /><br />I've been buying pure maple syrup for many, many years and was thrilled when I found out about Grade B syrup several years ago.<br /><br />Contrary to most rating systems, with maple syrup, the higher the grade, the more intense the flavor. I've seen some say that this syrup tastes too much like molasses. That wasn't my experience at all. I did find that to be true the one time I bought Grade C..that was too strong for sure. I've purchased several gallons of maple syrup over the years. This brand was right up there with brands that are much higher in price.<br /><br />I also use this syrup for regular applications like pancakes and french toast. I enjoy the strong flavor and the fact that it's not watery like grade A syrup can be. It's a must for cooking. I make a maple-walnut praline ice cream with it that is simply luscious. I've also used it to make maple breads, cakes and candies.<br /><br />A caveat: Please be sure to refrigerate the syrup after opening it. Mold can form in maple syrup if left at room temperature too long after opening (weeks, not hours). If you do forget and get mold, you can strain the syrup through cheesecloth and then boil it for 10 minutes or so, but it's better to avoid it altogether.<br /><br />If you like Log Cabin, this may not be the sryup for you.

review/summary: Terrific!
review/text: Whoa! When reviewing this syrup, two things immediately come to mind: #1. Damn this is good syrup! #2.  Damn this is expensive syrup! With about 10 servings per 32 oz. jug (on pancakes) and at $23.00 per jug, you're averaging a little better than $2.00 per breakfast -- just for the syrup! Well, I can't afford that ..... Yet here I am buying ANOTHER jug. It really is that good. Last week in an attempt to save money I purchased a 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup. It was $36.25 for a 64 oz. jug, which is vastly cheaper than Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup which is about $23.00 per 32 oz. jug; so you're looking at $46.00 per 64 oz. jug of Coombs compared to the $36.00 per 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont. Unfortunately for us thrifty shoppers, the Hidden Springs Vermont is not in the same league as Coombs Organic, and even if I saved $25.00 per jug, I'd probably still go with Coombs -- that is an indication of just how much I love this syrup.<br /><br />Quite simply, I've never had syrup as delicious as Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B. I was raised on Ms. Buttersworth and other corn syrup w/ maple flavoring brands; in fact, I didn't try real maple syrup until about 6 months ago, and now I could never go back. I've tried a few brands including Highlands Sugarworks which was good and Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup which was not, yet none of them hold a candle to Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup.

review/summary: Dilute and runny
review/text: I like this Grade B product more than the Grade A product because of the stronger flavor.  Being organic, it is quite expensive.  My husband was shocked when he saw the size of the small jug.  Nonetheless, I am hoping my children are protected as much as possible from all the chemicals out there, though the degree of protection will be limited by the amount of chemical leachables from the plastic bottle.  I was disappointed that the packaging is not glass.  The product itself is very runny.  I am starting to believe that this is just the way natural syrup is.

review/summary: Robust, clean taste
review/text: This is a very good grade B maple syrup, with a deep, layered flavor and a good sweetness level.<br /><br />Contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, "organic" does not necessarily mean only that the farmer added nothing; "organic" means (according to Wikipedia, and others) that the syrups are produced using methods that do not involve modern synthetic inputs such as synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  If you have an organic farm, it means that there are no pesticides or chemical fertilizers used on the farm.<br /><br />I've tried other Grade B maple syrups (Highland, Trader Joe, plus another I can't remember the name of), and Coombs is at or near the top of the pack.<br /><br />A very good product.

review/summary: Deep, Rich Flavor and Family Owned Maple Farm
review/text: I love this maple syrup because it has a deep, rich flavor very wholesome tasting. How can people eat the artificial maple stuff from supermarkets?  There is no comparison between 100% maple syrup and the junk sold in supermarkets full of high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, additives.<br /><br />I have purchased it at natural food stores in the smaller 8 oz glass bottle, didn't note any difference in taste from the plastic jug - this is a terrific price since the 8 oz glass bottle sells for $9.00 which would work out to $36.00 compared to the big jug Subscribe and Save price you save a couple of dollars to purchase it in bulk.  Since 100% natural maple syrup has such a long shelf life it is a good deal.<br /><br />My favorite snack is fresh cranberries, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg and cook it with rolled oats - drizzle Coombs Family Farm maple syrup in it - yummy - especially in the winter for breakfast.<br /><br />A post was written by a person who grew up on a New England maple syrup farm and said there is no difference between organic and non-organic maple syrup but I know I've seen non-organic maple syrup with additives like brown sugar, artifical additives, artificial flavors.

review/summary: I absolutely love this syrup -- and that other too.
review/text: I'm no maple syrup expert but I've been using maple syrup grade B for a number of years and I absolutely love the Coombs Family Farms one. It's thick, rich and complex. I like it with yogurt, pancakes, fruit, lemonade, in cooking, and even by the shot. However, after reading about maple country and maple syrup culture, I toyed with the romantic idea of buying directly from maple syrup makers. I recently was able to do that. I ordered a gallon of maple syrup grade B from Bear Mountain Vermont Maple (that's the place I chose after some research). Their sugar bush is in a remote mountain that borders Quebec and has never been farmed. Although the syrup is not certified organic, no pesticides or insecticides are used anywhere in the area. These are really nice, honest people and it was a great experience ordering from them. The syrup is great. And the price is good too: 1 gallon is $60 (including shipping) and is shipped in two half-gallon BPA-free containers that have an oxygen barrier coating on the outside to help the syrup stay fresh longer. The service was fast too. I got the shipment just 4 days after I placed my order (I live in Northern California). So yes, I'm really satisfied. I am not ready to say that I prefer this syrup to Coombs Family Farms'. They're both really good in my opinion. But ordering from Bear Mountain was more like getting my produce from a farmer's market kind of experience for me.

review/text: This is one of our favorite syrups. It has a soothing rich flavor and is great on pancakes. Organic is a must for us. The price seems to be lower than its competitors.

review/text: My wife and I love this stuff. It's become such an indispensable part of our grocery list that we get auto-shipments now. There's nothing like real maple syrup, especially when it's organic, and this stuff is the best I've had yet. It's really that good!

review/summary: Good Maple Syrup
review/text: I am into maple syrup.  I can tell the difference in different grades of syrup.  I love the sweet taste of this syrup.  Some syrups are very thin like water.  This is not, it has a nice consistency to it, but not thick.  I put syrup on everything.  I add syrup to my oatmeal, my tea, my homemade salad dressings.  I use this instead of sugar.  I would recommend this to anyone the flavor is great.  Don't hesitate to buy it.
