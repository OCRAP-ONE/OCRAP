review/text: Got my first order of these last week and have ordered four more for friends who keep raving about them! I usually buy these sort of chips at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods but the price and convenience of ordering from Amazon can't be beat. These chips have a great flavor to them and arrived in perfect condition. I love blue corn chips and these are among the best I have ever had. You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Good taste, but not perfect
review/text: Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

review/text: OK, so before we opted to purchase these from Amazon, my whole family was a fan of these chips and if you never tried them you have too. They are absolutely delicious, spiced up just right, perfect in taco salad, with salsa or just fine all alone (and it helps if your alone too because when sharing these chips are addictive!)<br />But I HAVE TO SAY that these chips purchased through amazon were the best NO EXAGGERATION, that I have had. I thought it was just me but then my husband was like "i dunno what it is but those chips are GOOODDD!!" They were fresh, so fresh and this size bags makes it better for snacking/sharing as opposed to the larger bags from the store.<br />Stop reading and order these, your family will thank u :-D

review/summary: My Favorite Torilla Chips
review/text: I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.

review/summary: Yuck-a-moldy
review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

review/summary: Great chips, but...
review/text: I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation.

I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these.  My children one which likes spicy and one which doesn't (third is too young for this kind of food) love these.  They are great straight out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or bowl of chili.<br /><br />I initially found these in our local PCC and Whole Foods.  I'm glad Amazon carries them.  Price wise I'm saving at least $1.00/bag by buying through Amazon instead of from my grocery.

The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed. Try these baked chips. If you have taste buds,they'll be happy.

review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!

review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/summary: The BAKED version of these chips is misleading and non-tasty
review/text: Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits. It's just not what I expected/wanted, and won't buy again.

review/summary: A rare low-salt chip
review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

review/summary: a little too salty for my tastes....but....
review/text: I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

review/summary: Great taste...very poor packaging
review/text: These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

review/text: I've been a subscriber to the Blue Chips with no salt added for about a year now and love them. These chips are great for nachos or with good salsa, and probably other things I haven't tried. Now that I've been eating them without salt for so long, eating salted chips is like an overload. You'll get used to it and appreciate the health benefits.<br /><br />I only wish they were cheaper and came in bigger bags!<br /><br />My mouth is watering now...

review/summary: not correc size
review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

review/summary: Very  old stock
review/text: I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product. Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: ! WARNING !  Not for those who can't handle the heat!
review/text: * SAFETY INFORMATION<br />! WARNING! Risk of death, severe injury, chemical reactions.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />DO NOT even think of attempting to try a product this hot without being fully prepared. Acclimate yourself over a period of months to truly hot food substances. Keep antidotes on hand such as peanut butter, vodka, ice cream, etc. If the burning sensation is over-powering, place an antidote in your mouth and swirl it around for several minutes. Repeat as necessary. Contact a medical professional for help as needed.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />* OVERALL REACTION<br />All right, with the Safety info out of the way, I will now delve into the really good news:<br />Woo-hoo! This stuff is HOT! Spicy, yes, indeed -- and GREAT!<br /><br />From time to time I buy Blair's products whenever I see them in a store and now we are blessed to be able to pick them up on the Internet and right here at Amazon, too.<br /><br />This Death Rain Nitro powder is killer! Aaaaaahhh! HELP! Call 9-1-1 and look out! PLEASE please Please PLEASE do NOT attempt to sample any Dath Rain Nitro unless you are a 100% certified psycho Hot Head and can take the Scoville Units way, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy up there my friend. YES!<br /><br />If so, then take just a little bit, maybe three or four speckles of the powder, and try it on something. I just now sprinkled some on a spoon of chili that I made last night and after a few seconds, WHOAH! Tremors. Spasms. Internal tsunamis of flavor, shock, heat waves . . . now I am perspiring . . . but lovin' it! Wooooooooooooooooo! Woo-hoo!<br /><br />At first, you may not notice anything and think, "Hmm. This stuff isn't so hot."<br /><br />Then, the delayed fuse reaction takes affect . . . and keeps on burning, and burning, and BURNING! Aaaaaahhhh!<br /><br />Ten to fifteen minutes after ingestion, the heat and your own body's reaction will reach an apex so please hang in there, be patient, wait for the results, then consider the full effect, flavor, heat, power, and other attributes of Blair's Death Rain Nitro powder seasoning.<br /><br />Try a little, wait a lot. This is for your own safety, ok, thanks. Wait maybe . . . five to ten minutes. Then decide what Blair's Death Rain Nitro means to you in terms of physiological as well as flavorful terms.<br /><br />* NO PAIN, NO GAIN<br />You know why the hot, spicy stuff is so fabulous: the reaction to the PAIN inflicted by the whacky hydroxides from the crazy end of the pH spectrum generate endorphins as a protective response. In turn, the endorphins give us that RUSH that we so enjoy and we feel good, great, even exuberant as we pile on the spicy materials, in search of a further quest for a new high. The more we're used to the Scoville Units, the more we need to get that rush. Fortunately, no one has to worry about illegal drugs, shared needles, and all that other nonsense.<br /><br />* FLAVOR CRYSTALS<br />There is a hint of that delicious, fruity haba&ntilde;ero in there . . . but mostly, the Nitro Death Rain Seasoning has HEAT. I wouldn't want to fool ya', I wouldn't want to mislead ya' -- take heed -- this is not a food substance to play around with. It is SERIOUS stuff.<br /><br />The ingredients list is corn syrup, natural pepper flavor (contains soybean oil), haba&ntilde;ero powder, ancho powder, and spices.<br /><br />* THE SPICE MYSTERY<br />OK, will somebody PLEASE share with us what the mystery ingredient of "spices" really are? Don't you just LOVE wondering what "spices" could be? What is that, Blair's, come clean here. Spices could be anything in the spice rack; anything in the spice aisle at the store; anything as defined by law such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory guidelines allow. WE WANT ANSWERS! Tell us what "spices" are, or we're comin' for ya!<br /><br />* FINAL ANALYSIS<br />I highly recommned this product for you or for any friends and family members who are bona fide Hot Heads.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Yours in Scoville Units,<br />  --Dennis J.

review/summary: Spicy!
review/text: Love spicy spicy spicy hot sauce? Want something that is more portable than a glass bottle and easier to distribute evenly on food than a liquid? Here's your answer!<br /><br />This is probably (my perception) as spicy as the Blair's liquid version. I usually tend to eat hot sauce on solid foods (eggs, rice, etc) rather than liquid foods (soups, chilis, etc), so a powdered form is probably more useful for me than the liquid, which tends to bunch up in one bite and then your mouth hurts.<br /><br />Also, this is really really spicy. Really. Much more spicy than tabasco or any other "commercial" sauce you might get, so if tabasco is NOT spicy for you, this is probably up your alley. If tabasco is a spicy sauce (not a flavoring agent--b/c it is actually quite tasty in it's own right, just not super spicy) to your taste, this will probably overpower your taste buds.<br /><br />Use sparingly and build up the amount you use over time--what's spicy in is usually spicy out, if you know what I mean, so if you're not used to it, you'll be sorry!

review/summary: Incredibly dry heat for chiliheads!
review/text: This is by far the hottest dry seasoning I have ever had. Very good flavor too, it tastes like it's made with Red Savina. I use it for one of my homemade beef jerky recipes and it is extremely hot. Most people will not be able to handle this level of spice. A lot hotter than the regular Death Rain I would say. I love this stuff, but I don't think I would sell jerky with this spice because this stuff is for hardcore chili heads.

review/summary: Perfect Scoville Portability
review/text: I've been using this spice for years and love it.  The heat level lies somewhere between dried Habanero powder and dried Ghost Pepper powder.  It should be used with caution and you should definitely wash your hands if sprinkled upon.<br /><br />The best part of these bottles is that the glass is very thick and the plastic top is very strong and durable and most importantly air-tight.  They won't break easily and the powder does not leak out.  I carry one in the car and frequently one in my pocket whenever and wherever I want to add some heat to a dish, especially restaurant salsas.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the true chilehead.

review/summary: !!!!!!! YEAH !!!!!!
review/text: This is THE best hot seasoning out there.  It's super hot and at first all you may get out of it is hot, but if you're in it for pure heat then go with the 3am special reserve from blair (basically pure, slightly diluted capsaicin). However, this powder has a great flavor of its own as well as acting like MSG by exciting all the other flavors in your food - so power through the first few applications, let your system get used to it, then everything tastes way better because of it.  I use it on everything except sweets.  People will be insulted when you want to sprinkle on their homemade dish because they don't understand that it's not like normal hotsauce; just tell them that it's exactly like their salt and pepper but more-so.<br /><br />The best part is no matter how much hot you are used to, you can achieve a superior sharp burn without the acid reflux side-effects of super-hotsauce (pure capsaicin actually counteracts acid reflux and ulcer problems fyi) or the intestinal problems associated with non-extracted habanero or ghost chili powder.  Or you can just get some heat and flavor - whatever you're in the mood for, Nitro will abide.  Additionally, it's much harder to get hot-eyes with Nitro than with super-hotsauces because it's a powder and doesn't stay on your hands.<br /><br />non-chiliheads: I suggest you go with Blair's Death Rain Habanero - great flavor without as much heat (still hot though, it's about 1/4th as hot as Nitro by weight).<br /><br />caution: do not fry

review/text: I mixed about a teaspoon with some masa harina and put it on some chicken tonight.  The end result? Some fantastic tasting spicy chicken! Also, sprinkled a little onto my mashed potatoes, a food that hot sauce does not mix with.<br /><br />This has a great taste to it, hot and a little bit sweet too.  I did not find it to be too insanely hot myself, but it's hot enough where even a small amount will add a noticeable amount of kick to just about anything.  However, I am a hardcore chilehead and my threshold for hot is a lot different than say that of Tabasco's heat scale.

review/summary: Great alternative to hot sauce!  A must have for any Chilehead!
review/text: I am a hot sauce addict, I admit, but at times hot sauce just doesnt "apply" well to some foods. For instance, on pizza or pasta, if you dont mix it into the sauce, it can be a splotchy application... especially when you use sauces as hot as I do. With this, you dust this over the top and you've kicked it up several notches without an accidental glob under that pepperoni. This is also good to take to restaurants or work since it doesnt need to be refridgerated.  The heat level is perfect for me as well. I always keep a bottle of this handy!<br /><br />FYI, to amature chileheads:  if you eat too much or if its too hot to handle, just eat some butter on crackers.  I usually keep some Brummel and Brown and saltines handy if I think I may have added too much.  Yes, milk and other remidies can help, but this works best for me.  Just to comment on heat level, I dont think its quite as hot as others have mentioned (depending on how much you use), but I have been eating this stuff for a while, so proceed with caution just in case.  Enjoy the burn!

review/summary: Wow, the flavor is STRONG!
review/text: I purchased these energy shots to compare them with the 5 Hour Energy brand shots that I used to buy (I decided 5 Hour are too expensive). Red Rain Watermelon flavor is really strong and super sugary sweet! It's like drinking double or triple strength watermelon Jello. The flavor is shocking to me every time I drink one, even though I know what's coming up. But, like I've said before, it's a shot, you chug it down and you're done. So, if you find that you can bear the shockingly intense SWEET watermelon flavor, you might want to try these as they are offered at Amazon at a very good price for a pack of 12. The energy that you obtain from these shots is comparable to all other brands of energy shots that I have tried.  They get me through my early morning workouts and if I take one in the early afternoon I can stay pretty focused and sustain energy until around 8 p.m. I'll probably buy them again unless I find something that's priced even better.

review/summary: Affordable and Effective
review/text: Energy shots are everywhere.  My decisions are driven by value:  the bang for buck ratio.  I'm not a morning person, so caffeine is essential.  I also have a high pressure management job and concentration is also a key element.  In addition, I didn't want to pay more for a 2 ounce shot than I do for a 20 ounce caffeinated soda.  Red Rain works just as well as other shots, costs a buck a bottle (less if you subscribe) and tastes good.  Depending on your sweetness tolerance, it might taste too good, as another reviewer pointed out.<br /><br />Effects:  When it initially kicks in, I find it difficult to shut up.  Fortunately there's no one to talk to in the gym at 5AM.  Afterward, it keeps me alert for about 4 or 5 hours.  I don't crash and burn.  I don't feel the need for a nap.<br /><br />If you drink any caffeine drink, you'll quickly discover that caffeine is like any other drug:  your body will build up a tolerance.  Give them a rest on the weekends and holidays whenever you can.

review/text: A great energy shot for an unbeatable price. I love watermelon and was excited to find this. I don't care much for the 6 Hour Power watermelon flavor, it's a bit dull. Obviously flavor isn't a big deal when you can down it in one shot, however I use energy shots frequently so I love when I can enjoy the taste.<br />Red Rain has a superbly sweet watermelon flavor. It's sweetness is reminiscent of the Monster Energy Shots (which I also love). Red Rain has now become my new favorite. When compared to Monster it has less sugar (carbs) and less calories (Red Rain has 0), and it gives me the same amount of energy; all for less money.<br /><br />I recommend this to all Energy Fiends.

review/summary: Not for people who are accustomed to strong caffeine
review/text: I purchased these energy shots because they seemed to be an economical option to 5 Hour Energy. What I realized was that after comparing the effects and ingredients, Red Rain used much less of the variety of vitamin B's as well as less caffeine than the leading brand 5 Hour Energy. There's a reason why Red Rain is cheaper. If your body can function well with less caffeine, then Red rain is for you. However, if your body is "blunt" against caffeine and need a lot of extra ingredients like guarana and vitamin B12 + B6, then you should just stick to 5 Hour Energy.

review/text: I brought this to compare with 5-Hour energy. When comparing the labels i've realized this has only half of every ingredient then 5-hour energy, Such as Vitamin b6, 5-hour has 40mg so red rain has 20mg. I only drink half a bottle of 5-hr at a time so drinking 1 full bottle of red rain will be equal to 1/2 of 5hr. and obviously i'd have to drink 2 of the red rain to equal 1 5hr BUT it is still cheaper. FYI these are sold at K-Mart for $1 or if you buy the 2pk its $1.79 which comes out to $.90 a bottle! Just dont think i'd really want to drink 2 bottles to get the effect of 1 but i'll see how it goes, i've only drank 1 bottle thus far

review/text: Price is important to me.  When I discovered these little gems for about 1/3rd the price of 5 hour, I picked them up.<br /><br />1.  They do what they are designed to do, virtually duplicating the 5 hour formula<br /><br />2.  The taste is fine.  Covering up the taste of vitamins with flavoring produces a sweet tart combo, similar to 5 hour<br /><br />3.  No hangover, no jitters, and no blood pressure increase.  They last about 3 to 4 hours for me, the same as 5 hour<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are like me, and tired of paying $3 for a vitamin shot, you're in luck.  These will do fine, and they are cheaper than a diet soda.

I was shocked by how good it was. I didn't even need to add crackers. So with the empty bowl sitting here on my computer desk, while still smacking my lips, I'm ordering a case of them. I'd recommend buying one and trying it though, before you buy a case. I generally do my grocery shopping at PCC but amazon is cheaper on this one.<br />*** update, once the produce arrived ***<br />The case arrived and 6 out of the 12 cans were heavily dented. The box Amazon shipped it in was undamaged though, so the damage must have happened before it was packaged for shipment which means amazon sent me dented cans. I like to store a certain amount of food in case of a job loss or some other disaster but you can't store dented cans for that reason or you're asking for trouble. I had to put the dented cans in the kitchen so I could use them right away. Then I logged on and altered my review, dropping the rating from 5 to 4 stars.<br /><br />By the way, I'm not some kind of crazy survivalist, I just plan ahead a bit.<br />Disasters can be personal, local, regional, national, or global, but most are just personal disasters like a job loss. Disasters like that happen to everyone so it's just good common sense to be ready for them.

review/text: This is the BEST whole wheat pasta we've had, and trust me- we've tried most of them. Not only does it taste really great, it stands up to just about anything you subject it to- overcooking, baking with sauces, being sauteed in oil, refrigeration, etc.<br /><br />The bionaturae pastas all cook up lovely. And unlike other whole wheat pastas, there's no weird aftertaste or bitterness no matter how long you cook it for. No matter how al dente (or how tender) you like your pasta cooked, this pasta holds up to whatever you subject it to. We tend to like pasta more on the tender side, and the pasta retains its shape, doesn't disintegrate or get glue-y even after 12 minutes in boiling water. Holds on to sauces very nicely. Also refrigerates well after being mixed with sauces.<br /><br />My daughter, who is four years old and a SUPER picky eater, prefer this over her regular semolina pasta.<br /><br />The best part about this? This particular pasta shape boils up LARGE and fluffy and really fills your plate, so you can have a nice large bowl of pasta for not a lot of calories. I love the shape of the Gobbetti - spirals of noodles with ridges to grab cheese and sauce.<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I am shocked how delicious this whole wheat pasta is.  To me it tastes like regular pasta and not whole wheat. Therefore, I don't feel like I am losing anything in taste yet I'm gaining more in nutrition.  Cooks Illustrated reviewed this pasta as the best whole wheat pasta around and they were right. I will be ordering this from now on.

review/summary: OUR KIDS LOVE IT TOO
review/text: We love pasta in general (both white and whole wheat) and Bionaturae's whole wheat gobbetti in particular.<br />  The only problem was that the gobbetti was difficult to find where we now live, so I was really happy to see it on Amazon at a reasonable price.<br />It's got a slightly heartier feel after cooked than white pasta (white pasta feels just slightly smoother when chewed). The heartiness, as well as the twisty shape and surface ridges, of this pasta go particularly well with tomato-based meat sauces (like a bolognese) and also with bean or lentil sauces/stews.<br />Our kids enjoy this pasta, I think because of its twistiness. They sometimes want it with a little salted butter, and sometimes even plain, instead of the sauce so that they can eat it with their fingers.<br />All in all, this is a good-tasting way to get a whole grain food into our diet.

review/summary: Be healthy AND happy!
review/text: I always try to purchase the healthiest foods available for my family, buying organic and high fiber foods as often as possible. That's why I purchased a package of BioNaturae Organic 100% Whole Wheat Gobbetti. I prepared it last night for dinner and this pasta is a winner!! I know from experience that pasta cooked "al dente" is just too underdone to me, so I usually add an extra 60-90 seconds to the cooking time. Not only did this pasta stand proud and tall in the boiling water, but it also expanded beautifully... what was a small portion of dry pasta turned into an entire bowlful of fluffy goodness. And the taste was wonderful, especially when enveloped in my homemade organic pasta sauce! This is definitely the BEST whole wheat pasta I've ever eaten; many turn into a glutinous mess with a postage-stamp aftertaste, but not BioNaturae. This will now be my Go-To pasta brand.

review/summary: On the small side for $1.89
review/text: Unlike more popular pasta shells, I have never seen this shape go on sale.  They are always $1.89.  They are not very large so I use a mini scoop to fill them.  I omit the egg suggested in the recipe on the box.  Stuffed shells sold at my local pizzeria costs $7!

review/summary: Works AWESOME
review/text: I use 1/4 tsp in my cats wet food. I noticed a HUGE difference within days.  Not only did his coarse hair become super soft and shiny his tummy problem went away.  I bought this because I was at my wits end and spending money on vet bills was adding up.  So I thought I would just change his diet.  I went from commercial food to Evo & Natures Instinct canned and add this. I am so happy that I found something that works (he has was having problems using the bathroom and his feces would get stuck and then he would prolapse it would be so bad)  I am thankful that I found something that works for my little guy and I will keep using this everyday! Would highly recommend!

review/text: I've been giving The Missing Link Super Food Supplement to my cat 3 year old Kaya for over six months and coincidentally ever since, the tiny bumps on her ears that itched her and caused her fur to missing on the tips of her ears has COMPLETELY gone away.  She has never seemed healthier and last week at the vet, for her wellness check, the vet claimed she was in great condition for a cat her age.  The price is great from this vendor and I would definitely purchase again from them- I buy enough to keep a stock, so my supply is good for the next year.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Kitties Love It, Too!
review/text: My finicky felines both have dandruff despite being on high quality cat food.  The last time I tried an EFA supplement, purchased from the vet, I got loud "meows of protest" and kitties who wouldn't eat (not that a little restraint would hurt the 22 pounder).  They don't even seem to notice this product sprinkled into their food, or if they do they actually like the taste.  With this supplement and daily brushing, their dandruff seems to be getting better and their coats are shinier.  Since bathing with Head and Shoulders isn't an option, there is nothing to lose and everything to gain.<br /><br />Also, I checked at Petco yesterday and the same product was selling for $15.99.  Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />Update as of 8/14/12.  Cats have been on this supplement for about a month now and there is a huge improvement in their coats.  No more dandruff at all and they are so shiny!  Also seem to shed less when I brush them (a daily activity). The only downside, if it is one, is that this product does make their breath a little more "fishy". My cats eat only dry Iams so they don't have terrible breath to start with.  I can live with that for the results.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I have had Monkey, my kitty since he was 2 days old. When I first got him and his 4 siblings, they struggled with diarrhea. NOTHING seemed to work. Pumpkin mixed in the formula helped somewhat but they were still having loose stool. I started adding a tiny bit of Missing Link to their formula (I had originally bought it for another cat I owned at the time who had stomach issues and a dry coat, so I had it on hand) and it worked wonders! Their stool firmed up, their little butts weren't irritated anymore, and their coats looked nicer within a week. The feed store I had been buying it at for a really great price quit selling it, so I quit giving it to Monkey. He didn't seem to "need" it anymore. Well, he's 2 now, and recently he's been having some serious gas and loose stool issues again. He's on a really great food and has no other problems, but I decided to give the Missing Link stuff a go again, and just bought it at Petco and paid about 8 bucks more than I had at the feed store. But it was worth it! I also bought another supplement called Fresh Digest, which is mostly plant enzymes and prebiotics, and between the two of them, Monkey is no longer a stinky kitty. Plus, his coat is even shinier and softer than it was before! (And people were already jokingly asking if he was part rabbit before, he was that soft) And the shedding has been cut down drastically too. I would definitely recommend this product! I mix a heaping baby spoon full (about 1/2tsp) with 1/4 tsp of Fresh Digest, and mix those with his wet food and he eats it no problem. The taste seems to appeal to him. I haven't tried mixing it with his dry food though.

review/summary: Superb
review/text: Products like this are hard to find, so if you've stumbled upon The Missing Link just go ahead and buy it. The product - which is basically a course powder of whole foods & nutrients - goes right into your cats wet or dry food & tho cats are notoriously picky...my cats & the cats other reviewers have mentioned really do seem to either not mind it, or just plain old enjoy the taste.<br /><br />I bought The Missing Link not for an unhealthy stray or sickly cat - but simply for our two family cats. I try & buy fairly wholesome food for them, but even the most "wholesome" foods from the big manufacturers aren't anything to write home about health-wise. Thats why i was looking for a supplement...and i found one. This product really did change both of our cats coats. They're radiant, and silky - and to be honest they both seem generally healthier. Perhaps thats because they LOOK it, but Sam - our big black & white boy - has stopped a strange coughing & wheezing that was all too common with him. If you're semi-obsessive about your cats health or are a person nursing any cat back to health, or simply get ENJOYMENT from seeing your cat shiny & happy - this is the way to go. Same goes for dogs with the dog formula. Kudos to Missing Link, love the product.

review/summary: Great for Picky Cats + digestion/hairballs
review/text: I have an extremely picky cat.  She has ALWAYS suffered from hairballs/digestion issues and rarely ate wet food---if she did, she would vomit immediately.  I have tried lots of gels, supplements, and other products so I decided to give the missing link a try. I AM SO GLAD I DID, SHE LOVES IT! Not only does she like it, she begs for it, and for the first time in her life, my cat eats and digests wet food! I just sprinkle a teaspoon in with her wet food and she gobbles it upI have seen no hairballs since starting this, she seems to have more energy, and her fur is looking great.  I am a believer in this stuff! So far, GREAT and I am highly impressed...this is truly "the missing link" my cat needed!
