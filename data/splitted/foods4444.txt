review/summary: They changed somehow
review/text: If you grew up eating these in the 1980s and so on, you're likely to notice a change in the quality during the past few years.  My family and I noticed these changes:<br /><br />The cookies that had currants in them no longer have the currants.  If they do, they are so miniscule that you can't see them or taste them when you eat the cookie.  When I was little, I thought they were mini chocolate chips.  But they are gone now.<br /><br />The cookies usually appear to be over-baked.  Not necessarily dark, but too hard.  They used to have a delicate, light crispness to them, with a tender butter cookie feel in your mouth.  Not anymore.<br /><br />The flavor is a little different.  They are not as pleasant and sublime as before.  Just average store cookies now.<br /><br />We loved buying these cookies, but have since stopped purchasing them because we miss the originals.

review/summary: java podz
review/text: We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods. I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee. However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup. After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button. This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers. It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great. Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time

review/text: The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar.<br /><br />Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffee<br /><br />We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com

review/summary: Mais non, monsieur
review/text: If you showed this product to any person associated with a French restaurant, they would say that it was not lobster bisque. But on the can it does say, "New England Style." Who am I to say that this soup is not representative of the way a Yankee would make lobster bisque.<br />As promised, it is ready straight from the can for heating. I found that some cream improved it. The little strands of meat or was it veins from celery stalks, felt fibrous. Was it that meat in the lobster body that is not very good? They're too nondescript to pin down.<br />The soup base has a taste that is reminiscent of oyster stew. While I recommend adding shrimp to this company's lobster chowder, I think a few oysters put in at the last minute might make this bisque worthwhile.<br />My next order will be for this brand's chowder instead of the bisque. I think you will agree, that's the way to go.

review/summary: My cat loves Tuna too cool
review/text: I have a 15 year old cat. He has been a finicky eater all his life but has gotten a lot worse in the last few years. When I could get him to eat, he would eat a few bites then quit and never touch the food until I put out fresh food. Then the same routine.<br /><br />When I received the Tuna Too Cool I didn't expect him to eat it, boy was I surprised. I gave him 1/4 of the can first and he ate it all then licked the bowl clean. I had NEVER seen him do that before. I gave him another 1/4 can and he did the same thing. I didn't want to give him too much at one time so I put the rest of the can in the refrigerator and I waited 3-4 hours. He laid down next to the bowl the whole time. Then I gave him the rest of the can and he ate it all and licked the bowl clean.<br /><br />I'll be ordering this again and trying the other flavors from Best Feline Friend. It will be my cats only food in the future.

review/summary: IMO - Best Risotto outside of Europe!
review/text: While traveling through Europe, we stayed at a lovely bed and breakfast in the Swiss Alps. One evening, the owners of the inn prepared a dinner for the guests that included lemon chicken and parmisan risotto. While the chicken was delicious, I fell in love with the creamy yet meaty texture and delicate flavor of the risotto, a perfect accompaniment, and attempted without success to duplicate this dish at home. Recently we began switching to organic and natural foods, and made our first box of Lundberg Organic Parmisan Risotto. I was taken back to that lovely inn with the first delectible bite! I was so amazed that the rich flavor and texture of a homecooked dish could come from a box! This risotto is ideal with so many main courses - chicken, fish, Italian meat dishes - and can also be the foundation of a hearty vegan dish with added vegetables and nuts. I'm impressed with all of the healthy Lundberg products and recommend them without reservation, but this Parmisan risotto remains our family favorite!

I don't doubt he or she got ill, but the timing I believe was the culprit, and the risotto simply got blamed for whatever actually made he or she ill. It is definitely gluten free. I also have celiac disease and had no problem at all.<br /><br />I prepared this on the stove top in a saute/fry pan with olive oil. I actually added some white chicken breast & made it a "one pot meal". It was absolutely delicious! It was very easy to prepare and tasted like something I worked hard to make! I am very happy with this product. It will become a staple in my pantry. :)

review/text: This is as good as any risotto I've ever made from scratch and is much less labor intensive.  I've had slightly better stuff in chi-chi restaurants and in the motherland (Italy)...but only SLIGHTLY better.  I always make it with a combination of 1/2 c. milk and 2 c. water, because it doesn't get nearly as creamy if you use only water.  I also add some dried herbs and shallots, and top it with freshly grated pecorino romano cheese.  Do this, and your family or guests will think you slaved for hours.<br /><br />My only criticism of the Lundberg risottos is that they're a bit too salty for my taste.  Still and all -- a great product!

review/summary: Not GF
review/text: Lundberg has a Gluten problem with their 'gluten free' food products.  WARNING:  they are NOT gluten free!!  My entire family got sick eating Lundberg rice and rice cakes----and this product---I should have sued!  The reps at Lundberg act all shocked about anyone complaining about gluten reactions in their products---but trust me---there is plenty of evidence all over the web of people reacting to their products.  They need to step up to the plate and come clean about where the gluten is coming from.  GF is NO fad diet----it is life or death for some of us.

review/summary: The Only One For Me!
review/text: I've been using Woeber's Horseradish Sauce for years and nothing else compares to it. Several years ago I purchased a bottle that was somewhat watery and I called the company. They couldn't have been more apologetic. Information was exchanged and a few days later I received 2 bottles of horseradish, a bottle of mustard and I think something else...don't recall.<br /><br />This past year Woeber's has disappeared from every store in the area.  I called the company again to find the nearest location to purchase the product and was told that unfortunately it was approximately 90 miles away!  The representative said she would see why the stores that I had purchased them in are no longer carrying it.  In the meantime she offered to send me two bottle at no charge.  Talk about customer service...you rarely see that anymore.<br /><br />Well, I've used the two bottles and it's still not available in my area.  I'm ordering a case from Amazon...seems to be a good price...I'd pay even more if I had to.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!

review/summary: Best Horseradish sauce ever!
review/text: I've just recently started using horseradish sauce in my sandwiches, and after trying another brand that was very strong and hot (Beaver), I tried this sauce and fell in love!  This sauce is very mild and sweet, but there is plenty of horseradich flavor to go around.  I can only find this brand at one of the grocery stores in my neighborhood, but not the store I usually use, so I decided to buy a six-pack online, at a very good discount over retail.  For my tastes, this is just a perfect Horseradish Sauce, and I will never change.

review/text: Woeber's Sandwich Pal horseradish sauce is bar none the finest I've tried and I've been faithful to this brand for quite a few years now. This sauce is a great alternative/addition to mayonnaise with a spicy kick and works like a dream for making spicy Sushi.<br /><br />At only 20 calories and 1.5 grams of fat per teaspoon, this is also an excellent way to punch up the flavor of whatever you use it on while cutting back on fat and calories. I wish I could buy this stuff by the gallon tub.

review/text: I've always liked this milk chocolate and caramel candy called Milk Duds, but I mostly eat them when at the movie theater.  Milk Duds will last a while because the caramel takes a while to chew.  Even a small box of these things will get you through a two hour movie.  These duds really help pass the time, especially when you're watching a dud movie (no pun intended).<br /><br />What else can I say?  A classic candy from Hershey's that lasts longer than your average candy out there.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Not Stage 3 Quality. Very thin
review/text: I use jar foods when I am on the go or if I did not have time to leave the babysitter food. I made a majority of my twins food from scratch using the baby bullet, a chopper or just by mashing it. Now that my twins are 11months they have been eating table food. I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste. However, I would not have purchased if I knew it would be so thin.

review/summary: Disgusting! :(
review/text: I bought this for my baby (since she didn't have teeth at the time) thinking that it would be a good source of iron. Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option.

Remember, like any food product, the liquid separates sometimes and you just have to stir the food.  No big deal.  Problem solved.  If you still have an issue with it, I would recommend adding a few drops of water or formula to the food. Then stir again.

review/summary: Baby doesn't like it.
review/text: I love Earth's Best products (except their diapers, they are very hard and stiff and seem uncomfortable for my baby) and this isn't an exception. Baby doesn't really like it but we keep trying because babies tastes change. I only buy Earth's best babyfood and the thick consistency is much better than Gerber's stage 3 veggies.

review/summary: My K-Cup Coffee!
review/text: I've had this coffee many times before (purchased at a grocery store), but recently my MIL bought us a Keurig Coffee machine.  My husband and I quickly realized we couldn't afford to keep buying those tasty little K-Cups - so we decided to get a My K-Cup, but splurge on good coffee.<br /><br />We found FogLifter to be a good replacement of our Tully's French Roast K-Cup. We just put two TBS in the My K-Cup & brew two small cups with one pod.  The coffee tastes excellent & I don't feel so guilty for buying because I drink my entire cup (instead of wasting half a pot via a drip machine).<br /><br />If you purchase via subscribe & save, it makes this coffee even more afordable.  I highly recommend this flavor - even when used in a K-Cup.

The package arrived early and cost efficent which is why it gets 5+ stars.

Highly flavorful with a velvety smoothness and excellent after-taste. Beats other top shelf Rums I've had hands down. A great Rum to be be savored with fine food and friends (but also can't be beat alone after a hard day!). I recommend drinking neat with a splash of water in an open cocktail glass or brandy snifter.

review/text: These are great, fresh, and just as I remember them.  I knew how many I was getting when I ordered them but the price is just too high, no matter what.  You've got to lose two stars for the price.  It was worth it once, because I wanted to have them again after so many years and can't get them many places around here but won't likely buy again for the price/quantity.

review/summary: Coffee that deserves an exclusive label
review/text: We started purchasing Eight O'clock Coffee about ten years ago when we saw it in our local grocery story.  We like the whole beans and also the decaf.  My husband and I have decided that it is probably the most under-rated coffee ever.  It is rich, flavorful, and exciting.  The flavor is distinct and original.  It is not Starbucks, but it is far better and much less expensive.  We have found Eight O'clock Coffee to be consistantly fresh ,and the aroma while is is brewing, literally defines comfort and contentment.  I can run around with a steaming cup in the morning and feel confident that my day is going to be just perfect. I conclude by saying that this coffee will steal you away from other much more expensive brands and you will be an Eight O'clock convert for life.
