review/summary: Best  Blueberries
review/text: I have been buying Oregon brand canned fruit for years and I believe it is the best quality canned fruit available.<br /><br />I am so pleased that Amazon has decided to carry the entire Oregon line of products as most local grocery stores only have four or five.<br /><br />We are retired in Florida and to be able to get great tasting fruit from the Northwest at a reasonable price and free shipping ($25.00 minimum policy) is just a great bonus.

review/summary: Too much sugar??
review/text: I am used to buying canned veggies that have been cooked to a mush, with too much salt. Why blueberries cooked down with too much sugar??  Isn't it possible to cook them less, and leave out most of the sugar? However, it's nice to have a can or two handy for desserts.  I now have been buying frozen vegetables and frozen berries under the "Surefine" brand at my local IGA market. It's a great difference  in taste and texture.  BL

Of course he tries to put less suger in it so I buy the blue berries in their own juice and thicken it myself and use less sugar. I also do this with the canned cherries in their own juice for my husband as he perfers cherry pies. Amazon is one of the only places that I found I can get both these items so quickly and at a great price rather than just buying a can at the grocery.<br />Lpunky

review/summary: Fantastic Taste; Haven't Died Yet
review/text: Wow, I don't know what to say about the "bad idea" review, and it's interesting because the company actually claims the lava salt has positive health effects. For what it's worth, we haven't noticed any change in our health, good or bad, since using this product.<br /><br />About six months ago a friend gave us some Palm Island Salts (black, red and green) as a housewarming gift and we really love them all. He works in one of those hippie/dippy health/organic foods stores down near Santa Cruz, owned by some very health-conscious people. I'm a meat-lovin' (grass-fed only), organic-produce-eatin' moderate, and it's the taste that causes me to buy this salt and the organic produce I eat, not the health claims.<br /><br />It's true this salt has activated charcoal as the third ingredient, behind "Natural Pacific Sea Salt" and "Premium Hawaiian Sea Salt," and ahead of "Hawaii Kai Ocean Essence," a trademarked blend of "ocean electrolytes, trace minerals, and elements." Sounds like health-nut market-speak to me, but it sure tastes good!<br /><br />Our favorite is the black, which is just amazing, but the red is a close 2nd. It's incredible what a difference it makes in the food we cook, compared to other sea salts we use, and all our guests take notice when I use it! We like the green too, but don't use it much. We still use Redmond Sea Salt for day-to-day cooking, and it's very good too, but whenever we want to add something special, we add the black or the red.<br /><br />We use it very sparingly, as it is quite strong in flavor. A single 6-ounce pouch is only half-empty after 6 months, so a little goes a long way. We actually use the red a little more, as it is nearly as good in taste and much better in appearance.<br /><br />Not that I doubt the above reviewer about the danger of activated charcoal, but it seems a safe product to me just judging from personal experience, and it is put out by a company that actually seems to have a conscience. You can check out their website at [...]<br /><br />If you have concerns about the charcoal, try the red!

review/text: I first used this while spending my Summer in Maui.  The salt itself has a bit of a peppery taste and its a perfect topping/garnish on a dish.  Not really for use while cooking as the black melts into the food.  But as a topping to lets say... a bowl of watermelon, or grilled fruit?  Oh my god! Its amazing.  It adds a dash of surprising flavor and a visual touch as well.

review/text: So this is sea salt, with added activated charcoal.<br /><br />Now I have nothing against activated charcoal -- it is indeed a miracle product and one of the few 'medicines' I have in the house.<br /><br />But, it will leach minerals and nutrients from what ever it is added to.  That is why it is part of the 'universal antidote'. (google this for more info).<br /><br />So, I use it topically for poisons  (insect bites ) and internally for some sicknesses, but never as part of my daily diet.<br /><br />This could be a poster product for the 'style over substance' culture...

review/summary: Excellent flavor and  easy to use!
review/text: I love these convenient boxes of sushi wraps, so I was eager to try the brown sprouted rice after eating the white rice ones the last couple of years.  The brown rice did not disappoint!  I actually buy these for my 6 year old who loves to make sushi rolls.  It's a great size for 2 kids and it's super easy to use since the rice is nice and sticky.  The only thing I don't like is reheating in the plastic container that it comes in, but we just take it out and place a moist towel over it and heat it that way.  The flavor of the nori is excellent as well and the kids beg to eat it all of the time.  These are not carried at our local Whole Foods so I buy them by the case here on amazon so we are never without.

review/summary: Another Hit from Annie Chun
review/text: I've eaten the white rice ones for a while. When I saw the brown rice, I thought I'd give it a try. Once I stuff it with my ingredients, I really can't tell a difference in the rice. I just bought a new tool that makes these sushi kits even better. It is called "Sushezi Sushi Made Easy" found here on Amazon. I love the taste of Annie Chun's Nori and soy sauce, that come in these kits. If you lay all the rectangles of nori into a pattern, they make one full sheet of nori. The Sushezi makes a compressed round roll of sushi. When you push it out onto the arranged nori rectangles (better if you overlap them just a bit) you just roll them onto the sushi roll.  It takes all the rice, all the nori, and a fair bit of sushi ingredients to make one roll. I like to use smoked salmon with cream cheese and avocado; or imitation crab meat, cucumber, carrot, and avocado; or the best yet was some fried soft shell crab, with cucumber, and a spicy mayo sauce.

review/text: I've been buying organic green beans that I like immensely for their crispness and flavor. However, I was tempted by the discounted special price offered for these. I regret my penny pinching purchase! Right from the can these are limp and overcooked. So these soggy beans will not be purchased again.

review/summary: Bringing Zingy To an All New Level
review/text: My first impression is not the initial taste on the tip of my tongue as first expected, but the powerful, almost peppery taste at the back of my throat as I sip this one down. On the second sipping, more on the tip of my tongue this time, the tea's more subtle qualities come through: the mellow side of the lemon and ginger combination--then wham again with the peppery snap at the back of my throat. This is no mildly flavored herbal, but one directly infused with ginger root, lemon peel, lemon grass and blackberry leaves. One other interesting ingredient is linden, a plant with many medicinal properties and used for such for many centuries. It would be interesting to know if it is the linden flower that is used (and most probably it was), since this is a diaphoretic, a very mild fever-inducing part of the plant when taken as a hot tea. This naturally enables the body to help fight off infections according to some sources I looked up on the web. Not to worry though--this is not a fever that will keep you from work! It's one that will make your body work for you instead.<br /><br />I bought this one for some relief from a sore throat and it definitely helps ease my sinus induced problem. As with any lemon-flavored beverage I've tried, it does leave a slight aftertaste of lemon, but not too strong or unpleasant. I imagine it would be quite good with honey, which I will definitely try once I get home from work. For now, a slight bit of sugar seemed to compliment the flavors nicely, even bringing them out more. This is a strong flavored herbal, not a mellow one as I've come to expect a lot of herbals to be. Drink with caution if you like your herbals on the softer side. This one's courting the wilder side of the tea experience.

review/text: I was told in a natural cures for health issues & it told me that Ginger to helps to calm the pain of arthritis. Tryed other products but was unable to get just Ginger Tea. We looked at all the stores near us in Utah but could not find just Ginger tea, we were able to find this brand of tea down in Southern California while on vacation. My husband & I both drink this tea. I have also shared this information with 2 other people that I work with that suffer from arthritis pain. We are all agree that this is the best thing for us.

review/text: I love ginger, and I love lemon. This tea is a perfect combination of both. It easily makes two cups, the second not as strong but still a good way to drink fluids. If you aren't interested in reusing, try empting the tea bag into the water. The resulting tea is much stronger, for some odd reason. But they you have to worry about chewing pieces of ginger and lemon, which doesn't bother me. It really is the best I've tried. Others are weak and kind of pathetic compared to this.

review/summary: Lentils w/Onion & Bay Leaf, all Organic. YUM!! Soy? Ugh.
review/text: This is one of the most heartful, hearty presentations of a healing comfort food I can imagine eating [definitely slurping with glee]... though I have one issue with it which won't immediately bother others as it unfortunately will me. I'll attempt to explain...<br /><br />My Aunt Mary's homemade lentil soup, saged and simmered with near religious grace at the opening of each new year, was beyond description, so when I saw this canned soup my soul drooled in thanks!<br /><br />Reading the ingredients noted on the buying page, I was thrilled that the soup was composed not only of organic lentils, but with a list of organic ingredients which to me, well versed in herbs for heavy healing as well as high flavor, read like a literal Godsend for my needs for delicious sustenance. Even the label reeked with super yummy culinary art. I couldn't wait to get my hands [and taste buds] on that concoction.<br /><br />The unfortunate part for me is that when the can arrived in good time and condition, and was in hand; I read the ingredients. Indeed each on the list was certified organic. That to me means no GMO's, no genetic modification of any type, nor excess additives are involved within the product. The unfortunate part for me was that "organic" soy was included as one of the beans in the soup.<br /><br />I need to stay away from any type of soy, as much as possible, and I honestly have a hard time believing that any type of soy these days could be called organic, especially in the sense of having no GMO or genetic modification. But, even if there is such a thing as a truly organic soybean, I would still be compromised by other aspects of that seed's purpose, which, according to some scientists, was not intended to be a human food.<br /><br />If you want to background on this, feel free to read THE DARK SIDE OF CINDERELLA by Dr.s Mary Enig and Sally Fallon. That article can be read on Dr. Mercola's web site.<br /><br />A larger part of this "Why NO SOY for me" is that I've had a magnesium deficiency and liver debilitation for most (if not all) of my life. That deficiency and debilitation means that I am much more vulnerable... [having shown symptoms earlier and and with more serious and varied consequences which are not only severely painful but life threatening and accelerating of aging ailments]... than the general population would be, to the toxic and mineral blocking facets of soy, along with its estrogen effect being forced into overdose, due to the predominance of soy products [included as ingredients in other foods] having been pushed into the food marketplace so many ways since the 60's [see above article for background].<br /><br />Even if not for the health difficulties I've suffered from soy products being included in so many foods for decades [I'll turn 63 this year] through various ways; I can't stand the taste or smell of soy, except in fermented soy sauce, or except when it is dramatically masked or enhanced.<br /><br />This won't be an issue to those who believe soy is a healthy vegetable if produced by organic restrictions, or even if it's produced with GMO scientific enhancement. And the other ingredients and the caring way this product has been produced and presented would indeed be akin to God Food, IMO. That is why I'm giving this product a 5 star rating.<br /><br />For those who seek organic presentations and organic soy, this soup would indeed be a product of highest appeal.<br /><br />But I needed to include the warning about its soy presence, for those like me who might already be limited by soy related allergies, intolerances, or debilitations; or who would like to be informed on the buying page ingredients notations that soybeans are included in this otherwise richly luxurious soup.<br /><br />I wish there were someone young and healthy who likes soy to give the two cans I purchased with joyful anticipation.  I don't dare eat it, even though many foods I get at the grocery store and restaurants are impregnated with soy or cooked in soybean oil. So, what's one more soybean?<br /><br />The point is that I've been gradually building a stock of 100% certified organic, no soy foods, focusing these cautious purchases from a level of health and survival at risk. I would not have guessed that this type of soup would have added soybeans to its recipe.  It represents to me a food with an historic and near religious significance from a cultural soul-set which would have been inimical to adding soybeans to its long revered ingredients. [See the article noted above if you want to know what the ancient Orientals believed about the soybean seed; I would have been honored to eat their revered foods.]<br /><br />All the issues for me could be remedied if soybeans would have been disclosed on the buying page as an ingredient.<br /><br />Each of the other ingredients were listed. Why not mention the soy?<br /><br />What hurts me most is I was SO looking forward to slurping that soup! I honestly envy those who would be able to comfortably enjoy it as it is, with soy.<br /><br />With respect to those who believe soy is a true nutrient, I apologize and have no desire for your choice for soy products to be limited in the marketplace. Even if those who believe soy is potentially harmful with long-term input are wrong, I want the presence of this [IMO] toxic anti-nutrient to be clearly disclosed, especially since so few products in the marketplace are free of its presence.<br /><br />I'm still hungry for a truly organic soup precisely like this one, with NO soy of any kind, but thankful that I still have a yummy good supply of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PH0">Wolfgang Puck Organic Creamy Tomato Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PGG">Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Egg Noodles Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I have a growing stock, purchased from Amazon, of the type of organic presentations I need, and hope to be able to review those, but health issues are making my supply of reserves at low ebb indeed. Thankfully, many products available on Amazon are clearly marked for ingredients, so most of us can find what we want or need, by preference or necessity.<br /><br />Thank you very much, Amazon sellers who give a clear, full disclosure of ingredients,<br />Linda Shelnutt

review/summary: Good dog food/reasonable price - even the cats love it!
review/text: I switched my dog to the Iams Healthy Naturals chicken food about 2 months ago. Previously, she was eating Science Diet for the past 2 years. I didn't have any big issues with Science Diet, except for the fact that it was fairly expensive and I could only buy it at one of the local pet stores. Due to work schedules, it is sometimes difficult to get to a pet store while they were still open.<br />The reason I picked this Iams product is because the first few ingredients are actually meat, not wheat or rice, etc. I switched my dog over to the brand slowly, and she seems very happy with it. I realize there ARE better quality dog foods out there, such as the Blue Buffalo brands. However, the dog really didn't care for it, and the cat that did try to eat it had an allergic reaction, so we stopped buying it. That is more expensive - if our dog liked it more and we could keep the cat from getting into it we would have dealt with the cost, but it just doesn't work for us.<br />Our two cats LOVE the Iams dog food as well. We feed them Iams Proactive chicken flavor cat food, but when I fill the dog dish, they will run to it and try to eat as much as they can before the dog gets to it. I think it is a good product for a decent price.

review/text: I just bought a 29lb bag of this that was on sale for $15 just for a trial. I have four dogs including one with unkown food allergies/intolerances, an overweight beagle dog, and a nine year old senior. I have just been feeding straight gravy train canned food due to prior problems with other dry foods mixed with The Honest Kitchen food. The honest kitchen is Great but pricy for feeding four mouths and I go through six cans of gravy train per day so wanted to get them back on a dry food to cut down on costs. This is one of the few dryfood options that has meat ingredients which is why I've picked this.  It is by one of the well known petfood companies that I usually stay away from but with the quality of this food, I may sway towards iams for more of my pet needs. My dogs love this and I'm gradually transitioning them to it. It is readily available at my local WalMart so thats a plus and I know that my pups are getting the nutrition they deserve! FYI-Ive had problems with Taste of the Wild dry dogfood! It almost killed my dog, just a caution, don't be fooled by the great reviews and ingredients like I was! It made the dogs breath smell horrid as well as their waste and body odors too!

review/summary: Little Chocolate Bits of Heaven
review/text: These are excellent!  The raisins are plump & the chocolate is nice & sweet!  Chocolate covered raisins are by far one of my favorite treats since I was a teen.  Back then I was gobbling up Raisinets; I knew nothing about what the food companies do to our food.  When I got into my early 20's & discovered that just because it's allowed to be sold in stores as food doesn't mean it's safe or food for that matter!  That ended my chocolate covered raisin eating for many years.<br /><br />Later I found Wood Stock Farm Organic chocolate covered raisins.  They are good, but sometimes I would get bags that were not as good as the others.  On top of that they cost about $10 a bag.<br /><br />Now we have SunRidge Farms Organic Milk Chocolate Raisins & I have to say, they are simply the best I've had so far!  I am in heaven!  To add to my joy, they use ORGANIC Soy Lecithin.  I am so frustrated by USDA Certified Organic products (esp. chocolate) that continue to use non organic soy lecithin in their products.  GMO no thank you!<br /><br />The ingredients per the delicious bag I have right next to me: Organic Milk Chocolate (organic evaporated cane juice, organic milk powder, organic cocoa butter, organic unsweetened chocolate, organic soy lecithin[an emulsifier], organic vanilla), Organic Raisins, Pure Food<br /><br />I hear all the time how organic is too expensive.  I think having to go to the Dr. gets pretty expensive too.  I guess it's up to the individual how they want to spend their money...

review/text: I reviewed the non-organic version of these as 4 stars and said that it would have been 5 if the ingredients were organic.  I have since tried this organic version and am disappointed to say that I don't think they taste as good as the non-organic versions.  The chocolate is sweeter and less chocolaty.  The non organic version is just the right blend of sweet and bitter-sweet.  This version is just too sweet.  The raisins, while they may be organic, taste inferior.  They seem a little crunchy.  I don't know why.  Good organic Thompson raisins taste much better than the raisins in these.  I hope the manufacturers can improve these so they are BETTER tasting than the non-organic version, not worse.  Not worth the extra price.  On the other hand, if you like them sweet and less chocolaty, you'll like these.

review/text: Great Value! Same quantity (60 oz) of Bob's Red Mill toasted hazelnuts (on Amazon) is $20.00 higher! Plus, you can get the Amazon Subscribe & Save price on these! Keep them frozen up to a year and they are real easy to toast in the oven yourself. It's hard to find natural, raw hazelnuts, and Diamond brand is the highest quality. For baking, raw nuts are best so they don't get overcooked and bitter. Recommended.

review/summary: Almost Out Of Date
review/text: I was put on a waiting list when I purchased these nuts so when they arrived I was a little concerned about the expiration date of Sept 2012 on the bags.  After opening and chewing a couple I was really concerned about the freshness since they tasted a little dried out.  I called Diamond Nuts and inquired about how long nuts are good for after they're packaged.  I was told by their company rep that nuts are good for two years after packaging so that meant I was sent bags that were 1 year and 7 months old.  Now how do you get put on a waiting list for a product and then receive old , almost out of date product?  I'll tell you how, companies think if you're from West Virginia then you have an under 50 IQ and they can send out of date items, factory seconds and merchandise that had been in the recycle or junk bin straight to West Virginia and us dumb-ass hillbillies won't know the difference.  I have no problem with Amazon because they made it right by issuing me a refund.  A word to the wise, always check the expiration date on any thing you buy.

review/summary: The price is great but the nuts are stale.
review/text: I have been buying these nuts from Amazon for about a year now using the autoship and they have been hit or miss from the very beginning. One bag is fine and the next is stale, which means half of the 6 bags they ship out each month are bad. I've been continuing to buy them because the price is so good and they are loaded with lots of good fats. Also, I am allergic to almonds and this is a great alternative, but after buying some hazelnuts from a local store I realized just how much better they were compared to the Diamond ones here and have finally cancelled my subscription with Amazon and decided to just pay more for some fresh and much better tasting nuts. I don't know if its the brittle plastic packaging that Diamond uses or if the nuts are old to begin with but unfortunately I now have to pay almost double at the grocery store. I did use the nuts for baking and the slightly stale taste is definitely masked when you grind them up and put them in chocolate chip cookies or something similar but if you plan on eating these raw like I was doing on a regular basis then prepare yourself to be biting into quite a few stale ones and a few downright rancid ones in every bag.<br /><br />I also just want to mention that I also order the Planters pecan halves and they are delicious with never a stale nut in the package and Amazon has them at a great price too!!

review/summary: Perfect size package for making nut milk
review/text: 2 cups is the perfect size to yield 1 quart of hazelnut milk the way I make it. The nuts are smaller so I suppose that makes them filberts ... but 2-cups is 2 cups. The two I have used have been fresh and tasty so when we get down to 1 left, I'll order more.<br /><br />My recipe<br />2- cups hazelnuts<br />4-5 organic dates<br />4-5 cups of water (how thick do you like it whole or skim consistency)<br /><br />Blend on soup setting (not to where it's hot, just totally emulsified. Then strain through nut milk bag. Refrigerate and enjoy. Use left over "cheese" to make hazelnut cheese...our son loves it.<br /><br />Update (7/1/2011): I have since move to using Amazon's Subscribe and Save option and get a shipment of these once a month. Also we no longer use dates int he milk, just the nuts and 34oz of water.

review/text: My husband and I eat popcorn most nights.  Popcorn was on the core food list at Weight Watchers.  We'd rent a movie and have one flavor at a time with 2 tsp of olive oil, and non-stick spray to make the seasoning stick.  They make popcorn so much better.  We went from microwave, to original method in a pot, to a machine, to an air-popper.  Each time we used one of the flavors.  I love them.

The packet mixes with 1/4 c. oil, 2 tbsp water and 2tbsp vinegar to marinate 2 lbs of chicken, salmon or seafood. The variation (suggestion) to use the packet with 1/4 c. orange juice, 1/4 c. oil and 1 tbsp honey is absolutely as good if not better. That being said, the price at Wal**** is less than a dollar a packet, so unless you can't find this in your area, the current price is absurd.

review/text: So all I can tell about this coffee is that it was fairly fresh, makes a smooth, mild cup o' joe. Which has made the wimpier coffee fiends in the household happy, and while I do like this coffee, I really like a stronger bolder flavor.<br /><br />I have been having real problems getting fresh beans lately. The beans I have been buying at the stores available to me locally have been stale the last few times I purchased them. I guess my only recourse is to roast my own or buy directly from a roaster which might be more than my pocketbook can handle. At least the coffees I have been trying out here on Amazon have been much fresher and in some cases cheaper than what I can buy locally.

review/text: We drink a lot of coffee in our house, and we're fairly picky besides.  I'm constantly looking for good coffees that are less than $7 per pound.  This one on sale recently by Amazon ran $6.17 per pound with super saver shipping, so it was worth a try.  It is better than I expected, although at the suggested retail price of $10.50 per pound, I couldn't recommend it.  The coffee does live up to its claim about being a breakfast blend, medium in flavor, although some, including me, could wish that it was more full bodied.  Another plus factor is that this coffee will leave no aftertaste or acidic problems, which can be problems for heavy coffee drinkers.

review/summary: Long lasting, and safer in my experience.
review/text: My dogs, and many of my client's dogs, inhale regular rawhides.  I was always worried about them swallowing big chunks.<br /><br />And I really hate flavored plastic bones, as well as veggie bones, since I've seen chunks of those being swallowed whole right in front of me a number of times.<br /><br />These have been by far the best solution for me.  It takes the dogs much longer to chew them, and they really have to work at it.  For all my medium to heavy chewers, these are my first choice.<br /><br />Having said that, nothing is 100% safe.  After chewing up most of the bone, a very food motivated chewer could the remaining hard chunk - which could be a serious problem.  That's why I tend to choose the bigger sizes (8" or 10") over the little ones (4"), and take the bone away when it gets to a swallow-able size.  I buy these in bulk.  The value compared to other types of rawhides is huge, even without a bulk discount.<br /><br />These come in flavors also.  This plain style, as well as the the chicken flavored ones, have not been messy at all.  The beef ones are not quite as tidy.

Then it tells you to add the sauce (this doesn't taste anything like teriyaki sauce), and microwave it for 2 minutes.<br /><br />I followed the instructions, and when I opened the box, I got a clumped up noodle meal with poor taste.  I threw half of it away.  Out of all the microwave and frozen meals I eat, this one rates as one of my lowest.

review/summary: Actually pretty addicting
review/text: I'm not sure what the other reviewers were expecting out of this.  I've had a lot of microwavable noodles, and this is one of the better brands.  If you're looking for Americanised teriyaki chicken or something like that, you aren't going to get that here.  These are noodles with teriyaki sauce.  One of the things I like about Kame is that the noodles are pre-cooked.  They're stored in a moisture pouch with oil, so all you have to do is heat them up.<br /><br />Cooking tip: don't worry about seperating the noodles straight away.  Just remove them from the pouch, push them to the bottom, and pour the sauce over.  Then wait for it to be heated before stiring/seperating the noodles.  It makes it much easier.

review/summary: Waste of $12!! Disgusting!!!
review/text: I thought it would taste good considering the price and fancy box. I also figured it'd save me time and money on meals for work...WRONG! This is the worst! I don't think I've ever tasted anything this awful in my life. The noodles were difficult to even separate with a fork according to the instructions. Once that was finally done and I poured the dark brown goop "sauce" into the box and heated it up, the office stunk like spicy armpits! Even worse was the actual taste! The noodles were hard and rubbery and the sauce was really salty. I threw it away immediately!!! HORRIBLE!!!

review/summary: Not great, but good to keep in a desk drawer for a working lunch.
review/text: I bought a pack of the pad tai noodles, they have sat in my desk drawer for the last six months and I am finally on my last box.  By themselves, they are completely mediocre, throw a little Asian hot sauce on them and they are pretty good.  For the price they are a reasonable choice for a lunch substitute when you don't have time to run out of the office.

review/summary: If it ain't broke....please don't fix it!
review/text: Well, this is the biggest disappointment that I've had with a food product for quite some time.  The original Propel Kiwi-Strawberry powder was, to me, the best tasting water additive on the planet!  Finally, I was able to drink quarts of water without forcing myself to do so.  The powder dissolved easily in my 16 ounce water bottle and the flavor was just sweet enough.  I have a sweet tooth and this stuff was awesome!  But some dumb focus group participants decided that ten calories per packet were just too many calories to allow in their diets each day. Ten bottles adds up to only 100 calories! Really?  Did they only ask anorexics?  The new version clumps in my water and has a bitter after taste.  I have to add my own artificial sweetener to get it to taste like the old version. That's way too much trouble for something that's supposed to be easy.  I even called Gatorade and begged them to bring back the other version along with the new but they said they wouldn't do it.  I am now looking for a replacement to Propel powder.  Mio Berry Pomegranate is real close and you can add as much or as little as you like.  I still mourn the passing of the original Propel powder but what can I do?  Marketing people are idiots and always will be.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: Tastes great and powder disolves with no problem. I no longer drink soda of any kind or caffeine. Just wish the powder was easier to find and more "green" - would be great if they sold it in tubs with a scoop.
