review/text: I LOVE Dry soda and Juniper Berry is my very FAVORITE flavor, or was that  Lavender ? NEVER-MIND I LOVE em both. Less sweet is much better this stuff actually quenches your thirst almost as well as regular water and tastes a lot better. I wish regular soda companies would get a clue from Dry that if you want less calories all you have to do is add less sugar NOT fill it with nasty chemicals.

If anyone has any idea how to get some Africafe in the States, please post! :)<br /><br />To those who have not had this (not sure how you got to this page, but congratulations), if my preceding sentence is any indication, this is the best instant coffee around. I still have Nescafe (a.k.a. Taster's Choice) every now and then, and it pales in comparison to Africafe. Africafe has no bitterness whatsoever, tastes great with or without cream or sugar, I just love it.<br /><br />If you have not tried Africafe...you need to. Seriously.

review/text: very, very good chocolate chip cookies, a great value at an even bette price.  I got these yesterday because my Amaazon Prime membership guarantees two-day delivery and they were fresh, delicious, chocolatey and are insanely addictive.  My Father and I have already eaten a row of these and we have 2 rows left.  I should stop feeding him these cookies cos he's going to get fatter than he already is!  I can't say enough good things about how delcious these cookies are, the only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they came in a package, but otherwise they taste just like they're homemade.  Another excellent purchase from Amazon.com, I love this website!

They also got here fast and well packaged so you can certainly buy these with confidence.

Finally, i realized that they were merely "undercooked."<br />So, I placed them on a cookie sheet and baked them in the oven at 325 degrees for 8-10 minutes.  When they cooled, they were of perfect consistency, had great taste and were, indeed, transformed into homemade TOLLHOUSE COOKIES.<br />Happiness is a perfect chocolate chip cookie from Grandma!!

review/summary: An excellent choice.
review/text: Different types of treats have different advantages.  Bits of raw or cooked meat are great as a "high value" reward during initial training or for training under distraction.  A softer, manufactured treat is good for rapid and involved work, when you don't want chewing to slow down the action.  And a dry, crunchy treat like these biscotti provide a wonderful, practical, general-purpose solution.  They don't need special storage and they don't go bad.  They are low-cal.  They are clean to handle.  They are easy to deal with during the winter, when wearing gloves.<br />Regarding the user photo posted, of fractured bits of biscotti, I'd say that based on my experience that problem was likely one of poor luck with the shipping.  As with any sort of dry grain food, some does end up damaged, much as is the case with breakfast cereal.  Each bag does end up with some crumbs at the bottom, even in the best case.  Personally, I've never felt ripped off by this, as the vast majority of the treats have been in good shape.  And the crumbs can be added to the dog's food, or mixed in with peanut butter for a treat toy, to add a little interest.

She hates dry dogfood, she only eats her special canned food....  she gets upset tummy pains often.... She has skin allergies from fleas and wheat.  And I get frustrated.  I have never dealt with this stress.<br /><br />BUT, Wait!!!!  I got that small bag of Liver Biscotti's.... and she loved them.  She L-O-V-E-D them.

review/text: I am allergic to peanuts and so was thrilled to see there is a Sunbutter bar version. However, I'm pretty let down. The bars are tiny - about 1/2 of the packet is bar and the other 1/2 is air. They are also, like a previous review said, random in their sizing - some are a full inch bigger or smaller than others. The taste is kind of bland, but I do think they're nice for a hiking/camping situation to have something with protein that is allergen-safe and easy to toss in a backpack.

review/summary: Versatile snack bar with solid nutrition
review/text: I really like these Chewy bars by Enjoy Life.  I first purchased a few boxes at the local grocery store, but figured I could shave off some of the cost by going through Amazon.  I noticed a lot of other customers have complained about the small size.  Yes, the bars are small and, therefore, are kind of pricey.  But you get a good texture and flavor - difficult to find on a gluten-free diet - and a decently portioned snack for on-the-go, all with the benefits of useful nutrition.  Certainly a good balance for a snack or to round out a meal.<br /><br />I recommend giving these a try by buying a box at the grocery store to make sure you like them.  The "Cocoa Loco" flavor is excellent too.

review/text: My son has peanut allergy.  Enjoy Life has become a staple at our home.  I was very excited to see the sunbutter option for these bars.  They provide a little more protein than the other bars.  I had hoped the kids would like them as much as the other flavors since they do  like sunbutter itself.  However, they were not too keen on these.  I liked them, my son liked them and my daughter just was not interested.  I love their products and just wished Amazon would offer them on the subscribe program.  Thier new chocolate bars are very tasty too!

review/summary: Great portable nutrition for allergy sufferers
review/text: I have to eat gluten and dairy free, and my husband and kids are nut allergic.  It is real difficult to eat on the go.  We keep these bars handy (I eat one every day at work).  I always keep a few in my purse and more on long road trips.  They are not the greatest tasting, but for the being gluten free and having less sugar than similar snack bars they aren't bad (ie don't expect a cookie or candy bar taste like those overly sweetened snack bars).  The sun butter crunch is my fav flavor, but The differences between flavors are not all that great.  They are however just the right amount of nutrition to get me through a few more hours of work, travel, or errrands until I can get home to safe food.  I have noticed the differences in bar shapes.  Seems like sometimes they are longer and thinner and other times shorter and fatter.  The shorter and fatter size can make a person feel like they've been cheated on product because there is so much space left in the packaging, but I could not be certain that the actual weights were any different.  This is definitely the cheapest place I've found to buy them.

review/text: As a parent of kids with multiple food allergies, we're thrilled to have companies like Enjoy Life that make allergen-free treats.  These, however, are not worth the cost.  Each bar comes in a package that's about twice its size, making you feel like Enjoy Life is trying to pull a fast one on you.  As several other reviewers noted, the bars are dry and not so flavorful.  We'll probably keep a box of these in the pantry to vary our options a bit but will more often go with tastier take along treats made by Glutino, Oskri, and others.

review/summary: My Cat's Favorite
review/text: Cats are obviously finicky, and there's no telling what a particular cat will find delicious.  My cat loves the Thrill treats, especially the white fish.  The quality is quite good across the product line, being just freeze-dried meat and nothing else.  The pieces are surprisingly consistent in size, about 1/2 inch square.  They are freeze dried, so are easily chewed.  That does tend to make them a bit powdery if manhandled, however, especially if your delivery person is ham-fisted. Nevertheless, these are high quality treats your cat will love.

review/text: No comparison to loose tea, but if you are looking for the convenience of an oolong tea bag, the Yamamotoyama (YMY) Oolong Tea Bags are the best I have found so far.  I have also tried, in the order of my preference, Choice, Bigelow, Twinings.  None were awful, but I think the YMY has the most taste.<br /><br />FYI, it looks to me that the agreement for Stash to market YMY oolong has ended.  Stash was selling a well reviewed "Stash Premium YMY 1690 China Oolong Tea (bags)" and I searched everywhere for it to no avail.  Then I noticed that YMY is picking up their presence in the US.  I like Stash tea bags (green and green/white fusion) and I will watch to see if they bring out another oolong tea bag.<br /><br />I still make my AM and PM teas from loose leaf (various Harney teas - I LOVE their loose leaf, but I do not think their tea bags are worth the price).  And after much trial and error, I am finding an acceptable assortment of green and oolong tea bags for the office and travel.

review/text: We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.

She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!

She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.

review/text: we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!

I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.

review/summary: Solved our skin issues
review/text: Understanding not all skin issues are alike, this food seems to have solved our issues.  My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet.

review/summary: OATMEAL and Lamb
review/text: Lamb and rice formula was awesome, used it for years without any doggy digestive problems.  The photo and description on Amazon are wrong now though.  Amazon is currently shipping out the new OATMEAL and Lamb formula which my dog cannot eat because of digestive issues with oatmeal.

review/summary: Miracle
review/text: I have three dogs, and one of them kept having bouts of diarrhea.  My vet gave her antibiotics and other prescription drugs to resolve the problem. These would work for about a week, and then the problem would return. My dog groomer suggested that there might be a food allergy involved.  I looked on Amazon.com and saw the "Wellness Limited Ingredient Diet for Dogs with Food Sensitivities Simple Food Solutions" dog food. I noted that the primary ingredent was lamb instead of corn...I ordered some and the first day I fed it to my dogs, it worked!!! My little dacshund Sugar had no more diarrhea or sickness from that day forward. I feed it to all my pets and I believe that they are actually happier now.  I am too!!!!

review/summary: Hot Spots can be from food allergies
review/text: After spend $$$$ and several years of trying to find out what was creating fur loss (hot spots) and itching on my poor dog, it all came down to food allergies. This food is wonderful. It is one of the few choices out there that can be purchased on line or at a pet store without a perscription. So many pet owners try shots and pills that may be unnecessary. Start with the food!!! My dogs LOVE it, too!

review/text: Our dog developed diarrhea last fall and we tried several "cures" before finding this product.  We gradually switched her food and by the time I got to 3/4 this and 1/4 old food, her poop had firmed.  She's been on this formula for several months now without any problems.  So nice to find a healthy food that worked for her!

review/summary: Not sure if it works for allergies
review/text: My two Shih Tzu are picky eaters.  But they seem to like the Wellness foods better than any other I've tried.  However, this particular variety doesn't seem to be quite as big of a hit with them as the other Wellness canned varieties we've tried.  But they do eat it.  As for it helping with food allergies.. and for sensitive stomachs.. I'm not so sure yet.  I've been feeding it to them for several weeks now, but don't see any diference so far.

review/summary: Perfect for Dogs with Food Allergies
review/text: I have two yellow labs - one of which has severe food allergies (ear infections).  I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.  My female lab used to have persistant ear infections but since I started using the Simple line of dog food - the problems have disappeared.  I rotate between the duck and lamb flavors and she seems quite happy.  Never tried the salmon flavor.  I also treat both dogs with the Wellness biscuits (peanut/honey is their favorite).  Quality dog food well worth the cost!  My female lab is almost 7 now and the male is 5.  Both love the food and are very healthy.  Thanks Wellness!

review/summary: Mostly cured the red bumps on my dog's skin
review/text: Even our vet could not cure the red bumps on my dog's skin.  The rash and excoriation was unresponsive to oral antibiotics and topical steroid spray.  Our pet sitter recommended we try a dog food without known allergens, so we tried Wellness Rice & Salmon.  It really works! Our dog still gets some redness but she is so much better.  The only negative is that apparently the food doesn't taste that great. Our solution is to mix it with a very small amount of canned cat food (about 1 tablespoon of our cat's Newman Organics), and our dog gobbles it right down.

review/text: My dog loves this food and I like it because it's low residue and doesn't upset his tummy.  Less waste when he goes makes it more comfortable for him and easier to pick up for me.  The only complaint (besides the price!) would be the smell of the food if you sniff it.  It doesn't make his breath smell.  I may try the lamb one next time (to compare smells), but I definitely recommend this food.

review/summary: Excellent! My dog's skin looks amazing and he loves this food!
review/text: I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love! The cat food kibble is the size of a small pea. To good health and happy feeding! :)

review/summary: Revised opinion
review/text: Update 11/12/11: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb & Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted.  I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />"Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."

review/text: I started a LID for my dog when after a regular yearly check up, my vet noticed that her paws were tinged a redish color. The vet said that it was probably an allergy to something in her food and suggested a limited ingredient diet. We have been using this food for about 4 months now and we have noticed remarkable results. She no longer constantly licks her feet and they are returning to their normal color. Worked perfectly for our dog!!

review/summary: Great for Dogs with Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products. It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations. My vet prescribed a dog food that is only available from vets but after 3 months I saw no improvement.<br /><br />Finally I researched on my own and tried Wellness Simple Solutions and after 3 months I noticed that her ear problems subsided. I supplement her evening meals with the Wellness Simple Solutions dry food and she loves it.<br /><br />Compared with the stuff the vet prescribed, which looked like a waxy tube coming out of the can, the Wellness Simple Solutions canned dog food looks and smells like real food. It contains no wheat, corn, soy, dairy, or eggs and yet is high in nutrients.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the back of the can is duck and it states " This is a naturally preserved product". Considering that, I am very happy that the best by dates average about 2 years out because I keep extra dog food on hand in case of an emergency.

Since the switch almost 7 months ago, their coats are amazing - like silk and I have no shedding at all.  I have one dobe with a sensitive stomach so switched him over to this formula when I saw it came out.  He loves it - sure, its a little pricy but so worth it - no loose stools, no throwups and no shedding - I get comments on them all the time about how beautiful their coats are!

review/summary: Good food for sensitive dog
review/text: I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.

review/summary: not much better than I the salmon flavored one.
review/text: Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.

I followed the directions on the package and added just a teaspoon of vegetable bouillion to kick up the flavor a bit.  Delicious!  Next time I think I'll try adding some frozen veggies to round it out even more.  The rice and grains were chewy and flavorful.  I've also tried Near East couscous products and they're terrific too!  Highly recommend this product and other Near East products to anyone wanting something different than the standard white rice fare you see on the supermarket shelves!

review/summary: One of the few that doesn't make my dog sick!
review/text: I recently adopted a cute little furry Shihpoo and have been very careful about his training and feeding.  I have been slowly learning what he is going to love, and what can upset his stomach, which comes with the territory as these small dogs have very sensitive stomachs.  I was turned on to True Chews by my girlfriend's mom, who has two Shihpoos of her own.  After going through various products, this brand seemed to be the one that her dogs loved, and didn't get sick from!  I gave it a shot, and my Brody absolutely loves them!  The great thing about the bully sticks is that they dont break apart into small chunks like some of the coils do, therefore there is less of a chance for your dog to throw up the smaller chunks that he swallows.  These little treats are not only all natural, but they also do not smell (trust me, there are some that are unbearably smelly).  If you have never given your dog a bully stick, try giving it a shot!<br /><br />Note: These sticks are geared towards smaller dogs, ~&lt;15-20lbs
