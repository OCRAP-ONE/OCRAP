review/summary: Dogs love the new formula
review/text: Shiba Inu (35lb) and Malamute (80lbs) owner here. I had been shopping for a new dog food since my old Taste of the Wild brand got hit with a recall.  Ideally I try to keep my dogs' food in as close to the dollar:pound ratio, but it's getting harder and harder to find a good premium dog food in that range. At the time of this review, this Merrick product was creeping up on the two-dollar per pound mark, but I decided to give it a try anyway mostly because of a random sampler I was given while at a pet store. I took home the sampler baggie and my dogs went nuts for it. The dogs were currently eating a mix of left-over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CIP6K">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Pacific Stream Canine Formula with Smoked Salmon, 30-Pound Bag</a> and its replacement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00609PJEC">Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free Lamb Meal and Sweet Potato Formula Dry Dog Food, 30 Pounds</a>. The dogs still loved the Hi-Tek, but if you placed a bowl side-by-side with the new Merrick, the Merrick would be gone first.<br /><br />For those who have tried Merrick in the past and found that their dogs were ambivalent to their flavors, I would highly suggest grabbing a small bag of their new formulation and trying again. My dogs didn't really care for their old gimmicky flavors (turducken, pot pie, etc), but they really loved this new "Classic" variety. As of this review, my dogs have been eating the product for about two weeks. They're both healthy and their ...droppings... are still as solid as with any other premium dog food. DogFoodAdvisor also gave this new formula a five-star rating.<br /><br />Since I can't seem to find the full ingredient list on the Amazon product page, here is the list from Merrick's site:<br /><br />Deboned Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Brown Rice, Peas, Barley, Sweet Potato, Chicken Fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), Salmon Meal (source of Omega 3 fatty acids), Oats, Natural Chicken Flavor, Carrots, Apples, Blueberries, Organic Alfalfa, Minerals (Salt, Dicalcium Phosphate, Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Copper Amino Acid Complex, Potassium Iodide, Cobalt Amino Acid Complex, Sodium Selenite), Vitamins (Choline Chloride, Vitamin E Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin D3, Niacin, Riboflavin Supplement, Biotin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Folic Acid, Thiamine Mononitrate), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, Dried Lactobacillus casei fermentation product, Dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, Rosemary Extract.

review/summary: Merrick Chicken dry dog food
review/text: Merrick has reformulated their dry dog food. It is a great product, and I highly recommend it to others.  The vet complimented all my dog's coats of fur, and said that Merrick dog food was good stuff!  I didn't give it 5 stars because I have't been using it long, and want to see the long term effects.  But so far, my dogs are doing well with this new chicken formula.  Check out the list of ingredients on the bag, and you will see why it is such a good product.  I am somewhat disappointed that Merrick no longer uses the Bible verse on their bag like they used to.  I thought it was a blessing.

review/summary: My Dog Loves It!  and it's 5 star rated
review/text: At this point, I actually can't say if the food is going to work out completely, but I can say that my dog definitely loves it. I've tried giving him choices and he always chooses the Earthborn.<br /><br />As far as the ingredient list, I'm super happy about it. It was listed as a 5 star dog food out of 6 possible stars on [...].  The main reason it wasn't a 6 was because of not having a statement that said that it was ethoxyquin free, but I read on another site that they have since made that statement (don't know if it's true though).  There are a couple of other minor reasons, but nothing that really matters  -especially considering that the price for this grain free dog food was much better than some others.<br /><br />I'm a little bit concerned about the 38% protein and the 20% fat as they seem a bit high.  As long as he gets plenty of water and doesn't start gaining too much weight, then I won't worry about it.  He's a 10 month old pit but he's not really that active though so it may be a problem.  He's too busy following me around the house being a big baby all day & he doesn't even want to go outside by himself so he doesn't get a ton of excercise. Right now, he's the perfect weight but I just started it so we'll see. I've read that the high protein isn't a problem unless it's not a good quality protein, so as long as that is true, then it should be fine.  (like they say, look at the wild animals that eat mostly protein).<br /><br />The other problem that may be an issue is that I think this MAY have caused some loose stools.  I've read that it can be the result of the high fat content.  I noticed them being loose even when I was doing the transition of 1/4 of new to 3/4 of old.  BUT -I don't want to say for sure that this was the reason.  I did notice that a few other people were having the same problem, but the food that I was mixing it with was also fairly new to him since we've only had him for 3 weeks.  I don't know what he was on before when he was with our friend who found him, but I know that it was something cheap from the grocery store.  I just switched him directly to Strong Point, which is a pretty decent food.  He didn't seem to have it before I started the transition to Earthborn, but he's also been moved around a few times (had an original owner, then our friend found him & had him for 5 months, then my mom had him for a week and now we have him).  Since we've had him, he's had conjunctivitis in both eyes (and putting those darn drops in the eyes is stressful for us all!), he's been neutered, traveled out of town with us in the car, he's been given all his shots for at least the second time -maybe the 3rd (we had to do them over because my friend couldn't find the paperwork where he had it done)and he's started heartworm medication.  I just wonder if some of it couldn't be from stress or feeling anxious.<br /><br />Anyway, with that being said, I would definitely recommend trying this food. What works good for one dog is not always what works for another.  The fact that it is a grain free food and it has good quality ingredients makes it worth trying!  Even if it turns out to be too much for my dog, and some others, there are still plenty out there who loved it and had no problems.

review/summary: Good premium food at a fair price. What's not to love?
review/text: My dog was picky about her food until we started buying the "premium" types that have more meat in them. We had her on Taste of the Wild for a while because it was a nice quality grain free for a fair price. Someone recommended that I add Earthborn to my rotation because it was comparable in price and quality to ToTW. I think that is true of the other grain free formulas, but primitive natural is actually better than ToTW in my opinion. It has higher protein and fat with lower carbohydrates. Even though it's a couple dollars more expensive per bag, since it is about 70 more calories per cup, it actually works out to be a little cheaper as fed (she ate 1 cup ToTW per day, and now 2/3 cup primitive natural per day).<br /><br />Anyway, my dog likes this as much, if not more than her old food and she seems to be doing just as well on it so I am happy. Nice firm, small stools, shiny coat and nice energy level. Aside from that, I like to think I'm supporting a good company when I buy this food. They claim that the bags are made from natural gas, and they have the UPCs for Trees program, where you send them a certain number of UPCs and they plant a tree. The food also comes in a resealable bag, which is really convenient and helps keep the food fresh without having to pour it into an airtight container. Overall I am very happy with this food. Just wish I could find it closer to me, but the free super saver shipping makes it a mute point. :)

review/summary: 5 paws up for this one
review/text: This food is for my 8 year old German Shepherd who has a sensitive stomach & skin allergies in the past.<br />We've tried just about every natural, organic and holistic food in the past with some luck in finding foods that don't upset her stomach or make her sick.<br />The very first days of her eating this food I mixed it in with her old one and there was no stomach upset. She loves this food and licks the bowl when it's empty. Immediately there was an improvement in her energy level *she already is a hyper dog, but now she's even more lively & vibrant*, her coat has started to get softer & shinier and less scratching.<br />I've found a better price somewhere else, but wanted to share with everyone how much we love this food & will continue to purchase in the future for my dog.<br />The ingredients are natural and the company is here in the states. That alone makes a huge difference in choosing the right dog food in my opinion. I also wanted to point out that these are smaller bites so a dog of most any size except the toy or miniature would be able to chew these, even older dogs.

review/summary: Ollie LOVES Earthborn!
review/text: I have an extremely picky 4 year old cockapoo with allergy issues.  He LOVES this food.  I have tried sooooo many different kinds in the past few years (without much luck at all for one reason or another) but thankfully we found this.  I will warn you ... he had a few loose stools at the beginning when I was weaning him onto this (I think because of the high fat content as well as the other people said), but it only lasted a couple days and then he was fine.  Once he started eating this, he wouldn't even look at other food.  There have been times when Ollie has been around other dog's food and always goes for the bowl, but now he sniffs at it and leaves it alone.  I almost ran out of one day and had to mix his Earthborn with his old food just to give him his meal until I got to the store and he actually picked out all the old food and put it on the floor!  Too funny!  He loves this stuff!  Also, I saw an almost immediate improvement in his coat - it's so much shinier and softer than before.  He feels like he did when he was a puppy.  What a nice added bonus!!!  If you pay alot of attention to your pet (like I do - I totally baby him) you'll see the difference right away about everything.  This food is the BEST!!!

review/summary: wish it had worked
review/text: This food has such high ratings, I wish it had worked. I have a black lab/weim mix who is over 2 year olds and about 100 lb. As he aged (turned 2 in April) his ears kept getting worse and worse with black smelly gunk and nothing the vet gave helped. He also started chewing feet and legs (made a bare spot on one leg). After researching I decided it must be food allergies. I changed to Dr. E's Great Life Grain Free Potato Free Limited Ingredient Buffalo - worked GREAT ears cleared up. no foot/leg chewing, skin wasn't shedding white flakes as much. but...he HATED it. he would dribble pieces on the floor - I had to mix it with stuff (I'm just not the type who will starve my dog till he eats). He also leaned up quite a bit though he wasn't an overweight dog. I figured since his ears were clear but he hated this, I would try this food as it sounded so good. What a disaster. He loved it. gobbled it down and wanted more. He gained weight (not in a good way now he looks fat), his ears got stinky, his feet got itchy and his skin was so dry and flaky he looked like a partially white dog and his hair was flying out in handfuls. Am going to keep looking as I don't think I can keep feeding him the other as it was such a struggle but really disappointed this didn't work. as a side note, we were at the bottom of the barrel with his old food and I didn't do a two week intro as I usually do, plus his probiotics had run out BUT he had zero diarreah issues switching over to this. I did mix it with grandma lucy's grain free chicken dog food but he was having that on his food before and was cleared up so I don't think that was it. Also, some have mentioned NOT to mix this with water so I'm glad he didn't have bloat issues though I did (as the Grandma lUcy's is a dry flake you rehydrate)

review/summary: Amazing food!
review/text: My three-year-old Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix is thriving on this food. He has had seizures since I adopted him along with severe skin allergies. Both have stopped completely since starting him on this food. It is the only grain-free food he will eat and it has helped me identify that he does have a grain allergy. He loves it and has actually lost weight on it (for him this is a good thing). He is currently maintaining a healthy weight. He does have a few issues with diarrhea, but has had the same issue on any food we have tried so I do not believe the food is causing it. Also, some of the bags do have Menadione Sodium Bisulfite listing as an ingredient. However, this is not listed as an ingredient on their Web site. From what I have read, they no longer use it and are simply using up old packaging which is very environmentally friendly.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: The perfect kibble
review/text: When I adopted my dogs, they were eating the junk food of dog foods. I tried several brands of more natural and/or organic foods and wound up with Natural Balance, until I discovered that it was causing them to have loose stools. In an effort to find a replacement, I brought home many samples of some of the best dry foods available. They liked some of them, but they LOVED the Earthborn Primitive Natural. I can't imagine feeding them anything else, besides Honest Kitchen Embark which I also give them with the kibble in the morning.

review/summary: Finally good food for my Dane
review/text: I have gone through nothing but headache with trying to find my guy a food that was good for him.  Brands including Eagle Pack, Solid Gold, Canidae, Nutro, etc. each one with a disappointment.  His  coat was dull, shed like crazy,  terrible gas, and the clean up was foul to say the least.  Mushy soft stools with an awful smell.  Even tried the raw feeding for a few years with mixed results, then I had to make a switch back to kibble, since I there were few places to buy raw food.<br /><br />Until the recalls I was feeding TOTW and had some very nice results.  However I grew tired of the constant recalls of Diamond company and decided to look elsewhere. It was the best decision I made.<br /><br />Earthborn Holistic grain free food is the best thing I come across, and the price is right as well.  After two weeks of feeding this food I noticed my dog's coat was shiny with minimal shedding, that gas unfortunately remained ( I think its just him), plus the clean up is a breeze.  For a 200lb dog his output is comparable to a medium size breed, in fact there have been some cases where it was even smaller.  They are nice and firm with no smell at all.  Perfect for clean up.<br /><br />What's even better is that its great for all life stages perfect for my growing dane pup. Highly recommend this food and other grain free flavors.

review/summary: A very enjoyable sauce
review/text: I bought this sauce (from a local store [Figuero's]) looking for something that I could use in smaller amounts on things like burgers, tacos, sandwiches, etc to jazz up the taste, and something I could use in larger amounts in things like chili, soup, queso, etc to jazz up the heat.<br /><br />My money was not wasted.<br /><br />I'd like to give this item 4.5 stars but that's not an option, I can't give it 5 so I gave it 4 and I'll explain my grading.<br /><br />Taste:5 I found this sauce very pleasant. The mix of spices and sugar, really sets off the flavor of this sauce.  The sauce has a pretty thick texture, which I enjoy, I've never been a fan of really runny sauces.  It contains bits of seed as well.  Also, no extract in this sauce.<br /><br />Heat:4 The bottle says "1,000,000 Scoville Units" though I have to say (by my own subjective judgment) there's no way this sauce is 1,000,000 scovilles.  There's definitely a decent amount of heat to this sauce however it's a heat that isn't immediate.  There's delay from when you start eating it to when it really kicks in, and it does kick in, and it kicks fairly hard, just not quite what I was hoping for.  I'd rate the heat on this one as the upper end of the medium spectrum (maybe 5.5-6.5 on par or perhaps mildly hotter than Dave's Insanity Sauce)<br /><br />All in all I do recommend this sauce as a very good, pretty hot sauce, that I may end up buying again.  If you're only looking for extreme heat then you should pass this one up.

Those come in around 140 calories per bar and are much more filling then this 90 calorie variety. I find that I am still hungry after eating this kind and tend to reach for something else - which pushes me up past the 140 calories anyway.<br /><br />The flavor and texture also reminds me of stale or old popcorn. Or maybe packing foam. Not good.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy the regular fiber bars and add a another five to ten minutes to your workout routine to offset the calories. You'll be glad you did.

review/summary: Great testing, Very little Sugar
review/text: First the price...not really that bad. Cheaper then Walmart, but can be found at Odd Lots on occasion 1 dollar less. Sams also has the higher counts less also, but this price is less then the general food stores. As I said, sometimes they don't have them..here they do.<br /><br />This is a sweet tasting wholesome snack. Being on a low sugar diet, this fits the bill very well. At 90 calories, much more fulfilling then lets say a cheese snack (that can have over 120 calories plus the fat issues unless you get 2%) and are much smaller. Quaker oats makes a version of it, but they are too sweet for my tastes. This fits the bill for me, it's taste is great, and gives me that boost I need. Good Fiber content.<br /><br />With all this stuff on obesity, it seems to be getting harder to find good diet foods that are relatively healthly. They make claims on fancy packages, (I bought "low calorie yogurt" once, and the only reason was they made the size smaller, much like Lean Cusine does at times) but these ar every bit as large as their 150 calories counterparts and just plain tastes better.

review/text: Real Kobe beef cannot be purchased in the US.  Quotes below are from the aforementioned Forbes article.:<br /><br />1. This is a quote in the article directly from the USDA:<br />"early 2010 all beef from Japan including that "normally referred to as Kobe beef," will "be refused entry," "including in passenger luggage." This is still the case, as you can see in the most recent Animal Product Manual, produced by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), dated March 1, 2012 which specifically states that beef from Japan, fresh or frozen, whole or cut, bone-in or boneless, will be "Refused Entry.""<br /><br />2. This quote shows how strict the tracking and quality guidelines are for the real thing:<br />"In Japan this beef is strictly tracked down to the cow from which it came, which must be of a certain lineage and fed a specific diet its entire life."<br />What they are selling is "american Kobe" which is not controlled, therefore you don't relaly know exactly what you are getting.  It is most likely some type of cow with some japanese heritage that is crossbred with an angus breed.<br /><br />This is just a reality check.  To find out how good it is you have to buy it..  Respectable american breeders have taken a lot of time to produce it, so I am sure it is probably a great piece of meat.  Is it Kobe - NO!  They really shouldn't be able to use the name, because it leads us to believe we are getting something that we are not.  Perhaps they should adapt the use of what everyone else does when trying to emulate a product, or sell us something similar....<br /><br />Call it US Kobe Style Beef.  Clearly label that it is not from Japan, is not affiliated with Japanes Kobe, etc..  Keep it real!

review/summary: Nothing like regular SpaghettiOs
review/text: At the time that I purchased these, this "Dora the Explorer" nonsense was all Amazon was offering in the way of SpaghettiOs.  I figured it would just be just like the SpaghettiOs quality I was used to, only with silly shapes instead.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This is like tomato flavored water punctuated by monstrously large doughy shapes.  The "sauce" was what was really sickening.  I don't see why they would have changed the sauce recipe just for some branded can, but they simply must have.  It's downright disgusting.<br /><br />If I had any sense I would have spent a buck and picked up a can at the grocery store first.  But as it is, the remaining 14 cans will be sitting in the basement waiting for the next nuclear war.  It might improve the flavor some.

review/summary: Excellent Product - Strong Disagreement with 1-star Rating
review/text: The title pretty much says it all.  I reserve 5 stars for what I consider the best of the best.  I wanted a gluten-free cereal that was different from the few I've been eating over the years.  This is definitely NOT like the usual "crispy rice."  It's much more substantial (not "90% air"), has a nice, though not too strong, cocoa flavor, and doesn't get soggy in the first two minutes after milk (or other drink product) is poured on it.<br /><br />Another rater talked about empty calories.  I'll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading (and comparing) nutrition labels.  If a high quality rice is also considered "empty calories," that review would be valid.  But comparing the Koala Crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values - perhaps because Koala Crisp IS a high quality rice.  Just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal, neither is Koala Crisp.  What it is, is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients (none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to "grocery store" cereals to make them look better).  And it's designed to be used as part of a balanced diet.<br /><br />With that out of the way, It's just plain good.  I buy it by the case, and eat it several times per week for breakfast, I like it that much.  And no, I have no connection with the company at all - I just love their products (many of them - not just this one).  Now, if they'd just add this one to their line of Eco-pak cereals (large, bulk bags), I'd be even happier.

review/text: Koala Crisp is a delicious gluten free cereal. It is crispy and has a nice chocolate flavor. It's cheaper than a lot of gluten free cereals I have seen, close to almost half the price. It is a bit higher in sugar content, but sometimes we all want something sweet. And there is more in the box than some cereals. (the ones that are twice the price. Doesn't seem fair does it?) Anyway there is a fun game board for kids on the inside of the box.  Highly Recommended!

It was easy to prepare (just heat in a saucepan).  Nice, creamy texture.  And while the cheese flavor was nice, I thought it was very "alcoholly" (if that's a word).  Would I buy it again?

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: I've had a lot of GF bread-like products, but this one takes the cake (har, har). These bagels are the closest thing I've ever had to an actual gluten-filled bagel. I even checked the package again after my first bite, just to make sure it was in fact GF.<br /><br />There is not that glossy hard sheen you get from boiling a regular bagel -- they're more like a roll or almost a croissant on the outside than a bagel, but it does not detract at all.<br /><br />These are fluffy, hold up to microwave or toaster oven, and are (unlike many GF products) sufficiently delicious that you could eat them completely plain if you were inclined. No need to disguise the flavor in any way. I don't know that I could eat an entire case of them, as offered here, but I would not object to trying... :)

review/summary: The best GF bagel - but don't expect too much
review/text: First of all, I would NOT by these on amazon if there is a Trader Joe's near you. I want to say they cost maybe $6 a bag there? Definitely don't need a case and don't need to pay these outrageous prices.<br /><br />The bagels are not bad if you toast them REALLY well so that the insides get a bit more crunchy. The insides tend to be a bit doughy- for lack of a better term.<br /><br />Here is a tip: use these for pizza bagels instead of buying overpriced frozen GF pizza. These taste MUCH better and will save you $$$! Just slap on some pizza sauce (or use tomato paste from a can and season it with garlic salt and pepper and dried italian herbs), shredded cheese, pepperoni, whatever toppings you like! Heat in an oven 375 degrees until brown. I can't even tell they are on a GF bagel when I eat them like that. You can also use these for tuna melts or any other hot sandwich. Try them in a panini press and make your own steak and cheese sandwiches! Yum!

review/summary: I Get to Eat Bagels Again!
review/text: Wow - Udi's has nailed it once again with some awesome bagels. The texture and taste are just like "regular" breads. If they're frozen, I recommend thawing briefly in the microwave (only long enough to pull the top and bottom apart) and then putting them in the toaster. I tried warming them completely in the microwave one morning and ended up with a very hard, chewy bagel. My only complaint is that it's alot to spend on 4 bagels (or 4 breakfasts) when I can spend the same amount for a whole loaf of Udi's bread. Granted, the bagels are rather large.

review/summary: Great Pods - make the Senseo better!
review/text: This coffee is infinitely better than the Douwe Egberts coffee that comes with the Senseo. I like my coffee black - no cream, sugar, or anything else, so I like to really taste my coffee and can spot bad coffee right away.<br /><br />No bitterness, much smoother, and stronger than Douwe Egberts coffee. Also, each pod makes an 8 ounce cup versus 4 ounce per Douwe Egberts pod. The pods are individually wrapped, and you can smell the freshness when you tear open a pod packet; when I opened a Douwe Egberts packet - there was only a faint smell versus the strong, fresh smell from these packets.<br /><br />I have even - accidently - made 2-8oz cups of coffee with ONE of these pods - and the second cup wasn't bad (a little weak, but not bad - some folks that prefer weaker coffee would have thought it was great).<br /><br />I have tried four of BetterPods' varieties, Kona, French Roast, Columbian, and Sumatra Mandheling - with the French Roast being my favorite due to my preference for a darker roasted coffee - but all being equally great otherwise. I think I am going to throw away the Douwe Egberts pods that came with my Senseo, or find some other non-beverage use for them.<br /><br />I have also made espresso using Ecopads and the Senseo's 1-cup mode with some Starbuck's Espresso Roast... not quite as strong as a true coffee house espresso, but very good nonetheless, and much easier to setup than my old home-brew espresso machine... Now if BetterPods would only come out with an espresso roast (hint-hint)!

review/summary: NECTAR OF THE GODS TO START YOUR DAY
review/text: My husband and I have drunk a lot of coffee through a good part of our professional lives - most of it bad.  He in the Navy and me in the operation room of the hospital I worked in.  Think of every really bad cup of coffee stereotype you may have seen on television in the movies, that's what we have been forced to drink if we wanted something hot with caffeine in it.<br />So, when we can get a very good tasting, fresh cup of coffee, it is like nectar of the gods.  This coffee falls into the nectar category.  With the Senseo, we get a right now fresh cup and the flavor and aroma from these little pods as the coffee brews is so lovely.<br />I really appreciate that each pod is sealed, making a truly fresh cup of coffee.  The range of flavors is a treat.<br />Thank you for helping make the start of our day an enjoyable one with a fresh, fragrant cup of coffee.

review/summary: Wide ribbons of flavorful coconut
review/text: I saw this in a specialty market and was so impressed by the wide ribbons of white coconut that I disregarded the gazillion dollars they charged and bought a bag.  At the Bob's Red Mill website, I investigated recommended recipes and found an enticing cookie recipe, then assembled the ingredients and prepared a batch of wholesome, chewy, flavorfully delicious cookies which we've been enjoying for a few days.  I'd used home dried cherries and grapes (raisins) instead of the cranberries listed in the recipe, but otherwise followed it as written online and on the Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Cereal bag.  The coconut was so impressive that I immediately checked to see the Amazon price in preparation for buying more and after only a week, they now have it in stock at a much better price than the nearly five I paid for my first bag.  The 12 ounce bag probably contains 3 hefty cups of coconut as I split it with my daughter and nibbled some before measuring it for review.  She made fresh blueberry coconut ice cream with coconut milk and said this coconut was especially nice because the texture was more interesting than smaller shreds which she'd used in the past.  Nothing is added to the Bob's Red Mill Flaked Coconut Unsweetened and that's just what I want!  Toasted, it's even better when added to fruit and yogurt.  I have it in my Amazon cart ready to order!

Really.  If you have never tried unsweetened coconut before, be warned that it is more texture and filler than flavor for most people.  What I like about this kind is the flakes are nice and big.

review/summary: Superfresh, flavorful and - yay! - no added sugar
review/text: I was not able to find any UNSWEETENED coconut flakes in local stores. Coconut is kinda sweet in itself, I have no idea why they load it with sugar.<br />Anyway these flakes are so flavorful. There are a trillion ways you can use them. They are also so fresh.<br />Some people have said in their reviews they are dry... well I suppose that is inevitable because they need to dry the coconut meat in order to preserve it. Also, obviously these will tend to be more dry than those shredded finely because finely shredded flakes will have more surface in contact with moisture from other foods (or your mouth if one eats them alone) and thus will absorb more moisture than large flakes. But it is very easy to shred them more finely with a food processor or similar tools. Personally, even eating them alone without shredding further, I have not found them dry at all.<br />Overall, outstanding product.

review/text: I make my own "trail mix" using Kashi, dried cranberries, walnuts & shredded coconut. I was surprised how sweet the flakes are despite being unsweetened. Nice "coconutty" aroma.<br /><br />Only negative is that despite being flakes, there are a lot of small bits. Not excessively, but for my use, it led to a lot of little coconut "droppage". (This was a bit of a problem as I was eating trail mix for dinner by the campfire... I had a bear at my tent that night... I guess he thought the coconut was yummy too.)

review/summary: Virtually Impossible to find in grocery stores
review/text: My wife bought a case of this coconut for two reasons, #1 it is almost impossible to find unsweetened coconut at the grocery store and #2 Unsweetened FLAKES are like the white whale of grocery items. The flavor and texture of this coconut is quite good, no chemical aftertaste, just thick/moist enough to not choke you like a cinnamon challenge when eating straight from the bag. We used this in a coconut crusted baked chicken recipe and it worked great. The flakes are large enough to brown up nicely and provided a great texture/flavor overall. Also made some coconut zucchini muffins that worked well. Bob's Red Mill costs an arm and a leg if you buy from the grocery store but they really do have high quality items that are consistently good across the board. I have tried various items from them from wheat flour to flax seed and they have all been top notch. Buy this brand with confidence and save yourself the hours driving around to 10 different stores to find freaking coconut that isn't pumped full of sugar.

Perhaps just the lot I received was overly dry and hard to eat, so much that my coconut macaroons were almost inedible.

I hoped to be one of the lucky reviewers who got the wonderfully delicate texture of properly dried/moist coconut, but alas I was not.

review/text: I thought that this flaked coconut would be finer, maybe more shredded..I didn't mind the fact it was unsweetened, but I found it did not have much flavor and it  was much larger pieces.. more like it was chipped.. and I really don't know what to do with it now that I have it..Don't think I will order it again..

review/summary: Not bad!
review/text: I had a bowl of these todasy for breakfast. I put two fried eggs on top and added a little hot sauce I made yesterday. The noodles have a decent firmness and the broth was tasty. The veggies weren't as plentiful as I would normally wish, but I couldn't complain; a good breakfast. 3.125 out of 5.0 stars is what I gave it on ramenrater.com.

review/summary: Really??
review/text: This soup is terrible!!  I don't know how it gets such good reviews.  I bought a whole bunch of boxes when they wre on sale, and I thought it would be great to stock up.  I'm actually having my first cup as I'm writing this.  The "noodles" or whatever they call these little microscopical pieces of noodle are so small i can't even taste or chew them. The carrots are pretty much non-existant, and the meat? where's the meat?? i dont see any.  I'll pay a few extra bucks for progresso soup in my opinion.

review/summary: cost way too much
review/text: At 48 dollars for 12, it's highway robbery. Doing the math, that comes out to 4 dollars a box. Each box has four envelopes, that means a doller per envelope. You can go to Drugstore.com and get it for half that price. Not to mention I can buy individual boxes, I don't have buy in bulk.

review/summary: As much as I LOVE this soup mix....it'll kill you!!!
review/text: I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil.  That means it has 'trans fats' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease.  That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.  Soybeans (except for the fermented forms like tempah) elevate one's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks...especially estrogen mediated breast cancers.  And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.  As much as I love the flavor of this soup mix, I can not recommend it to anyone!  I will not be ordering this health 'time bomb' ever again.  Eat it at your own risk!!!

review/summary: The old style!
review/text: I was very excited to find this item since Lipton changed it's recipe.  This product is from Canada, but is almost identical to the old Lipton Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup that used to be sold in the USA.  Unlike the new version, there are no hard carrot blocks to filter out of this soup. Great taste for a quick meal, or when you aren't feeling well.

review/summary: Fast and Cheap
review/text: I love the Lipton Cup-a-Soups. They're cheap, fast, and don't taste bad at all. I use two packs at a time, and use a little more water than they say to use. 90 seconds in the microwave, God's gift to singles.

review/summary: My Cup a Soup Order
review/text: Lipton still makes the best instant soup you can buy anywhere. Unfortunately a lot of local grocers including Wal Mart no longer stock this great soup in their aisles. I'm just glad I can still order this product that is currently being manufactured in Canada from Amazon.com. Please keep listing this product as long as Unilever keeps it on the market. I've enjoyed this product for well of 20 years and hopefully for many more years to come. I usually make a double batch since I like soup so much and it is good for the human body. I also add about a dozen or so Ritz crackers to drink up the excess broth.

review/summary: Excellent, Convenient Soup for the Price.
review/text: If you are looking for something that is fast, hot and tasty, this just might be it. A great alternative to coffee.<br /><br />This soup is made in Canada and is all natural with no preservatives . True Knorr or Maggi soup mix might be better if you want to spend 2 to 3 times more. This soup is slightly salty as are most of them, but if you add more water than directed it's not bad at all. For a soup that only takes 1 1/2 min. to make in a microwave and tastes like chicken noodle soup, its excellent. I did not need a spoon to get the noodles and chicken out of my cup, it just slid out with the liquid. And yes there are little pieces of chicken in there, so don't be naive as some of the reviewers and expect big chunks of chicken for this price.<br /><br />For the sale price or even the regular price and with Subscribe & Save plus free Prime shipping it cant be beat for 48 servings. It comes out to 25 to 30 cents a serving. So 5 stars for a soup that tastes really good at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />Note::: I just found this at my local Super WalMart for $1.08 a 4 pack.
