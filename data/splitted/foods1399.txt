review/summary: Changed ingredients equals bland product.
review/text: I have been buying this product for well over two years and had been delighted by it!  Gluten-free mixes for the most part are horrible and this used to be exceptional not only in taste but in texture.<br /><br />To my great surprise and disappointment the ingredients have been reformulated. I recently reordered two cases of this mix; same packaging, etc. so no reason to suspect anything had changed.<br /><br />Well, as I was baking yesterday I noticed the "new" mix was a different color, in comparison to the "old" mix (I still had 3 older bags) and consistency when stirring was like mixing chalk powder in water.<br /><br />As the muffins were baking, the "old" batch mix was baking beautifully (nice golden brown) but in comparison the "new" batch mix did not appear to be baking (still pale white coloring after 20 minutes in the oven).<br /><br />So here's the scoop, the bag is now 13.5 ounces versus what was 16 ounces. There was no disclosure on the bag stating this major change.  In addition, many of the key taste ingredients have been eliminated such as vanilla bean powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The base ingredient was brown rice flour but is now whole grain brown rice flour (pale bland flour).  Now I know why the "new" product is bland! The taste is now gritty and in essence unpalatable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have one unopened case but will not be able to return it; Amazon does not allow food product returns. I believe the manufacturer should have disclosed all of these changes clearly on the packaging thus allowing consumers (like me) the option of purchasing or not.  If I had known the mix was reformulated I never would have reordered. Base cost per bag including tax is $4.84.  But keep in mind that your cost is slightly higher because you must add oil, sugar and any other ingredient i.e. blueberries, nuts, etc. to make the "finished" product.<br /><br />My recommendation, do not buy this reformulated product.

review/summary: Best multi-allergy free quick bread & muffin mix
review/text: I am allergic/severely intolerant to wheat, dairy, eggs, and nuts.  Finding great tasting and textured baked goods is very difficult, but your search has ended!<br /><br />I use The Cravings Place mixes exclusively.  This quick bread mix makes a fabulous dessert bread without any additions to the mix - just top with stewed/pie/fresh fruit, simple frosting, (vegan) butter, or eat plain.  The bread also comes out very moist, which is not common among GF baked goods.<br /><br />I have used this bread to make pumpkin, banana, and raisin breads and muffins.  All came out tasting delicious.  I have noticed that it is hard to get this product to bake through completely if you put it in one loaf pan, per the directions. I would recommend using two loaf pans for any recipe that calls for substantially more stuff being added in (e.g. pumpkin, banana, zucchini, applesauce).  I have also had real good success using a 9x13 glass casserole to get even baking results.<br /><br />My husband (with no food restrictions) loves it, too!

review/summary: The Best Gluten Free Flour Mix!! PERIOD!!
review/text: My wife has been gluten free for over 2 years and we have been trying different products to find goof tasting ones and this is by far the best mix.<br /><br />We use it for pancakes, Apple Cinnamon Coffee Cakes, and Fried Chicken.  The fried chicken  is delicious.  It is very interesting with a hint of cinnamon in the mix.<br /><br />The one secret we learned with just about every mix is always make it more liquid then recipe calls for.  Always add extra liquid.  It makes it more fluffier and more like real gluten products.

review/summary: Absolutely the best Gluten Free Muffin Mix we've ever tried
review/text: I have to revise my review of this product after our most recent shipment.<br />The last case we received was a reformulated product. It did not have the same great taste or ingredients as the prior shipments.<br />Others had written similar comments, but we had received good ingredient product long after they posted their reviews. So it did not make any sense to us.  Now it does. So we can no longer recommend this product as its taste was bland and mediocre and it sticks to the paper muffin cups like glue.<br /><br />In the future we will buy the Cravings Place Cookie and Cake Mix (we had been using it as a substitute as the muffin mix was constantly out of stock)which has a nice flavor.  Beware though the result is a denser but still better tasting baked good.<br /><br />Prior Review:<br />Absolutely the best Gluten Free Muffin Mix we've ever tried.<br />It's the truth.  We've been GF for many years and every time we try a new mix we are mostly disappointed in the baking outcome.<br /><br />We love this mix because it is unsweetened (we add a little Agave when making ours), has all natural ingredients, is non-dairy, and seem to work great with no eggs (vegan). And of course, the great taste.  I think it comes from the vanilla added.  It took someone who when to school at the CIA to come up with the blend, so I give credit where it is due.

review/text: It taste great. It's like cheeseball kind of texture with banana flavor instead of cheese.<br />I hate cheese, and in USA there are like more than 80% snacks are with cheese flavor.<br />So this is great.<br />But!!<br />When I opened the bag, it tasted a bit old.<br />I checked the date, I only have less than a month to finish the whole box.<br />Usually snacks like this don't go bad for a long time, not sure exactly how long, but mostly almost a year or a bit less than a year.<br />But seeing the date saying that I only have less than a month, tells me how long Amazon had this in their warehouse.<br />And the fact that I can actually tell the difference in taste is bad. My husband didn't notice but I'm kinda really really great at tasting stuff.

review/summary: Banana Cheetohs are YUM!
review/text: We lived in Korea for two years and these were our FAVORITE snack of all time.  We'd buy them at the 7-11 (really!) just beyond the gate of our housing complex.  They're sweet, but not too sweet and have the consistency of cheetoh puffs.  They can be addictive, though.  You'll find your bag empty long before you're done eating them.  On the Korean economy, they cost between 700w and 1100w (so under a dollar) per bag, but they're worth the bit more you'd pay to have them shipped from a friend.

review/summary: Slower than US Orders, but well worth the wait
review/text: As another buyer described it, Cadbury chocolate is unique and cannot be "replicated", even by Hershey.  It's just not the same taste, consistency or flavor at all.  Although I love Hershey as well, Cadbury is special and has less of a "waxy" taste at first.  The moment you put Cadbury Milk Chocolate in your mouth you're in heaven on Earth.  I was worried that ordering from British Mart would take too long and my chocolate would certainly come melted, however, I ordered 4 bars anyway, just to see.  Much to my surprise, the chocolate arrived weeks earlier than promised in perfect condition, packed well.  I will definitely be ordering again from this seller.  So, for those of you that are willing to wait about 2-3 weeks for "the real thing", this is definitely worth it.<br /><br />Mike in Maryland

review/summary: It's not bad as a flavoring.
review/text: Truffle Oil is a flavoring agent. And this inexpensive flavoring product is pretty decent when added to cooking requiring a fungal aromatic.<br /><br />I suppose there could be a real truffle or two or ten added per 100 gallons of olive oil, along with a generous supply of 2,4-DTP for flavor enhancement. Who knows, and really who cares given its price and use? People certainly buy vanillin instead of vanilla for baking, and that totally artificial ingredient works pretty well in cakes. And people also use other artificial flavorings from pineapple to cherry to almond in their cooking. For those dumping on the product on the chance that its been enhanced, were you expecting 24K gold for the price of Grade 2 straw?

review/text: I too was fooled, but apparently there is no such thing as truffle oil made with truffles.  They are all made with a chemical compound.  See this article from the New York Times:<br /><br />Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles<br />By DANIEL PATTERSON<br />Published: May 16, 2007<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/16truf.html?_r=1&ref=dining&oref=slogin<br /><br />As the article notes, it's not possible to infuse oil with a truffles and ALL oils claiming to be made from truffles aren't. Don't feel too bad, even rather famous chefs fell for the idea.  But all of this explains the "one-dimensional flavor" of these oils.  One might argue if it tastes good then it doesn't matter.  Perhaps, but that doesn't explain why the oils costs so much.

review/summary: Great Taste in Sugar Pecans
review/text: Once this jar is opened, you won't be able to stop eating them. These are so good, and I could actually taste the honey in them. I love Pecans, as one might image living in the South and find these nuts are great to eat in just about every way one could fix them. I highly recommend this product. Fresh, great packaging, great tasting.

review/summary: Metallic. Mediocre. Meh.
review/text: I disagree with the previous reviewer. I paid $14 for one of the bigger jars of the Victoria brand salt and vowed to never buy another finishing salt again. It's sweet, light, and perfect for sprinkling without fear of overkill. This salt tastes like regular $5 salt to me. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost nearly as much to ship it, but trust me when I tell you the Victoria brand is unlike anything you've ever tasted. I read the backs of both jars and this one is harvested from the whole island, where the Victoria brand is harvested from the one coast. Don't know if it makes a difference, but the sodium content is much higher in this brand and therefore a little too twingy for my taste.

review/summary: Best Salt Ever
review/text: I used to order this same type of salt from another vendor.  It came in one larger jar but the shipping was very expensive.  I now have more salt in the three smaller jars for much less shipping.  This salt is wonderful.  It enhances the flavor of anything you use it with.  I use it on edamame, which I eat often.  This salt has a wonderful flavor of it's own, very subtle and clean.  I would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: I am already a fan of all Nueva Cocina Products and this Paella dish just made me look like the world's best cook. I added shrimp, little-neck clams, bay scallops, mussels, and one fillet of grouper cut in chunks. Everything cooked to perfection within the time indicated in the instructions and my family could not believe I didn't spend all day long slaving over the stove. The flavors are authentic Spanish, rich, and yet light enough to know you ate an all natural dish. We loved every bite of it and will continue buying this product.

review/summary: Excellent mix for paella
review/text: I have prepared several Nueva Cocina mixes and have been very pleased. This paella mix is no exception. The rice and seasonings are stirred into water, with some white wine and a little olive oil, brought to a boil and then simmered. While the rice was cooking part way, I sauteed some jumbo prawns and large sea scallops in a separate skillet. I also browned some sliced garlic sausage. When the rice was about five minutes from being done, I added the seafood, the sausage and some frozen baby peas. It was so easy and a very big hit with the family. Actually, it was so good, I would serve it to guests and probably wouldn't even confess it was from a mix. Hmm, I do wonder which cookbook had the recipe.

review/text: These are great and I'll be ordering them again as I cannot get them locally anymore. There are other variations on the original but none that compare.<br /><br />Evidently, some mis-directed marketing bloke must have thought they could increase market share by modifying the original corn nuts into something more "corn chip like" (taste like corn chips). Not sure it it was the same guy who is pushing the different flavors but the ones I ordered here, these are the great original and they taste the same as when the packing told a story about how Native Americans (but it was so long ago I'm not sure they said it exactly that way) used to make these and take them on long journeys to live off of. I was happy to be able to find these again via Clinton's Vice President's invention.

review/text: This was definitely a wonderful find. Chili in a half an hour? I will take it! I am a working woman and appreciate a tasty, quick and easy shortcut when it comes to feeding my family. I like it as a chili with ground beef or turkey, using the recipe on the back of the jar. But my favorite way to use it is to make spicy pulled pork - I just cut up a couple of pounds pork shoulder, brown it well, pour the sauce over it, add a few chipotle peppers and a couple of tablespoons of adobo sauce from the same can and let it simmer until the pork is tender. You can serve it over rice or on a bun. Yam-yam! I am going to have to try the green chili now.

review/text: I was visiting my brother in Texas and as always I had to go to that wonderful HEB store by his house.  Demonstrators were serving up this chili so I tried it and OMG, had to have it.  It was spicy picant to perfection, delicious, and so easy to use.  Just brown ground meat with chopped fine onions (I used ground pork) and when that is ready add the already prepared chili mix in the jar.  I added a little water as it was too thick for me.  When the sauce is hot, your chili is ready.  I wish I had bought a whole bunch of jars but I just bought one.  I give it an A+

review/text: I guess I have developed somewhat rarified tastes for gummy candies after sampling any number of Haribo products from Amazon. Most of those experimental purchases were a success, so when these jet planes turned up at an unbelievable sale price, I couldn't resist. Regrettably I was really repelled by these. The soft texture was agreeable, but they had a decidedly nasty, synthetic, plastic-y taste---unlike the Haribo products, which seem to all have fruity, pleasant flavors. Quickly donated all ten pounds of them to my office co-workers, who will eat anything.

review/summary: Watch out for feline struvite crystals
review/text: This is a difficult review to write. Let me start out by saying that I think this is a good product. My cat certainly loves this food very much, and she has been very happy eating it for the past several years.<br /><br />That being said, my 7-year old cat developed feline struvite crystals (bladder stones) while on this food. That does not mean your cat will get them; I am just offering my short story so you can observe your cat, monitor for symptoms and make the best decision on what food to buy.<br /><br />The first time she got bladder stones was over a year ago, and it required expensive surgery to remove them (one stone had broken in half). The question was, why did the stone form in an otherwise healthy cat? I refused to believe it was the food, so I thought she must not be drinking enough water (the vet agreed this was the alternative). Since then she has a pet fountain, and I have added water to her food (making it like an alphabet soup of sorts). She loved it. She would eat all her food, and drink the water to the bottom (because it tastes like this food!). Unfortunately, the problem has returned. If she doesn't pass the stone soon, surgery will be required again. This time, I must take her off this food entirely, not just supplement it with something I think might help.<br /><br />Please monitor your cat for symptoms and pay attention to their needs. I'm sure you already do that since you are reading the reviews for these products. Just my 2c.

review/summary: Food for picky cats--and owners
review/text: I first tried this food as a treat for my cats many years ago. As soon as they tasted it, however, they went on a food strike and wouldn't touch their old kibble again. So I started buying this kibble, first at Trader Joe's (which has a good price), and then later directly from the manufacturer (a single 30-pound bag for $55; no shipping fees; we store the food in a bucket with a sealed lid that spins open). Their coats got glossier and their coat colors richer and more intense than they had ever been.<br /><br />Recently, we put three of our cats on special diets. Two are on Hill's Science Diet C/D because they both had urinary blockages and need a diet that keeps their urine acidic, and a third, our "old man" cat, is on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AT6FS">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Active Mature 28 Formula</a>, which has improved his mobility tremendously. The rest of our seven cats continue to thrive on Bench and Field.<br /><br />It is interesting how they all seem to know which kibble is "theirs"; I put the Royal Canin in one area, the Hill's in another, and the Bench and Field in a third, but there is nothing keeping the cats from trotting to another location in the house to eat if they want. We also keep their kibble dishes filled all the time. And yet they all stick to their own foods.

review/text: The same exact product is available directly from the maker, Bench and Field, for a price that is 40.3% lower per volume. You can buy a 30lb bag from benchandfield.com for $55.00 with free shipping, arriving in 5-days by UPS. This is a massive 40.3% discount! I repeat: 30lb @ $55 + free shipping = 40.3% less than Amazon.<br /><br />This is one of the healthiest pet food lines on the market. B&F uses only human consumption-USDA Grade A ingredients. Several key ingredients are sourced from Certified Organic Growers. All ingredients are sourced from the USA and they bake the kibble in Indiana at lower temperatures so as to avoid destruction of essential enzyme content.<br /><br />BUY THIS BRAND FOR YOUR CAT OR DOG, JUST BUY DIRECTLY FROM BENCHANDFIELD.COM SO YOU CAN GET THE BEST PRICE.<br />(The cost from B&F is even cheaper than buying at Trader Joes, which is a 24% discount from Amazon using Prime...just saying!)<br /><br />NOTE: I am a proud and happy Amazon Prime subscriber and in most cases the Amazon Prime deal is the best available price and convenience, bar none, on the web and in person. I feel confident that I glean benefits well beyond the $80/yr I pay for my Prime Membership. Free 2-day Shipping, Cloud Storage Benefits, Kindle Lending Library, Streaming Movies, and a lot more make me quite pleased with the value of my Prime subscription. I find very few 'for pay' web memberships worth joining. Amazon Prime, Britannica OnLine, and eMusic are the three that really stand out in terms of value, ease, clarity, return on investment, happiness, and utility.

review/summary: My cats think this is great stuff!
review/text: Have been feeding this cat food to my two cats for many years now.  Couldn't find it locally after we moved but luckily found it on Amazon.  Couldn't imagine life with them if they didn't have their favorite food to crunch on.  I leave it down all the time with fresh water and I often hear them crunching during the night.  Do feed them a little canned food also to give them a little variety but they do love their Bench & Field's.

review/text: Bottom Line is that this is the first healthy cat food I've been able to get my cats to eat since "Pet Promise" went out of business.<br /><br />Great stuff! No more throwing up, no more 'Friskies'(or as I call it, McDonalds).<br /><br />I've tried everything they sell at the local health food megastore with no luck.<br /><br />This Works.

review/summary: I've created a picky eater
review/text: I picked this cat food up one day after work (mainly because Trader Joe's was next to my old office), and my cat LOVED it.  Not only does he love it, he now refuses to eat any other food.  Better yet, he used to have a lot of problems with hairballs and throwing up.  This food helped that problem greatly.  Unfortunately, I moved further away from Trader Joes, but would still drive the 1:30 minutes to the nearest one and stock up on this cat food for our cat.  I can't begin to tell you how EXCITED I was to find it on AMAZON.  I know where I am getting his food from now on.  Thanks Amazon.

review/text: We have three very different and fussy cats and Bench & Field's Holistic feline formula satisfied them all.  One cat has been on very expensive "bladder control" formula for a long time.  Since we introduced this product four months ago she has had no bladder problems.  The only down side of this product is they all love it and beg for more.

review/summary: High quality, all natural cat food
review/text: I had been looking for a cat food that is complete yet all-natural.  I had been buying various Purina diets from my vet for years, thinking these were the highest quality pet foods available.  But I came to realize that chemicals and meat by-products were just as common in these foods as in cheaper foods.  My cats love this food.  There is a money back guarantee in case your cats don't like it, but you won't need it.

review/summary: The Best Between Doses
review/text: With the flu and cold season kicking into gear, I thought I'd give my opinion of the best cough drops on the market:  Halls Mentho-Lyptus.  When taking cold or flu medicine, everybody knows that the closer it gets to your next dose, coughs, throat irritation, and congestion get worse.  Halls helps suppress those symptoms just a little bit longer.  They are especially good at clearing nasal passages and suppressing coughs.  While I'm a fan of the original flavor, there are plenty to choose from.  The standard flavors like cherry and strawberry are there, but new flavors like Canada Dry Ginger Ale are also available.<br /><br />While there are plenty of cough drops on the market to choose from, Halls, in my opinion, has always been a step above the rest of them.  I highly recommend Halls Mentho-Lyptus cough drops.

review/summary: nutty cocoa rather than hazelnut flavor
review/text: I think the Land O Lakes Raspberry Cocoa is wonderful w/either skim milk or water & I use about 1/3 package per drink. The comfort factor offsets the guilt from the occasional use of partially hydrogenated soybean oil contained within. I have tried the Land O Lakes Mint Cocoa & like it so I should have ordered that instead of the "hazelnut". I can smell the hazelnut but it just tastes "nutty", so a disappointment for me & I will not order this flavor again. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAUIEY">Land O Lakes, Cocoa Mix Classic Hazelnut, 1.25-Ounce (12 Pack)</a>

review/text: I use oat bran in baking and added to yogurt. Other brands of oat bran have been too coarse for me and moved food through my body too fast. This oat bran is not as coarse, but more soft-textured, though not as fine as some brands. I highly recommend it for baking or stirred into yogurt and eaten raw. I don't live near a store that regularly stocks oat bran, but ordering this via "Subscribe and Save" makes this priced competitively with any brick and mortar or online store.

review/summary: Perfect Morning Tea (Caffeinated)
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."<br /><br />Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Unusual, delicate yet flavorful.  I began developing cravings for it!
review/text: This is the perfect tea for breakfast or any time of the day. Numi's Yunnan Black tea has a distinctive aroma with a strong apricot top-note fortified by a nice oaky, grassy base. The brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex, slightly rich. There is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors. Excellent with a dash of cream. Unfortunately Numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box. It appears to have less caffeine than the usual English breakfast from its effect on this taster.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings".

review/text: I pre-ordered this item for my office and just got it.  It's really cute and got a ton of attention.  It works great!  I filled it with dark chocolate M&Ms but I am going to try it with some other foods too when the M&Ms are gone.  Much better than having someone's dirty hands in my candy bowl!  I also like that it's green - you don't have to buy everything wrapped in plastic just to keep it clean.  I really like the look of it. It has three sizes - small hand, big hand, and bowl - so you can control how much candy comes out.  I'm going to let my daughter take it to school for show and tell, I think the kids will really get a kick out of it.  This is a great idea for gifts too!

I have not had any laying on the table in the morning.  I did have some trouble loading peanut M&Ms it seemed to jam up so I chose to use smaller candies with all having the same shape and it works much better for me.  The red color of the machine is not bright red but it is not maroon either; it is more a deep red.<br />I really like the machine and it solves all my candy woes at work.  The item was delivered timely without problems.  I'd do it again.

It would be nice if it had more settings, smaller preferred.<br /><br />If you mix the candy and make something like trail mix, the small setting is OK.<br /><br />The silver base makes any dropped candy roll off the counter.<br /><br />The motion detector is fairly sensitive but you have to be careful wiping down the counter or it will dump a handful of candy on the countertop or floor.<br /><br />It is easy to clean since the clear top comes off, followed by the floor and then the auger that feeds the candy.

Also the batteries have held up reasonably.<br /><br />Pros: less germs, slows down some candy ninjas, motion-activation works great, looks pretty good, office workers love it, holds a lot of product<br /><br />Cons: Jams on pretzel M&M's and Almond M&M's, sometimes dribbles, some morons can't figure out the motion activation or don't catch the candy when it comes out<br /><br />Recommendations: Almonds work great and are a bit healthier than candy. Peanut and plain M&Ms work fine but people eat them quick. Skittles are fairly cheap and look nice, but people don't like them much so they go slowly. Place the candyman on a large paper plate with a rim to catch the dribbles and candy from dolts who take their hand away too quickly.

review/summary: So much fun!
review/text: I have this machine in my office.  It is a huge hit with my co-workers, have to keep re-filling!  Also, dangerous to have filled with candy I like!  Works very well and I know of two others who have one as well.  No one has had any mechanical issues.  Go ahead and get it, you will love it!

review/summary: Best invention ever!
review/text: I bought this candy machine for the office to replace a gumball machine.  I had been looking around for a while to get something that could be easy to get candy/snacks from while protecting the contents from less than clean hands.  The big benefit is that everyone loves to run their hands underneath to get their prize!  I would recommend it hightly for any office setting.
