review/summary: Didn't enjoy it as much as I'll like to
review/text: Ordered this right at the end of November and was surprised to see that the expiry date was the first week of March. I ended up giving them away at a party in January because I don't think my two young children would be able to finish the many packets before March. Also, many packets had biscuits in them that were badly broken up. I guess this is not a good item to be ordered online and delivered.  Will stick to buying these biscuits from the supermarket.<br /><br />On a positive note, I did enjoy the variety that this box of biscuits/cookies provided. However, I don't think I will be ordering them online again.

review/text: My puppy loved these treats. They were just the right size for her. They have just enough rawhide to keep my puppy entertained and happy without having too much to be bad for her. They did not upset her stomach as some of the other reviewers have stated. I also gave them to my moms two dogs and they didn't have any stomach problems with them either. Every dog is different so what works for my puppy may not work for yours. Just try these treats and I hope your dogs is just as happy with them as mine was.

She is getting more discriminate in her old age but she was eager to tear into this treat. For about an hour she went off and chewed it. Since then she hasn't touched them. I find them laying around the house. She just snubs her nose at them.

review/summary: My dogs don't like peanut butter much I guess...
review/text: I wish my 3 dogs would have liked these more, but none of them really likes peanut butter, so these were just okay.  I wanted them to like them because they're good for them, but, although they ate them, they didn't treat them like anything special.  Usually if they get a treat they really like they run off with them, each to a separate area.  These, they took, and eventually ate, but they didn't hide them, or run off with them.  These are probably great for dogs that love peanut butter, but not one of my dogs does.<br /><br />If your dog likes peanut butter treats, I'd definitely give these a try, but I won't be buying these for my picky dogs.

review/summary: Dog gone good
review/text: I gave this chew to a labrador.  It was probably a little small for him as he was able to put the whole item into his mouth and choked on it once.  It took him approximately twenty minutes to consume the whole treat.<br /><br />The fun bites have a hard rawhide outside and a softer center.  I liked that it was not a messy product; there were only a few crumbs left behind.  It does not have a strong odor.<br /><br />Not sure about the "digestive support", the dog got the squirts later but he seems to have a sensitive stomach and that often happens when a new item is introduced into his diet.<br /><br />Update - 8/4/11 - The labrador mentioned was just diagnosed with a bad pancreas, so this product neither helped or hurt his issue. He is now on a special diet for his lifetime.

review/summary: Not for small dogs
review/text: These treats might be fine for larger dogs, but they were not good for my 13-pound miniature poodle.<br /><br />At first he wasn't really sure what to do with it, but he finally started chewing on it. The outer rawhide separated and the dark center came out. My dog abandoned the rawhide at that point and concentrated on the flavored "filling." The package says one per day for a dog of his size, but I should not have let him finish it. Although he didn't throw up the treat, he seemed to be a little "off" after eating it, as if he wasn't feeling very well.<br /><br />These are probably OK for a large dog, but I will not give another to my miniature poodle. And I would not feed even a large dog more than one a day, despite the package recommendation.

review/summary: Keeps Your Pup Busy for a While
review/text: I have a beagle mix who is about 6 months old so constantly chewing everything.  Most dog treats (even the solid rawhide pieces) don't last long enough and she ends up begging for more right away or moving on to my shoes.  The miniCongo chews are larger than I expected and quite a bit heftier.  I don't think she quite knew what to do with it the first time I gave her one.  She quickly figured it out, however, and spent well over an hour working on it.  She really seems to like the flavor of the filling.  Now, when she sees me reaching for one, she starts licking her lips in anticipation.<br />I was really impressed with the quality of this product and the fact that it provides digestive support is a definite plus.  I will be buying this product again for my dog and would recommend it to anyone who has a medium to large breed of dog.  It's a bit too large for the smaller breeds.

review/text: If our dog could talk he would tell you how much he appreciate these leathery treats that taste of peanut butter and contain papain to assist in digesting the hide.  Whenever I give him one he takes possession of it eagerly and goes to work on it.  Usually he takes a break in the middle but then he'll go back and work on it some more.  On one occasion, he had a bone that he really shouldn't be chewing but he willingly surrendered the chop bone for one of these treats.

review/summary: Not so mini! Pomeranian not impressed at all!
review/text: I rarely give 1 star reviews, but how do you rate it higher if it does...nothing?<br /><br />First of all, I was a little surprised by how large these "mini-Congos" are.  We have an 8-pound Pomeranian and the only reason I chose these is because of the word, "mini".<br /><br />The "mini-Congo" is a full inch in roundness and about 3.5" long.  When you go to the pet store and buy "mini" treats, they are about the size of a matchbook or so.  This seriously looks like something for a medium-large sized dog.  I can only imagine a regular "congo" is enormous, heh.<br /><br />But all dogs love bones and they all love to chew on something, right?  Well our Pomeranian is not impressed.  He looked at it, licked it for a little bit and left it alone.<br /><br />We also give him these "dental sticks" and he hates them (well he doesn't devour them like he does a real treat).  He will lick them and put them away for awhile and if we don't give him any treats for a couple days, he'll go ahead and eat the dental stick.<br /><br />Well it's been over a week now and he won't go near the "mini-Congo" treat at all, in fact he'd rather go eat the "dental stick" he doesn't like.<br /><br />So it is confirmed, our dog simply does not like these, plus he can't even put his bite around it to begin with.  Caution - these are not so "mini" for your "mini" dog like our Pomeranian.<br /><br />Two paws down says Chocco.

review/summary: Decent dog treats
review/text: These are dog treats. I have given them to my dog, and he enjoys them - he will lay down and chew and nibble until they are gone. However, he will do that with the ones I make here at home, too. I have not necessarily seen any "digestive support" effects, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars. For what they are (dog treats), they seem just fine - as specialty treats that are supposed to be helpful to dogs, they don't seem to be living up to the claim. Whether or not I would buy these would probably depend pretty much on price - they aren't worth paying a premium for the "digestive support" claim, but if they have a decent price as plain dog treats, then I can see purchasing them every so often to have around.<br /><br />Editing to Add: I make it a habit not to look at others' reviews before I type mine, so I wasn't aware of the issues with smaller dogs. My dog is a medium-size dog (Blue Heeler Mix), and he didn't appear to have any issues with chewing, swallowing or digesting. Knowing that others are having issues, I will probably not give my dog any more, just to be on the safe side - a massively expensive vet bill is not something I want to encourage! I will leave my 3-star review as it stands, since I did not personally experience any difficulties, but can say in all honesty that I will not purchase these in the future.

review/summary: All the dogs LOVED these treats
review/text: I have two finicky dogs. They are particular about their snacks and food and while they will like something at first, they will not like it later on. Frustrating, but reality. So I gave two of these treats with my friends dogs to see their reaction as well.<br /><br />I have a schnauzer/poodle mix and a jack russell/chihuahua mix? I am sure about the schnauzer poodle and not totally sure about the jack russell/chihuahua as they are rescues. But they are about around 18 months old and 10-12 pounds; they both enjoyed the first rounds of treats TREMENDOUSLY. I mean, sat down and chewed on them for HOURS. Which is amazing because they are both such active dogs. Also, they did not have gas or digestion problems after eating, which was great.<br /><br />My friend gave the treats to her yorkie and bulldog and they loved them too. She said that it was the first time that her bulldog has growled, ever and he is three years old. They also did not have gas or digestion problems.<br /><br />Now, the real test - the other three treats for my dogs. Would they eat them or lose interest? They chewed them and loved them just as much as the first time. Okay, maybe not quite as much, because they lasted longer the second time, but still had the same great results.<br /><br />I would not give these  treats to my dogs on a regular basis, just because I don't believe in lots of treats. But on special occasions these are the treats I will be ordering. They loved them and their digestion did not change. I highly recommend these treats!

review/summary: They don't like 'em . . . .
review/text: I can't really speak to the digestive support benefits of this product.  I'll assume it works, but only if you can force your dog to eat these.  My experience:<br /><br />I gave one each to my obese Jack Russell (Gizmo)and blind diabetic quasi-chihuahua (Bruiser).  These guys are true chow hounds and general treat fanatics.  Gizmo had to work hard to finally get his softened up and eaten.  (He has big, strong jaws).  Bruiser couldn't even scratch the surface on his.  He finally discarded it, and Gizmo (a treat thief) wasn't even intterested in it.  I put the treat back in the package unscathed.<br /><br />Plan B -  I introduced these to my daughter's two large and very hungry ex-racer greyhouds, Mosche and Canova.  Mosche (the bigger stronger of the two) examined his and abandoned it.  Canova struggled through his with little enthusiasm.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews describing digestive problems brought on by these, I'm not going to even take a chance.  The dogs don't like 'em anyway so into the trash with what's left.  Thumbs down on this one.

review/summary: dog likes 'em
review/text: These are 4" in. long dog treats with a 'center' of chewy material. The outside coating is made of raw hide. They are not greasy to the touch and come in a resealable pouch. The dog enjoys tearing open the raw hide and eating the centers, but she does not go crazy over them like she does other dog treats. She generally leaves the raw hide behind after she has eaten the center which is a bit messy. I noticed the dogs stool getting very soft. Not sure if this is due to the the "digestive support" built into the product. I will report more later.

review/summary: Too big for small dogs...but my pup loved them
review/text: Who doesn't love Peanut Butter?  My pup sure does.  She chewed and chewed on these "mini" congos.  She is generally pretty picky but definitely gives these 2 paws up.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the recommendations on the packaging.  They say they are for small dogs, once a day and there isn't much mini about them.  I took it away from her after awhile because I felt a whole one of these is just too much for a small to medium dog.  They are probably a good size for larger breeds.  You might want to pace your little one on these.  Unlike several comments on here, she did not experience any digestive problems but that might be because I didn't give her the whole thing at once.<br /><br />Overall, she liked them and I would recommend them.  Just use with caution.  Remember you are the best advocate for your pet.

review/text: FunBites MiniCongo's for digestive support are the perfect size treat for my 30lbs mutt, Tuna.  She went nuts over them, and think it is because of the peanut butter flavor.  She had quite a few hours of fun.<br /><br />Like other FunBite products they are a huge mess.  There are large chunks all over the place! Unlike other treats, Tuna did not go back to lick up her crumbs, she just abandoned them.  I though this was odd.  Also, I am not sure exactly how these are supposed to sooth digestion, but it seems to give Tuna diarrhea.<br /><br />She liked them, but it does not look like they liked her.  I am not sure if I can give her any more, especially now that I see all these other reviews.  Please use your best judgment and monitor your dog after use.

review/text: I have 2 lab mixes roughly 70 lbs each and they loved these treats. We didn't have any digestive troubles from either dog, they both came running when they heard the package crinkling. These are the only chews we've ever given one dog that she started chewing immediately, everything else we've given her has been given careful consideration for a few minutes before she ate it. My only complaints were that they were a bit messy (although the dogs found every crumb) and that having an odd number in the package meant that one dog had to be bribed with a different treat at the end of the package.

review/summary: Healthy dog treats
review/text: My dogs like them, but they are really messy!! The middle part crumbles all over the place and the dogs don't seem to eat it off the floor once it comes out of the middle. So I was left with a huge mess on my hands, having given this to all 3 dogs at the same time. However, I did make the mistake of giving it to them in a room where there are rugs, so the crumbled pieces were everywhere. Maybe had I limited them to a room where there are hardwood floors or tile, it wouldn't have seemed like such a project to clean up, but it literally took me 20 minutes or more to vacuum up. I can't really report if these actually helped their digestion in anyway because I didn't really see a difference, but not sure that I really ever would. I will buy some more of these, but I will definately only give it to them once inawhile or give it to them in a place where there are no rugs.

review/summary: Not Too Sure
review/text: I have 3 dogs - a Grey Hound, a Boston Terrier, and a Chihuahua/Rat Terrier mix.  They all love various kinds of treats, and will also chew on generic rawhide when I purchase them sometimes.  Due to the size of the FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support chew, it is only appropriate for my medium and large dogs.  (They are too hard to break in half for the small dog, which is what I've done sometimes with other kinds of treats.)  As to my 2 larger dogs liking the FunBites, I'm not too sure.  Both the Grey Hound and the Boston Terrier will carry their FunBites around sometimes and guard them, but they will not chew on them.  They've had them for over a week now, and I have even left a FunBite in their kennels for them to chew on whenever I have had to leave them in there.  All the FunBites are still intact.  Therefore, I cannot recommend FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support, since my dogs will not chew on them.

review/summary: My Chihuahua loves them, kept her busy for nearly 5 hours
review/text: We have two Chihuahua's. One is 12 years old now she won't chew on toys, rawhides or bones of any sort. It was no big surprise that she wouldn't touch it. My other Chihuahua is only 2 years old and will chew on almost any type of rawhide or bone. Over the long 4th of July weekend she was driving us crazy because she wouldn't stop barking and growling at all the fireworks. She is scared to death of fireworks and will shake like crazy and go nuts. So I decided to give her one of these to keep her busy for a while.<br /><br />She loved it and wouldn't put it down for nearly 5 hours. She pretty much ignored the fireworks for the rest of the night and went to town on devouring the MiniCongo. Occasionally she would decide to take a break and walk away but she wouldn't take her eye off it. If I would walk near it or our other dog would approach it then she would pounce on it and guard it with her life. She seemed to really love the peanut butter filling inside because she kept trying to lick inside before chewing the beefhide.<br /><br />About a month ago we gave her a Purina Busy Bone which is similar to this and she loved it as well. It has filling in the middle too. The difference is the Busy Bone really upset her stomach for 24 hours or so and the MiniCongo didn't.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by Mini in the name because these are still quite large. It is probably too big for our Chihuahua but that didn't stop her. I am happy to give these to my dog because they do a good job of cleaning their teeth. The more chewing they do now, the better their dental health will be when they get older.

review/summary: Neighbor's dog loved them
review/text: I miss-read the label and thought they would be good treats for my 4-pound Yorkie and 5-pound Maltese. Problem was, the treats were nearly the same size as the dogs. They might have liked them but there was no way they could have eaten them.<br /><br />So I gave them to the neighbor who has a German Shepherd. The 90-pound dog ate them down as if they were M&Ms. I think the dog would have given me a thumbs up if, of course, he had thumbs.

review/summary: Dogs fought eacn other to get them
review/text: The dogs love, really love these things.  We have two Yorkies and they were climbing all over each other to get the treats.  Normally this would be a good thing, however we have two concerns.  The first is a concern over eating so much rawhide and what it might do to their digestive tracts.  Taking it away from them in the middle of consuming it is a bit traumatic for both of us.  The second is there is a rawhide shell filled with something.,  It seems like a lot for little dogs.  For the time being, I've been cutting them smaller on the band-saw, however you can only go so small before you fear they will swallow it whole.  I'd like to see these in a thinner form at this same length.  That would provide less for the dog to consume.  On the other hand, if you have dogs over 10 pounds or so, they should love these.

review/summary: A-OK from my Dog
review/text: The first time I gave one of these to my dog, she didn't get up until she finished it.  We like to give our dog rawhide as a treat instead of softer treats such as Beggin' Strips and she really seemed to enjoy this.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it leaves a mess.  We've decided to only give it to her outside because little niblets get all in the carpet.

review/summary: Not for my geriatric dog with gastrointestinal problems
review/text: My elderly 13+ year dog has experienced gastrointestinal issues for the last two years and I have to be very selective in my choice of treats. I was hopeful this digestive support treat would work out. I gave him one a week for 4 weeks and every time, within 12 hours, an incident followed. Though I can't directly connect the two (treat=incident), 4 timing  coincidences was enough for me to stop short of giving him the last 2 treats.<br /><br />He LOVED them ... which is why I gave them two, and not one, stars. But for a treat advertised as providing digestive support, at least for my dog, this is a 2 star product.

He loves them and I gave him one a day.<br /><br />He normally has a digestion problem, stopping to eat grass almost each time I walk him.  I can honestly say that while he still stops to chew grass when I walk him, it's only a nibble here and there whereas previously, he'd "graze" like a cow.<br /><br />I'm ordering more.

Finally, a safe, longer-lasting chew that doesn't smell bad, stain the rugs, or leave offensive debris. My dogs go crazy each time they see me take out the package and don't let up until they've finished the last satisfying (to them, anyway) crumb.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon has more in stock soon so we can buy some more.

review/text: My dog is excited about the treat but hasn't finished one. That is not the norm for her. She loves her treats and will spend hours working on them. This one she goes to but never makes much of a dent into it.  So I can say it last a long time. I can't say she loves them.  I like feeding her a treat that is good for her.

review/summary: Awesomeness with a warning
review/text: I gave one to each of my dogs.  The little one, under 10 lbs, took a sniff and dropped it.  The thing was almost as big as her so it isnt for small dogs.  My medium dog couldnt get his mouth around it either and he is about 20 lbs.  On the flip side, my 50 lb dog tore the thing apart like there was no tomorrow.  He thought it was the coolest thing ever and chewed it to pieces.  In his opinion it was the coolest thing since sliced alpo.  Now, we must remember that these things would probably not be good for dogs under about 30 lbs.  I have a junkyard dog so I dont worry about his digestion because it is made of iron.  He did manage to plow through the treat in about 20 minutes.  As to the smaller dogs, they are out of luck I guess.  Anyway, it is a good item from the dogs sense.  They did all like the smell, and they did try to chew it up.  The little ones just were to lazy to try to get to the middle.  I will see if they eat more later.

review/summary: Too Big for Some Small Dogs
review/text: I've got a Shih Tzu and a Jack Russell mix. I had no idea how large these FunBites were. After receiving the package, I realized it was too large for the Shih Tzu. He and the Jack Russell mix are the same size, but the mix is younger and has a larger mouth. I didn't even try to give it to the elderly Shih Tzu.<br /><br />The other guy liked it very much. He carried it off and alternately chewed on it and hid it. He quickly got the coating off and essentially made it into two treats--a rawhide and a munchy. He sometimes has a sensitive stomach but had no problems with this one. It took him about 24 hours to devour the whole thing. I'll probably give him one a week.

review/summary: my dog approves!
review/text: My dog loves to chew, but can be picky about some of the chewy bones/treats I get for him. I myself detest the ones that have really strong smokey smells. These don't have any scent that bothers me, and my dog is liking them too. I have a Miniature Pinscher and so these large chews are going to last a long time for him (he's been working on the same one for a week now), making it a great value for small-medium dogs. I am sure larger dogs will chew through them much faster, but they are very thick and dense so will probably keep them busy and happy for a while. I don't smell any peanut butter scent, but my dog seems to enjoy whatever he smells and tastes. I would definitely get these again for my dog. Also, they are not messy. I recently got a different brand "busy bone" at the store and that made the worst mess! This one here is neat and tidy. Two thumbs up and four paws up. :)

review/summary: A Healthy Treat for your Dog
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:20 Mins<br /><br /></span>You can see for yourself our dog really enjoys the FunBites MiniCongo treats. It is difficult to access the "Digestive Support" other than to say he is same regular self and did not have any accidents in the house. One thing I did notice is that some treats - especially rawhide treats seem to make him very thirsty - that was not the case with the FunBites. He was able to chew on each treat for a few hours before he reduce it to nothing. Another nice thing i that it does not have any artificial  dyes or colorings, which is important because 1) Our dog is allergic to them 2) They can stain your carpet and furniture.<br /><br />Final Verdict - Our dog really seems to like them - and with any luck the digestive enzymes will do him a little good too!<br /><br />5 Stars

review/text: I wasn't sure how to really review these bones since, well, I wasn't willing to try them myself and my dogs, well, they will eat pretty much anything (recent snacks enjoyed by them include styroform packing, paperback books, and a really nice pair of sandals).  But actually these bones are great because they lasted quite a long time and I had a whole hour or so where my dogs were happily occupied and not trying to find more household items to destroy.  So I will certainly buy these bones for them again.

review/text: (And really, keeping a dachshund occupied for long enough to be useful is a bit of a challenge, so they win on that account alone). She was a little hesitant about the first one but with every subsequent FunBite, she's eaten them more and more quickly -- I think this speaks well of their quality, because she can be a little picky!<br /><br />These also don't leak anything all over the floor like some other chewies, which is great.

review/text: For once I have nothing to do with this product opinion. I left it all up to my dogs. I have two small dogs, a Chihuahua and a Min Pin. Both completely ignored the FunBites MiniCongo treats when I first gave them one. But after a day the Min Pin started going to work on it. She seems to like them but probably wouldn't bite me if I tried to take it away. The Chihuahua could care less and shows no interest at all. There seems to no health concerns yet but I'm keeping an eye on them.

review/summary: A typical rawhide dog treat.
review/text: These FunBites treats are a typical rawhide dog treat. They are cylinders, about 5-inches long with about a 1-inch diameter, and are stuffed with hard, brown filling.<br /><br />You get seven of them in a pack, and I guess the idea is to let your dog chew on them for awhile so that his or her teeth get nice and clean. Given their girth, I imagine this would take awhile for most dogs to get through, so it should give your dog something to do for an hour or two when you're away. But apparently the big selling point of the product is its "digestive support" which it apparently gets this property by containing papain enzyme - that may mean more to you than it does to me. It's also apparently "low fat" which according to the nutritional information means that it contains somewhere between 0.5% - 3.5% 'crude fat.'<br /><br />However, my dog's digestion and fat consumption are not problematic, so what really matters to me is whether he likes it... which he doesn't. I can't blame FunBites very much, he's generally not a fan of rawhide treats, but I was hoping their "delicious peanut butter flavor" would get him interested. Unfortunately, he just licked the treat a couple of times and walked away.<br /><br />That said, if this is the type of treat you think your dog might like then you may want to give it a whirl - especially if you're overly concerned about digestive issues (though other reviewers have apparently had problems, so be careful).

review/summary: Maggie the mostly lab loved them!
review/text: Now I will confess, I'm not quite sure how a human reviews a dog treat.  But I will tell you that Maggie my mostly lab (pound puppy of some questionable lineage) took to these like they were candy.<br /><br />When I buy this sort of treat for her, I'm looking for a few traits:<br /><br />They last longer than 30 seconds.  Maggie's a big girl and she has very powerful jaws.  So most treats are here for a blink of an eye.  But she had to work on this one for a bit.  I'm not saying they lasted an hour -- but it took her a good 5 or 10 minutes to eat the whole thing.<br /><br />They don't come back up.  With just about every dog I've owned my entire life -- some treats, like rawhides, seem to re-appear within a few hours.  I want my pet to have a treat she can enjoy once...not have it come back up again because it irritated her stomach.<br /><br />They don't stink.  Maggie (and most of my previous dogs) loved the cow hoof shavings.  But the stench is so unbearable, I had to stop bringing them into the house.  These are odor-free.<br /><br />Overall -- these were a big hit with both of us!

review/text: I received the miniCongo dog treats as part of the Amazon Vine program.  Our dog Scampers really liked the treats.  They are really big so a Pomeranian of 10 pounds was about the minimum size for the treats.  They would be too big for real small dogs.  They looked to be very healthy.  They have a lot of protein and seem to be very healthy.  The package states that they are good for a dog's digestive system.  You get six in a bag so they should last a long time.<br /><br />John Navarra

review/summary: Confusing at first...
review/text: With a 50 pound boxer/pit, finding an effective and lasting treat is a bit of a challenge. My playful, lovable monster can routinely destroy pillows, blankets, and kong bars with the greatest of ease. So I tossed her one of these, expecting it to be demolished within minutes.<br /><br />And she put it in her mouth, spit it out, and looked confused for a few minutes. A day later, I tried again. Same result. The day after that? Finally she bit into it, cracking its exterior and devoured whatever was inside. Now that she's figured out what to do with them, these actually have some use - preventing the rest of our house from being her chew toy.<br /><br />This is definitely something made for larger dogs. The exterior of the MiniCongo is rigid and bone-like, so much so that I think only large dogs could really break into these suckers effectively. If you have a pup or a toy dog, I wouldn't recommend them. Our little monster has a delicate stomach and so far I can't attribute any mood changes / digestive changes to this. Not a bad little product, provided your dog is smart / large enough to really get their teeth around them!

review/summary: Treats my dog likes!
review/text: I have a very cute 10 lb. Jack Russell/dachshund mix.  She either carries treats off to "bury" them somewhere in the house(if they aren't quite to her liking), or eats them right away(if they are good to her!).  These are a little big for her, but she loves them.  Thankfully, it did take her a couple of hours to munch her way through one of these.  There seemed to be no ill after effects.  She is quite young (only  1.5 years) so her teeth are still lovely and very clean.  I hope these "digestive" aids will help her teeth, I'd like to keep them that way.  The "Mini" might be a bit of a misnomer for those of us with smaller dogs--it isn't huge, but still, a little big of a treat for one day, and it is a little hard to take stuff away after they've started eating them!

review/summary: Not sure about digestive support, but the dogs like them.
review/text: I read some of the negative reviews due to digestive issues with concern, but decided to try these on my dogs since my dogs are extra large with cast iron stomachs. My dogs are Irish Wolfhounds and even with their size, rawhide is not recommended in large amounts. These had a small amount of rawhide with filler. One dog is a food-aholic and the other is picky. The picky dog liked them, the food-aholic thought they were so-so--how could I tell--he didn't need me to say "gentle" to save my fingers from a chomp.<br /><br />If your dog can digest these, it is a nice treat for them. Although they didn't provide the Wolfhounds with much of a rawhide chewing challenge as they had them ingested within a minute or less, they did like the filler. Didn't notice any change in their digestive systems, breath or with the male his, ummm, flatulance issues, but the dogs were happy and that made me happy.

review/summary: Our three canine testers have mixed opinions
review/text: Our trio of canine treat testers have mixed opinions about the palatability of this product.  Yesterday I gave one FunBite stick to each dog.  Gypsy, my female Shepherd cross, dropped hers on the floor and ignored it.  Jasmine, my female Collie cross, took hers back in her sleeping area in the indoor back porch, but come morning today, it was still untouched.  Sherlock, my male minature Schnauzer, absolutely LOVED his -- by morning he had gotten all the filling out and reduced the rawhide to a soggy chewy lump, which he has now eaten.  Of course, he's always been more of a chewer than his 2 pals, and he is also a smaller dog, so maybe it was easier for him to hold the treat between his paws?  At any rate, he will get the rest of the package eventually, but I'm not likely to buy any more.<br /><br />It's hard to say just why a dog does or does not like something.  Jasmine loves the raw eggs from my pet goose, while Gypsy will not touch them, but loves raw chicken eggs.  And all three dogs love matzah, which seems REALLY odd, since it is rather dry and tasteless.  Anyway, back to the FunBites, I guess you will just have to try them with your own dog(s) and see what happens.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After reading some of the other reviews here, I want to say that Sherlock doesn't seem to have any bad side affects from eating this, but then, he's always been something of a garbage can who eats anything (He's a rescue dog, knew serious hunger before we got him, so he is not picky about food -- ANY food.  If he had been a dog with a sensitive stomach, he never would have survived what he went through before we got him.  So he may not be a typical case here.)  But it does make me wonder if my other dogs somehow knew it was not right for them.

review/summary: The pups seem to like them
review/text: Our Standard Schnauzer wants that peanut butter pretty bad.  She's not one for rawhides or treats that involve work.  The mini Schnauzer only seems to like meat treats.  Jack (our mini) would take the treat, chew the rawhide and crack it.  Pepper (the standard) would steal the peanut butter treat out and then Jack would go back to eating the rawhide.  These are about four inches long and about an inch or so around.  The outside is like a rawhide and the inside seems to be the peanut butter and something treat.  After just a few chews I really couldn't tell you if the dogs were exhibiting better digestive support, but they seem to be enjoying them and sharing nicely.  I would assume that we will purchase them again.  I would, however, like it if Jack would eat his whole treat he seems to have some digestive issues.

review/summary: Even The MiniCongos are Too Difficult For My Lab Mix To Eat
review/text: I thought maybe these FunBites MiniCongo treats would be small enough for my lab mix. He certainly liked the idea of them. He carried them over to the rug where he eats his treats, and then put it down. I could tell that he was interested, but this is a very hard treat, and even the "Mini" is too large for him.<br /><br />I picked it up and started to put it somewhere for another of our family dogs, one who needs this kind of treat to keep her from chewing on her leg, and my lab let me know he wanted the MiniCongo right where he had put it.<br /><br />So, it's still there. I'm not sure why, but that's where he wants it. He can't do anything with it, so I'm going to grab it when he isn't looking and get it to the dog who will be able to do something with it.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars, because although it doesn't work for our lab mix, this is probably a very good choice for other dogs. It's more of a problem with him than with the treat.<br /><br />EDITED to say that my son's dog, a shepherd, loves these! He gave her one of the larger ones, not the "Mini", and she just carried it to the area where she takes treats and sniffed at it, trying to figure out exactly what she was going to do with it. When he came back a few minutes later, it was gone. These "MiniCongos" are built exactly the same, but they are cut in half, still too big for my lab mix, but either size will be perfect for the Shepherd.

review/text: I'm not the one who ate the product, but I am the one who had to clean up the vomit after the product was eaten.<br /><br />I offered these new chews to my dog and at first he couldn't have cared less about them.  For the record he loves chews, they are his drug of choice. I thought maybe he was just reluctant to try something new so I left the chew out for him.  A little while later he ate it and seemed to enjoy himself but afterward threw up twice.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the problem with these chews is but I won't be buying any for my dog and I certainly won't be recommending them to anyone else for theirs.  I thought about giving the remaining chews to the SPCA for their dogs but then decided against it, what if it makes their poochies sick to? Sadly I had to throw the rest away.

She has shown no hesitation when being given one of these treats and I have not found one left on the floor yet.  I am not able to comment on their claimed digestive abilities, other than than to say that I have not had any visible issues with it.  The bones in this bag are approximately 1"x3" in size and are rated for Medium and up dogs.  Our Yorkie seems to enjoy them and I would get them again in the future.

review/text: Gave these treats to our 2 greyhounds.  They chewed and ate a bit of the beefhide outer wrapping, but learned quickly to just mash it and make the filling come out. Once that trick was learned, they left the wrapping for me to clean up.  Our female has had an upset tummy, very gassy, so I am not sure if the treat contributed to this or not.  However it was the "new" thing added to the diet, so it is suspect.

review/text: Miko and Sparky give Fun Bites a 2 paws up rating! They loved these chews! Each of them ran off to their secret hiding places to munch on these, and didn't come out until they were finished. It's only special treats that warrant the running off to fully savor.

review/summary: Odd
review/text: These are a strange shape, and my dog couldn't quite figure out how to eat them.  We keep her lean, not feeding her much, and she always scarfs up any little molecule that happens to fall.  Not so with this.  She carried it around for a while, and then finally crunched it down.  Not the best treat.

review/summary: My dog says "5 Stars"
review/text: My Golden Retriever loves these treats that I received through the Amazon Vine Program.  So does my Bichon, although  they are  a little big for him (10 pounds).  But he carried it around  & chewed on it daring anyone to come near.  I'm not sure if he is going to be able to eat it because of its  size , but he is protective of it.  DJ, the retriever ate his immediately & came back for more.  So far, their stomachs haven't been upset, so hopefully they will be good for their digestive system & not just another treat.  I  would  buy these again.

review/summary: Dogs Liked Them!
review/text: I can't say how much these actually help my dogs' digestive system, but before I opened the bag my two dogs were sniffing and nosing at it. I gave one to each and they gnawed on them with relish. The bag claims to have enzymes to help clean the teeth, which would be a definite plus. I have read the other reviews and I can say neither dog had an upset stomach. However, both dogs are one hundred pounds plus and have have fairly strong stomachs.

review/summary: FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support
review/text: Well, the dogs (basset, golden and retriever) loved these! It took them about 30 minutes to completely finish these. I liked the quiet in the house. The bad part, these are not super nutritious and these contain grains, which can cause problems for dogs. Now, if this is for digestion, I wonder why all three dogs had the worst gas ever. The only thing different in their diet for the day was these FunBites. They are not normally gassy. This leads me to believe it was caused by this treat. Beware.

review/summary: so far, sooooooo good
review/text: EDIT: After reading other reviews, it seems hit and miss about the quality of these rolls. Be sure to read the one-star reviews. I don't know if the reactions are breed specific.  My old dog is a Rottweiler and the young one is a Cocker Spaniel who gets the runs from who knows what she has gotten into. She did not have a bad reaction to this product.  However after reading about other dog reactions, and since I got these free through vine so no financial investment, I am going to throw away the rest of the bag.<br /><br />I presented my two dogs each with a roll, which they both accepted, mainly because they are dogs not cats.<br />The roll is white rawhide wrapped around that crumbly mix used frequently to stuff these products.<br />One roll did not have a complete wrapper.  My old dog quickly removed the wrapper and ate the center.  The younger dog, a cocker, took the wrapper. I don't think that she ate it all, but it is out of sight at this point, probably hidden with other treasures.<br />The cocker chewed one end of her roll. When I found it later, the insides had moved a distance out one end equal to the distance on the other end that the dog had chewed.  The whole thing has since disappeared. See previous paragraph.<br /><br />Evaluation: For my dogs, one old and one under 25 pounds, the rolls are a pleasant challenge over several days.  If your dog has strong young jaws, it can probably eat one roll in just a few minutes.  I don't know about the digestive support.  Neither dog threw up or had GI distress.  At the rate they are consuming these (very slowly for intact rolls), I don't see how the rolls can have an effect on digestion.  But if your dog is a quick eater and there's actually digestive support in the rolls, then these rolls could be helpful.

review/summary: One of my favorite sounds.
review/text: My dogs quietly and contentedly chewing away on treats... I have a mid sized senior dog and two young small Chihuahua's. Everyone is happy with their FunBites. My older dog is usually a major chowhound but this time she isn't able to make it disappear too quickly as she usually does. It's nice to see her getting to enjoy her treat. She in particular needs the digestive support the treat offers also, as well as the teeth cleaning. It's a win-win offer for my whole pack. I'm liking this product a lot.

review/summary: FunBites MiniCongo Dog Treats
review/text: The basics: these dog treats come 7 to a bag and are about 3 1/2 inches in length. The outer shell is rawhide and the middle is said to be filled with a peanut butter treat.  My dog who can be finicky with certain dog treats appears to love these things -devouring them as if it were her last meal. I have a boston terrier that is about 20lbs and one of these treats will keep her occupied for about 30 minutes.  My only caution, and not specifically with this treat but with any rawhide dog treat in general, is to supervise your dog while they eat so they do not swallow large pieces and choke.<br />While these dog treats claim to promote digestive health and clean teeth and gums only time will tell if this is indeed true but what I can say is my dog seems to enjoy them so this would be something I would get for her in the future.

review/text: From the first second I opened the package, my pit bull puppy has loved these treats.  It takes her a few days to get through them, so dogs with less strong jaws than a pit will take a while.  It smells fine (but I assume smells great to the dogs).  Also, it says it's nutritious.  Great product.

review/text: My dog is a bit of a picky eater and she will eat these but definitely prefers other bones over these.<br /><br />There are 7 bones per pack and each bone is fairly large (especially since she's a 16 pound terrier).  It looks like a cannoli with the rawhide wrap on the outside and bone / peanut butter flavor on the inside. The whole thing is quite hard, I suppose to provide maximum chewing time and teeth cleaning.<br /><br />I haven't noticed whether it actually has helped her digestion as she doesn't usually have problems.  *shrugs*

review/summary: Both dogs loved it
review/text: I gave each of my 2 labs one of these treats. Both happily took the treat and went into their respective corners to eat it. My dogs are avid chewers and it took each dog about 5 minutes to eat the treat. The treat did leave crumbs but both dogs cleaned up every morsel.<br /><br />A bag contains 7 treats. Each treat is about 3 1/2 inches long, and 1 1/4 inch in diameter. Each treat is filled with what looks to be ground rawhide which has an artificial peanut butter flavoring (I didn't notice any peanut butter smell). That is surrounded by a coating of rawhide. It seems to be easier to eat than normal rawhide (which takes my dogs much more time to eat). If you want a treat that takes a longer time to eat, (and your dogs are avid chewers), this isn't the treat for you. However, I liked the fact that this rawhide coating was easier to eat and I was less worried about a choking factor.<br /><br />The treat is advertised as high protein and low fats. According to the packaging, it contains a minimum of 61% crude protein, a minimum of 0.5% crude fat; 3.5% maximum crude fat; and a maximum of 5% crude fiber.<br /><br />Overall, I liked these treats. They seems a bit pricey, but my dogs seemed to really enjoy the treats. If it matters to you, these treats are made in Mexico.

review/text: Upon receiving the treats, I gave one to the dog.  She loved it.  In her own way, she played with it, tossing it in the air.  She liked playing "keep away" with it.  Once she got down to chewing though, she no longer wanted to play.  She loved the taste, enough that she will stare at the bag in hopes I will give her another.  Great item!

review/summary: Good for strong chewers
review/text: I have 2 dogs: a rescue greyhound and a rescue pit mix.  The pit mix has very strong jaws and is a heavy, strong chewer.  The greyhound is, like all greyhounds, weak-jawed.  My pit mix can manage these hard treats, but the greyhound was not able to chew through to get to the peanut butter center, and eventually the mix stole it from him.<br /><br />These are rawhide chews with a peanut butter 'flavored' center.  Why they don't use real peanut butter is beyond me.  They claim to be good for the teeth, which I assume is true since they take a lot of chewing.  They also claim to be good for the digestion.  I don't know if this is what is meant but they seem to go right through my dog.  (Not a good thing in my book... I can't give her one when she is home alone.)<br /><br />I don't downgrade because my greyhound can't manage them; that's a greyhound thing.  But I do downgrade because they are flavored artificially and because they give my dog the runs.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Dogs think they're tasty, but the weak chewer can't manage them.  Artificial flavors.  Seem to go right through the dog that can manage them.

review/summary: Dog loved it!
review/text: I admit I have one of those spoiled dogs.  I am not sure she knows she is a dog.  She doesn't eat regular food, I make sure it is natural and doesn't have the wrong kind of additives.  Her treats don't come from a box; I pick them out special, just for her.  So when Amazon Vine gave us a chance to try these new dog treats we were excited.<br /><br />They are called FunBites, but unless your dog is big, these are not bites.  They are about two and a half inches around and three inches long.  (I measured)  The outside is hard rawhide and the inside is filled with a peanut butter looking substance.  I don't normally give my dog rawhide because it can cause some health issues, but this says it has papain enzymes to facilitate protein digestion.  It also says that they help clean teeth while chewing.<br /><br />My dog loved it.  She is a high-energy dog and treats that might take another dog hours to devour; she can take care of in minutes.  This one did take her about fifteen or twenty minutes.  I got the package out to look it over before I typed the review and she was all around to see if she could talk me out of another one.<br /><br />I do spend more money on food and treats, but there were only seven "bites" in this package and you are getting four packages, so they are not an inexpensive treat.  I haven't had them long enough to see how they affect her digestive system, but I will let you know.  Part of what I look for in a dog food is the amount of protein, the front of the package calls this a daily treat, but they have 61% protein and I am just not sure that my dog needs that much extra protein every day.  I think this is more likely a weekly treat.<br /><br />These are better than the regular rawhide bones because it is a treat with a smaller amount of rawhide, and better than the crunchy bones because it did not fall apart and leave little pieces everywhere.  So they seem to be a favorite.

review/text: So they must be good! They are a nice substantial weight, I was thinking they would be thin but they are quite wide. I have a boxer and he gobbled it right up when I gave him one. It seems like a pretty good value for the price, there are similar treats out there that are a bit more expensive (for only a couple in a package) so I would probably buy these over the other kind!

review/summary: Will keep them busy!
review/text: I have 4 cocker spaniels, 3 male, and 1 female weighing over 30 pounds each.  I gave them each a Funbites peanut butter flavored minicongo.  First of all, I don't give my dog's whole treats of this size.  Normally, one of these would be cut in half and I would make two treats out of them.  However, I couldn't cut through the white rawhide with gardening shears so each dog received their own minicongo.  My picky male promptly took his off and I didn't see him for 2 hours.  He busily and happily chewed all that time.  My female spent all her time growling at the boys and would never chew hers so I ultimately had to take hers away.  She wasn't upset; she just lay down and went to sleep.  My oldest male growled and barked over his for an hour but then eventually ate all of his and foraged pieces from the youngest one.  The youngest male spent 20 minutes so excited over it, he ran from room to room and then outside hiding it then going and getting it and he finally took it to the couch and chewed on his for the next two hours.  The dog treat is said to contain papain which I looked up on Wikipedia and it is an enzyme present in papaya used to break down tough meat fibers and is sold as tenderizer.  It is also used in small amounts in toothpaste as a whitener.  It's not just good for their teeth, but will whiten their teeth, also?  Just kidding.  I haven't noticed anything with the digestive system yet. The only problem I had with them was they were messy and small pieces came off as they chewed but they eventually cleaned all the pieces up.  The price is $22.15 for a 4 pack which is by my calcualtion $5.54 a pack and I think that's a bit much for a package of dog treats. All in all, my dogs loved them and I would buy them.

review/summary: Bleeding gums, bloated belly, diarrhea...
review/text: Before I explain how each dog reacted, let me tell you that they loved the idea of these.  They took them with gusto and went right to town.  That said, three of these dogs ARE beagles, and will eat pretty much anything (and the fourth, a Lab, follows whatever the other three do, so he went to it, too).  Here is what I witnessed:<br /><br />Red:  Age 11, male beagle: Took the bone with excitement, and went right to his bed and started chewing away...within 5 minutes, his gums were bleeding.  Later, his belly was slightly distended and soon after that, he had a bout of diarrhea.  (This didn't stop him from asking for another one, though!)<br /><br />Rosie:  Age 11, female beagle: Took the bone and ran into her crate with it.  She came out shortly, with a VERY distended belly and need to run outside.  She ran out, and drank her weight in water.  She spent the evening outside, and didn't want to come in.  Her tummy was very upset.<br /><br />Junior:  Age 5, male beagle:  Like his fellow Snoopies, he took it and ran to his bed.  He chewed away, and I think he didn't quite "love it", but didn't want the others to get to it.  He took longer to get through it.  He had few side effects, except a slightly bloated tummy.<br /><br />OhGee:  Age 12, male lab:  Took the bone and went to his bed, chewed on it until it was gone, and then wasn't real interested in another.  He might have had some diarrhea, but it was hard to say, as I didn't "witness" that...just the after effects. Ewww.<br /><br />I'm not thrilled with these.  As you can see, they didn't go over well physically with my dogs.  Although they'd take them again, in that "give me a cookie, give me a cookie" excitement.  I threw the rest away, and am glad that they are out of reach of my dogs.<br /><br />As far as "keeping bored dogs occupied", they didn't last long enough to keep any of mine occupied...<br />If you're looking for something better, try the Kong line with the peanut butter inserts.  Those rock!<br /><br />I hope this review helps you to avoid a bout with a sick pooch.

review/summary: A Yummy Snack for Pups
review/text: My two dogs really enjoyed these treats. Fiona, a little rescue mutt who's about 14 pounds, worked at her treat for a good two hours, with a couple of breaks in between (but only when her doggie brother wasn't around, since he would have stolen it). She loved it. Lately, she hasn't been very excited about her food, merely sniffing it in the morning and not eating much until later in the day. But this morning, after eating  the Congo last night, she was thrilled about morning kibble again, spinning in circles before diving in and eating the whole bowl.<br /><br />Finn, another rescue mutt who's about 35 pounds, also really enjoyed his treat. He spent the first hour burying it around the house and staring at Fiona while she snacked on her treat. Then he headed outside and snarfed it down in peace before coming back in to stare at her again. This morning, he was spunky and perky on his walk and, while he didn't eat his kibble this morning (it's too hot for him & he's only been eating at night), he did go out and patrol the yard, fertilizing the bushes, and scaring the squirrels.<br /><br />So, by every indication, my two pups give these treats four stars and can't wait for their next treat.

review/summary: Doggy Deliciousness
review/text: I have one dog, an older beagle/basset mix, and my brother has 2 dogs (both corgi mixes), so we let all three dogs try the FunBites.  The dogs loved them.  The FunBites are not, in fact, bite-sized.  Toy-sized dogs or very small dogs may have a hard time with them.  The FunBite has a diameter of between 1 and 2 inches.<br /><br />Each FunBite has a beef rawhide exterior that the dogs can chew/gnaw on.  The center is an artificial peanut butter marrow. It must taste good because the dogs had to work to get through the rawhide to get to treat inside.<br /><br />As a dog-owner I do like a treat that keeps the dog occupied for a while and does not leave a mess in the house.  FunBites rawhide exterior keeps the dog busy. And the treat is not coated with sauce or anything so it is clean for indoor use.<br /><br />I also like to know what I am giving my dog.  The main ingredients in FunBites are beef hide and rice.  It is about 65% protien and about 1.5-3.5% fat according to the package.  It also has an interesting ingredient called "Papain" that is supposed to be good for digestive systems.<br /><br />I did a little research into Papain: Papain is an enzyme found in papayas.  It has many uses and is found in a wide variety of products. Its utility is in breaking down tough meat fibres and has been used for thousands of years in its native South America. It is sold as a component of powdered meat tenderiser available in most supermarkets.<br /><br />I am happy with the FunBites. The dog enjoys them.  The FunBites keep him busy chewing away on the rawhide exterior and the FunBites don't leave a mess in the house. FunBites are a high-protien dog snack which is good for dog's general health.  The papain enzyme may also be beneficial to his digestive health.<br /><br />Overall, any dog owner would do well by their best friend to buy FunBites.

review/summary: The dog is not thrilled with them
review/text: This is one of those things where you can buy a treat and feel good about giving it to the dog. What's not to like? Digestive support through papaya which is also available as a human supplement too.<br /><br />'Mini' is a bit of a misnomer though. They are about the size of a quarter - that is if you put a quarter on one end that is about how big the chew is round. Length is about 4 inches. So your doggie size is a big factor on deciding if these really are mini or maybe too big. They are too big for really small breed dogs.<br /><br />The first one I gave my dog (he weighs about 20 pounds but he's lanky) he chewed it up in about 10 minutes. He's part cocker spaniel so he is a capable chewer if he likes what he is gnawing on. After that first one though he was a lot less excited to get the treat. Even if it'd been a day or two since he'd had any treat. He usually does finish it sometime during the day.<br /><br />That isn't such a big deal since this probably should be a once a week treat.<br /><br />[edit: updated Aug 4th, 2011<br /><br />Well. The doggie is totally disinterested in these treats. Now he eats it after two or three days of being on the floor. I changed my rating to 3 stars because the dog has relegated this to a non-treat "I'll eat it when I am totally bored' type item.<br />/edit]

review/summary: Dog back from vet.....
review/text: Back from vet.  Vet is about 100% sure it was this chew stick that upset my dog.  His digestive tract is inflammed and will have to be on meds. He is not allowed to eat anything today. My vet said that even one is a lot for my size dog (I brought this to the vet with me), but bag said small dog, one per day (dog weighs 20 pounds). He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one.  The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this.  He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these.  AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.  I believe it is the inside of the chew stick that made him ill, as THAT is what he threw up.  It is distinctive and hard to miss!<br /><br />Particularly if you have a SMALL dog, I would be wary of this chew stick.  I'm not saying it would upset ALL small dogs tummies, just that it is hardly mini and if my vet said it was too big for my 20 pound dog.<br /><br />I have read a lot of dogs love this and did fine with it. Unfortunately mine didn't and it seems SOME other dogs (mostly smaller ones) didn't either.<br /><br />Just trying to save dog owners the worry of seeing their dog in distress and a big vet bill.

review/summary: Lil guy liked them...his tummy did not.
review/text: My Boston thought these were AWESOME, and stole a second one from the package after I'd already given him one a few hours before.  After getting halfway through the first one, he threw up the entire thing.  That evening, he had pretty yucky diarrhea.  For that reason, I haven't given him any more since then.  In general, he's got a touchier stomach than a lot of other dogs, so maybe it's just him.  However, if you're going to bill this as offering digestive support, it better not cause my lil man to throw up and have diarrhea.  Wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Made my dog sick
review/text: My dog is a 15 pound Maltese. He is really picky about what he will chew, so I did not think he would like these, but I figured  it was worth a try to see if he would like them. I put it on the floor and he ignored it, just as I had expected. He  only likes a couple of types of chews. The next evening, I was happy to see he was chewing away at it with glee. He was really liking it, I was glad I found something he actually likes. But the next morning, he was throwing up, and had really bad diarrhea all day. Poor doggy! The ironic thing is that these chew bones call themselves "digestive support"  "Health and Fun" NOT!!!! I threw them away and will never give them to my dog again. I would not recommend these dog chews.

review/summary: What a Treat for the Boys
review/text: This is one of the most versatile products to drop on the market.  I have "smart" dogs (working breeds - a Border Collie and an Australian Cattle Dog) who constantly strive for stimulation.  Typically rawhide is a special treat, but since it takes a while to chew...it can cause problems.  With this variety of rawhide, the product gets chewed rapidly.  It doesn't take a long time to go through one piece.  Some may say that this is not a good thing, but I find it to be quite nice, as there are no skirmishes.<br /><br />What's more is that this promotes Digestive Health.  Very, very true.  Not to go into too much detail, but after administering these treats, my boys did prove that they had to go.  I'm not sure what they put in it, but it's helped, and the treats seem to be devoured.  If only the boys had opposable thumbs, they could write their own review of their new favorite treats.

review/summary: Keeps dogs busy for awhile
review/text: In the heat my dogs don't want to go outside much so I am constantly looking for ways to entertain them inside.  I tried these one afternoon and for a good half-hour both dogs were thoroughly engrossed.  Upon offering them, a quick sniff was all they needed to know they WANTED this treat.  And after snatching it up, they each disappeared to a private place where they could enjoy it in peace.  I've had issues in the past with rawhide producing stinky farts but after each dog had consumed this treat, there were no after-effects, so that made me happy.  So all in all I am very happy with this product.

review/summary: Snowball turns up his nose....  Not a peanut butter lover?
review/text: After our experience with other Funbites treats, I thought our dog Snowball would really enjoy these treats, but despite giving him these on different days, under different conditions, when he was hungry and when he was full, Snowball just wouldn't do more than sniff at them.<br /><br />Why?  I suspect that it must be the Peanut butter flavoring.  He's always eaten meat or vegetable flavored food and treats, and the peanut butter must be throwing him.  I may give the treats to a neighbor to see if their dog will eat them, but since these reviews are all about our experiences, I have to give this One Star - Snowball, a dog that I would think would eat ANYTHING, just won't give these a chance.<br /><br />That said, I'll have to buy another Funbites flavor for him to see if he'll like these.  He just loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X3VQ5I">FunBites FlatSticks Calcibone, 60-Count (Pack of 5)</a>, so it isn't the outer "crunchy shell" - it's got to be the nutty flavor and scent.

review/summary: Dog loved it after having been sick - no tummy probs!
review/text: This was the first treat we gave the dog (a 50 lb hound mix) after she was getting over some tummy troubles. She loved it and it lasted quite a while (they're fairly good-sized). She sort of ripped it apart, ate the inside first, and then ate the wrapping last. Though Lucy did have some problems again a few days later from some other treats, she had NO issues after eating these. I recommend them if you want a 'big' treat for your dog and they have recently been sick or have chronic tummy troubles.

review/summary: Tasty digestive dog treats but some concerns
review/text: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who sometimes suffers from varying degrees of indigestion so I'm always on the lookout for treats to help reduce issues. Unfortunately, many doggie specialty treats are a bit on the pricey side if you want to give a daily helping. When these Fun Bites popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched them up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, low in fat.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Contains papain enzymes.<br /><br />+ Lasted about 20 minutes.<br /><br />+ Resealable bag.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Extremely messy! Give this treat to your dog outside or on hardwood floors for easy or no clean up.<br /><br />- Contains filler/rawhide material.<br /><br />- Can leave a sticky residue.<br /><br />- Treats are too large for smaller dogs. Approximately 3.5" in length.<br /><br />- A bit pricey considering you only get seven in a package.<br /><br />My dog sure loved these Fun Bites (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and guards them quite aggressively (not always a good thing). Sadly, I couldn't tell if he got any digestive benefit from eating these treats. Better suited for larger dogs who are average chewers these treats were nice but I don't think I'd pay the asking price for them. The best thing about these treats were they occupied my dog long enough to properly groom him without him constantly trying to bite my hands!

review/summary: 2 out of 3 dogs
review/text: Kozmeaux (Shih tzu - Bijon frise mix) is a spoiled rotten house dog. He sleeps in the bed, begs for table scraps and thinks (or perhaps realizes) that he has the run of the house. He was completely uninterested in these treats. Sniffed it, walked away, and never returned. Now, in fairness to the treat, Kozzie is a picky, picky puppy and dislikes more threats than he actually likes.<br /><br />Gator (American Staffordshire terrier) was given one as a bedtime snack. He didn't eat it right away, but the next morning, he was on his blanket and the treat was gone. He liked it, but I wouldn't say it's one of his favorites.<br /><br />Grizzy (Husky-Chow mix) took hers out to the yard and proceeded to disembowel the treat, tearing the outer shell off and eating all of the peanut butter from inside. Once the peanut butter had been completely removed, she finished off the outer husk. Bonus points to the treat for Grizzy not only enjoying the treat, but being entertained by it as well.

review/summary: Not universally loved
review/text: My dog heard the package crinkling and became excited; but when I gave her a treat, she dropped it and walked away. She's notoriously picky about treats so I wasn't surprised. I left it there for a day to see if she would later sneak over and eat it but she was not interested in it at all.<br /><br />We are allowed to bring our dogs to work, so I brought the package to work with me to test the treats out on a wide variety of dogs. The other dogs all loved them, some taking their time to work on the bones slowly, others gobbling them as fast as they could break them down.<br /><br />I tested these on a wide range of sizes, from a chihuahua-sized mutt, to my Aussie-mix, to a large boxer-mix mutt. The smallest dog required that we break the bones down a little bit but overall, all but the pickiest of dogs liked these. The boxer-mix begged for more, but she'd eat treats all day if you gave them to her.<br /><br />My experience was that if a dog is picky to begin with, they may not accept these treats. But if they generally are food-hounds, they should have no problem eating them eagerly.

review/summary: Big Messy Treats My Dog Loved
review/text: These are large "raw hide" bone-size treats.  My dog loved them - and immediately tore them apart.  Be advised they are a bit of a messy treat - there were a lot of tiny particles left over - almost dust size - that I had to vacuum off the carpet.  Hard to tell if they really provide digestive support - but she loved them.

review/text: My dog, Oscar, loves these treats.  Oscar has had some nasty digestive problems in the past and, even thought he's on a pretty restricted diet, he still has problems.<br />I tried these FunBites about a week or so ago and within days, there was a noticeable difference in his digestive issues--his problems have just about completely cleared up, he doesn't get gassy and his breath is so much better.  I definitely recommend these for anyone's dog...whether they have digestive problems or not.  The enzyme that is in the FunBites really improves there digestion, freshens their breath, and whitens their teeth.  Plus they seem to love them.

review/summary: Yummy, Yummy  hard on the tummy
review/text: Since I have an assortment of dogs, I was delighted to review the dog treats. I gave them to three German Shepherds, a cocker Spaniel and a Rat-cha. I am glad to say I only had one that got loose bowels and only for one day. It was one of the German Shepherds. All the dogs seemed to enjoy the treats, for its rare that I give them rawhyde. Although the Rat-cha had some difficulty with the size of the product, the Cocker and Shepherds had no trouble at all. They appeared to have liked them with no other negative effects. Although I am sure they would appreciate another taste, I don't think that I will be purchasing the product.

review/summary: My dogs love the sticks.
review/text: I have 2 boston terriers and they eat everything (from dry food to meat, veggies, fruit- when they hear crunching apple or peeling cucumber they run for vitamins in seconds) and they like dogs snack as well. But I don't like some thick rawhide sticks because they became slimy and sometimes I have to dig in my dogs' throats to get leftovers (great choking hazard).<br /><br />I was a bit worried after reading negative reviews, I didn't want my dogs to get sick and me being sick from the vet bills. But I gave my dogs one stick each and they liked it a lot. It took them about 20 minutes to finish. I was watching them and they really enjoyed that thing. I was surprised that rawhide part was actually coming off in small bites, easy to swallow (second dog was rather chewing on it though). One dog finished earlier and was intimidating the other, so he swallowed about 1/4 of the chewed stick and I ended up with finger in his throat, so I guess they will enjoy them under my supervision.<br /><br />I took one star for the price, it comes to more than 50 cents per stick (I see the price is changing, it was as high as one dollar per stick)-kind of expensive. Also I would be more happy with the long lasting snack like that to be more safe (that can be my dogs chewing and swallowing bigger parts). But so far I am happy to see occupied dogs and they have no digestive problems at all with a bit looser poop than unusual, but nothing runny and weird (gotta pick it up on the walks). But as it says, the snack is digestive support, so it is not a daily snack, more of a helper with constipated dog.

review/summary: A Bit Too Large
review/text: I ordered FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support, 7-Count (Pack of 4) for my dog not realizing that they would be too big for my Shih Tzu's mouth.  Since they are called "minicomgo" I got the wrong impression upon the size.  My dog will lick the hard bone material so I know she liked the smell and taste, but laboring over the thickness is too much for her.<br /><br />However, FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support, 7-Count (Pack of 4) would most likely be lovely for a larger pet.  I am loathe to give it a bad review because of my own ignorance.

review/summary: The Whippet says "Buy!"
review/text: I have an "I will eat pretty much anything and I will eat it quickly" whippet. I was pretty sure he would take to these treats but wasn't sure how well he would do after the taking. Whippets, especially pups (he is 8 months old) sometimes have trouble with high protein foods and we have had a few issues in the past.<br /><br />Well, naturally the pup loved the bars. They were a good size for him, about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. He seemed to be really excited about the treat on day one and was still amped up when I launched the treat across the room for him to fetch on day three. We have had no digestive upsets so far and I really like how long it takes him to consume the thing. I can actually sit down and eat my lunch while he works at the bar. (Generally he likes to wolf-down his milk bone and then make sad eyes at me while I eat a more leisurely lunch.)As the packaging says, these are a soft beef hide outer chew with a peanut butter flavored inside. The pup ran off and ate his treat under the dining room table on my cream white carpet (of course) and I found no evidence of staining.<br /><br />I just put in a subscribe and save order for more of these things, so I have to say:<br /><br />Recommended

review/summary: My Dog Hates Them
review/text: These are supposed to be peanut butter flavored, but the filling neither smells like, nor resembles peanut butter at all.  My dog loves peanut butter and raw hide, so I thought these treats would be a hit. They are not. I gave him one last week, and it's still sitting on the floor, untouched. Sometimes he pushes it around like a hockey puck, but never tries to gnaw at the outside or dig out the filling. Obviously, I can't speak to whether they really do promote clean teeth and fresh breath as advertised. They are also a little on the large side, so if you have a tiny dog, these might not be appropriate.

review/summary: FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support
review/text: First off I'm going to say I don't know what they mean by Congo, especially since its mini in this case.  I'm assuming that's just the general shape of the treat.  Regardless, my dog had a good time with it.<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was surprised to see these mini-congo's were not so mini at all.  This is a fairly large treat and I wouldn't recommend using it for training purposes.  This is one of those treats you should give instead of a bone or maybe once a week.  Which is what I've been doing.  My dog's a great bone chewer, actually its probably her only talent aside from making trouble and she can inhale one in no time flat.  When I saw this, I thought for sure that it would be gone in a good 30 seconds but surprisingly it took her longer.  The outer part of the treat is rather hard like a bone so she had to chew her way through it.  I'd say it probably took her a half hour to finish the entire treat and she does get excited when she sees the package now so I'm assuming she likes the taste (peanut butter) as well.<br /><br />The next thing to comment on would be that this is all about digestive support.  I don't want to get into too much detail but it seemed like instead of helping my dog's digestive system, it made it a little harder for her to do her business.  Each time after she's had one she's had a little trouble with her normal activities the next day.  Perhaps since she is already on a high protein diet, this is the cause of that since this is a high protein treat.  I'm not too thrilled with the ingredients in this treat either.  The ingredients include: Beefhide, Riceflour, maltodextrins, dextrose, caramel color, papain, and artificial peanut butter flavor.  Really, artificial?  Peanut butter's not that expensive and it would have been much better to give real than fake.  At least the beefhide and riceflour were real I suppose.<br /><br />As a whole I'd rate this an average dog treat.  You can't use it for training purposes due to its size and the nature of the treat means its not good on a daily basis.  Add in the artifical peanut butter and it does round to somewhere in the middle.  But hey, at least my dog liked it and it kept her busy long enough for me to cook supper.  So that's something.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

review/summary: Tasty Chews for a Picky Dog
review/text: My lab will eat any type of food he can find but is very picky about "chews."  There are only a few types he likes, and I've tried dozens.  I tried these recently.  This is now one of his favorite chew treats.  He really enjoys them, and unlike some other chews, he doesn't finish them off in a few minutes.  They last a good 15 - 30 minutes, which for my dog is a long time.  These are supposed to be good for his digestion, but unless I ran some type of controlled scientific experiment I'm not sure I can tell if this is true.  The ingredients seem reasonably healthy, although it does contain some artificial flavorings, which is not good. Overall I'm satisfied and  the dog likes them. Although they are a little pricey, I will probably buy more.

review/summary: Updated review - not so happy anymore
review/text: Original review appears first.  Please read the bottom for the updated edit.<br /><br />I've never given my dogs any type of rawhide product, so I can't tell if they like these any more or less than other similar products.<br /><br />The size is described as mini, but they don't look that small.  I thought the sticks might be too large for them but they each happily managed to pick them up and run to their corners.  I never heard a peep from either for the next two hours, when they only budged to trace spots.  They managed to eat about 1/3 of their stick in that time, and I took them away to save the rest for another day.<br /><br />I read the review by the other customer who was worried after his dog became ill.  If my dogs get sick, I'll update this review and the rating accordingly.  But otherwise, they just spent two hours in doggy paradise.<br /><br />UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE<br />Unfortunately we are not as happy now.  I gave the dogs the minicongo treats again the next day and they loved them just as much.  This time I took them away after they had eaten about an inch.  Later, both dogs vomited the mixture and both had really weird poop.  I threw away the rest of the package.

review/summary: 2.5 out of 4 Dogs Approve
review/text: I have 4 mini dachshunds and 1 is very picky. They have tried FunBites CalciBone chew sticks, and 3 out of 4 dogs loved them, so I was hopeful for these bones. Unfortunately, the picky one didn't like them again, and one dog, who usually likes every bone she can get, was easily distracted. She chewed on it a little, and then lost interest. The other two dogs, however, loved them.<br /><br />They are much bigger than the Chew Sticks- about an inch in diameter. There is a hard rawhide outside and a dry mixed tube of a peanut butter mixture on the middle. In some bones, the middle is firmly attached to the rawhide, making the chew time much longer (a plus since it keeps them busy longer), but in others, the rawhide is pinched and the middle tube slides out with a little chewing. This made the bone disappear quickly.<br /><br />An odd thing might keep me from buying these bones- there are 7 bones in a bag. By not having an even number, it means I have to buy 4 bags to give each dog one without leftovers. This wouldn't matter if you had a different number of dogs, but for me, it is an issue. Since the dogs were lukewarm towards them, I would probably choose to buy a bone with an even number in the bag. In all, though, they seem like a healthy treat for your little pooches!

review/summary: My dog ate it, but...
review/text: I have one siberian that will eat anything, including a small horse if it can fit in the dog's mouth, and the other siberian is such a princess she just licks and licks until she's full, which is usually very quickly.  So I was happy that both dogs liked these treats.  Unfortunately, both of them had diarrhea the next day and were high tailing it out the back door pretty fast several times in the same afternoon. This was the only thing that was different in their diet unless they got hold of a neighborhood toddler I do not know about. I hate to give a treat a bad review, because I know the people work hard to make a good product and no one sat around and said, "Well, so what if it makes a few dogs barf! We're rolling in money, hahahahahaha!!" but I have to speak the truth here, and the truth is, they appear to have given the dogs some pretty awful diarrhea. Sorry. They did eat it though and did not die, so 2 stars.

review/summary: My pal Bear loves them . . .
review/text: It's tough to review a treat for dogs, so this may be a bit short.  Bear gets one of these after our long evening walks; he now knows to expect them ans sits patiently while I get one out of the package.  He loves them.  I can't comment on whether or not they've improved his digestion, but there aren't any problems, so . . . !  Recommended.

review/summary: My (big) dog enjoyed the treats
review/text: My big (retriever/lab mix) thoroughly enjoyed these treats.  She didn't have any ill effects at all, which I read that some smaller dogs might have.  She enjoyed the product as a chewy treat, but I didn't notice any particular digestive improvement.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: My dog wasn't too crazy about these, but more importantly, the contents didn't seem especially healthy and his poop was runny. Of course, dogs vary, but for my dog at least I'll stick with the dental chews.

review/summary: Dogs do digest them well, but not their favorite
review/text: I noticed the other day that there was still one of these MiniCongo Digestive Support treats in my car, so I guess Max and Ginger don't count it as a favorite; your mileage may vary on that count. On the other hand, the ones they ate did seem to be easy on their digestion; Ginger was puking up almost everything she ate at the time, but she had no trouble keeping these down. I would say that they are worth a try, especially if your dog doesn't do too well with rawhide or other traditional treats.

review/summary: Issues of concern
review/text: Fun bites are too big for my 6 & 7 lb Maltese to handle easily and my littlest got sick and had to go to vet after eating one. I AM NOT saying the illness was caused by these but after reading others who had troubles it does cause concern. I will not purchase these.

review/summary: Keeps the Dog Busy for a Half an Hour
review/text: Whenever I give my dogs something to chew on I hope it keeps them busy for a while and tire them out.  These Fun Bites are too big for my Chihuahua (it is suggested for dogs over six pounds), but for my medium sized mix breed, it would take her about a half an hour to finish them off.  I really cannot comment on the "digestive support" that the Fun Bites advertise but she does not seem any different as to the way then before she ate these.<br /><br />What is annoying about this product is the labeling as they have important data and warning on the bottom of the package making it very hard to read it without ripping or cutting it.  If it is important, how about putting the warning wear someone can actually read it?

review/summary: Another hit with the dog
review/text: These Digestive Support treats were a bit easier to give to my dog. It may be because they are smaller than the other treats (the Skin/Coat) treats, or it may be that the peanut butter aroma was irresistable to her - who knows. I also found that she didn't have odd bowel movements afterwards (see my other review, it could have just been blueberries).

review/summary: Dog didn't Like
review/text: Unfortunately my dog didn't go for this product. The bone casing was pretty hard for her to get through and the stuffing wasn't enticing enough for her to even try. She is a Shitzu but has no problem with hard bones or treats. She carried this one around for a couple of hours and then never bothered with it again.

review/summary: Two paws up!
review/text: As soon as I opened the package, Buddy, my 20 lb mini-Schnauzer was all eyes and ears.  He disappeared with his MiniCongo, returning empty-pawed about 15 minutes later.  About 10 days later, and Buddy's had about 3 or 4 MiniCongos, I made a startling discovery.<br /><br />Buddy really likes these MiniCongos. He'd stashed them all beneath the sofa cushions. Now that we'd exposed them, he took them out in the yard, and buried them.  Every now and again he digs them back up, chews on them a while, then buries them again so no one else can deprive him of his enjoyment.  MiniCongos have to be very special because he's never done that with any treat before--food or toy.<br /><br />We still have a few MiniCongos left, and every time we give him one, we have to follow him around to make sure they don't end up in the sofa.  Yeah, if Buddy has anything to say about it, we'll be buying these again.

review/summary: Our dog seemed to like these
review/text: Our dog seemed to really go for these treats, she would go through them in a couple of minutes, which is pretty quick for her.  I will say that she doesn't have any digestive problems (other than the occasional gross noise here and there, but I could say the same about myself).  So I didn't notice any issues before or after, which is fine by me.

review/summary: The Dog Said They Tasted Like "Bark"
review/text: How to review a dog treat?  I opened up a pack of these and tossed one to the dog figuring that might be a good place to start.  After taking a minute to sniff and inspect the treat, my dog took it and promptly devoured the thing in a few minutes.  Granted, my dog is quite large, but these definitely did not last as long as regular rawhide treats of the same size.<br /><br />Next, I sat my dog down to interview him about the product.  When I asked him if he liked the treat, he said "yip".  Sweet, so they are a hit.  I then asked them what they tasted like and he told me "bark".  Hmmm, this seemed a bit peculiar.  I thought they were supposed to be peanut butter flavored.  I then asked him about the texture and he responded "ruff".  So my dog liked a rough textured treat that tasted like bark, not exactly a convincing answer, but he was the judge.  I was not about to eat one to see if he was right.  He liked them and that was good enough for me.<br /><br />I fed my dog a couple of these a day.  Being a 90 pound dog, I was not concerned about feeding him two of these a day.  However, when I went outside the next day, I was greeted by piles of diarrhea.  In all due fairness to the treat, my dog did start a new medication (one he has had in the past with no issues) about this time.  I honestly cannot say if the treats or medicine did this.  I did not think of the treat causing this until I read other reviews.  I will give the product the benefit of the doubt as it could have been the medicine, but given what I saw and what other reviewers went through, I would start your dog on these treats slowly if it is their first time having them.

review/summary: my three smaller breed dogs loved them
review/text: i have a beagle mix, a miniature beagle, and a corgi mix and they all enjoyed these bones. took an average of about 15 minutes for the dogs to eat them and they left very little mess, mostly drool. they have a rawhide-ish outside wrap and in the center a softer center that sort of breaks off in pieces. they're suppose to taste like peanut butter. overall i'd recommend them since my dogs enjoyed them without any problems. if i could i'd ask them if their tummies felt better after eaten but well i'll just have to believe what the makers say,

review/summary: Upset Stomach
review/text: I have two mini Doxies, one wouldn't touch this at all (smart dog), the other who will and does eat just about anything, tore right in.  Unfortunately about an hour later, it came right back out... onto the carpet...<br /><br />Needless to say we have moved on to other more digestible chews... I wish I had read the reviews before hand, I could have saved myself and my puppy the trouble and the mess.
