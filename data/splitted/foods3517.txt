review/summary: Our favorite flavored K cup
review/text: A favorite at my home and the office, unlike previous reviewer have never had a problem with grounds just a good cup of coffee every time. The strength is a little bit on the light side, so those who expect a spoon to stand up in their coffee would be better off with a different product.

review/summary: Great taste - if you can keep the grounds out of your coffee cup
review/text: While the coffee itself is good, we have been frustrated by the number of cups that have had the paper seal break and result in grounds in the coffee mug. One or two wouldn't have been a big deal, but more than half have done it. It is a pain to clean it out of the machine afterwards.

review/summary: A great healthy snack to keep around for the kids
review/text: These have become staples in our house. I first picked up the "Blueberry Blitz" from our local super-market, but the only other flavors they carried were "fruit-only". I really liked the fact that you get at least some veggies in these (albeit a few places down on the ingredient list). So I came to Amazon and ordered "Carroty-Chop" and "Beetbox Berry". So far the kids (boys aged 4 and 6) love them. They are an easy snack to throw in the lunch box or to take on the road. I also like that they have a long shelf life and they are certified organic by the Oregon Tilth, one of the more stringent organic certification agencies.<br /><br />Here are the ingredient lists since I don't see them on Amazon:<br />Blue-Berry Blitz: organic apple puree, organic blueberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic purple carrot juice, organic lemon juice<br />Carroty Chop: organic apple puree, organic carrot puree, organic mango puree, organic orange juice, organic lemon juice<br />Beetbox Berry: organic apple puree, organic strawberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic beet juice, organic lemon juice<br /><br />They are all 60 calories and have 11 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I've also taken to buying the "Peter Rabbit Organics" which have more vegetables mixed in with the fruit and are a little larger. My kids prefer the Mashups, but they also like the Peter Rabbit brand, so I just have a big basket of them all mixed in and I grab what makes sense. If we've dined out and they didn't get a lot of veggies I give them a "Peter Rabbit" for bedtime snack. If I'm just adding a little something to their lunch box I'll throw in a Mashup. It does help keep the kids away from the junk food, particularly at snack time. A great tool in the "trying to feed the kids healthy stuff" arsenal.<br /><br />And to be honest I've been known to grab one when I need a quick snack. They taste pretty good, and it's better than grabbing cookies or chips.

review/summary: Fresh and flavorful..Nutz for these Nuts!
review/text: My physcian recommended eating cashews for quick reduction of high blood sugar.  For once, this was a suggestion easy to follow.  However, I've had some really raunchy cashews from the local store.  I think they are normally thought to be so expensive that the product is possibly sitting on store shelves longer than usual.  In any event, I went shopping via my Amazon account, and came up with these two beautiful canisters, which seal air tight, of Fancy Jumbo Cashews with sea salt.  I had my doubts, but needed some QUICK!  These are absolutely, without a doubt the most PERFECT, Beautful, and Huge Cashews I've ever tasted.  They were so good I  bought some for a friend and ordered two more.<br />Thank you for supplying these amazing Cashews, Planters and Amazon!!<br /><br />Writer Gerl

The third one Da'Bomb Ghost Pepper is not to be trifled with either but, this is a sneaky one. It hits your mouth and while you are adjusting to this very different flavor, you take a couple more bites and it happens. First your stomach growls then the heat strikes and you realize it's not raining but, you are indeed sweating..Enjoy them as they are a steal at this price..

To make them crunchy just spray a little olive oil, brush some wasabi, sprinkle with salt and bake for 10-13 minutes at 250 degrees--the BEST snack! Thank heavens they're only 10 calories per sheet (for as I mentioned, I've consumed 12 bags... and with 50 sheets per bag, that's 600 sheets!). Aside from making sushi ~ they make yummy, healthy, crispy snacks for all ages!

This can create an issue because I have very specific ways I am accustomed to cooking, and things don't QUITE fit.  For example, it is JUST too narrow for two full pieces of musubi.

review/summary: Pretty much the tastiest stuff ever, if you need to flavor 164 pounds of meat!
review/text: You've probably seen small bottles of Montreal Steak Seasoning in the grocery store (the most common size is 3.4 ounces);  you're buying almost 20 times that much with this purchase.  To put it in perspective, the McCormick website suggests that you use 1 tablespoon of seasoning per pound of steak (which is too salty for my taste, actually).  With 58 ounces of steak seasoning, you can flavor **164 POUNDS** of meat.<br /><br />I love this seasoning and use it almost religiously on steaks, chicken, fish, popcorn, you name it...and a single 29 ounce bottle last me almost two years.  Luckily, the steak seasoning keeps pretty well AS LONG AS you store the bottle in a cool, dry place, and transfer the amount you want to use into a smaller container.  The salt in the mixture soaks up any moisture in the air, so if you live in a humid environment, the seasoning will start to clump up pretty quickly.<br /><br />That said, if you're feeding a large family or survive on a completely carnivorous diet, this is the best pre-mixed steak seasoning I've ever tried.  The coarse spice grind is delightful, and there's something in the flavor that surpasses the standard "salt-pepper-garlic" steak flavoring combination.  The seasoning is quite versatile and you can use it to dash up poultry, sauteed veggies, even baked potatoes.<br /><br />Just watch your sodium intake...this stuff has 100% RDA of sodium in a single tablespoon!

review/summary: Of benefit to backyard grillers
review/text: This blend is also sold as "Canadian Steak Seasoning" in generic brands. If you're a casual backyard griller, you might try this product to see if your family likes the end result.<br /><br />Use this blend by rubbing quite a bit of it on to either one or both sides of completely thawed, large steaks and then allow them to sit for an hour or so prior to grilling over a very hot charcoal or (propane) gas grill. This seasoning is essentially a blend of dried garlic, black pepper, and rough salt, (among other lesser ingredients), all of which go a long way towards enhancing the flavor of a grilled steak.<br /><br />As to McCormick spices in general, they are consistently excellent and always fresh, a consideration which is of imperative importance in cooking. Old spices should be tossed and replaced! If you're going for the very best, regardless of the price and the trouble to obtain them, Penzey's Spices are actually the best of all -- but, again, McCormick's spices are still first-class, reasonably priced, and always available at the local grocery store.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent flavor for grilling steaks
review/text: 29 ounces?  Thats huge!  I know what you are thinking, but if you grill often, you will use it, because its that good.  I am currently almost finished with my 3rd giant container of this stuff, and I am on container number two of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ56GM">Montreal Chicken Seasoning</a> for grilling chicken.<br /><br />I use this mainly when I am using charcoal for grilling steaks.  My normal cooking method for charcoal is either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P2490E">Artisan Salt Co. Himalayan Pink Salt-coarse</a> and pepper, or I grab the jar of Montreal seasoning.  Either one is a great choice.<br /><br />If I am using the propane grill, I marinate the steaks first to give them extra flavor that they do not receive with the tasteless propane.  Sometimes I sprinkle the Montreal seasoning on the marinated steaks when I put them on the grill to give an extra layer of flavor.<br /><br />The flavor profile of this seasoning is not spicy, but it is flavorful.  There is a pepper taste and my favorite part is the salt taste, because they use coarse salt, so you get a nice salt flavor.  The seasoning can be pretty strong if you coat the steaks with a heavy blanket of seasoning, but it is just right if you give it a much lighter coat.  Season to taste.

I've mixed it in with the meat (1 TBSP per pound of beef) usually the day before I grill and it is fantastic! Tried it on steaks once and it's really good (but I prefer olive oil, fresh garlic, salt, and pepper)

With these sauces, I can still make a phenomenal dish full of flavor in minutes and sometimes with whatever I have in the fridge.  This concept eliminates the time-consuming part of cooking.  Every night I can deliver an incredible dinner in a few minutes and still feel like it was a special menu to pamper my husband and kids.<br /><br />Each sauce is unique, and changes its flavor depending on what you use it on. The green and red sauces should be in your fridge always. The mole is such a special sauce that you should throw a dinner with friends soon and impress them.  They have never tasted something quite like it. Look for the seasonal sauces . . . I do not know how they come up with these flavors.  Outstanding cooking<br /><br />I tried them on a visit to Oregon and I cannot belive my luck when finding them in Amazon! My life has changed!

review/summary: I LOVE THAT CRUNCH!
review/text: Kellogg's Frosted Flakes Cereal, 61.9 Ounce Box, I love this Cereal and sometimes I eat it with some Milk in the morning. I think almost everyone has grown up eating Frosted Flakes, the very first Cereal introduced by Kellogg's Company in the early 50's, is Fortified with 10 Vitamins and Minerals and it's only 120 Calories per serving, how good is That! ..(wait, I'm gonna say it later on)<br /><br />Frosted Flakes doesn't taste Stale or overly sweet and sometimes I eat it right out of the Box as a Snack, one of life's simple Pleasures. The 61.9 ounce Box is like getting two large boxes inside a Huge one I would have to pay a lot more where I shop to get the equivalent amount of two Boxes for that Price, and I think...that is GR-R-REAT! Thank You

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's Frosted Flakes contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. That's right, folks! GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. Foreign genes have been forced into the DNA which cause every cell of the plant to make its own pesticide. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. When people bite into it... well who knows! Two recent studies linked the pesticide toxins in the corn to human cell membrane death and the death of neonatal kidney cells. A study done in Canada found the Bt toxins in the blood serum of 93% of pregnant women tested, and 80% of their unborn babies. The FDA lets the chemical companies decide if they're safe - there is no requirement for long term, independent, peer reviewed studies to test it before it gets into your food. There are 50 countries around the world that require products to be labeled when they contain genetically modified ingredients... all of Europe, China (!), Japan, Russia (!), Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, India and more. In the US, there is no labeling law. We hit the jackpot! We have Michael Taylor appointed as our food safety czar and guess where he came from! MONSANTO... the number one chemical company creating and selling GMOs. To make it worse, they have also inserted foreign genes into the DNA of sugar, soy, canola and cottonseed. (POP TARTS contain ALL of these - don't buy them!) They've made ALL of these GMOs resistant to high doses of an herbicide called RoundUp. (Guess who also sells the RoundUp - you got it! Monsanto!) The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp is called Glyphosate. If you google it, you'll find that it's linked to birth defects, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and more. No wonder everyone seems to be getting sick! Kellogg's doesn't want you to know any of this and they have recently contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California, where voters will be voting on Prop. 37 for the labeling of genetically engineered foods on November 6th. They are trying to trick people into voting against labeling by telling them its going to raise their grocery bills by $400 a year and other things which are totally untrue. None on the countries that have labeling laws have seen ANY increase in their food costs. Kellogg's Frosted Flakes are no longer G-R-RRRRREAT. I wouldn't feed them to my family... not to my pets either. BLECH.

review/summary: Kellog's Frosted Flakes
review/text: I found these Frosted Flakes to be good but as compared to what comes from the local grocery store the flakes from Amazon had a different color and taste. I received the flakes in a timely manner and they still had almost a year left before reaching the Best Used by Date, but these had a look and taste as if they had already passed the expiration date. The coloring was considerably darker and they seemed to have lost their sweet taste.  They are still edible and I am eating them.

review/summary: A classic never goes out of style
review/text: I've been eating Frosted Flakes for as long as I can remember. One of those simple treats that never gets old. Although, as age has not stood still for me, I tend to mix this with a more age-appropriate cereal such as bran flakes. A good-sized touch of Tony the Tiger makes the good-for-you cereal much easier to deal with.<br /><br />The box is huge, but inside there are two sealed bags of a more normal size that will fit in the cabinet. Very fresh, and if you catch it on a price dip, it's better priced than the warehouse clubs.<br /><br />Love those flakes!

review/summary: So refreshing!
review/text: I've been purchasing the True Lemon brand since I first discovered it on my supermarket shelf a few years ago. It's such a great way to get natural flavoring in your water.  It doesn't colorize your water, so it won't look like you are drinking fruit juice like most of those beverage powders for water bottles.  Plus, each packet is 25% of your daily vitamin-c intake, which is pretty cool!<br /><br />My favorite flavor of all three currently on the market is the True Orange.  But of course, it also seems to be the most difficult to find.  I found it once in a supermarket near me.  I tried it, I loved it, and I never found it there again.  Luckily, amazon.com sells it, so I can buy this for myself, and not have to worry about rationing my one box, which is very close to empty.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this!

review/text: Having tried many Jasmine blends, I found the Dragon Pearl blend basically the same as regular Jasmines but for the novelty of the leaves being rolled into tight little dried &quot;pearls&quot; which unfurl when infusing.  As far as I can tell, this does nothing to enchance the flavor of the brew.  It's a nice Jasmine blend, but nothing more.  I would recommend it for Jasmine lovers.

review/summary: BEST SCOOP FOR FELINE PINE PELLETS
review/text: I've been using a very similar scoop for about 6 years - its bottom was almost entirely round holes (I can't tell the shape/size of the front holes from this picture).  Altho they were originally designed for the "pearl" type of litter, the round holes are large enough to let the good unused litter fall back into the pan as you wiggle the scoop.  I have been unable to find this style in store for several years.  NOTE: this style is prone to cracking at the base of the handle, maybe because of the scoop's large capacity when scraping thru the litter.  I've recently broken my second one in 6 years.  But with a 6-pack you'll always be supplied, and the price is very reasonable, especially with Prime shipping.<br />I applaud the ingenuity of "Scribblemania" who reviewed the Feline Pine brand scoop.  I too spent way too much for a scoop that doesn't work with traditional Feline Pine.  Her idea of removing alternate dividers from a scoop styled with small rectangles (not long slots) is great - I'll suggest that you use a Dremel or drill to cut them out so that there are no sharp ends to catch onto the poop you want to remove.

review/summary: best scoop for clay clumping litter
review/text: ignore the "little pearls" litter type specific item name - this scoop is perfect for rice grain size 1-4mm Oil-Dri type clumping litter (like Tidy Cats Scoop or A&H Super Scoop).  this hard plastic scoop has a 5"x5"x2" hopper and a 6" handle, which i find is the perfect "man" size for scooping out 4" deep of litter in my 2'x3'50gal bin that i use as a litter box.  this deep hopper allows me to comb the box biweekly instead of daily after my two 8 pound cats, and this large deep scoop makes the job easier.  like most cat owners, i have a collection of other scoops i no longer use, and will tell you why i will never by another type:  the round holes on this scoop not only allow good litter to sift though, but also keep clumps from breaking up while rolling around in this scoop.  you'll notice this scoop is more hole and less screen, which allows the good litter to sift through it quickly which really helps when you are racking 30-40LBs of litter at a time.  the handle is perfectly angled for comfort and to prevent you from touching the litter even while deep scooping, especially since there are no holes on the sides of the hopper to get litter on your hands, like most other scoops.  the only downside is all the heavy lifting you may do after 2-3 years with this scoop wears out the plastic where the handle connects to the hopper - you could superglue it, but i opted to just replace it.  I would argue it's better to buy 6 plastic scoops so you have replacements in case of misplacement, breakage, or regifting, then spend the same money on a steel scoop which won't be any better, and if you misplace your steel scoop you are back to square one.  i prefer plastic because a metal scoop cuts wear and tear into a typical plastic walled litter box, while plastic on plastic will not.  you can buy a single <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AQQNS">Litter Scoop for Litter Pearls - 11 in. x 5 in.</a> here, but I think you'll be better off buying a few, since your cat loving friends will want to "borrow" yours as soon as they see it in use.

review/summary: Great for pellet type litters
review/text: Nearly every scoop out there is made for clay and other granule/sand litters. This scoop is marketed for the pearl litters, but works well for the pine and other pellet type litters. I purchased mine elsewhere so I could buy just one, but wanted to review it here because I'm so happy with it. The large size makes scooping the box quick and easy and the larger holes allows the clean pellets to fall through with minimal effort.

review/text: I love these pretzels. They are light and airy and have a buttery flavor that melts in your mouth. They work great by themself, and we melt chocolate chips and dip them in those too. I also crumble them and use them for crusts. If you keep the bag sealed tight, they will stay fresh for a while. I like these twisty ones, although my husband likes the straight ones. Maybe I like these better because if feels like my mouth is fuller and it holds onto the chocolate better. :) Enjoy!

I also love it because it's organic. With each day of my life I'd say i'm eating smarter and this product was the next step in my plan.

The shells and white cheddar can be turned into a super-fast almost-casserole by adding these quick items:<br />* canned tuna, heated in a frying pan with your favorite oil, a little Worcestershire sauce, and your favorite general-purpose spices (I vary these, but garlic powder, parsley, and a dash of black pepper work nicely)<br />* peas<br />* use a little extra milk when you add the tuna<br />All these items can be cooked and combined in less than half an hour, and the result tastes much like a tuna noodle casserole with white cheddar.  Very tasty, with hardly any effort!

The "Aged" doesn't even come close to tasting like aged cheddar..pretty much mild. 2 stars for attempting to make a strong flavoured mac and cheese though.<br /><br />Now i will say I do like my strong cheeses, balderson 7 year cheddar, asiago etc.<br /><br />Kraft the only flavour I like is Sharp Cheddar I can even add meat to it and still keep some of the flavour, others taste the same as Annie's so if you like mild or medium cheddar maybe you can eat this stuff but I find myself adding in some real cheese to get some taste. Not exactly sure how you can call mass produced food "organic" but those laws will be changing.<br /><br />And just taking a bite after typing that...taste like noodles with butter.

review/summary: Not so good.
review/text: Followed directions to the letter. Quarter cup of milk was way too much for the amount of cheese powder. I used a measuring cup, stirred and stirred, waited thinking it might thicken with standing, poured it over the shells and got shells with cheese water. Not creamy. Couldn't see it or taste it on the shells. I opened a box of Kraft macaroni dinner, added some of the cheese sauce and ended up with Annie's Kraft Dinner.<br />  I'm hoping maybe my cheese pack wasn't full. I plan on NOT following directions next time. I'll measure a quarter cup of milk and add it to the cheese powder a bit at a time until I get what I need, instead of adding the cheese sauce to a quarter cup of milk in the measuring cup.

review/summary: really really expensive
review/text: We have two large dogs and are always looking for high quality treats.  The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.  The chews were not long lasting (about five minutes).  I have purchased other high quality chews for a lower price so I can't really justify the high price of these treats.  We spend a lot of money on our pets but this is the first treat/chew that I felt like they might as well have been chewing on my wallet! (I think my wallet would have lasted longer)

review/summary: Best I Have Tried So Far
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH3M">Zoe Anti-Oxidant 8-1/2-Ounce Dental Chew Treats, Medium</a> actually worked really well. We have a medium-sized lab + something mix and she really enjoyed these. I'm generally not a big fan of dog treats, because they stink,, they don't help her breath/teeth much, they have funky things inside, and she has powerful jaws that enable her to go through just about any treat in a short amount of time.<br /><br />ODOR<br />As far as the smell goes, this wasn't bad at all. In fact, not only did it improve her breath, but there was a noticeable reduction in plaque. I didn't expect the treats to actually accomplish this, and was glad to see how well they worked.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />All natural and healthy.<br /><br />LONGEVITY<br />Unfortunately, the treats didn't last long. She finished each one in just a few minutes. I suppose I shouldn't expect treats like this to last too long (hence, the five stars), but it would be nice if they did.

review/summary: My Dogs Were Not Very Enthused
review/text: I tested these treats out on three dogs, a schnauzer mix, poodle mix, and a terrier mix.  They all got very excited when I opened the bag, but the terrier was the only one who seemed very enthused about the treat itself.  The other two kind of chewed on the treats for a minute or two, then just kind of stared at them.<br /><br />The treats are a little messy, especially near the end.  My dogs left tiny crumbs on the floor, so that's something to watch out for.  They're a good size, perfect for medium build dogs.

review/summary: Quite the hit!!
review/text: When I first received Haley's (my dog) package of Zoe Anti-Oxidant Dental Chew Treats (medium size), I took Haley and 3 of the treats to my neighbor's house to visit and share with her dogs. All 3 dogs LOVED the treats and got very possessive of their own. The dogs range from about 15 pounds to 30 pounds.  It took the boston terrier the longest to eat.  There were no crumbs leftover at all.  Haley normally carries bones around for awhile to protect and guard.  She started eating her Zoe bone right away.<br /><br />These bones are similar to Denta Bones in style, but they have much better ingredients.  I've given Haley natural dental bones before, and these have a similar smell.  I'm not sure if it's the rosemary or what other ingredient.<br /><br />I am very impressed and pleased with these bones.  They seem to keep the dogs busy for a while longer than denta bones, so that is definitely a good thing!  I will be purchasing these for Haley in the future.  I doubt I would give her one every day because of the calories, but maybe she will get them as a special treat a couple times a week.

review/summary: Short life, strong odor
review/text: On arrival, I distributed a chew to each of three dogs under 20 pounds who do like chews.  They each went at their chew with a will, and in 15 minutes the chews were gone.  As the chewing was in progress, and lingering, was a distinct odor similar to horse weeds and other strong herbs.  I cannot say how "dental" the experience was, for such a quick gulp.  If one of the purposes of the chew is to occupy a pet for any extended time, this choice is a flop--but it must have been tasty.

review/summary: Dog Loves It and Perfect Size
review/text: My dog has been using Check-ups and Greenies for a while and he loves this new addition to his dental chewies routine. The medium size is perfect for my 25 lb. cocker spaniel. The bone is roughly the size of a large chicken drumstick bone. When I was opening the bag, my dog followed me around. I suspected he knew this bag of bones was for him. He grabbed the chew bone immediately after I offered it to him found a nice corner and went about his chewing. It lasted a good minute or two. This stuff is made of quinoa, gluten free, and touts anti-oxidant benefits. And I assume it tastes good because it actually smells pretty good. 5 stars for Zoe Anti-Oxidant Chew Bones and I would buy again and recommend to others. When my dog is happy... I'm happy.

review/summary: Benny likes it. But why Nutraceuticals in Dog Treats?
review/text: My cocker spaniel enjoyed these treats. They do not contain corn or wheat, which is good because he seems to get itchy when he eats those grains.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not give them to our other dog, a beagle mix. He tends to get seizures after he consumes chicken, and since these contain natural chicken flavor, I did not risk giving him these.<br /><br />I received these treats as a sample. I would not bother to purchase them because of the cost plus the fact that only one of my pets can eat them.<br /><br />I wonder if the price would be lower if designer nutrients were left out. I mean, do dogs naturally want green tea extract? I realize that studies are being done on possible benefits of this substance, but throwing some in dog treats is not the same as having a vet prescribe it. When I searched the web for research on canine green tea extract, one of the first that came up reported that some beagles died in a study using high doses of the extract, so now I feel that caution may be advisable. Of course, your dog would have to eat an awful lot of these treats to get enough of it to suffer any harm; a single treat is almost certainly okay.<br /><br />Nutraceuticals have become trendy because marketers know that people are aware that certain nutrients have impressive health benefits. And including these nutrients give manufacturers a reason to charge more. You may want to ask your vet's opinion before paying extra for designer treats.

review/text: My chiweenie didn't think twice about making mince meat out of these chew treats. Once she got a hold of one, she didn't stop gnawing on it until there was only a knobby end left. It didn't take her too long to do it either. As for helping with her bad breath - meh. It became minty bad breath, but it was still icky breath.<br /><br />My yorkie, on the other hand, didn't really care too much for these treats. He'd tried them only because the other dog was enjoying it so much, but never cared for them much.<br /><br />From an owner's point of view, I do like the good ingredients these chew treats have. They don't get sticky, they are not messy, and they smell ok. I would gladly buy these again seeing how much my chiweenie enjoyed them.

review/summary: My dog loved them!
review/text: My 21 lb Cockapoo loved these treats. He's only 1 1/2 yrs old and I brush his teeth regularly, so his teeth still look great and he does not have bad mouth odor. If the treats helped to clean his teeth it was not noticeable to me. I do wonder how effective the treats are at teeth cleaning and mouth odor because my dog was able to consume them very quickly- within just a few minutes. Perhaps the treats leave some sort of residue in the dog's mouth and on their teeth to prolong the effectiveness. I thought the treats smelled rather strongly of beef stock, though the ingredients list natural chicken flavor, rosemary, parsley, and vanilla among other things. The ingredient list is not too long and are all natural. I've found my Cockapoo to have a rather sensitive stomach and these treats do not upset his digestive tract. I try to buy only natural, limited ingredient foods and treats. Unlike other reviewers, I have had no issues with crumbs or staining from these dark brown treats. My dog tends to eat the treats on our beige leather couches and there has been no residue.

review/summary: The dog loves them and they probably help his teeth
review/text: These treats are a huge hit with the dog; it's the only item he takes to another room to enjoy and be certain that we won't change our minds about it. They've got a tough exterior that he works hard at, but he likes it so well he never gives up. It's about 15 minutes from start to finish. That's a lot of good jaw and tooth exercise.<br /><br />Of course, when we ask him if his teeth feel cleaner, he doesn't say a lot, and a visual inspection doesn't tell us a lot. But with the way he works at these, we're certain it's doing something worthwhile.<br /><br />We've had other rawhide-like treats, and the dog abandons them after a while. Not so with these.<br /><br />We also liked the packaging, which was attractive, reseals nicely, and isn't extravagant or wasteful.<br /><br />The only thing we recommend you watch out for is to get a large enough treat size. We had a package of the "medium" size and for our dog, about 60 pounds, a larger size would have been better.<br /><br />Highly recommended --- by the dog as well as us.

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats!  There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes.  As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />Teeth cleaning ability? We were only able to sample 1 bag up front, so I can not comment on how well they would do over time, but can say that they did appear to be soft and chewy and looked like they would clean teeth over a period of weeks.  As for her breath?  Again, not enough quantity to make a call one way or another, but she did not have what I would consider bad breath.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per...  If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them.  However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them.  In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/summary: Slowly approached, but definitely enjoyed
review/text: My pups (aged 6 & 5) both enjoyed these, but since they talk I couldn't get their "official" position on them.  That said, having trained them extensively I'm pretty good at watching their body language.  When presented with these both pups were eager for a 'treat,' but after getting these in their mouths they both were slightly tentative to dig in.  Perhaps its because my pups normally get high-protein snacks like dried chicken breast, and they're not used to brown rice flour, quinoa flour, pea flour, & tapioca starch. Or perhaps it was the vanilla/mint flavor. Either way, it sort of reminded me of kids acting with trepidation about eating a new vegetable. But, after a few fleeting moments the question marks popping out of their heads went away and both pups earnestly chewed up their treats.<br /><br />The package says "Dental Chews" which normally speaks to an ability to remove tartar or freshen breath. The package states that the product "freshens breath naturally,"  so I assume the mint serves as a breath freshener, thus earning the title "dental chew" instead of "treat."<br /><br />That said, I'm pleased to know the product is wheat-free and corn-free, as I'm not a fan of feeding my pups either one of those all-too-common ingredients.  I was going to give the product four stars because the dogs didn't jump on them like white on rice, but then I realized that this is a very healthy treat that is a whole lot better for them than most of the stuff that's out there, and after the slight hesitation, both dogs seemed to enjoy these very much ... so five stars it is.

They are the right size for him but they did go down very quickly but he did not pester me for more so I can only assume they filled him up.<br />Now when I give him one he is very attentive and he sits politely so I will let him have it.<br />I would buy these again, I chose the medium size and that was perfect for my boy.

Being a fifty pound dog, it's also the perfect size for her -- not bulky like some rawhides (which she detests) and not too small like some treats.  One per evening was sufficient for her.<br /><br />My only knock on these is they are a bit pricey.  There are comparable products available priced a few dollars less.  If the price is reasonable to the consumer, I'd definitely recommend trying them as a healthy treat for your dog.

We have some medium puppies 30 lbs and adult 30 lbs dogs. Bull Mastiffs. And they like to chew it. That's good idea.

review/summary: love these
review/text: I get a lot of stuff from the Amazon Vine program but this is the first item that I liked so much that I added a subscription to my account for them. Freakin' LOVE these things. My golden retriever is 3 years old. She sees the vet every six months (ongoing medical issue) and each time the vet checks her teeth. She has never had to have a vet cleaning because I'm a bit compulsive about keeping her teeth clean. She normally gets a Greenie a day along with an additive in her water and regular teeth brushing. Yet there always seems to be a bit of tarter build up on her back teeth that I end up scrapping off with a scaler. After chomping down just two of these, that tartar was completely gone. The nice part is that they are much harder for her to chew than the Greenies. Even though I gave her size medium, it still took her several minutes to chew it up. (Greenies are gone within a matter of seconds) And she LOVES them. I'm pretty sure she would save a baby from a blazing inferno if she thought that is what it would take to get one. When she sees me going for the bag, she starts in with doing all the tricks she can think of. Hilarious to watch. They smell...interesting. Like mint and beef jerky? I can't put my finger on the smell exactly. It's not bad or anything. I am now getting a bag of mediums sent each month and will make it a part of her weekly dental hygiene. Very glad to have found these!

review/summary: Great for bad dog breath!
review/text: The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a really strong minty, doggy smell. I still can't decide what it is beneath the mint, but it is potent! Whatever it is, my little Maltese had no problem with it. She quickly buried the first one in the backyard, which she only does with things she really likes. She'll recover it later, I'm sure. The next day I gave her another one which she worked on for several hours before it was gone. When she jumped in my lap later, I immediately noticed that her bad breath problem was gone...wow! And it seems to last for hours. For us this is a big plus since doggy halitosis is a big problem with her.<br /><br />Another big pro for me is that these chews contain no wheat or corn products which cause allergy problems for my dog. Treats that she actually likes that don't contain these products are hard to find.<br /><br />One other con besides the strong odor is the gassiness that occurs later. I might not have put two and two together on this had several other reviewers not mentioned it. This is not normally a problem with her, however, and since nothing else in her diet has changed, I would have to attribute it to the Zoe chews.<br /><br />Since bad breath is such a problem with our dog, I might be tempted to purchase them regularly, even if the price works out to $2 per chew (5 in a bag @ $10 per bag). I might shop around first to see if I can find a better price, though. Maybe I could make them a weekly treat instead of a daily one.

review/summary: A Dental Chew My Dog Likes
review/text: My walker hound is a very picky eater. He does not like milk bones, snausages, or most of the usual cheap dog junk food. He doesn't even like those popular greenies or any other dental chew we have tried.<br /><br />At least, we found these. He absolutely love them. Our other dog likes them too, but he likes everything.<br /><br />They do have a mild smell but it isn't unpleasant to me. The first ingredients are brown rice and quinoa so I like that these aren't made out of junk fillers like so many dog treats and chews. on the market.

review/summary: Vanilla mint?
review/text: I understand that it says vanilla mint flavor, but I also expected it to smell something like that.  To be blunt, it is funky!  All three of my dogs (two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier)seemed to think that they smelled great, so who am I to judge.  I am careful about the treats that they get because the cocker spaniels try to inhale most of them.  These actually took them a while to annihilate.  Some treats leave a sticky residue on them and the carpet, but these weren't messy.  Although they smelled funky, the smell didn't linger on their breath.  The size was excellent for my dogs.  A lot of treats that are recommended for their size tend to be much smaller.  Six came in the pack, so I waited a while before giving them the second round.  They are a bit too expensive for me to buy regularly.  If they ever go on sale I would probably stock up.  Overall a pretty good product.

review/summary: Two Paws Up
review/text: My dogs (a 20-lb. and 32-lb. terrier mixes) showed their approval by enthusiastically accepting these chews and wagged their tales eagerly for more. To be fair, they love nearly all treats, but I approve of these, as well, because of the healthful ingredients, neutral odor (at least I couldn't smell them without getting down on hands and knees to sniff), and lack of slobber-staining as the dogs (as usual) chose out area rugs to enjoy their treats. I noticed no sharp points as they chewed, and the dogs are chew-savvy enough not to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />With high quality ingredients and a high terrier approval rating, I highly recommend Zoe Anti-Oxident Dental Chew Treats.

review/summary: Smelly, but my dogs don't swallow them whole
review/text: At last, a dental chew that my one dog doesn't inhale in one bite. Altho, it does smell pretty gross -- doggie chew on steroids, proteiny smell. I didn't detect any of the vanilla mint they were talking about in the description.<br />I was pleased to see Maggie the Inhaler actually working little pieces off of these. Her chomping down entire Greenies has worried me in the past. Because if it's in her stomach whole then it's doing nothing for her teeth.<br />The smell, like many dog treats, is a little overpowering. But I'll put up with it, if it's actually helping get her teeth a little cleaner.

review/summary: 6 out of 6 Dogs love these chew bones
review/text: We have 6 big dogs here, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Walker Treeing Coonhound. These dogs go through a bunch of snacks, treats, bones and toys to say the least. I am always on the lookout for healthier snacks - especially since the Ridgebacks tend to be sensitive to corn and wheat. (oddly enough, the random squirrel doesn't phase them)I like these Zoe Dental Chew Bones - no corn, no wheat and no soy.<br /><br /> When the bag was first opened, the smell of roasted chicken wafted out - good first impression! They don't feel particularly greasy to the touch, yet clearly have a flavored coating. I passed one out to each dog and they went to their respective beds to knaw away. The Ridgebacks can burn through other brands of similar type chews within a few bites, so I expected the same thing here. They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better. That was astonishing - these are hounds and they always assume someone else has something better than they were given. Meanwhile, that smell of roasted chicken has permeated the kitchen - so much so that now I want chicken for lunch! I will buy these in the future for our Heathens.

review/summary: Premium Dog Chews
review/text: My pups like these chews and can down one in just a few minutes, however, they seem to give my girls a bit of a gas problem.  Now, the pups have always farted but these treats seem to stimulated their little gas makers to go full tilt.<br /><br />As instructed, I haven't given more than one treat a day and I've skipped days and now I also know better than to give them the treats in the evening.  All I need is to have a bedroom filled with a bunch of dogs pootering all night long.<br /><br />As for the treats themselves they smell like mint and molasses to me.  They're somewhat glossy and you get 6 medium-sized 5" bones to a bag.  Pricy.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll buy any of these "Lifestyle Treats for Dogs" in the future due to the costs and the farts but the dogs like them well enough.<br /><br />Is being a dog really a lifestyle?

review/summary: Gracie gives this five stars
review/text: When Gracie (our mini-dachshund) sees me open the treat container, she comes running.  Then when I give her one of these chews (shaped like bones)...she is off to the living room where she always gos when not sure she's supposed to have such a delicious treat.  As for us, we are happy to give her one of these, knowing it's good for her teeth, her breath and her health.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pretty decent
review/text: (These are the medium anti-oxidant ones)<br /><br />Our dog likes these well enough.  She's not "crazy" about them, though.  She'll chew on one for a few minutes, but she won't go to town on it like she will other chews (raw hide, pig ears, etc.  So I don't think she "loves" them.<br /><br />Anyway, I broke it down a little further, as I'm sure every dog is different and some dogs might really love these.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Really nice and hard, will last a long time, take a long time for the dog to chew up.<br />- Made of quality ingredients, no corn, wheat or soy or other junk.<br />- package is nice and neat, not excessive, hard to get open, or anything like that.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- They smell really odd.  Almost like... breakfast sausage, but less appealing.  Our dog keeps her toys and 1 or 2 chews she's working on in the living room.  All the other kinds/brands she has, I can never smell them later.  But even after two days, I can still smell the thing when I walk into the living room.  Not really crazy about that, especially since she doesn't look like she'll finish one sooner than a week.<br /><br />- The price.  To me, the price seems a little high for what you get, even with the subscribe and save.<br /><br />If the smell wasn't so strong, I would probably give these 5 stars.  And our dog is still technically a puppy (lab) so perhaps she'll like them better as she gets a little older.

review/summary: Doggie dessert
review/text: My dog adores these! They are more dense than the usual dog treats yet not as chewy as rawhide. Though the chew appears dark in color, the color does not rub off only to carpet while the dog is chewing--as some flavored rawshide chews do. They are high in protein, anti-oxidant, and healthy for the teeth. An 8.5 ounce package contains six bones about the size of a chicken drumstick bone.

review/summary: A treat I can feel good about
review/text: My beagles really loved these. The bones are approx. 4 inches long and kind of shaped like a real chicken bone.  When I opened the bag, I could really smell them - not really a good smell, but I guess it's something dogs like. Once they started eating them, I could smell the mint. I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.  The price is definitely not out of line with other treats that are similar to this, such as Greenies and Healthy Edibles.  I'll probably continue to buy these.

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: I have 4 miniature dachshunds and one is very picky about his treats. Usually he snubs treats. I usually don't buy treats like these bones, but thought they might be a good change for my pooches (especially their breath). I was completely surprised when all the dogs LOVED them. In fact, the picky one ate his and then tried stalking the girls to get their bones, too. He never does that! While I might not have bought these bones again because they are a little pricey (about $10 for 6 bones), I think now I am going to have to invest in some more seeing as they made the dogs so happy! I can't say much about the breath enhancement- it still smells pretty foul in there- but maybe they need to experience the bones a bit more before there is any breath improvement. I guess these will become a regular treat in my house since it is the first thing short of a juicy steak I have seen the dogs so excited about!

review/summary: Puppy Approved!
review/text: I have three dogs, all relatively small. While they have no problem handling the size, I don't want them eating such a big quantity all at once. These bones are soft enough to snap in half, yet sturdy enough to require some effort in chewing on my dogs' part.<br /><br />They all enjoyed the flavor. These bones don't leave a giant mess and they smell somewhat minty. The ingredients are healthy, without the byproducts and assorted additives that I avoid giving them.

review/summary: Elvis the non-hound dog approves...and so do we!
review/text: Like everything else these days, even dog treats are going green, high-tech, and health-conscious!  Just look at the product description for these chew treats!  We have a 2-yo golden/Labrador retriever mix, the best dog we've ever had, and while the unusual makeup of these goodies gave him brief pause to consider, he was chowing down heartily before too long.  And the best news is, as a breath mint they affirmatively do the job!  No more doggie breath!  And it's a pleasant coincidence that Zoe (a Greek word for "life") is a family name shared by my mom and HER mom, so that's a nice touch that you don't care about but I wanted to mention to pad out this review.  Let your dog enjoy a package of these and I bet you'll be back for more!

review/text: This is a nice tasting white tea.  When brewing the Strawberry Paraiso make sure to steep for 2 minutes. You can boil the water in a teapot, but remember to add some ice cubes to cool it down in your tea maker.  The temperature is supposed to be at 175 degrees. It is my favorite so far from Teavana.

review/text: My family has used this oil for many years.  We used to buy it in Brooklyn from the Asaro family store in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.  They would put it in the cans while you waited.  It is the only oil my mother used for her salads.  She would say, "Get the good oil", and she meant the Partanna.<br />After we moved to New Jersey, we would go back to Brooklyn periodically just to get this oil.

review/summary: Very flavorful  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
review/text: I have tried many olive oils in the past with little to no flavor.  This oil has a wonderful taste. You can use this  oil ,almost as much as you would use butter, without all of the animal fat. I use use this oil for my salads, add to tuna fish instead of mayo, and use it once in a while to top off my cooking. My favorite way to cook with this oil is to fry eggs and garlic together, with a touch of sea salt and black pepper. I am glad to have found such a good tasting oil. Stay healthy , Retired early.
