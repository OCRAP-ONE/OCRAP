review/summary: Seattle's Best French Roast -- the best
review/text: Being a native of Louisiana, I was raised on French Roast coffee and have sought it where ever I may be.  Seattle's Best is probably the very best French Roast available this side of France.  There, you can enjoy excellent French Roast coffee along with chocolate or plain croisants -- at a gas station along the highway.<br /><br />I recently re-ordered a shipment of Seattle's Best French Roast but, unfortunately, I received a weak roast in lieu of what I ordered.  I may or may not try ordering from Amazon again.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to Starbucks French Roast
review/text: I like strong coffee and usually drink Pete's, Starbucks, or Seattle's Best level 5.<br />This is an affordable alternative to the equally great more expensive brands.<br />Full of flavor and rich in aroma I like it.

review/summary: Excellent in a Keurig
review/text: I use a Solofill cup with my Keurig single-cup brewer and this coffee tastes very good when brewed with it. I told my wife after trying it that it is a good "kick-you-in-the ***" brew for the morning! Dark & bold but smooth without bitterness, as others have stated.  Try it, you'll like it.

review/summary: Ultimate French Roast Experience
review/text: SBC's French Roast is fantastic!  Yes, I'm a Seattle coffee snob, but after having lived in a lot of different places in the world (many of which grow and roast their own beans), this is my absolute favorite.  This is also my favorite amongst the various French roasts I've tried.  The taste is full bodied yet not bitter (unlike another MAJOR competitor's French roast) and the coffee is never cloudy in the cup.  I've been drinking this French Roast for a long time and have never experienced a weak roast as another reviewer cited.  I will be ordering this coffee again and again. I only wish it was on Subscribe and Save (hint, hint Amazon)!

review/summary: Needs to go back to the test kitchen
review/text: I usually love Duncan Hines baking products, but this was a huge disappointment. I bought the frosting starter with the white chocolate raspberry add-in, and it nearly ruined my cake. The frosting consistency is way off - it's drippy and doesn't hold well to the cake. Looks awful. But worse, the taste was unpalatable. It tasted like cough medicine and sugar substitute. I couldn't bring myself to put it on my daughter's birthday cake, so I fiddled with it for about 20 minutes until it was edible and a little thicker. The cake ended up being eaten well by the kids, but the adults mostly scraped the icing off. Even after all my fiddling with it, it was only slightly better. Duncan Hines regular icing is great, in all varieties. But stay far away from Frosting Creations. I wish I'd dumped it in the trash and started from scratch. I now have a half eaten cake that no one wants because the frosting tastes off.

review/text: The consistency of the frosting starter base is disgusting.  It's thin, sticky, and leaves a very oily taste in your mouth.  The flavor packets, however, are genius!  I've been buying them and adding them to a regular can of vanilla frosting or to homemade buttercream.  The base is a waste of money.

review/text: Wow, what a complete and utter waste of my dollars.  I bought this along with the caramel frosting packet.<br /><br />Pros:  It did mix well, there was enough space left on top to stir and the powder did dissolve nicely.<br /><br />It was very easy to spread and swirl.<br /><br />Cons:  The texture was almost stringy/rubbery.  The taste was horrific without anything. It tasted like a gooey marshmallow having a bad day.<br /><br />We added the flavoring and it did not help.  The strange texture, flavor and now with the added caramel, it was simply disgusting.<br /><br />While the idea in theory was intriguing, the product failed completely in its execution.

review/summary: Ruined my cupcakes
review/text: This stuff is awful. My sister and I decided to make cupcakes so I got this to be fun, I got cotton candy and white choc raspberry. We opened the packets and immediately got a whif of the most horrible smell. The dust Goes rightt down your throat as you are stirring, and you can taste the smell also. It literally made me gag. I figured it was just bc it was concentrated, so I made the icings anyway. They were both disgusting and inedible. they smelled and tastes completely chemical, and the flavor barely comes through. I iced three or four cupcakes, and they don't even taste good combined with the cake. I ended up throwing out the rest of the icing and now have naked cupcakes I would rather eat than cupcakes with that Muck on them.

review/summary: Always check for damage during shipping, otherwise a great product.
review/text: I have been using this milk for my son since he quit breast feeding at 1 year. I find it mixes very well wether the water is warm or cool and he liked the taste from the beginning. This is the second time I was ordered the 6 pack from Amazon because I live out of the country and my family brings it when they visit. Unfortunately when my sister opened the case to pack 2 days before she flew to see me 2 containers were cracked. So if you do ordered it always check immediately to see that there was no damage during shipping because if you wait like we did it is too late to return it. Otherwise I recommend the product.

I see it in the stores for about $23 but I've seen specials for the $21 I paid on Amazon, but the service is great on Amazon. It came faster than I expected, about 7 days with free shipping; can't get that in the stores. It was packaged well and was delivered in excellent condition. It's nice to be able to get the same product I get at the stores delivered right to my door and for as good a price as I could get anywhere.

As for the formula itself, I love it too.  My son had problems with the regular baby formula so we used gentlease--then this.  The transition was easy and he was gas free (most of the time).  I trust this formula more then regular milk and will use it until he is 24 months.

review/text: I saw this at the grocery store, with a coupon, so I decided to try it. GENUIS! I have used it successfully in smoothies, but my favorite application is mixed with mashed banana, on a whole grain waffle or just eaten with a spoon (generally 1/4 to 1.3 of the banana per serving). My 1yr old son loves it too. I know he needs the fat, so he gets the real kind most of the time, but when we are out, he loves my PB2 as well. I think I'm going to bring some on vacation with us...

You can mix it with as little/much water as you want so you get the consistency you like and use it on anything!  It basically tastes exactly like peanut butter, just without the sugar - so if it's not sweet enough for you, you can add in a packet of splenda.  It's great!

You don't miss all the fat from the regular peanut butter as it has a great taste still.

I can mix it, cook with it, put it in shakes, sprinkle it over ice cream - ANYTHING.  I absolutely love this product and will continue to be a faithful customer.<br /><br />The fat/calorie content is negligible compared to jar PB but the taste doesn't show.  Contrary to another post I think this actually does taste like the natural brand jar PB's although you do have to play with the water ratio but that's whats great, I can dilute just a bit more and then make a creamy peanut sauce.  I hands down recommend this if you are a true PB lover but hate the calories and high fat.

I like it best on crackers, smoothies or other recipes so it certainly fits the bill in my opinion. My 2 yr old is none the wiser so for that reason alone I'd continue buying it. One of the negative reviews sited an 'aftertaste' as a reason it's bad, but all PB's have that. Drink some water if that bothers you.;) All in all bell plantation knocked it out of the park compared to other PB substitutes. LOVE the fact that I don't have to trade hours at the gym for getting my PB fix anymore!!

review/text: This is fantastic just as their chocolate powder. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon,a big one) with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. I am really glad I came across of it looking for a fat free calorie free, low calorie search. It tastes spot on like peanut butter. I used it first with Yonanas mixer (and chocolate one too) and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes) One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again. Actually I just had a thought, I think I will put it in recycled Yankee candle jar. That would work.

review/summary: Great in Smoothies!
review/text: I've found that this product is fantastic in smoothies and in banana whip (frozen banana in food processor, add chocolate powder, etc)as long as you add about 2 tbsp. Any less and it doesn't have too much flavor. I think for the calorie/fat content, it's a great product to give foods a peanutty flavor when you don't want to weigh yourself down. I haven't tried it as a paste or peanut butter replacement, but I'm satisfied with my creations so far.

review/text: We stumbled on this in a nutrition website and how couldn't live without it.  All the tastiness of peanutbutter and -0- [as in nada, zilch, none] fat.  Mixed 1/1 with water and stirred up, it acts & serves like regular peanutbutter.  The taste is super, texture just right, and for those midnight moments when a little smackerel of something comes to mind, PB2 is free of sin entirely.

review/text: This product is NOT peanut butter.<br /><br />It's powdered peanut butter. And that's why it's so great!<br /><br />If you're looking for a lower fat, diet/calorie friendly option to spreadable, creamy, delightful peanut butter that's not chemically altered or filled with weird ingredients... you've arrived! Simply mix this stuff with water and you've got a spreadable substitute!<br />This product really shines in a myriad of ingredients-- frostings become fantastically peanut buttery without heaviness or an additional caloric load. Smoothies become creamy shakes. Make peanut butter cookies with this as your flour and your mind will be blown with peanut butter presence.<br />The aroma and the hint of peanut butter flavor are the stars in PB2. Eating them side by side is like drinking half and half, and then expecting 2% to taste the same. If this type of comparison is hard for you to notice, then you'll love PB2!<br /><br />But remember, it's NOT peanut butter. Don't go expecting it to have the mouth-feel of full fat, smooth ground peanuts. Just relish the fact that this product exists, and use it where it really shines.<br /><br />P.S. You're always a Google search away from a PB2 recipe.

review/text: I read about this product in the Nutrition Action newsletter. I became very curious and looked for it in several local stores.  When I couldn't find it, I was very pleased to see it available through Amazon Prime.  I love love love peanut butter.  But, I can't eat too much because of all the fat.  This product was a joy to find.  It tastes very good.  And, it was fun to discover that I could create exactly the texture that I preferred - just add a little more or little less water.  I can use the peanut butter exactly the "normal" way: on sandwiches, a dip for apples, in sauces and soups; it works great. Hurrah!  All the taste and healthy protein; less fat!

review/text: I got this PB2, from a recommendation of many friends.  I was very skeptical because after all, its a powder!  But when I put a spoonful of this in my protein shakes, or sprinkle some on a sunday, it is delish!  Plus when one serving of "regular" ice cream is only 1 tablespoon, you get FOUR servings of PB2 for the same calories!  It is yummy and my children love it.  And since I care what they put in their bodies, I don't mind as much when they snack on PB2 and crackers or PB2 and jelly sandwiches, etc, because this is so much healthier (85% less fat!) than regular fat-filled peanut butter.  I am never going back to the other stuff.

I run frozen bananas through our juicer to make 'soft serve' and sprinkle/stir this in and the result is awesome!! I've had it on a sandwich with Nutella and that was outstanding too. I don't think I could ever go back to regular PB again. This packaging is a little awkward, once I cut it open, I put it in a plastic container to stay fresh. There is no resealing the package.

review/text: I discovered this while browsing through sugar free and low cal foods on amazon.  When I first tried it, I must admit I was a little turned off.  I couldn't decide whether I liked it or hated it.  But over time, I have grown to love this stuff.  I am on a high protein/low carb diet and normally peanut butter would be out of the question due to its high fat and calorie content.  That's what makes this stuff so great.  Sure its not as good as peanut butter but when is a low calorie version ever better than the original?  It's a great snack and takes away my cravings instantly.  I can eat it anytime of the day without feeling guilty.  I try to keep it between 1 and 2 servings which is just 45-90 calories.  The additional protein it gives me is a bonus.  I just ordered 3 more.

review/summary: Greatest stuff ever!
review/text: I absolutely love PB2! Most of the time I just put some in a baggie and take it to work. During a break, I will pour a little water into the baggie and mix it by squeezing the bag a few times. That way I don't have to carry a spoon to work or wash a bowl when I get home. I dip a banana into the mixed up PB2 and have an awesome snack!<br /><br />  Another way that I like to eat it is mixed up in some plain Greek yogurt. I mix a spoonful of PB2 and a spoonful of sugar-free jelly into a 5.3 oz Oikos Greek yogurt container. It is delicious just like this or spread on some toasted thin buns. Mmmmm....mmmmmm!<br /><br />  The only downside is that I don't like it by itself. It has to be on a banana or an apple or be mixed with something.

review/text: Hi! I bought this from Warehouse Deals. Product arrived in an airtight bag which looked a bit small for the money. When mixed with water to reconstitute the amount of peanut butter seemed okay. Product tasted very fresh. This is an excellent product if you like peanut butter but worry about fats and oils. Most are removed. I recommend the product. It has multiple uses. Can mix with honey, use as a topping and of course make peanut butter cookies. That last one is my favorite. PB cookies are my weakness.

review/summary: Amazing for peanut butter lovers who watch their calories
review/text: So, I am a peanut butter fiend - I admit it!  However, I am very health conscious, and I realize I can't eat peanut butter all day and stay thin. However, you really could eat PB2 all day and still successfully watch your weight.  This stuff is remarkably good, and I've tried just about everything out there in terms of lower calorie peanut butter substitutes.  I absolutely crave this stuff - So, if you love your PB&J but don't want to trade in for a larger pair of pants, then PB2 is the way to go.  It really does taste great.  When it comes in these 16 oz. bags like this, they're a bit messy. Powder seems to get everywhere.  I usually pour them into a large zip-lock bag (but a canister would be even better) to scoop out what I want, when I want it. Just a little tip there.

review/text: I am a passionate peanut butter lover, but as peanut butter is so high in calories, PB2 appealed to me. I actually haven't tried mixing it with water as per the directions, but I don't think I would enjoy it on its own or on toast, just as it isn't sweet enough (sorry, I need that bit of added sugar!). HOWEVER, I'm big on adding peanut butter to cottage cheese, and 2 tbsp of this PB2 powder to 1/2 cup cottage cheese is lovely! It's also quite nice mixed in with vanilla frozen yogurt (1 tbsp to 1/2 cup). I'd probably purchase again just for those uses alone, saving me 150 calories!

review/text: I am not using it to replace peanut butter so I can't comment on it's comparison to the real deal. I use it as a protein supplement in many foods from salad dressings to oatmeal. It would be a good thing to have for emergency food stock and I take it backpacking or hiking. It weighs very little.

review/text: All the good and none of the bad.  This tastes like peanut butter because it is, but it has most of the oil removed.  As a result, you get all the protein for so many less calories.  2 tblsps of regular peanut butter have 200 calories; 2 tblsps of PB2 have 45 calories.  Peanut butter pleasure w/o the  diet breaking guilt.

review/text: does it taste EXACTLY like fattening, sugar-loaded peanut butter? hell to the no!, but it certainly curbs the craving for it if you are a health conscious person, and it is delicious!

Spread it on bread, use it in protein shakes, sprinkle it on cereal, blend it with fat free cool whip for a peanut butter mousse..., The possibilities are endless!! I would never be without PB2 in my cabinet... EVER!<br />My husband and 14 year old daughter eat it as well, so I have competition:(, Oh well, just have to buy more!

The taste is great and well worth the low amount of calorie/points; but still packed full of nutrients.  Sometime I use the PB powder with a envelope of sugar free hot cocoa with milk and ice WOW that is fantastic, too!

review/text: I have ordered this stuff numerous times now and I haven't been disappointed. It is a bit on the pricey side, but I try not to use it all the time. The consistency is a bit less viscous and sticky than normal peanut butter due to the lack of oil I suppose. A great buy for those who want natural peanut butter flavor without all the calories and fat.

review/summary: Great Considering the Calories
review/text: This was my first experience with powdered peanut butter (didn't know such a thing existed until I found PB2 while browsing the best sellers in Grocery & Gourmet Food).  I think that while it is not quite the same as normal name brand peanut butter, but when you compare it to Skippy or Planter's brands - the two I had in my house to compare it to - this peanut butter has 75% fewer calories.  There is no way that I would rate this as being 75% less satisfying, so if your goal is to find a substitute for peanut butter that is better in terms of overall calories, this is the way to go.  It might take some experimenting to get it to a consistency you like.  The recommended 2 tbsp powder to 2 tbsp water was a bit thick for me.  Finally, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses peanut butter as an ingredient, as opposed to just eating something with peanut butter on it.  The powder dissolves much more easily than you can get actual peanut butter to mix into a sauce.  I particularly have enjoyed it in milk shakes.

review/text: i stumbled across PB2 when i was on amazon one day and was reading all the great reviews about it. I took a chance and bought the chocolate PB2 and regular PB2, best to buy both 1-1b bags. LOVE THIS STUFF. Its great in a smoothie, i dont like it by itself. You can mix it with water but i end up wanting to put something else in there to make it taste better. I have used it in cookie recipes for the peanut butter flavor and love it in smoothies. I will be planning to buy more this summer, since I will be having more smoothies.

review/text: Im not sold on using this as a peanut butter substitute (like for PBJ sandwich or dipping crackers or celery), but it is rock solid for recipes.  I like that I can get full blown peanut butter flavor in recipes (cookies, smoothies, cakes, pie, pancakes, ice cream, etc.) without the 200 calories of actual peanut butter.  The PB2 website has hundreds of recipes to use this with.  I check their site all the time for fun uses of PB2.<br /><br />As for making actual peanut butter (e.g. mixing the powder with water), I did not like it and wont use it for that.

review/text: I don't mind eating regular peanut butter because if I eat peanuts I expect to get the natural oil that comes with it.  I can get organic PB that only has sugar added and the oil is the same.  However, I love this powder! I am supplementing snacks in my diet for protein shakes and I have vanilla protein powder (it can be mixed with a variety of other flavors). But when I drink plain vanilla protein it's kinda bleh, so I add the PB2 chocolate and it's a Vanilla PB Chocolate dessert!!  I think it is great for those who are really strict with their diet and uses protein powder or smoothies and such.

review/text: I started the HCG diet and realized that I had to give up my beloved PBJ smoothies until I stumbled across this amazing product. When you mix as directed, it's a bit different than traditional peanut butter. It tastes more like the natural pb without sugar, which I prefer anyway. I mix in with a little less water for a more dense texture. When I blended with fresh strawberries, ice, a touch of fat free milk and stevia I found that this made the most delish lowfat/sugar PBJ smoothie ever! The regular version is usually a whopping 600-800 calories! This version with PB2 is merely 120 calories! Can't beat that! Amazon has the best price on the stuff too! THANKS! :-)

review/summary: UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter
review/text: Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the "Better-n-Peanut Butter" brand sold here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of "better n peanut butter" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( "Better n Peanut Butter" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this.
