review/summary: Too sweet for me
review/text: This is an organic loose leaf decaf Chai tea mix.  The herb mix in this Chai tastes too sweet for my taste; and my spouse agrees.  So now I'm stuck with several boxes that nobody here will drink.

review/summary: A tasty, comparatively healthy snack
review/text: For your health in general, and for your waistline, whole grains are good way to go. With this snack, Snyder's of Hanover provides a tasty, comparatively healthy snack that is organic as well! Not as salty as regular pretzels, these sticks make a delicious and really hit the spot. I think that they are great!<br /><br />(Review of Snyder's of Hanover Organic Whole Wheat & Oat Sticks)

review/summary: Absolutely love these!!!
review/text: These turned out to be exactly what I'd hoped...a great tasting, healthy snack.  A snack I never feel guilty about because it won't add any pounds!  And for my kids this is the perfect, healthy alternative to chips, crackers and other way over processed junk food that has no nutritional value.  I've read some reviews where people were complaining that there isn't enough salt.  It has the exact right amount.  Add a bunch of salt and these pretzels would no longer be healthy.  I like to find foods with nutritional value, not too much sodium, sugar, fat, etc, and my whole family loves them.  My kiddos dip them in natural peanut butter...it's really good that way!  Highly recommended...give 'em a try

review/summary: Sweet, not savory
review/text: I thought these sticks would be a great substitute for regular pretzels.  They are more sweet than savory.  More like a graham cracker type of taste than a pretzel.  Other members of my family like them, but I was looking for a whole grain alternative to a regular pretzel.  Gave 3* since family members like them.

review/summary: It's a dessert in a tea bag
review/text: I don't normally even drink tea but tried this out in the cafe onboard a cruise ship.  It knocked my socks off with the aroma and spicy taste, to the point I knew I had to track it down once I got back on land.  It still hasn't turned me into a daily tea drinker, but it's the only tea I stock in my house!  I'm not saavy enough to say if the teabag version is worse or better than the satchel version, but I stick with the latter because it just adds to the novelty of the tea drinking experience, somehow.  This item has proven to be a very warmly received gift by a couple of friends, one who loved tea and one who loves spicy flavorful drinks.

review/summary: Quickly Replacing Coffee for Me
review/text: I really enjoy tea and drink it frequently; however, I NEED coffee. I've been looking for something that can keep me away from my addiction for a while now. I'm not big on flavored coffees, or fruity teas so when my best friend (a guy) told me that I had to try this, I was skeptical...especially of a cinnamon tea. I've tried chai and  most people like it; however, I am NOT a fan. I was worried this tea would be like that. Man, I couldn't have been more wrong. This is the BEST tea...Naturally sweet, and perfectly spiced. I quickly became obsessed, and buying these at $2/bag at the coffee shop was really starting to hurt... So I knew I could depend on Amazon to have them. :)<br /><br />I just got my overnight order on Friday (10/5/12), so every morning this past weekend (and this morning included) I have had this tea instead of coffee. It's amazing. It's hard to limit myself to one cup a day, but I know if I don't I will quickly run out. :)<br />This is the first tea I've ever had that doesn't make me feel like "man, I miss coffee".<br /><br />Also, my husband is a sometimes tea drinker and doesn't like hot beverages (he will wait for hot tea to go nearly cold before drinking it, lol). Normally when I make a tea for myself, I will ask him if he would like one even though I know the answer is usually "no, thanks".<br />So here's what happened the other day:<br /><br />ME: "Would you like to try a cup of my 'special tea'?"<br />HUSBAND: "Sure..."<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;5 Minutes Later>>><br /><br />ME: "How is it?"<br />HUSBAND: "Mmmmm..."<br /><br />The next morning as I'm making breakfast, hubby gets up and sees me in the kitchen:<br /><br />HUSBAND: "So, can you make me some of that special tea?"<br />ME: "Oh,you liked it that much?"<br />HUSBAND: "Hell yeah! That tea is awesome."<br /><br />'Nuff said. Buy this.<br />I'm super serial. :)<br /><br />THAT BEING SAID - ***DO NOT BUY THIS FROM THIS SELLER*** This is way over priced for this tea. I picked up a tin of the Peppermint herbal variety from Starbucks for $10. They didn't have this variety, so I turned to Amazon. Amazon is always my first choice, but I really wish I had checked eBay. A seller there this same tea there for $11.50!! Also, one of the tins I received was dented, and it wasn't due to poor packaging. So $16.95, plus overnight shipping, dented tin... you do the math. I paid 2x as much as I needed to. So sad. Damanged tin AND totally overpriced.<br /><br />Sorry for the long review. I get carried away.

review/summary: Heaven in a mug...
review/text: I used to work at Caribou Coffee, who carries Harney & Sons tea (little did I know). Ever since I stopped working there I've lamented that I no longer get my free weekly hot cinnamon spice tea. To my surpise, after much hunting online, I discovered that Harney & Sons in fact supplies Caribou with their tea sachets. I was beyond joyous when I discovered that I could buy this tea to enjoy, and not only that, it's much cheaper than Caribou packages and re-sells it for.<br /><br />The sachets are a clever invention because they give a lot more flavor than a standard tea bag but don't require the time and dedication that loose-leaf tea and a strainer do. This tea tastes and smells like the holiday season with a kick. Cinnamon, cardamom, cloves...okay, now I'm just making stuff up, I'm not really sure what they put in this stuff, but it's heavenly.

review/text: I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in "store bacon" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the "good old days."  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.

I usually incubate for 8 hours overnight and no longer add hot water halfway through.  Always looking for the easiest way.  It turns out fine every time.  Still love the taste and convenience of this starter. Still just using half the recommended amount of starter.<br /><br />My batch of yogurt is actually 5 and a half cups rather than a quart. I use great old heavy glass jars similar to big peanut butter jars. I've never bothered to measure it before, till another reviewer made an issue of the cost effectiveness of making homemade yogurt. So the cost per "quart" for me is even less than the 97� plus electricity I mentioned in my comments to "Are You Kidding?".<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I love this starter. It's very convenient to have on hand since I live in a very rural area, and I think the taste is great. I get firm yogurt in my Salton in only 5 hours and I don't think it's anywhere near too tart. I find the flavor to be very pleasant when I lick the spoon. I eat my yogurt with fruit (no added sugar) and the flavor is not at all overpowering. Yogurt gets more tart when it incubates longer but sometimes I have let a batch go 7 or 8 hours and I still think it tastes fine.<br /><br />Because this starter is so pricey, I use just half of the recommended amount and it works fine. I first used it at the recommended strength for comparison. A half portion is a little less than a teaspoon. Then I tightly reseal the packet till next batch. I also save portions of yogurt for starter. I keep one in the fridge for the next batch, and freeze several. This way, a packet that costs a dollar or more, instead of just making one quart, gives me about ten quarts without too much fuss. On occasion I use second-generation yogurt for starter, but mostly just the first generation.<br /><br />Now that amazon is now offering a 3-pack of 6-portion boxes for a good price and eligible for Super Saver shipping, this starter has become much more affordable.<br /><br />Some additions/Dec. 13, 2009:<br />My Salton died a premature death.  Now I incubate in an insulated six-pack-type cooler, using jars of hot water alongside the jar of yogurt (which sits in the insulated holder from my old Salton).  I refill the jars of hot water halfway through.  I use the hottest tap water--obviously this is a potential variable--but the jars of water can be a lot hotter than the yogurt if they're not right up against it.<br /><br />It sets up in 6 to 8 hours, flavor still great.  I add 1/2 cup dry milk per oversized "quart" and still use just half the recommended starter.  I use nonfat milk which is notorious for not making real firm yogurt.  Mine is totally firm (curd-like or gel-like consistency) for the first serving.  After that the whey separates out some.  I either eat it or pour it off. It is not as creamy as commercial nonfat yogurt; I don't think that's achievable at home.<br /><br />I  use store-bought milk and do not scald it.  I warm it to 110 degrees, using a cheap candy thermometer bought right here on amazon.com.  I believe anywhere from 105 to 112 is OK.  I warm everything I'm using ahead of time.<br /><br />I'm glad my tips have been helpful and hope these details might help someone else out.

review/summary: Not bad, but not the best
review/text: First, I am quite surprised at how expensive this product is on Amazon; my local health food store (with a notoriously high mark-up on products) sells it for about 3.59/box. Otherwise it is a good product; definitely more potent than store-bought yogurt as a starter, but I've actually had much better results using my probiotic capsules that I use as a dietary supplement. Here's a quick comparison of results with yogurt starters:<br /><br />Store-bought yogurt: incubates in about 8 hours, results in runny yogurt<br />Yogourmet: incubates in about 5-6 hours, results in relatively thin yogurt<br />2 probiotic capsules: incubates in 3 hours, results in thick, luscious yogurt

review/summary: Delivered steaming hot
review/text: I have used this yogurt culture many times before and it makes great yogurt. However, my local store stopped carrying it, and I ordered these cultures from amazon. I am a prime member and chose a 2 day delivery. The package arrived steaming hot (it was over 90F outside) and was not packaged any differently than a non-grocery item. I did pick up the package as soon as it was dropped off by the UPS carrier. First batch failed, and so did the second batch. I am assuming that improper delivery destroys the culture and do not recommend purchasing it from amazon. A local store had it in the refrigerated section with yogurts and probably had it delivered accordingly.

review/text: I have used this product for several years and it makes wonderful yogurt and has some of the most useful bacteria in it.  I make a batch then take a sample out and put it in the freezer to use for the next batch.  That way the box of starter packets last quite awhile.  I keep them in the freezer.  I only use a new packet if for some reason my sample becomes messed up and starts developing an off taste.  This rarely happens, but it has happened and then I have something to start over with.  Great product!  Healthy solution!

review/summary: Quick and Easy
review/text: Priced right & easy to use!  I keep the boxes in the refrigerator.<br />If you have a yogurt maker, making yogurt can't get much easier.  (You can make yogurt with out a yogurt maker too.  You can use a warm oven or warm pad, ect. & you need to maintain the correct temp.  You can reserch all of this on our wonderful informative interenet!) There are lots of different makers out there.  Check them out & get what suits you best!  The basic idea for making yogurt is to heat your milk until it just starts to climb the sides.  Then you let it cool to about 90 degrees or so.  You can put your finger in it & it's comfortable.  If you have skin on your milk, skim it off.  Add the yogurt starter to the milk & mix it in well.  Pour it in your yogurt maker jar/s & incubate it for 4 - 24 hours depending on your needs & desired tartness.  You can even add fruits, syrups before pouring in the milk/culture mix!  Just like "fruit on the bottom" in stores only way way better!  Anyway, instructions come with the yogurt starter so your covered!<br /><br />Make your own yogurt at home, it's cheaper & more satisfying!<br /><br />Good luck & have fun!

The longer you hold it at 180 degrees, the thicker your yogurt. I use a double boiler to keep mine from scorching.<br /><br />While I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZ8S5U">Yolife Yogurt Maker (YL-210)</a> because you can use your own jars and vary the sizes, you can even make yogurt using your crockpot. Just google yogurt recipe crockpot.<br /><br />This is a super starter and works very well.

review/summary: Best Freeze Dried Yogurt Starter
review/text: I love this product and have been using it for many years now. It makes a perfect yogurt every time. I use the Yogourmet incubator too - a gift from my mother when I got married 12 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving is always the best! I have tried all of the Yogourmet freeze dried starters with fantastic success. The Yogourmet Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt Starter, is my favorite, found here on Amazon for a GREAT price. Due to the higher price though, I tend to use the original freeze dried starter the most. I give this company a 100% positive review. I have never had problems with any of their culture products or with the Yogourmet incubator machine.<br /><br />I use 2 quarts of milk with the recommended 10 grams of Yogourmet starter. I have found for myself, that the key to making great yogurt is to heat the milk to 185 degrees and continue cooking it at this temperature for 10 minutes. Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also breaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this broken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1/2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1/2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt - closer to 8/9 hours rather than 4/6 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc.

review/text: I make yogurt twice a week with yogourmet using the yogourmet multi. The family loves it. The timing I use is different than the instructions, it seems to need at least 8 hours to become thick enough. I also let it stand for 2 days in fridge. Afterward, I use hand mixer on low to give it a creamy texture. At that time I add stevia, liquid vanilla & or some type of berry. I jar it up in 8oz canning jars with reusable plastic lids. This way we always have serving size available, easy to grab and go. (I also use raw milk)

review/summary: THIS is the culture recommended for the SCD diet.
review/text: I use and enjoy this all the time. I strain out all the whey and water<br />after incubation and get a v-e-r-y thick yogurt after draining.<br /><br />How thick you ask?  Well thick enough to support a chief's knife standing upright.<br /><br />The taste is great!  Just the right amount of tart -- how real yogurt is<br />supposed to taste without the post incubation sweeteners added to most commercial yogurts found in supermarkets.<br /><br />THIS is the SCD recommended culture because it contains three, and only three cultures:<br />  -- L.bulgaricus<br />  -- S.themophilus<br />  -- L.acidophilus<br /><br />Specifically, it does NOT contain Bifidobacterium (frequently shortened to Bifidus) which is considered anathema to the SCD diet.<br /><br />Nor does this culture contain any "other", "unknown" or "miscellaneous additional" bacteria which are frequently listed under "Ingredients:" on commercial yogurt containers.  Yogourmet cultures are produced by Lyo-San, Inc. in Canada.  Lyo-San &lt;lyosan.ca> specializes in growing pure cultures as well as mixing & packaging their freeze dried cultures in precise amounts.<br /><br />[Lo-San does, however, offer a variety of other culture combinations which DO CONTAIN Bifidus.  Those packages containing Bifidus DO NOT have a cover graphic depicting a bowl of yogurt with SIX Strawberries.]

review/summary: A pretty good deal
review/text: This is less a review of Yogourmet's freeze dried starter and more of a clarification of the value.  I mean, how much is there to say about a starter? It either works or it doesn't.<br /><br />When I ordered my Yogourmet yogurt maker, it came with a box of the freeze dried starter.  The box contained 3 double packets of yogurt.  A single packet will do the job for a quart of yogurt, and a double packet is needed if you are doing a full two quart batch.  Long story, short: I thought I was just purchasing a box of 3 double packets when I read the description (Pack of 3).  That seemed a little pricey at $12.  It turns out that that this item is actually 3 BOXES of starter (each with 3 double packets).<br /><br />I just wanted to clarify that in case you skimmed through the product description too quickly, like I did.<br /><br />Happy yogurt making!

review/summary: Makes good soygurt!
review/text: I can't tolerate milk(unfortunately), so I make soy yogurt. I love this starter because it's just so easy to use, and the flavor is full and tart.<br /><br />Personally, I like my yogurts sour enough to bring tears to my eyes, so I incubate my yogurts a good ten hours, sometimes twelve.  My only suggestion for making soy yogurts is that you might want to add a teaspoon of maple or agave syrup to your soymilk to give your culture something to munch on.  Soy milk is not the same as milk, remember.<br /><br />I don't have an electric warmer; instead, I use a "Yogotherm". Basically, it's a two-quart plastic bucket and lid that you pop into a styrofoam holder to maintain the temperature. A great $20 find if you don't have the patience for washing out tiny cups.

review/summary: Runny yogurt
review/text: I'm an experienced yogurt maker and thought I would give this a try. I've made three batches with it thus far and each has been runny. I use the heating pad method, always ensure I don't disturb the milk after incorporating the culture, etc. It's the same method I've always used to great results - except with the Yogurmet starter. At best, it was an expensive trial with disappointing results. I won't be buying again.<br /><br />If anyone reading this has suggestions for a good freeze-dried starter, please leave a comment. While Stonyfield works great, I don't always make yogurt batches back to back and having to go buy some to make some seems to defeat the purpose somewhat. Ideally, I'd like to have a freeze-dried starter on hand at all times, which I was hoping the Yogurmet would provide. Unfortunately, all it seems capable of turning out is yogurt for use in smoothies. And yes, I know I could strain it through a cheescloth/towel or add dried milk powder to firm it up, but I've never had to do that when using other starters. Unfortunately, the fall-back brand of starter I used in the past is no longer available so I'm trying to find a new one.<br /><br />Your suggestions for alternatives will be greatly appreciated.

review/text: I really like this starter. It's a little spendy, but we get much more consistent results than when we use the previous batch of yogurt as starter.<br /><br />Hanging the yogurt in cheesecloth for a few hours makes an incredibly thick, creamy yogurt, a lot like Greek yogurt.<br /><br />We use fresh goat's milk, and oh boy! Do we love our yogurt!

review/text: Yogourmet is a terrific product!  It produces no-fail yogurt every time. It dissolves quickly, makes yogurt with a good taste and texture.  Before using this product I was using the end of the previous batch as a starter and had a few less than desirable results. With Yogourmet,there's never a problem. I don't use a "yogurt maker", just a couple of canning jars and an insulated cooler.  This product makes the whole process simple.  I'm very happy with it.

review/summary: Thickest yogurt I've made
review/text: I tried using Dannon yogurt as my starter but the yogurt was too thin.  I decided to give this a try, and because of my first failed attempt with the Dannon starter, I used 1 cup of cream to 3 cups of milk to see if it would help it to become thicker.  My yogurt is perfect now after only 4 hrs in my yogurt maker.  I then use 1/2 cup yogurt from my jar to make the next batch.  Works like a charm.

review/text: I have been useing this brand and making my yogurt for about 3 mths I guess. We love the fact u can add your own items to suite your taste buds for that day. The #1 favorite is making smothies( out of this world). I do not know the screen name, but there is one reviewer that gives a lot of great tips that work very well. So take your time to read some of the longer reviews and u just might get some great hints. One I did try and worked just fine was using one side of the package for every 2 qts. So if you make 4 qts, just take out one envolope and cut both sides open and mix, u get the same thickness and great taste as if u used 1 per qt like the directions say too. So that means I get 2 times as much yogurt, then I would if I go by the directions. I even have a little yogurt fan, I make him about 2 qts every 2 weeks, and he loves it ( he is 5), him and his mommy enjoy making smothies also. When he started getting low he will come and ask me to make him more. So even kids love it. I use whole milk, heat it to 180F ( hold it at 180 for about 10min), then let it cool to about 105, mix the cultures in and then place in the qt jars. I turn my oven on for a short min or less at 350 ( place my candy temp gage to make sure it is at 105 to 110), turn the oven light on, and set the jars in ( put them more in the back), at one hr I turn the oven back on 350 for less then 40sec,( test your oven to see how fast it heats up, every oven is different, so yours may get a lot hotter faster then mine) check to make sure the temp is still good (105 to 110). I may do it one or two more times if I remember to. I find this makes my yogurt thicker, then if I do not do a quick reheat. But make sure u do not get the temp to high or u will kill your culture. Mine set in about 4 hours, but we like a little more sour taste so I leave it 6 to 8 hours. Then put it in the refrig, and eat up the next morning. There is so many ways u can rest your yogurt, just find one that works for u, the oven just happens to work for me. YouTube is another place to get hints.

review/summary: Have used this brand for a dozen or more years..here is why
review/text: Have been making our homemade yogurt for decades and the reason I use this starter is even though I remove 1/4 cup of the batch I have made for the next batch, after a few months its good to have a fresh culture starter.  So every 3-4 months after having made literally gallons of homemade yogurt I will open one of the sealed packets of starter culture and start a new fresh batch of yogurt.  But we make a gallon of yogurt per week, because we eat yogurt with a half teaspoon of cinnamon in the morning, and make yogurt cheese for both cheesecake and for mixing with herbs for our own yogurt cream cheese with crackers or on bagels.<br /><br />If you eat little yogurt you could simply buy a small cup of store bought plain yogurt and use that for starter, but you also have to make sure the store bought stuff has no milk from cows that have received hormones or antibiotics. Something we avoid by only using organic raw milk.

review/summary: It did not work for me at all...
review/text: I've been making yogurt for a few months with much success. So I am not new to this...<br /><br />I normally make yogurt with a previous batch, but I came across this product and saw the awesome reviews. I thought I could perhaps get better results with this starter, so I purchased two boxes. I followed the direction to heat the milk up to 180F and cooled it to 73-77F. I thought cooling the milk to 73-77F was strange as I've always cooled it to about 105F before adding previous bacteria culture into warmed milk. Most of the recipes I have seen online required the milk to cool to 105F as well, so I was a little bit confused. But then I thought the Yogourmet culture was special and therefore has a different temperature requirement.<br /><br />Well, I have an awesome thermos that always keeps the temperature for a prolonged period. I put the milk with Yogourmet mixture at 75F and set it aside for 14 hours (instruction said between 12-15 hours). As soon as I woke up in the morning, I excitedly opened my thermos. I discovered nothing but milk. There was no whey, firmed yogurt, nothing. It was literally how I left it.<br /><br />It seems like I am the only person who has had no luck with this culture. I am sure this company is great and the culture works normally as I can see from the previous reviews. I might have gotten a bad culture pack because it really did nothing for me. I am definitely not a beginner so I know I didn't make any mistakes in following the direction. I will email the company and see what can be done.

I've followed the instructions to a T, and I have an electric yogurt maker, so I know (assume) the temperature is correct, as I've had great success using store-bought yogurt as starter (which I felt kind of canceled out the benefits of homemade), but I just can't get a batch of thick, rich, yummy yogurt from this product.  Must be me, since everyone else thinks it's great, but I'm at a loss as to understand my lack of success.

review/summary: Very Tart Flavor
review/text: I found the flavor to be too tart. My family did not care at all for the flavor. To get the thickness I wanted I had to incubate for 17 hours then strain. However when I tried using some 'store-bought' yougurt as a starter ( 1 cup) plus 1 cup powdered milk. The desired thickness was achieved in 8 hours and the flavor was delightful! lick off the spoon mellow. So I am going to experiment with this culture to see if I can achieve the results I want without having to incubate for 17 hours. Any ideas from anyone? -MTF Aurora CO.

review/summary: Economically nuts
review/text: This is just nuts from an economic perspective.<br /><br />This starter costs $12.61 (if you assume free shipping), and this is good for three batches of 2 liters each.  That works out to $4.20 per batch.  The milk for this costs about $4.00 a half gallon for organic milk.  So now you're up to $8.20 per batch.  But you also should add some non-fat dry milk, about 1/3 cup per batch, adding about another $2.00 (for organic).  So the 2 liters (or 1/2 gallon) of yogurt is now up to $10.20, and this doesn't include the amortized cost of a yogurt maker, if you're using one, or the electricity cost.<br /><br />Or instead, you can buy very high quality Nancy's organic yogurt in a great reusable container for under $7.00 for a half gallon and not have to do any work at all.<br /><br />It's up to you.

review/summary: If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...
review/text: UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

review/text: Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue.

review/summary: Great for snacking or for a small meal!!!
review/text: These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones. I agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as I bet these would taste even better warmed up!  I bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when I get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs.  These would be great for someone doing a low-carb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body.  One bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar.  Bottom line is this... if you love hot wings and can't get enough give these a try.  You won't be disappointed.

I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.<br /><br />Lean, good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises.  My only criticism is they must cook these in crack cocaine, because I'm absolutely addicted to them.

review/summary: Jack Link's is always great
review/text: I love the steak nuggets (and tenders) even better than their regular jerky.  I swear by all three of the Original, Peppered and Teriyaki Beef flavors.

review/summary: Wouldn't buy it again
review/text: I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.

review/summary: Might make okay dog treats....
review/text: I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.

review/summary: Dry hot wings
review/text: I find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when I'm craving buffalo wings late at night. Sure they're not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor. They are very hot but delicious.

review/summary: Better than standard jerkey
review/text: I normally have beef jerkey with my lunch for some easy to transport protein. I decided to give these a try, bought them at the grocery store and they were great. Easy to measure and a lot less stringy than normal beef jerkey.<br /><br />I ended up saving a ton of money using amazons subscribe and save over using the grocery store. Definitely something I'll reorder.

review/summary: WOW!
review/text: These taste amazing! Best jerky I've ever had. They are kind of expensive, but once in a while Amazon will lower the price slightly and hopefully that happens when they are offering a 10% off Jack Link's products promo code. Anyone who likes jerky or is simply looking for a convenient high protein snack should give these a try.
