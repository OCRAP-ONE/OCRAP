review/summary: Amazing Tea- Overpriced
review/text: This tea is as awesome as everyone says it is.  I swear by it.  Only thing is that you can get this tea at your local grocery store for under $5 for a 20 count box.  Anything over that price is not worth it.

review/text: In response to "I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being?"  I think it does!  Whenever I drink this tea I feel happy and warm all over (especially now, since we're under 18+ inches of snow).  The tea is yummy.  It took a little getting used to since I'm a devout coffee drinker, but now my morning isn't complete without a cup of Tazo's Green Tea.

review/summary: Best hazelnut K-Cup we've found...
review/text: We have tried several different types of Keurig cups in search of the right Hazelnut coffee. This is the best we've found!  Overall, I like the taste and aroma. The only possible opportunity is that it could be a bit stronger...but I think this is more a case of personal preference (I like my coffee strong!) The hazelnut flavor is well balanced---strong without overpowering, not overly sweet like some other hazelnut coffee flavors.

review/summary: Awesome Taste, Great Aroma!
review/text: When I first got my Keurig brewing machine, I was a little skeptical about the quality of coffee any K-Cup could provide. After making a cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee using a K-Cup from a sample pack, I now stand corrected! Gloria Jean's makes great coffee to begin with and their Hazelnut coffee in K-Cup form is fantastic.<br /><br />The coffee gives off a wonderful Hazelnut aroma while it's brewing and it tastes great! It's the kind of aroma and taste you'd expect after grinding the beans yourself, but the K-Cup saves you the hassle. In the time that I've owned a Keurig brewer, this is hands-down one of the best coffees I've tried, and I'll definitely be ordering it again.<br /><br />My only complaint is in the packaging, but since it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the coffee, I can't rate it less than five stars. Just wish this 50-pack came in a differently-sized/designed box so it would store more easily in a kitchen cabinet.

review/summary: Delicious hazelnut aroma!
review/text: I love Gloria Jean coffee and their hazelnut K-cups do not disappoint. The aroma smells mouthwatering as it's brewing and the strength is just right. I do have to admit that hazelnut coffee tends to be on the light side of coffee strength so strong coffee drinkers beware! I always use the medium cup setting on the Keurig B60 special edition so if you want it stronger, use the smallest cup setting. At $0.60 per cup, this is easily the best value for coffee, especially if you're drinking a mug everyday like me.

review/summary: Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/text: I'm generally not a fan of Hazelnut coffee but even I like this one.  My husband tried this in a sample pack and loved it so I ordered them for him.  I was surprised that the cups arrived loose in the shipping box so make sure you have a container for them as this box doesn't exactly fit in the cabinet the way the small retail boxes do.  That said this coffee has a nice bold taste which works great in a big mug.  We will definitely buy more of these.

review/summary: Hazelnut Heaven
review/text: My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.  The Gloria Jean's is our favorite, even beating out Dunkin' Donut's and Millstone's Hazelnut Cream (which used to be my favorite) hands down.  We always make the largest size cup and there is still plenty of flavor, never watered down or "thin" tasting.  I've always been the major coffee drinker in the house, until we got the Keurig and then the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut.  My husband now drinks 2-4 cups a day!  Make the investment in the Keurig so much more worth it.<br /><br />This purchase is a great deal.  At $0.60 per cup and free shipping, it's a fabulous price and I don't feel like I'm paying extra money for packaging.  It does come in a no-frills box with all 50 of the cups just loose in the large box.  However, we have a holder on the counter which we fill and just keep the box in the pantry to pull from as we need.  If you have a storage situation like a stand or a drawer you keep your K-cups in, you'll have no complaints about them being loose in the box.  We're about to order our second box, and will definitely be repeat buyers!

review/text: I spent a good deal of time & money stoppin by DunkinDonuts every morning for a Hazelnut Coffee, of course it was never consistantly good with a different person always making it.  So.... My wonderful boyfriend bought me a Keurig & since then my mornings have been 100x's better!  I love the convience, they are the right size & tastes great! The hazelnut smell alone gets me going in the morning!<br />Great Product & Great Price compared to purchasing in the store!

review/summary: Need to seal the tops better
review/text: Granted that I live nearly 2 miles above sea level and packaging expands here, but the majority of seals on these k-cups blew.  That meant that I either had to throw out the k cups, pour into the k cup attachment or just use a sieve and another coffee cup to pour out the grounds. Plus there was a lot of cleaning up to do.  First thing in the morning, this is not what I want to deal with.  I gave up on anything from these guys.

review/summary: Love this Coffee!
review/text: I love this flavor of coffee for the Keurig machine.  It's subtle and not too sweet.  My husband love his coffee super sweet, but I prefer mine black, and we can both enjoy this without adding anything to it.  I definitely think this particular item is a great value.  When a couple people make coffee daily, you can really go through the k-cups, and this product keeps us stocked.  When these arrived, there were one or two that had been damaged in transit, but it didn't really bother me.  I removed the broken cups and transferred the rest to our k-cup staging area.  Definitely a good buy.

review/text: I guess my title says it all.<br /><br />Price has gone up 30% plus in the past three months. I have got my old coffee maker back out for when there is more than one of us having coffee. At over 50 cents a cup, even on "sale", this is too much. (All K-cup were at one time 30-40 cents now they are 50-60 cents!)<br /><br />For the taste it is weak at best and I am not a strong coffee drinker.  Better flavored Kcups out there but this one is just OK.  I do like some other Gloria Jean's coffee but usually get the bold one's just get a normal cup of coffee.

review/summary: Barely a Hazelnut Flavor from Gloria Jean
review/text: Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers. So I happen to like Hazelnut flavored coffee and I drink it often. When I saw the chance to get some for home it looked like a good idea. Idea may have been good but the Gloria Jean Hazelnut flavored coffee fell flat on my taste buds. The best I could give it is 'adequate' since the gas station on my way to work has stuff much better for a fair price. I will use the Gloria Jean stuff up then forget about it because I don't want to be bothered sending it back. Live and learn and take the bad with the good to let an educated perception be my guide.

review/text: These k-cups are a terrific price, and "green" as you're saving on packaging.  This hazelnut flavor is our favorite, as it's subtle, not overwhelming, just delicious.  We buy it through the "subscribe and save" program which saves even more on cost, and the coffee shows up on our door step as often as we'd like ~ and we incur no shipping charges...that program can't be beat.  Overall, this is a great product and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Coffee=great. Package a surprise!
review/text: This order came with 50 K-Cups loose in a box.  Surprised me because previously when I ordered this quantity of a K-Cup they had come in 2 inside boxes which helps me with storage.  I'm not complaining exactly, just commenting.  Love the coffee, however!

review/summary: Great value and taste
review/text: When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.  Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it.  Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container.  I just appreciate the value.  All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Great way to buy k-cups - the box of 50 is perfect and affordable.  As for taste - this is one of our favorite brands.  The Diedrich columibia blend and coffee people donut shop are also excellent.

review/summary: Far from the best Hazlenut coffee I've tried
review/text: I noticed a "different" aroma when the box arrived.  Hazlenut is my favorite flavor but I felt this flavor was not as good as other Hazlenut blends.<br />The taste is slightly bitter and just less rich and satisfying than other coffees.  Drinkable, is the best I can say.<br />I won't order this brand again.  This is my first negative review, so it isn't my personality, just the coffee.

review/summary: Superb flavor, excellent value, nice box!
review/text: I'm not really a fan of fruity flavored coffees like raspberry chocolate frappa-mocha-cina or french vanilla twist or what-have-you, but occasionally I do like a hint of hazelnut in my cup of joe, and Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups handily fill the bill.  The hazelnut taste is fairly subtle, blending well with the rich flavor of the coffee.  I've tested brewing on all 3 settings on our Keurig, and prefer the medium and large cup settings in terms of coffee strength.<br /><br />Buying these on Amazon ends up cheaper than pretty much anywhere else (yes, even cheaper than Bed, Bath and Beyond with the coupons) and the frustration free packaging is great.  Open up the box with your bare hands (no wasteful shrink wrap to throw away or hard plastic that needs to be cut with a knife), and fold the box up for recycling when you're finished.<br /><br />This is my second time ordering this set from Amazon and it won't be my last.  And writing about it reminded me how good it is so I've just gone and made myself another cup!

review/summary: Hazelnut flavor perfect for even hesitant coffee drinkers
review/text: First of all, I'm not a big coffee drinker. I asked for a Keurig for Christmas because I'm a second year law student and I could use a cup of coffee (or 2, or 3) while studying, but I didn't want to drink the Maxwell House that my parents drink. I was enticed by the idea of flavored coffee. This Gloria Jean's Hazelnut does not disappoint. I brew the 8 or 9 oz cup and add 1 tablespoon of fat-free hazelnut creamer, and I'm good to go. It has a nice smell and flavor that makes me feel cozy. Some reviewers would say that this coffee is bitter. I would disagree. I'm gradually warming up to the taste of coffee (I think it must be an acquired taste) and I still shy away from anything with a dark roast or anything with a bitter taste.  If you are like me and are not a huge fan of coffee (unless it is flavored) try this. I'm currently debating purchasing a Gloria Jean's Flavored Coffee Variety Pack along with this giant box of delicious hazelnut.

review/summary: Flavorful lighter coffee & great deal w/ Subscribe&Save
review/text: Bought these k-cups on a Friday sale and used the subscribe & save option for an excellent deal on another 50 k-cups.  Haven't tried this flavor before, so it was a gamble since I was going to be stuck with 50 coffees if I didn't enjoy it.  Fortunately, the reviews were correct, this is a good, flavorful coffee.  A bit lighter than I was used too, but that enabled me to use less creamer (Chocolate Toffee) than I normally would need.<br /><br />Amazon shipped this package quickly, all were in great shape, and the k-cups don't expire until next March.

review/text: I can understand how this appears to be a fairly good price as the k-cups expired back in July 2009... they are over a year old.  However, I do not notice a stale taste, but I wonder if I may be missing out on some freshness.  I plan to contact the seller and find out if all they sell is expired k-cups.

review/summary: The coffee is great but Packaging is terrible!
review/text: The coffee is fine, and the price is a bargain, BUT...when the box was delivered, there was loose coffee coming out of the bottom of the box.  Some of the K-cups were open and had to be thrown away and were not useable.  It looks like the K-cups are just thrown into the carton and some were torn open in the process.  The box was undamaged so the damage was not incurred during shipping.  If it occurs again, I'm going to cancel the subscription.
