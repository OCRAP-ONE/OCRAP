review/summary: Too Thick
review/text: The taste is great,  but it is so thick, you can't pour it,  and can't get it off of the spoon.  So it is not useful for trying to make chocolate milk,  and it is a pain to use as a syrup for ice cream.  This is much more like a fudge consistency.  Would not  buy again.

review/summary: Very good replacement for sucrose, but be warned...
review/text: I began using Xylitol as a replacement for sugar about two months ago.  Since then I have not consciously used table sugar in anything I have eaten or drank.  As it was I was only using it for coffee in the morning, and tea in the evenings.  Now I don't use table sugar at all.  Xylitol is as sweet as sugar, and has a vastly different impact on your blood chemistry.  I'll spare you the biochemical details, and suffice to say that if you are on a low-carb lifestyle, Xylitol fits right in.<br />That having been said, make sure you are willing to make a commitment to this product.  Xylitol is not digested, but rather is consumed in part by the bacteria in your stomach.  There is an adjustment period while you build up the suitable level of bacteria (good bacteria, mind you) in your intestines to consume this stuff.  Until that time (and if you go on antibiotics you will experience this again), Xylitol can give you the runs, and gas.  Once you are fully adjusted (takes a couple of weeks), then you will be fine.<br />As to this particular brand of Xylitol, it was very conveniently packaged in single-serving packs (4g) which makes monitoring your intake of this particular stuff very easy.  I have to say that the shipping is very good.  I had the product in hand about 4 days after ordering it.  The retailer has brick-and-mortar locations local to me, but they didn't carry this product there.  I have since ordered again via Amazon, with the same great shipping results.

review/summary: Buy American, this product is from China
review/text: There are two mainstream commercial sources of Xylitol - Corn and Hardwood trees such as Birch. Many rumors have circulated on the internet regarding the benefits and or drawbacks of either. Here you can gather the facts.<br /><br />The structure of Xylitol does not differ between corn based and birch based xylitol. However, it is a fact that the vast majority of corn based Xylitol found in North America is imported from China. Almost all imported Chinese Xylitol is derived from corn.<br /><br />Also a fact is that most commercial sources of corn itself are genetically modified. This is not true of birch trees.<br /><br />The process utilized in making birch based Xylitol is envirnmentally green and sustainable, in fact the process often uses caommercial scrap that may otherwise be discarded.<br /><br />So is Birch better than corn? You be the judge, each individual can make up their mind. Prices are almost the same, if the description doesn't say American birch you can assume it's Chinese corn.

review/summary: Great sugar alternative, that's good for your teeth!
review/text: Box of convenient xylitol packets perfect for on the go.  Xylitol is a sugar alternative that is a sugar alcohol, but an organic compound.  It is low calorie, lower than sugar, but not calorie-free.<br /><br />It's about as sweet as sugar, and doesn't have the odd aftertaste of other alternatives like stevia.<br /><br />It's great in coffee, or as an additive just like sugar.  Plus, it does not promote tooth decay like regular sugar.  In fact, xylitol based products like chewing gum are even supposed to help prevent cavities!

review/summary: XyloSweet is ok
review/text: I have been using TruVia as a sweetner and decided to try XyloSweet since it was so reasonable on Amazon.  Fortunately I do not have the digestive issues some of the other reviews mentioned with any of these products. I found the Xylo Sweet ok, but do still prefer the TruVia. Maybe its just my taste buds, but I would have to use two XyloSweet packets in my beverages to attain the same sweetness I got from one packet of TruVia.  The taste was the same, once I put in two packets.  No after taste with either product.  For now, I will stick with TruVia.

Somehow I'm not feeling the tightness and swelling in my joints as before.  The gluten free diet and this product have got me feeling great. Heck, if it's not the this product, at least I'm not ingesting some processed white sugar, which I know for sure causes my joints to swell.  One problem is that it doesn't sweeten as much.  I notice that I was o.k. with using less than half a teaspoon of sugar and I had to get used to using one pack of this sugar, as it was not as sweet.  Oh well, less calories!

I would say it is slightly less sweet than sugar but I don't use any more of it than I would if it was sugar and I can't even tell the difference anymore.

Great alternative to artificial bad-for-you sweeteners.

review/summary: High protein, alkaline wheat substitute
review/text: Quinoa, pronounced "keen-wah," is touted by many as a "super food." It seems as if it might be a whole grain, but it actually is a seed. It is grown  in the Andes Mountains of South America and is an ancient food highly prized by the Incas.<br /><br />Quinoa is very high in protein compared to grains, making it an excellent choice for vegetarians. It is also on the approved list for those on an alkaline diet as it is considered less acid than grains. Many people with gluten sensitivities substitute quinoa for wheat. When quinoa is rated on the glycemic index, it comes in at a very low 18, making it a great choice for people who are hypoglycemic, diabetic, or on a low-glycemic diet to lose weight.<br /><br />1 cup of cooked quinoa has this nutritional breakdown:<br />222 calories, which is 70% carbs, 15% fat, and 15% protein in this manner:<br />4 grams of (healthy) fat<br />39 grams of carbohydrates (5 grams of which is fiber)<br />8 grams of protein<br /><br />Quinoa contains folate, which is an important B vitamin, magnesium, phosphorous, copper and manganese.<br /><br />Quinoa can be ground into flour (I use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YRJT6">Vita-Mix</a> to do that) and substituted for wheat flour in recipes for baked goods. The whole seed can be cooked just like rice. You use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of quinoa, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer about 15 minutes. When you see ring-shaped sprouts popping out of the quinoa seeds, it is almost finished. Stir it to make sure all the water is absorbed.<br /><br />Quinoa by itself tastes a bit bland, but that's actually an advantage in cooking as it can absorb the flavor of herbs and spices very well. It makes an excellent pilaf and a nice addition to a thick, hearty soup. You can also stir in blueberries or other fruit and eat it as a breakfast porridge.

review/summary: Newbie to quinoa
review/text: I decided to try quinoa after hearing about it from a nutritionist on TV.  I looked it up on Amazon as I couldn't find it in my grocery store.  Thanks to several posters, I ended up purchasing this brand at Costco.  As a newbie I can't compare it to other brands.  Not sure whether I liked it at first, but after a little experimentation, I am now enjoying it.  First try, it seemed a little bitter to me.  Not sure if that's the brand or the nature of quinoa.  Then I read a recommendation from other quinoa users advising a 30 minute soak of the grain before cooking it to minimize any bitter taste.  This did seem to help.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because although I am satisfied with the product and the brand, I'm not sure of how it compares to other brands and also because price is much higher than Costco.

review/summary: GR8 value for an Organic food
review/text: Contrary to some of the reviews here, I find 'Earthly Choice' brand very good tasting and price-wi$e, it beats out the price I pay at either the fruit market or 'cost-club' ($5.49/14 oz.) Organic foods can be expensive. I used to have a Whole Foods store near me, but it closed, so this is the next best value.<br /><br />Here's some clues about quinoa:<br />- Quinoa is surrounded by an outer shell. If you don't wash it, the end result could be a bitter taste, which makes many dislike the taste of quinoa. Another good idea is to, after washing, combine it with another food.<br /><br />- Cooking ratio (for small serving): 2/3 cup quinoa to 1 cup water. Fifteen minutes will do it.<br /><br />- Quinoa is good for the body, providing all 8 amino acids, which no other food can provide. (Amino acids are good for muscle & bone structure. If you work out at the gym, this helps repair muscle you 'tear up'!)<br /><br />- I eat quinoa everyday, at different times, (because I eat 6 small-portioned meals). It is gr8 for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or night-time snack.<br /><br />- Cereal recipe: 2/3 cup organic steel cut 'Irish-type' oats, 2/3 cup washed quinoa, 4 cups organic fat-free milk, 2 tablespoons vanilla extract. First simmer up the milk and vanilla. Add oats and cook for 15 minutes. Add quinoa and cook another 17 minutes, (because it takes 22 min to thoroughly cook oats, I find). Pour into 7 individual serving containers. (I use glass ramekins with plastic lids). Refrigerate and you have a breakfast meal for each day of the week. (For breakfast, I add Ellie Krieger's 'Nutty Topping', recipe found on the Food Network website, 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt, ground flaxseed meal, wheat germ, vegetable yeast, 1/2 scoop whey protein powder.) Good for sports and pre-gym, because steel oats stick with you longer than other breakfast foods - tip from my cycling trainer!<br /><br />- Add quinoa to anything else, soups, salads, rice & bean dishes, even desserts - great in cookies, especially chocolate chip, oatmeal and homemade nature bars.

When a (healthy) friend of our introduced my wife and I to it, I was surprised at both the great taste and how healthy this stuff really is for you!<br /><br />I particularly like Earthly Delights Quinoa for the following reasons:<br /><br />- It's organic<br />- It's whole grain<br />- It tastes excellent<br />- I MUCH prefer having Quinoa (or indeed anything small and plentiful) in a solid bag than I do a box. It's personal preference, but it's the reason I keep using Earthly Delights.<br /><br />With shipping this is still cheaper than my local grocery store, and I will be ordering here in the future!<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I received my package of Quinoa in the mail today.  What a surprise that the shipper ([...]) included 4 peppermint balls (yumm)  what a special touch.  It actually brightened my day.  Thanks.  As for the price I read about, my Costco is about an hour away.  I have started ordering certain hard to find foods via amazon.  After this order, I will make more of an effort to remember on my next Costco trip to pick up a few bags.<br />Still, I am happy with the purchase.

review/text: Nothing off or second rate about this quinoa. I've re-ordered from amazon after using my first full bag. I really haven't been able to beat this price either $4/lb is pretty nice. Local grocers want more for less product.<br /><br />For those who don't know, it cooks like rice, really absorbs the flavors of what is cooked with it, is a complete source of protein, and filling.

review/text: I LOVE this quinoa!  I have tried several brands and this is definitely the best... IMHO.  I have prepared it as a savory side dish using things like French Onion Soup instead of water.  And I have prepared it as a breakfast "cereal" using Dr. Oz's recipe which is slightly sweet.  It is quite versatile and the nutritional benefits are amazing.  Check out [...]  to see all of the nutritional value this little wonder has to offer.  Unfortunately, it is too expensive on Amazon, so... like others... I buy it at Costco.

review/text: I was getting ready to purchase this product and then decided to check out the ratings. I saw that this exact product was stocked by Costco so before I purchased it from Amazon I decidedc to make the trip to our Costco store and sure enough the same product was normally priced at $9.99 for a 4 lb bag so I purchased 2 for a savings of $14.34. This product is as good or the wame as the Eden Organic Quinoa, Whole Grain, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6) which I heard to be the best but I can not tell the difference between the two so my advice to you if your into Quinoa purchase the Earthly Delights from Costco.

I do recommend using chicken broth instead of water and if you toast the grain before you boil it, that will eliminate the smushy texture it sometimes has.

review/summary: PEANUTS AND TREE NUTS!!!
review/text: Just an FYI for those of you who may have overlooked this in the description,  this product IS manufactured on SHARED EQUIPMENT with PEANUTS & TREE NUTS.  I tried another brand in small quantity at the grocery store to see if we liked quinoa and bought this product in a huge bag at Costco.  Mom of a peanut allergy kid and by golly if I didn't read the label until I went to put it in my pantry but it is NOT SAFE for him to eat.  I am NOT saying the product isn't safe in general, just unsafe for nut allergic people like my son.<br /><br />Disappointed because I will not get to try this brand but it was a great bargain.  No I have not tried the product so my rating is neutral but I wanted to make sure those with allergies are aware of shared manufacturing.  I have the same brand's hemp seeds and they are not made with peanuts or tree nuts just the quinoa.  On the hunt for another (peanut free) bulk quinoa source!

review/text: I was really intrigued with the nutritive information I had acquired about Quinoa. A product this nutritive just couldn't taste good, too. BUT once I received the Quinoa, I had to try it out. This Quinoa product rocks! Excellent flavor. I prepared it in a rice cooker. I added the appropriate amount of water, some margarine, a pinch of salt, a couple of TBS white raisins, 1/2 diced apple, a couple of dashes cinnamon, and proceeded to cook it. It cycled just fine in the rice cooker. Now with a little Splenda, and some cream, I had a really nice breakfast/dessert dish. Quinoa has a very slight split pea flavor, and works well in virtually any dish as a rice substitute. My daughter uses Quinoa in her stuffed pepper recipe.

review/summary: Take a stand against unfair pricing
review/text: I was informed by multiple Target employees (I visited 6-7 Target stores in search of these cookies) that they were unable to keep these Limited Edition Oreos in stock because they were bought in bulk by people selling them on Amazon at a huge markup (a 400% markup, to be precise).<br /><br />I realize price gouging is only illegal when it involves natural disasters and life essentials -- neither of which is the case here -- but it is always an unfair practice that makes it impossible for the average shopper to find Limited Edition and/or "soon-to-be-discontinued" items on the shelf, forcing us to pay ridiculous prices online (if we're inclined to be moved to such extremes).<br /><br />It seems this practice is particularly popular with the hottest toys during Christmas time (if the Amazon forums are any indication). The only way to put a stop to this practice? Speak with your dollars; don't give into the temptation; and spend your money on something else.<br /><br />It's for that reason that I have no idea how these Candy Corn Oreos taste. As much as I'd like to try them, no Oreo is worth $15 a box.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: Before these were sold out in our local Target, we've managed to buy two packs of these cookies and they were quickly consumed due to their deliciousness!<br /><br />The cookie part is your standard Vanilla Oreo, of which if you've had them before, they have of course a warm pleasant vanilla taste. The cream, contrary to other reviews I've read, is actually pretty good with it's vibrant half orange, half yellow coloring. The taste is near spot on and sweetly delicious with candy corn flavor. This is verified by me actually eating Candy Corn some time before eating a few of these cookies and then eating some candy corn roughly a bit later (Yes, Candy Corn is the favorite of my family!). The taste of the cream was unmistakeable Candy Corn as advertised! It was surprising to me at first as I just expected them to be a Candy Corn colored variant of the standard Vanilla Oreos. A wonderful surprise indeed!<br /><br />If you have a serious sweet tooth, these cookies are irresistible and you might find yourself constantly munching one. Plant one of these packages amongst a family and these will be gone quick (trust me, I know...).<br /><br />I will say that sugar tolerance varies from person to person, so if you couldn't already tell from all of the bright colors on the packaging, these may be a bit too sugary for some tongues, but for most others, these are definitely a treat to enjoy.... that is if you can get some before they sell out in your local Target or elsewhere!<br /><br />Bravo Nabisco, this was a wonderfully fun idea to put into cookie form. I'm almost sad that they are limited edition though...

review/text: These are the BEST crackers I've ever tasted.  They have crunch, a slightly sweet taste and most importantly: sesame seeds.  I adore them.  And, have been looking for them for years since my favorite gourmet store stopped carrying 'em.  That was a big mistake on their part.  I'm just thrilled to have found them on Amazon.  For those who are watching their wasteline this is a great lil' snack without the guilt.  Try 'em, they're GOOD!!!!!

review/text: I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed.  I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.<br /><br />The next trial was in a risotto.<br />The mushrooms lack flavor in general.  The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking.  I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase.

Once these mushrooms are rehydrated, they are great in soups, casseroles, sauces, etc. They keep a long time--I keep them in a large airtight jar in the pantry. Great to have on hand when fresh is not available or you don't want to make a trip to the store.

review/text: This dressing is one our entire family will eat and agree upon.  Never a complaint!  It has a tartness which we all love.  I have not been able to get it at Whole Foods recently which is a great disappointment.  I now by cases of it online.  It contains no dairy, gluten, or soy.  It is difficult to find a dressing without soy which is important to avoid if you want to keep estrogen levels in check.  It is also vinegar free which may be important to some.

review/summary: An essential ingredient in authentic risotto
review/text: First, I realize that many folks use Spanish saffron in risotto and other dishes that call for this precious ingredient. Many do not know any better, and some actually substitute <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DL53U8">Annato - 2.75 oz. Jar</a> (also known as achiote). You will get a rice dish, but I would not call it risotto.<br /><br />I've used various brands and types of saffron and to me the best come from Iran and Afghanistan. This particular brand is, as another reviewer stated, very high quality and is reasonably priced.<br /><br />There is about a 12 month supply of saffron in this package (assuming normal use), and at the asking price there is no excuse to use cheaper grades of saffron or annato.

review/summary: Cans Popped Open
review/text: I ordered 6 cans of chili.  Two of them popped open, likely due to the pull-back-type tops (no can opener needed) and insufficient packaging that allowed the cans to get banged up.  The mess was all over the rest of my shipment.  It had time to mold and begin giving off a rotten odor.  I had to remove the labels from all the cans because they were covered in this mess, as well as unwrap other items in the shipment.<br /><br />A week later, we decided to eat a seemingly undamaged can of chili and when I started opening it, it EXPLODED.  I cut my finger on the can lid as it popped up and chili went everywhere - even on the ceiling!<br /><br />Basically, I paid this price for three cans of useable chili, not six.  Maybe mail-order chili isn't such a good idea.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because the product itself is good when it's edible.

I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 6pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12/14. Name brands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal.<br />The pop-up cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here.

review/summary: Pretty good for canned stuff
review/text: This chili is pretty good for canned stuff. I ordered this chili almost a month ago and it has been sitting in my pantry until tonight when I finally got the courage up to try it. I am not really sure what I expected. I have vague memories of canned chili from my childhood and it tasted a lot like an old sock in a tin can. I was pretty scared to try this stuff out. But things seem to have improved since the Time of Cave Man and this Chili is not bad.<br />When I first tasted this, it seemed really good, but then I realized that I was really hungry as I had not eaten a real mean, even a canned one, in two days, so I was prepared to adjust that opinion.<br />After, the first few bites where I was in the "starving" mode I began to notice some other qaulities that were not solely based on How Good the Chili tasted. The next thing I noticed was a pronounced Saltiness. I believe you could leave this stuff stored and salt alone would keep its shelf life good for years. That is how it tastes. The can states that it has 45% (or 1080 mg of a total 2000mg) of Sodium/Salt. It also states that it has less than 2% of salt. That may indicate that, by volume, salt is less than 2%. And that is true. But the average person should have no more than 2000 mg of Sodium/Salt a day. So I do not know who did their math, but 1080 is slightly more than half of 2000, so the RDA should be about 54% not 45%. Take it from me, this stuff is salty. I had my crackers out to eat with my Chili and after a couple of crackers, I ate Chili only. No need for crackers. A shame, as Chili is best with crackers. But they are not needed; in fact, it is painful to try to take in more salt than the Chili itself gives you.<br />The next thing I noticed was that the Chili was sort of "gummy." The consistency is not quite right. Chili, right off the stove, has some "soup" to it. This does not. It is closer to the consistency of gumbo or chowder. It is quite thick. I am not used to it, so I felt it was a bit "too full" or "gummy." Others may not be used to that small amount of soupiness. But, which ever side of the fence you eat your chili on, this is not the soupy side.<br />The consistency that I experience as gumminess may be fat. The Chili has 15% of your daily allowance of fat. That is a whole lot of fat for a 15 ounce can. That means 10% of the can is fat. That makes my arteries shudder. The only ingredients are water, beef, beans and crushed tomatoes plus spices. The only thing on that list that has fat is the beef. So, they are not using the best grade of beef in the world. But, then goodness, this is Canned Chili. That must be where the lower quality beef goes! Into my canned chili!! It certainly is not the beef that I put in my own personal chili!!!<br />So, that about sums it up for the Canned Chili. The taste is pretty good but salty. You get more than half the salt you need in one day from this can. Forget the crackers and the chips for today. You also get 15% of all the fat for one day in this can. The percentage for the fat is not so bad as the percentage for the salt, but if you think of 10% of the can being fat, it is not quite so appetizing as it once was. But then again, I point out that this is Canned Chili. The Health Nuts of the world are not out eating it. It is those others of us who won't or don't cook, and who are not really into all that health food suff. That is who eats Canned Chili.<br />So, for Canned Chili, I give it four stars. I knew I wasn't buying the most healthful stuff to start with. Really, I just wanted to have something to eat on the nights when nothing else was available. So, I figure, I really do not care about all that health information. I am just ticked because it is too salty to allow me to crush my crackers up in it. Dang! Chili without crackers!! So, four stars it is. I would give it three and a half and take off for the fat, the salt, and the less than perfect taste, but they won't let me do that. So, go ahead and give this a whirl. I'll eat it every two or three weeks. If you have to eat it more often than that, I recommend Something Else to protect your arteries and kidneys. Perhaps a salad would do the trick. So, eat it, but not too much of it!!!!

review/summary: ALOT better than its larger brethren
review/text: The BIG rice cakes were like styrofoam. Even SLATHERED with peanut butter and jelly, they were a hard act to swallow.<br /><br />These mini-dainties are much better -- load em with PB&J and enjoy them. The caramel adds an exciting twist.
