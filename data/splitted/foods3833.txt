review/summary: Why go to a Theater??
review/text: I had just finished a Theater room in my house and decided the only thing missing was the popcorn! I searched and bought what I thought was the perfect machine and added the gourmet oil and popcorn, turned on the movie and sat back for the movie.  To my surprise, it just wasn't the same, no flavor, not even the smell was the same.  So I searched the web and discovered Great Northern Popcorn in pre-measured portion packs.  It was easy, and the result was just like I had dreamed, fresh great tasting popcorn, with the smell of a movie theater.  I highly recommend Great northern Popcorn for any event and any machine, you won't be disappointed.

Just cut the top off the package and pour into your pot and you get a perfect bowl of movie tasting corn.

review/summary: THE popcorn for movie theater popcorn lovers
review/text: I am one of those people who MUST have popcorn when I go to a movie. Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.<br /><br />When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I searched and read tons of reviews on Amazon and finally decided to order this brand.<br /><br />MY GOD! This IS it! With my first batch, I was blown away by the taste. This tastes exactly like the movie theater popcorn. If not better because you KNOW its fresh.<br /><br />First: The 2.5 ounce packet is enough of a serving for a person. I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you'd get at the theater. I had to share. haha.<br /><br />Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.<br /><br />Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the "solid" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix. All at the same time.<br /><br />It takes about 2-3 minutes before the popping starts but it'll pop up a TON of popcorn. And again, the taste. WOW! This is the popcorn I've been looking for.

review/summary: Delicious, Quality Popcorn
review/text: I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!

review/summary: great tasting movie theater poopcorn
review/text: good price and very easy to use, just heat up your popper for 3-5 minutes then cut the top open and pour it in, a few minutes later....movie theater quality popcorn for .50 cents a pouch.  wish i had a larger popper, but this is a great product if you have a 2.5 oz popper.  it is coconut oil (the same kind that movie theaters use, so you get the same taste, fyi they use it because of the high burn temp, so it does not get that burnt taste when cooking)in case you are wondering, since the description does not state the type of oil included and the salt and popcorn are premixed. will buy more.  very fast delivery.

review/summary: Perfect for a home theatre popper
review/text: I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain.<br /><br />I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time.  I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy.  The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch)<br /><br />My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops.<br /><br />The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper.  There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits.<br /><br />If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these.<br /><br />The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines.  They say just don't use the oil.  Are you kidding me!?!?  It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's "movie theatre" taste.<br /><br />Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb.  Well, using a hot air machine for popcorn is just plain dumb, but that's just my opinion....  ;-)

review/summary: 4 oz. Great American Popcorn Portion Packs
review/text: We purchased a popcorn machine for our media room which called for the 4oz. packs of popcorn. The machine was purchased at Sam's Club where the popcorn packs were not available. Not finding this in town, we went to Amazon where we found exactly what we needed. It works perfectly in our machine. One thing to be aware of: the butter/oil packet comes solid and you squeeze it into the machine. When we first opened the case we thought that the butter/oil was old and had solidified. We needed to look it up on the Great American Popcorn site to assure ourselves that we did not need to send it back. It makes wonderful movie theatre style popcorn.

review/summary: One word....Amazing!
review/text: I used the 4oz size which is just perfect for me and my wife.  My wife loves popcorn and can eat a whole large tub all by herself...but this 4 ozsize packet could easily feed 3-4 people for movie night and completely fills my Stir Crazy popper.  I dont melt the oil like some reviewers said to do since it arrived solid...I just pour all of the popcorn first spread out over my popper and then squeeze out little blobs of the oil here and there over the popcorn.  Worked perfectly and I had maybe 2 unpopped kernels.  The popcorn was very large and fuffy just like you get at the movies.  When the popcorn is done I sprinkle a little of the salt then shake the popcorn around, sprinkle a little more, toss again then put the rest on...turned out perfectly and I am not sure why some people say it tasty overly salty?  Perhaps they are just dumping it all on?  This is fine salt made for popcorn and it sticks to the popcorn very well so I would do what I did and just pour a little on to the top of the popcorn, shake the bowl, put some more, shake again and so on so your popcorn is unformely covered.  The popcorn is spot on like the movie popcorn and I love the taste.  I would stick with the 4oz size and get a Stir Crazy popper...they are great and cook pretty much all of the kernels thanks to the little arm that slowly moves around on the service to keep the kernels spread evenly and to help coat all of the kernels with oil so they pop perfectly.  Oh..and the popcorn is just as light and fluffy the next day...I didn't even cover it.  I would highly recommend trying this popcorn and I will continue to buy this brand only from now on.  I have tried all of the gourmet brands at the local stores and this beats it by far...and the ease of use makes this a winner.  Cut the popcorn and oil pouches and put in your popper...when popcorn is done, cut the salt pouch and sprinkle, toss, sprinkle, toss...enjoy :)

review/summary: Great popcorn at a great price
review/text: As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight -- over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Amazon, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive. Then I discovered Great Northern's Great American popcorn.<br />Not only was the Great American popcorn cheaper in price, but by comparison, the six-ounce package I ordered was larger than the similarly-packaged Whirley Pop at 5.5 ounces. The taste was probably about the same, although psychologically it tasted better to me because of the better value.<br />I probably went a little overboard, but thanks to the special 99-cent shipping at the time, I purchased three 24-count cases.<br />Each of these packages produces a whole lotta popcorn, which if not eaten right away, is still really good a week to 10 days later.<br />Just a great value for middle aged people who could use a little great-tasting ruffage in their systems!<br />Gotta go; feel another batch coming on!!!

review/summary: 8 oz Great american popcorn
review/text: I have a box of this popcorn and a box of Pop Weaver popcorn. No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels, yes there are unpopped kernels. I think there will always be unpopped kernels. The trick to good popcorn is to turn the heat off when the popping slows. That's where the unpopped kernels come from. I suspect you could get less unpopped kernels if you like burnt popcorn. As for the taste, I think the taste is pretty close to the theater popcorn. The only difference to me is no hot butter. If you want to go EXACTLY like a theater, buy one of those hot butter melters like the theater has. Otherwise it is a great tasting popcorn. The 8 ounce packets give you a lot of popcorn. I believe I remember the packets for the 8 ounce machine saying it has 10 ounces of popcorn in each bag. Great American popcorn from this store seemed to have the best price I could fine and (in my opinion) is definately better tasting than other types of popcorn.

I had been concerned about the amount of microwaved popcorn my family was eating and thought this would be somewhat healthier.  We have really enjoyed the Great Northern Popcorn--all we have ever used in our machine.  The pre-packaged all-you-need ingredients are so convenient!  If we ever wear our machine out, I know that "Santa" will bring us another machine from Discount Tommy's and a huge box of Great Northern Popcorn again!

review/text: We've ordered Great Northern Popcorn from Discount Tommy for about a year now. The popcorn is for a machine we keep in our employee lunch room for "Popcorn Fridays".  The portion packs are great because anyone can just snip off the top and pour it into the kettle.  No measuring or mess to clean up afterwards.  And the balance of butter and salt is perfect (other brands can be too salty or too greasy).  We've tried other brands but the employees complained about the taste so we switched back to Great Northern and everyone is happy again. It tastes (and smells) just like the popcorn from your favorite movie theatre.  Yum!!

I do add just 1/2 of the salt while popping and the remaining salt I have placed in a shaker for those that like more.  If you are looking for that "MOVIE" butter flavor this is the one!

review/summary: Great Popcorn - even 2 days later!
review/text: I bought a blue foundation 8oz popcorn machine from Discount Tommy along with a case of this popcorn.  The smell alone - oh my!  Makes my entire basement smell like a movie theater!  The popcorn, after the 2nd time when I actually followed the directions and gave it some time for the bottom heating element to "dry" the popcorn, is fantastic!  I've seem some negative reviews regarding it being mushy - obviously they either do not have an adequate popcorn make that heats well enough to dry it after all the steam/moisture the machine creates popping it in the first place or they did like me my first time through and couldn't wait to eat it immediately!  This popcorn is even good 2 days later if you turn your upper light/bottom heat on for an hour or so first to freshen it up - still tastes like it did the 1st day!  Leave out the "powder" bit and go to food.com and search for "Best Seller Caramel Corn" for a real treat!!!

review/text: This popcorn not only tastes great but pops very well.  There are some unpopped kernels, but I believe that's normal with any brand.  In reading a few of the other reviews, some noted it didn't pop well.  I went through that phase too but found out it was a problem with my popper.  Once that was fixed, the popcorn popped up a storm!  Many friends who have visited my home theater have commented on what good flavor the Great Northern Popcorn has--and it has a great price too.  Highly recommended.

review/text: We bought a 2.5oz popcorn maker for our kids and realized all popcorn is not created equal.  Assuming the ingredients in all pre-packaged popcorn is safe, the most important thing is flavor...and Great Northern Popcorn has it.  It is sooooo good!  I was competing against the popcorn from Ace Hardware.  Before now my kids begged to go to Ace Hardware which they call "the popcorn store."  Now my kids love Great Northern popcorn from home and I'm saving tons of money not buying tools every weekend.<br /><br />Another thing we like about Great Northern Popcorn is they provide 2.5oz packages (most popcorn packs start at 4oz).<br /><br />When friends come over with their kids the popcorn maker runs non-stop.  The kids can't get enough.

review/text: Perhaps I got an old batch, but I found the popcorn to be a bit stale when it popped up. In terms of ease of use, nothing could be simpler. Add the oil, turn the kettle on and when it's smoking add the popcorn and seasoning (and if you're me, when it's done popping put it in a bowl, drizzle with real butter and microplaned parmigianno reggiano- OMG SOOO good). No one else has complained about it tasting stale in my house so I might just be too picky. I'm not sure if we'll buy this brand again, but in the mean time it is working fine for us.

With this popcorn and the theater size candy packs available cheap at the grocery store/Wal-Mart, a case of pop and you are there for pennies on the dollar! Oh, the best part, used a plain old dutch oven on the stove top to pop the corn and it came out perfect. Literally, the BEST popcorn I have ever made, hands down.

review/text: My family and friends LOVE the taste of this popcorn and we don't have any issue with how many kernels are left over. Our issue is with the packaging. We have the 8oz Great Northern Machine, which we LOVE! But putting the oil, salt, and seeds in can be difficult because of the size of the heating element. I've found that if you carefully detatch the oil and pour that in, it gives you more room to put the rest in without getting burned. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm only considering trying the Gold's brand because they too have had great reviews (still on the fence). But I am very pleased and MY friends and family would HIGHLY recommend!!!

Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way, I just squeezed the package and it came right out.  Great product...I will purchase it again if we do another fundraiser.

review/summary: makes it easier - but too much salt
review/text: It makes it easier to use my 8oz popper( Gold Medal 2408) But its too SALTY. The Gold Medal Seasoning Flavacol is much better. I will not get again. I have adjusted by not cutting the salt portion then adding the Gold Medal Seasoning by hand that Works better. also others have talked about old maid. that comes from the Popper design. I also had issues with those Cheaper poppers & 4oz. poppers -That's why we upgraded to the professional Brand, Gold Medal, you will pay a tad bit more, but its worth it because parts can be replaced & fixed easily + it can pop ALL day with out issues + better product (popcorn)

review/text: Awesome butter and salt flavors! It tastes just like the movie theater! Next time I think I will try the 2.5 ounce version. This completely fills up the whirly popper! For 2 people, this is a little much. It stores overnight in a Ziploc bag just fine. An excellent product, that I will purchase again! Also, for those of you looking for the movie theater super buttery popcorn, you may want to purchase some additional buttery topping.

Yes, I took into consideration my normal No Salt lifestyle and leaned to the salt Connoisseur's taste, Yet even still!! Wow!! too much salt!!<br /><br />Hey Great Northern!!

review/text: Delicious Taste & so.......Convenient!  I bought the 6 oz. popcorn packets,  just to "try it"  on my new popcorn machine.  Little did I know I would get hooked on the delicious movie theater taste, with none of the fat issues of other brands!  There are a fair amount of unpopped kernels, but the volume and extraordinary flavor, allows the user to overlook that!  If you are a diehard popcorn lover who goes to the movies for the popcorn, you'll never have to leave home again!

review/text: First off... I LOVE POPCORN -- especially movie theater style popcorn. In fact, I've been known to go to movie theaters without buying a ticket just to buy some popcorn.<br /><br />We just finished our basement and my wife bought me a popcorn machine for Christmas. We tried a couple other "recipes" and couldn't find quite the taste we were looking for. I then saw the reviews for Great Northern and bought a box. The very first batch I popped got me hooked! It's a PERFECT recipe for my movie theater style taste. Whenever I have friends over and pop it for them, they too fall in love!<br /><br />Since my first order, I've set this up on repeat delivery so that I'm never out at home!

review/text: Popcorn has excellent flavor and nearly all kernels pop every time.  It is easy to make.  Just dump everything in the popper and fire it up.  I can see where some might say it's too salty, but if it is for you, just don't dump in all the salt!  It's definitely more expensive than bagged popcorn, but for the ease of making it and the flavor, it's probably worth it.

review/text: The oil is SOLID and hard in the package. Just looking at it made my 50 year old heart slow down.  Plus, we did not hear a choir of angels singing the Halleluja Chorus when we ate it; it was mediocre popcorn with many unpopped kernels. My own fault - I should have known that, like sausage, its better not to know how "movie theater" popcorn is made (hint: yellow food dye is essential). We cannot bring ourselves to eat this again.

review/summary: great taste!
review/text: i just bought this to go along with my great northern popper. unfortionaley for me, the popper arrived before the popcorn, so i was left with a brand new popper and nothing to put in it. i ran to the store nd purchased a bag of poping corn, got home, and faced epic dissapointment. it was gross. nothing like i, or the fiance expected. i clened up my popper and unplugged it, figuring it would just sit in our theater as an ornament from then on. the next day, my package of great northern portion bags arrived. we decided to give it another shot, with these portion bags. made one, and holy smokes. so good. just like the theater! the 4oz bag made enough to fill a 52oz tub, with lots leftover. the corn came out yellow, buttery, and delicious. the only downside for me is the salt. very, very salty. next time, i will use only half of the salt.<br /><br />i also noticied the price difference isnt much for the 8oz portions, it may be more cost effective to purchase them and save the leftover.

review/summary: Tasty popcorn
review/text: I popped my first batch and I have to say this does taste pretty darn close to what you'd find at a movie theatre.  Everything seems to be measured well enough that you don't see any grease stains when using a popcorn bag but you still get that distinct taste and flavor.  The popcorn tasted fresh but there are no expiration dates or lot numbers anywhere on the packaging so I'm not sure how they can trace anything if there's a bad batch. They don't have any ISO 9001 markings so I'm assuming there is no quality oversight of these.<br /><br />I have zero real complaints about the popcorn or the taste, but I don't think they should add some sort of traceability.

review/summary: Yummy popcorn, perfect for a whirley pop!
review/text: I purchased these 8 oz portion packs around a month ago, and at the time the 4 oz portion packs were out of stock. Now I am glad that they weren't in stock at the time, because it seems you get more bang for your buck with the 8 oz packs. They are only about 10 dollars more than the 4 oz packs, but you get twice as much product!<br />As far as taste, the oil and salt gives a spectacular taste to the popped corn. It isn't exactly that movie theater taste, but it is darn close. I mean lets be realistic, copying that theater taste is hard. But nevertheless, the taste is wonderful. I only use about 1/2-3/4 of the flavored salt because I think using all of it makes the popcorn too salty for me. The quality of the kernels is excellent. They pop quite big and aren't too chewy. If anyone has used cheap kernels (like great value), you know it can ruin popcorn.<br />I use the packs for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a>, so I have to divide the contents in half. Half of the pack will fill up the popper easily, and I just keep the other half in a ziploc until I want to make more. I eat popcorn frequently, so it doesn't stay in the ziploc long, a few days at most. I'm not not sure how long they will last opened, but storing them safely should be fine.<br />Overall a great purchase! The starter portion pack that comes with a whirley pop (from Wabash Valley Farms) doesn't hold a candle to this stuff!

review/summary: Best popcorn I've ever had at home!
review/text: I purchased this popcorn for my Nostalgia retro popcorn machine hoping that I would be able to produce movie theatre quality popcorn at home.  The seller describes this as the best popcorn available and I have to agree that it really lives up to the hype!  The popcorn comes out delicious every time-- the perfect balance of butteriness and salt.  I tried using popcorn kernels and all kinds of different oils before I bought this product.  I will never use anything other than this popcorn!  The only problem is that I have eaten 10 of 24 packages-- and I've only had it for two weeks!

review/summary: Salty tip
review/text: The saltiness depends on how you prepare it.  When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.  This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn, the two are not even in the same league.

The first shipment of popcorn came extremely fast, within a day or two and I quickly popped up a batch to try it out.  It was delicious, light and fluffy and very good flavor.  Perfect.  I would highly recommend.  I'll probably buy a subscription for my popcorn loving sister-in-law.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised both with the fast shipment and the yummyness.

review/text: I received a popcorn maker for Christmas. It has a small drum (holding 1/4 cup unpopped corn). I have never used a machine like this and wasn't sure if this popcorn size would be too much for the drum. It was perfect. The flavor is great, very similar to theater popcorn, although I am no popcorn connoisseur like others on this post. I just know what tastes good and this definitely does!

review/summary: Actual theater popcorn -- this is it
review/text: I'm probably one of the most critical when it comes to replicating the movie theater experience at home.  You're looking at a guy whom has a motorized movie screen, projector, sound system, actual 4 head soda fountain and candy display.  So, matching the popcorn was a large task.  Initially I was stuck with buying popcorn and peanut oil.  Ya, it tasted good but no where near movie theater popcorn.  Then, I found Snappy Snappack's and Great Northern.  Greath Nothern was my first purchase.  I challenge you to read all the reviews on here.  I can assure you that those whom say the popcorn is too salty are correct.  The salt comes in a powder form mixed in with the seeds.  If you're careful you can separate the two with some effort.  Personally, I've gotten used to the salt but I can tell you that it is very salty.  The freshness wasn't a factor.  I have no doubt that others have gotten less than fresh popcorn.  Here's a warning:  when your package arrives, BE CAREFUL.  Don't just slice into it to open the box.  The people from amazon literally grab about 20 of the packets and drop them into a box.  I was at a city event where they were giving away free popcorn and snapped a picture of the popcorn they were using.  Snappy SnapPack: [...] This was not overly salted and tasted more like theater popcorn than great northern I think but they're both a toss up... it's super close.<br /><br />If you're unsure how big your kettle is... go by this: the 2.5oz is only good for one person.  The 2.5oz kettles are the ones you see like this:[...]<br /><br />You've seen them at places when you're out and about.  So in retrospect I should have gotten the 4.5oz one.  I have one of those small nostalgia popcorn cards.  2.5oz will fill up a large popcorn bucket about halfway.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this pre-packed popcorn is that it pretty much pops all the seeds.  When I used to pop popcorn from walmart popcorn and peanut oil it'd only pop about 50% of the seeds... the remaining seeds would fly out of the popper.<br /><br />There are some on here that talk about the buttery/oily mixture not looking fresh.  It does come as a semi-solid.  You don't need to kneed it, however.  Simply empty it into the kettle and it will melt on it's own.<br /><br />If you have any questions I'd love to answer them.  Just reply to this message.

review/text: This is truly the best popcorn I have ever tasted. I also bought the bulk bag of recommended popcorn from Amazon and was/am disappointed in it; but THIS is the bomb. Why waste storage space on the coconut oil and popcorn kernels? It is all wrapped up and ready to go in these handy packets, which I use in the Orville Air popper gadget we have had for 12 years or more.

review/summary: Amazing Cinema-quality Popcorn!
review/text: I'm kind of a popcorn fiend (I routinely walk into theaters just to buy popcorn and walk out without bothering to see a movie), but I hate-hate-HATE microwavable popcorn.  My wife bought me the Great Northern Little Bambino tabletop popcorn machine for Christmas, and I ordered the 24-pack of Great Northern popcorn packs because they were compatible with the machine and had consistently good reviews.<br /><br />We decided to take the popcorn machine for a test run during our NYE party, and the popcorn was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had.  It was just the right combination of salty, buttery and fresh, and it was a cinch to make.  Everyone at the party loved the stuff (we went through half the box), and I find myself craving some now as I write this review...<br /><br />In short, I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend this popcorn.

review/summary: Good, but salty
review/text: I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a>.  I get just a few unpopped kernels.  If you put the whole package into the kettle, the popcorn comes out a little salty.  This can be solved by not opening the salt in the package until the corn and oil are placed into kettle.  Then opening the salt on the package and only adding as much as you want.<br /><br />Overall, good popcorn.  I'm not an expert, but it's great for me and my family.

review/text: I can't believe I could get this much great popcorn (along with the oil and seasoning) for such a low cost!  It tastes almost like movie theatre popcorn and doesn't have all the calories!
