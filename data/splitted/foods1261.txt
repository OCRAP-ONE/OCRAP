review/summary: Dog Luvers for sure!
review/text: My dog LUVs these treats!  These are sold @ the all natural pet food store down the street.  In fact the girls that own the store probably wonder what has become of my dog & I.  These are no more expensive on Amazon (less in some cases) than they are @ the store & that includes having them delivered right to your front door.  Great treats, great deal.

Well, this coffee tastes almost exactly like the one I wanted to replace. It is also more expensive than the brand I was using. It tastes like Folgers, lots of chemicals in the processing or something.<br /><br />I won't be buying any more of this and have subsequently discovered another brand which makes amazing packet coffee.

I use 2 cups mix and 11 oz. of water to make four Belgian waffles. The mix makes light full and crispy waffles. The taste is excellent. I do add some cinnamon to the batter for a bit more flavor. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Pancake Sunday
review/text: If you want the Grandkids to "for sure" accept your Sunday morning invitation for waffles or pancakes then Heartland's waffle and pancake mix is a guaranteed recipe for success.  We have only to ask the little ones once.  They even respond to last minute invitations if they know Heartland waffles or pancakes are on the menu.  And with three hungry Grandkids you cannot take a lot of time to prepare the meal.  Again Heartland saves the day for Grandpa (the pancake guy).  The mixing is easy, simple and quick.  You just cannot mess it up.  The ordering of the mix is Grandma's responsibility.  She says the on-line ordering is easy, simple and quick.  You will notice that she says the same thing about ordering that Grandpa says about the mix.  Last minute orders are filled in a couple of days and credit card payment is a snap.  Woo-Hoo Heartland!

review/text: I bought this mix after reading all the great reviews, and it didn't disappoint. It tastes more bland then sweet. So I add chocolate morsels, raisins, blueberries, and even dry honey. All taste great. To make smaller batches, the formula is 3 parts mix to 2 parts water and let it sit for 2- 3 minutes.  Experimenting a little I was able to just increase mix for bread density and decrease for super light/crispy variation. It was fun to experiment!

It works well with the Presto Flip waffle maker. My family now enjoys these waffles almost every morning. Your family will love them as well! I will never buy another waffle mix!

review/summary: Hartland Waffles
review/text: I have not yet been able to produce a waffle we can eat using this mix.  The dough sticks to the waffle iron and then separates.  I called Heartland and was told that their waffle conditioner (which is called for in the directions) is for their commercial customers. I have been unable to locate a waffle "conditioner" locally - or anywhere else. The bag does warn that nonstick sprays will cause the waffles to stick - THEY DO!!!!  Also the pack of 6 makes way more waffles than a family of two needs.  Heartland said the shelf life is 6 months - a year if frozen.  We liked the waffles so much when we had them for breakfast in a hotel while we were travelling that we wanted to enjoy them at home.  We inquired and were told how to get the mix.  Serve was quick, Heartland was pleasant to deal with.  Anyone have a suggestion or experience with this mix? Guess I'm back to "scratch" waffles.

review/text: First of all I did not expect the entire bag to be used at one time. I did not see any other directions that may give an idea of how to use in smaller quanities than an entire 2 lb bag. If that were not annoying enough I found the mix to lack taste. Granted you only had to add water but I would buy another mix that may require adding additional ingredients to make it taste better. Disappointing product that I would not try again.

review/text: I purchased this for our commercial waffler, but the waffles end up on the chewy side.  However, the mix does make very good pancakes, so we use it for that instead.  The aroma is not quite as "catching" as the Carbon brand, but it is definitely better than the Gold Medal brand, and has a nice taste.  Only drawback, as I said, is the waffles tend to be on the chewy side.

review/text: This mix seems useless. Following the instructions (but with 50% less water), the waffles turn out completely tasteless. One would probably need to add sugar, a couple of eggs, maybe some butter, to make a decent waffle (not something without any taste), and this product is sold to be used as is, only adding water. So if you want a ready-to-throw in the waffle iron mix, don't buy this one.

review/text: In an emergency food situation, I would eat these straight from the jar.  But they aren't as flavorful that way as rehydrated.  I especially enjoy them rehydrated in corn soups and in corn muffins.  They have an intensity of flavor that is deeper even than fresh.  I will never buy canned corn again to use in a pinch.  These have it beat by a landslide.  When using in corn muffins, I start them well ahead of making the muffins.  They take a while to rehydrate.  Then just stir them into your favorite corn muffin recipe.  For soups and stews they can be rehydrated in the cooking liquid as it simmers.

review/summary: Tasty, handy and satisfying
review/text: When it comes to snacking, the crunch dried snacks are the best. Each fruit has a distinctive texture and flavor. The individual pieces are flavorful so you can nibble one tiny piece of apple and actually taste apple. There is no fat so you don't have greasy fingers.  You can take the packages anywhere.  Dried apples taste like apples.  Dried peaches taste like peaches. Dried apricots taste like apricots. In some of the dried fruit mixes, the general taste is "blend." With Sensible Foods crunch dried snacks, you can savor the morsels slowly, one individual flavor and one individual texture at a time or eat them fast, mingling textures and tastes depending.<br /><br />I keep packages on hand to satisfy midnight snack urges,  to crunch instead of chips when I eat a sandwich, to snack while I watch the tube or to grab and go.  The only reason I did not give this a five star rating is because I've eaten over 100 packages of the Orchard Blend and in two of the packages, there was a brief whiff of mold.  While that may not seem like a lot, I've got mold allergies.  I've never had any reaction to the contents of an Orchard Blend package.  If there was a bit of mold, I would react so something probably got on the outside of the package in storage  but...  Orchard Blend is frankly delicious.  I buy regularly to always have some on hand.  It is much tastier, more interesting to the palate, and cleaner eating than nibbling on rice cakes, popcorn or chips. The product satisfies hunger, too, which makes it a close to perfect food in my world.

review/summary: Sulfa free dried fruit is fantastic!
review/text: As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy, I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits, which are tasty, but not aesthetically appealing. I'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room.<br /><br />I'd found a number of other freeze-dried fruits, but most of them had sugar added, something I try to avoid. I ordered this product (Orchard blend) with the hope that it would be flavorful. Wow, was it!<br /><br />Aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop, it's also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more.<br /><br />I'm extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy.

review/text: I love fruit but have never been a big dried fruit person because most are chewy and have odd flavors but these crunch dried fruit packs are yummy.  The Orchard blend is my favorite.  I wish they were a little less expensive so I could have them more often but with the subscribe and save feature they are slightly more affordable if you buy in bulk.  Love that they are made in California too.

review/summary: Great Snack
review/text: This is my favorite flavor of the Sensible Foods Fruit snacks. They are gluten free which is necessary for me with Celiac Disease. I love this flavor and like to sprinkle them on yogurt for breakfast in the morning when berries are out of season and so expensive. I wish the pieces were bigger to make it easier to just eat by themselves as a snack. My daughter is diabetic and also loves this line of snacks.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I'm celiac and am always on the lookout for a crunchy snack that won't make me sick and is healthy at the same time.  It's pretty hard to find.  I found a bag of the Sensible Foods Orchard Blend in a Tully's coffee shop and loved it!  I couldn't find it in stores around my neighborhood so I ordered a case, at a really good price, off of Amazon.com.  I love the stuff!  It's so nice to find a gluten-free snack that actually tastes good, is really crunchy, and I don't feel like I'm giving something up just because it's gluten free.  I usually take a bag every day to snack at work.  It's nothing but fruit with no added anything and only 70 calories.  And, it's really tasty.  I took a bag over to my friend's house and now my 16- month old godson loves the stuff.  I can't wait to try the other flavors.  The case was shipped quickly.  Had some problems with the post office losing the package, but that wasn't the fault of the seller.  They were great and I'm so happy to have found a new snack!  The packages are easy to stow in my purse or bag and I  usually have one to whip out when I'm hungry.  I've never had such a crunch from dried fruit before.  I would totally recommend this product.

review/text: Excellent taste and texture.  The apples are the crunchiest, but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture.  If you really like your crunch, I'd go for the all-apple product.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that you're not getting a lot for your money.  I love the convenient portion-control packaging, but $1.10 for a 3/4 ounce, 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon.<br /><br />So I'll order more, but these have become an "occasional" snack and not an "everyday" one.

review/text: I have not yet received my order but have eaten these delicious treats.  So, I am sure that they will be enjoyable.  However, the shipping fee of $11.99 for this small order is outrageous and I know that Amazon has negotiated very good rates with their selected courier carrier and I cannot believe that the shipping and handling fee is as high as the cost that is being passed on to your customers.  This fee seems to be a new source of revenue for on-line companies...I wanted four boxes of these sweets and chose not to purchase this number since the S & H fee was even more expensive.

review/summary: good cereal but has box design flaws
review/text: I keep buying this cereal, and then wondering if I should buy it again, only because I absolutely HATE the design of the box.  If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy.

review/summary: Love Earths Best
review/text: I really love Earths Best, and have used only EB to feed my little one.  This cereal is great, except I would switch back to plain flavor after this box is done.  The banana flavor had a weird smell to it when mixed with the formula (similac alimentum), and also if you're giving it in every bottle, then it can constipate your baby.  So as for EB regular cereal we LOVE it, but the banana flavor not so much.

What could be better, safer and healthier? I wouldn't want the cerial my baby eats to see packaged in something else (and get into contact with that "something else"). Maybe it's not as convenient (as the previous reviewer mentioned,though the question of conveniency is arguable) but piece of mind and health of my baby surely makes it worth to deal with the packaging!

review/text: My son really likes this cereal. I found it at our local healthfood store and the price here on Amazon does tend to fluctuate. It shouldn't be much more than a normal box of Earth's Best Cereal. I find I don't use this particular variety as much since we usually mix in cereal with his meals and not all of them go well with the banana flavor. He eats this without anything mixed in, however and seems to really like it.

I typically spice it up with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg or other tasty flavors, stir in some applesauce or other mashed fruit, a spoonful of yogurt or tahini, or various other things to keep it interesting. I have also used it as filler for meatloaf and meatballs. It's loaded with vitamins and is probably the most economic organic cereal on the market.

review/summary: great basic oat flakes!
review/text: I have been looking for a suitable substitute for Fortified Oat Flakes produced the the famous P--- cereal company for like 20 or 25 years!  I LOVED those darned Oat Flakes!  Well, I have found it!  After trying dozens of Oat Flake cereals, generic, organic, store brands, etc...do you know how hard it is to find an oat flake cereal that does not have honey, nuts, dried fruit, or other stuff in it?<br /><br />This cereal by Arrowhead Mills has the right flavor, and the right crunch!  The only drawback, is that they get soggy pretty fast.  I tend to put a thin layer in the bowl with a bit of milk, and eat fast.  But, the flavor, the real flavor is soooo worth it!<br /><br />Thank you Arrowhead Mills for giving me back a happy piece of my childhood!

review/summary: Best Oat Bran Flakes
review/text: These are the best Oat Bran Flakes available and I have tried other brands.  (Finding Oat Bran Flakes can be difficult)  When comparing the Nutritional Facts they are at the top of my list - Only three grams of sugar.  What's amazing to me and my Doctor - my LDL cholesterol dropped 29 points in only 5 weeks (1/11/2011 was 107 to 2/17/2011 now 78) - eating 1 cup of cereal with fresh fruit every morning.  Ordering the Arrowhead Mills Organic Oat Bran Flakes via Amazon is the way to go - I save near a $1 a box compared to local stores (San Diego Area).  I cannot recommend this product enough, especially if you want to naturally lower your cholesterol.  Thanks Arrowhead Mills.

review/text: I concur with the other reviewers on the flavor and value, but they do get soggy fast.  An alternate way to eat them would be with a creamy style yogurt instead of milk.<br /><br />  For a high fiber cereal they are surprisingly tasty and lack the<br />common sawdusty ot cardboardy characteristics of lesser brands.<br /><br />  Also, they get crumbly if the shipment is rough.  I ended up with a case that has a fair amount of crumbs in the bottom of each box.

review/summary: Dr. Johnson Got It Right ...
review/text: ... in his famous Dictionary of 1755, when he defined "oats" as a grain eaten in England by horses and in Scotland by people. Well, I guess I'm not Scottish. I've never regarded hot oatmeal as more than a cruel necessity of back-packing, and I've hated cold bran flakes -- honestly, all cold cereals -- since I was a child accustomed to Swedish cheese-and-herring breakfasts. But I'm adaptable. When I lived in Japan, I learned to 'relish' cold rice, raw egg, and dried seaweed for breakfast. It was easier in Spain, where hot chocolate and churros for dunking, in my neighborhood cafeter&iacute;a, seemed quite an elegant solution to the problem of mornings. Best of all was Italy: a huge bowl of caffe latte and a couple of croissants! But wait! Mexico was breakfast heaven: huevos rancheros, fried eggs on black beans and tortillas with melted cheese and hot sauce!<br /><br />Yes, I've had to confront the curse of mornings in a lot of environments, but now I'm living in the strangest realm of all: mortality, to which I hold the civic rights of senior citizenship. And I'm striving to be responsible, eating closer to my small share of the world's nutritional resources. Oat bran is reputed to reduce cholesterol - mine is unexpectedly high now - and to support a healthy colon. Well, a healthy colon is nothing to scoff at, in every way superior to a colon burdened with diverticula as labyrinthine as the intellectual diverticula of life in the USA.<br /><br />These Arrowhead Mills Oat Bran Flakes are 100% unsugared, unflavored, unadulterated horse food. I like that in a cereal to be eaten for duty rather than pleasure. Mixed with blueberries or raspberries, they're acceptably neutral, like the gesso on a painter's canvas before the pigments are applied. But you have to eat them quickly! Don't even try to read the sports page until you've gobbled them down! If they get soggy in the milk, they become as repulsive as canned spinach or truck-stop mashed potatoes.<br /><br />Are they effective for reducing cholesterol? I can't say. I bought my 'Pack of 4' and consumed my daily portion until the last box was empty, but that was probably not a long enough test trial to certify or decertify the product. On the other hand, I can testify to their utility for weight loss; I had no temptation to gobble a second bowlful.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I love these oat bran flakes! They're whole grain, relatively low on sodium, certainly much lower than other oat cereals such as toasted oats/cheerios. Sugar content is also low, and fiber content (from oat bran) is high. I've been eating them for a few years now, and I don't get tired of their taste. The only thing is, they get soggy pretty fast so you'll want to eat them pretty quickly after you pour on the milk. Also, you'll usually find quite a bit of "cereal dust" in the bottom of the box, since the flakes are relatively delicate. But to me these are minor drawbacks. The price on Amazon is right: delivered to my door and the price is cheaper than at the local store.

review/summary: Tastes good, but # of servings less than stated
review/text: I enjoyed the cereal.  I thought it tasted good.  But I am on a diet where I measure my cereal portions.  The label states there are "about 10" 1-cup servings of the cereal in a 12-oz. box.  I got 7 servings, and one was less than a cup.  I don't know about you, but "7" is not "about 10" to me!  With food getting more and more expensive these days, we don't need false information on labels too.  Although I liked this cereal, I won't be purchasing it again.<br /><br />Update 3/26/12 - The company sent me a letter thanking me for "reporting the issue" and advising that "quality is very important to [them."  They also sent some coupons - one for a free product, and two .55 cents off coupons.  So I have to give them credit for responding and for making an effort at good customer service.  I noticed that although they said "quality" was important to them, they still didn't say anything about quantity.  I'll give them another try and see if I get closer to 10 portions of cereal next time.  Also, I've bumped them up from one star to four stars for making an effort.

review/summary: Arrowhead Mills Oat Bran Cold Cereal
review/text: This is my staple cereal because of it's very limited ingredients.  Having lots of food allergies, buying any old cereal off the grocery shelf is impossible so fortunately for me, Arrowhead Mills produces a cold cereal I can eat.  Please don't discontinue this cereal!!!!!<br />I have poured hot liquid over it, and it almost instantly turns into oatmeal (sort of baby food consistency)which I found enjoyable.  My favorite fruit is blueberries so they add a nice flavor and texture to the relatively plain flavor  of oat.<br />I've also made lightly sweetened baked desert with mixtures of cereal, nuts, raisins, xylitol, etc.  Excellent cereal.<br />One thing I did notice was that the servings that the box lists at about 10 is really about 8 using the cup measurement the say is a serving.  Curiosity brought me to test two boxes. I measured using a dry measuring cup.  No shaking down to even out, poured out the entire box into a large bowl, and stirred it to fluff it up.  Then measured using a large spoon to scoop into the measuring cup, keeping it a level measure.<br />Seems to me the company is either mislabeling or misleading.  I'm not sure.  But, I do love the cereal.

review/text: I had been looking for a cereal remotely close to the Post Fortified Oat Flakes I enjoyed (two boxes per week) as a kid.  I saw someone else here recommend this product so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />They were right, it is as close to the original as I've come across.  Post flakes were slightly sweeter, but adding your favorite sweetener and blending it in works virtually just as well.  The consistency and *desired* quick sogginess were right on - and I mean that as a compliment.  The oat taste was also very close - not that classic cardboard taste you often find in organic brands.<br /><br />All in all, if you were looking for a Post eat-a-like, this product is pretty dang close!

review/summary: NATURAL - NEW YORK BUGS AND ALL!
review/text: Sad to report, upon the first bowl of this flavorless "organic" cereal, we witnessed what my mother used to call mealy bugs? Up close they look more like tiny cockroaches.<br />And unfortunately, before one of the little buggers came swimming up out of the milk, I got to give the cereal a taste test. It was perhaps the worst example of food I could imagine. I instantly wondered if this is what Soylent Green will taste like when our Prez is done fixing everything and every one?<br />It's BAD STUFF ALL AROUND and I noticed some saying it was like Fortified Oat Flakes from the 70's? They must have very bad recollections of that wonderful cereal.<br />I also noticed they are warehoused and shipped out of New York, which is another reason I would never buy them again - to make sure my money never supports anything from that state who recently attacked Christianity in the worst possible way.<br />Well, we'll see how the return process goes via Amazon.<br />FYI - the boxes of cereal were dated for expiration Dec 2011 less then half a year away. This is not really contrary to norms on popular selling cereals where the death date is almost always a year or more off, rather, it's because, they don't sell as quick so they have time for these bugs to manifest, and because, if it truly is organic cereal, it is something that will naturally occur more than in the boxes of UN-natural sugar chunks we feed ourselves.<br />So, even though it should NOT be so, it is something that will happen with ANY cereal, flour etc. if given enough time.<br />The only way around it would be shorter (smaller) factory runs tuned to the number of sales which is not done anymore because of inefficiency, shortages of product on the shelf, hence,(loss of of sales) and so, you'd have to know when they're going to make the next run and somehow get your hands on them right away, then you can freeze them to keep the bugs from maturing.

review/summary: Truly Delicious Mac & Cheese
review/text: Annie's Creamy Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is made with all vegetarian ingredients and even organic pasta. The sauce is made from cheddar cheese, cream, whey, dry milk, natural flavors and annatto for color.<br /><br />The 12-ounce box is enough for two to six people depending on how hungry you are at the time. We serve this as a side dish with many meals and normally can get about four to six servings from one box.<br /><br />When making the pasta, use a large stockpot filled halfway with water because if you even use a medium to large saucepan, it might boil over. The instructions say to use a medium saucepan, but I can't recommend that personally as it always boils over. Once you have the pasta cooked, all you do is add the packet of creamy delish cheese sauce.<br /><br />This is probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with information on where to get a "Be Green" bumper sticker. I also like the cute "Rabbit of Approval" sticker on the Annie's Homegrown products. They are all delicious and you feel good eating such a healthy product.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great taste, but like the others too much sodium!
review/text: Annie's Deluxe macaroni and cheese comes with a pouch of cheese sauce, which tastes better than any dry powder variety and it is quicker to mix.  Regardless of how thoroughly I mix the cheese powder, milk and butter, the dry powder varieties do not taste as good as Annie's Deluxe.  Our 3 year old really enjoys Annie's Deluxe and I feel better offering her this rather than Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Even if the taste wasn't as good as Kraft, I would choose Annie's since the ingredients are natural and some are organic.  Kraft uses artificial color in their dry powder macaroni and cheese, though I don't think they do in their deluxe version.  Kids (and adults) don't need artificial colors!<br /><br />I would give Annie's Deluxe a 5 if they would reduce the sodium content and make a Deluxe version that included whole wheat pasta  and was ALL organic (currently only some of the dry powder versions are all organic).  And while I am creating my dream version, I would give Annie's a 10 if they would enrich it with some calcium and other vitamins and make a whole wheat bunny shape version! :)  My big hangup is that the sodium is too high (like all the other brands).  It would still taste great with a lot less salt (if kids are not given high sodium in the first place, their taste buds don't crave it).  Unless pasta is whole wheat (or other whole grain), there isn't much nutrition in it, so whole wheat pasta that is enriched is the way to go!  Annie's  offers many varieties that include some of the improvements I am  looking for, but it would be great if they would include them all in one version.<br /><br />Boxed macaroni and cheese is truly junk food no matter who the manufacturer, but Annie's is doing great things to make it better.  Knowing that macaroni and cheese is often "kid food"  is reason enough to improve it nutritionally.<br /><br />The price is reasonable on Amazon and at WalMart, however most of the grocery chains and Wholefoods charge too much!  The best price I found was at Annie's home website when they offered 25% off and free shipping.

Get the Deluxe 4 cheese instead, it's much better.

review/summary: As good as it gets from a box
review/text: I grew up a Kraft boy, and you wouldn't find me with off-brand boxes of macaroni and cheese.  No, sir.  Just the authentic and best for me.<br /><br />When I got older, I realized (thanks to Mark Bittman's superb cookbook, How to Cook Everything -- if you happen to be in the vicinity of a bookstore, pick it up) that boxed stuff is horrid, compared to making actual pasta with actual cheese.<br /><br />But, well, sometimes I just want something out of a box.  (And our seven-year-old ALWAYS does, for he has the insane and tasteless taste buds of a child.)  In those cases, I always went back to Kraft, until we started shopping at Whole Foods and bought a pack of Annie's to try out -- very skeptically in my case, as I'd had a lot of off-brand stuff that failed to live up to the Kraft ideal.  Even so-called "premium" and "deluxe" stuff like the Velveeta Shells and Cheese was just totally weird and off-putting.<br /><br />But, heresy of heresies, it turns out that the Annie's stuff is actually BETTER than Kraft.  Both the regular box with the powder, and this stuff with the cheese-gel, taste better than Kraft, through some feat of food science alchemy.  Try 'em out.  Personally, I give the nod to the Deluxe over the regular, just because it's twice as easy to make (no mixing milk, butter, and powder -- just rip the pouch and mix with the noodles), and "easy to make" is pretty much the whole point of boxed food; but it is a lot more expensive, so if you're price-conscious and willing to put forth a bit of effort, get the regular Annie's.<br /><br />(Or, better yet, get that Bittman book, and learn to make pasta with sage and parmesan for the same price and just about as much work...)

If you're so inclined to have it just how you would make it, go ahead and make your own.  It's just mac-n-cheese after all.
