review/text: I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it. It had a mild but bold enough flavor for me that I could drink it in the am and have an afternoon cup  when feeling sluggish. No bitterness to it and the smell in the house when it was brewing was as if you were in a Caribou coffee estanlishment.I normally lean towards a more italian or french blend but I really like this. So a great medium roast if that is what you like.

review/summary: First coffee I drink without sugar and milk
review/text: I started drinking coffee at the age of 2 when my grandpa would sneak me some in my cup. Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

I keep trying to get him to drink the bold stock and he only says: "Do we have any more of that Caribou?". Well, looks like I'll be ordering much more of his new favorite coffee soon!

They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!

review/summary: Kinda Pricy but good!
review/text: If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.

review/text: I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth.

review/text: I was looking for a way to help clean my cat's teeth so at first I tried the feline greenies,but he wouldn't have anything to do with those. I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door.

review/text: My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.  My dog is a chewer so it works out great.  She is addicted!

review/summary: Teenie Greenies
review/text: My little dogs really like these "teenie" Greenies dental chewies. Not only are they good for the dogs' teeth, the dogs consider them a treat! I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are "petites" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!

review/summary: Expensive treats but my dogs LOVE them!
review/text: I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say "Time for your Greenies!" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive.

review/summary: My dog LOVES these
review/text: Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies.  I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else.

review/text: Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.  Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog.  This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but I don't think they love dogs
review/text: I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from "green." It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product.

review/text: I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times  before thru Amazon.  This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.  The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it!  After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat.  Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day!  I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.<br />I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled!

review/summary: very dangerous product for dogs
review/text: i bought this for my dog - he loved it.  however, i noticed that he stopped pooping and came to realize (after googling) that it caused him to be constipated.  His stomach was very bloated and I could feel that his colon was obstructed by something -- a piece of undigested greenies treat.  I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!  This product is really dangerous and I would love to join in on a class action lawsuit against this unethical company.  They have made greenies 'tasty' but that is all it is.  a tasty but dangerous product.

review/text: I buy the teenie greenies and break them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a "lite" version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing, but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do.

review/text: Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!

review/text: In September, I adopted 2 adult border terrier mixes from The Shelter Pet project and the oldest girl had a few "breath" issues.  Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar. Amazon has much better pricing then the pet centers, so I love it.  Try them for your pet, they will love it.

Maybe it was the heat or maybe something happened during packaging.  Either case, I have to pull off 1 at a time when it comes to snack time.

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.

review/summary: Why do they increase the price each month on the product?
review/text: I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases.  If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94.  Why the increase?  Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.<br /><br />The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible.

review/summary: A noticeable difference in dental health
review/text: I've only given Greenies four stars because they're pretty costly at one Greenie per day (and we have two dogs).  That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon.

review/summary: My vet suggested this.
review/text: My two dogs love these.  Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag.

review/summary: freshens breath
review/text: I have a (now) 6 month old miniature daschund puppy. I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!

review/text: We have been feeding these to our do since he became an adult dog.  We feed him the Jumbo size Greenies. He's 125+ pounds and devours them in seconds.  We order them from Amazon, because we can rarely find the Jumbo size greenie canisters in stores.  Our dog's teeth seem to be in really good condition.  We have never had any problems with him eating them or with his digestion.  We always give him one when we are around to watch and he's never had any issues.

review/summary: Like going to the dentist
review/text: I bought these for my 9 yr old dog because the vet said she had stage 4 dental disease, and we really couldn't afford the $300+ price of teeth cleaning for her. I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the pet store.

review/text: My dog loves these snacks.  I have a smaller rat terrier mix dog she loves these even more than Cherrio's.  They come in a canister which is flimsy but I threw it away as they are also in a resealable bag. They should last a fairly long time as I don't give them to her daily, only for special treats and after she takes any medicines.
