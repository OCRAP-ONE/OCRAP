review/summary: Cola... I think not...
review/text: I bought these cause they were cheap and had lots of good reviews.<br /><br />However, these dont taste like cola... at all.  They taste like some weird combination of ginger root and oranges.  Needless to say, coke is not made out of ginger root and orange peels, so I am disappointed.<br /><br />These are a must buy... if you like the combination of ginger and orange.<br /><br />On a positive note... they were very gummy, almost annoyingly so, but just like the regular bears are.

Yeah, a cheap supermarket brand that's been left open on a window sill, in the sun, for two weeks.<br />The Gold Bears are super to leave on a positive note.

review/summary: So small...couldn't hurt to eat just a few...so very small...
review/text: So here's how it went down.<br /><br />My teenage sons crowd around with innocent curiosity as I take the mammoth 5-pound bag out of the cardboard box, the box with the beguiling Amazon smile on the side. That knowing, wicked Cheshire grin. Within seconds the bag is neatly cut open. An oddly hypnotic aroma wafts out.<br /><br />It begins.<br /><br />We all sample one or two of the pleasantly rubbery candies, but find ourselves exchanging the same puzzled expression: that flavor---not really cola...vaguely medicinal, yet not offensive. Hmm. Further testing is required.<br /><br />We all sit down. Sampling continues now in earnest---they're so small! Where's the harm?---and we agree that you need to eat quite a few to identify the flavor with any accuracy. Not a name brand cola, to be sure...one of those "store brands," after it's gone flat. We notice that after the first 50 or so, the flavor seems to change somewhat, perhaps because all our teeth are now caked with adherent masses of gummy residue. Our mood is high, so testing continues.<br /><br />General consensus is reached after the first pound or two that the bottles in the middle of the mass are softer and more fragrant than the stuff from the top of the bag. The bag is passed around, sniffing ensues. Great effort is expended seeing how far a bottle can be stretched, while held between the front teeth, until it breaks.<br /><br />The unmistakable signs of hyperglycemia ---exhilaration, rapid speech, a cola-like aroma on the breath---go somewhat unnoticed as we burrow deeper into the jiggly wad of gummies. Dinner is postponed along with homework. A telephone call from my ex-wife goes unanswered. The scientific process cannot be interrupted. Would Fermi have taken time out from inventing the x-ray deathgun to take a call from his ex-wife? Please.<br /><br />The fun almost stops when a bottle goes up a nostril ---kids!--- but everything is soon back on track when we discover that moistened bottles can be stuck to the forehead for minutes at a time. Soon my sons' faces bristle with the things. A joke is made about "edible lesions". Hilarity ensues. Photos are taken. Outside it grows dark while leaves blow about, unraked. The scratching of a pet at the door stopped some time ago.<br /><br />Bottles are eaten ten at a time now. Cola-stained spittle dribbles down a chin. No time to wipe. Got to keep chewing. They are SO VERY SMALL.<br /><br />Suddenly the bag is empty.<br /><br />Empty. The room goes quiet.  The box is re-examined, but no stray gummies are found. The box with the grin. That damn, mocking grin. I have to explain to the children why I only ordered one 5-pound bag. We all feel somewhat sick. We are all trembling now.<br /><br />Parents, sometimes single dads cannot be trusted to make good judgments about their kids' eating habits. Living with the stress of alimony can pervert that part of the mind which regulates dietary choices, or common sense.<br /><br />I hope this will serve as a valuable object lesson for you all.

review/summary: Haribo Gummi Happy Cola Bottles Burst with Flavor!
review/text: First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true! If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know, and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Super Cola Bottles, are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in a delicious cola flavor and they are huge pieces of candy!  These are not small like the bears, at all. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a "chocolate-type candy" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh,delicious and full of flavor.  To keep<br />them this way, I put them into two different "freezer type bags" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact cola bottles that you get there, without the worry that everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi super cola bottles, they are a sweet<br />and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more super cola bottles, plus a few different kinds of other gummis as well.  Simply because, we all have our favorites!

review/summary: Love Haribo - brings back my childhood USAF base in Germany
review/text: You know after reading the other review I was shocked to say the least of their disatisfaction.  As a child my father was in the Air Force and we lived on base in Germany and we would visit the "Gummi Store" as I called it - my sisters and brother giggle at me as I was 5 years old and trecking to get to the gummi store was through a forest as I believed to get our Haribo candy - that forest as I know now, is a park.  The store was real and so was the candy and to this day - every holiday we always gift the family and friends with Haribo.<br /><br />I gave up soda long ago but love the taste of the Happy Cola - you have to watch as Haribo sells two different kinds - Happy Cola are the little ones and the one you really want. The other ones "Coke Bottles" think they are called are HUGE and who wants to eat something that big - Happy Cola is about the size of your pinky (finger).<br /><br />Above and beyond the Happy Cola is the Haribo Gold Bears and they are by far my favorite and coming in second the Happy Cola.<br /><br />Try it yourself and you will love it - get a small bag if you want to try it out first instead of getting the 5 pound bag - Rite Aid sells the small bag for a little more than a dollar I think - I do not tend to look at the price but the quality of the product.  We have never had a problem due to freshness etc.  I do not work for Haribo nor am I affiliated with any retail environment but a stay at home Mom who knows her german candy.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Country of Origin Changes Depending On Supplier
review/text: I am a long time Haribo fan. I was first introduced to Haribo gummies when I moved to Germany in 1979. The Happy-Cola gummies are my all time favorite, so I have really enjoyed ordering them in the 5-pound bags over the past year.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor of the gummies varies depending on where they are made.  When I first started ordering them on Amazon's Subscribe & Save, the Haribo Happy-Cola gummies were made in Spain and they had the flavor and texture of the original Harbio gummies available in Germany (5 stars). However, the bag I received in my most recent shipment shows that they were made in Turkey.....and the flavor and texture are both lacking (2 stars), likely due to the quality of ingredients used.<br /><br />So it saddens me to cancel my future Subscribe and Save orders of the Haribo Happy-Cola gummies. I wish there was a way to know the country of origin but it varies depending from which supplier Amazon is sourcing the product. :(

review/summary: Not a big candy person
review/text: Even with the title, I love these!  They are very hard to find where I live, well that's not entirely true.  The candy store at the mall 2 blocks from me has them, but they are EXPENSIVE, I believe $7.50 a pound!  Mind you, they are the exact same brand as these ones, I suck at math (blame the California public school system...)  but these are a outstanding deal, even with shipping it's much cheaper.<br /><br />Do I need a 5lb bag? probably not, could I eat a 5 pound bag by myself? Most definitely, not in 1 sitting, or even 1 day, but I'll manage :)<br /><br />These are not too sweet, and they have a strangely addicting Coke like taste, and the clear top parts, almost remind me of a 7-up'ish flavor.  These are really delicious, I might have to order a bag every month so I can eat a big handful every day, wonder how long they'll stay fresh when properly stored :)

review/summary: Haribo Cola Bottles
review/text: My parents were in the US military and we were stationed in (formerly West) Germany. I spent many years of my early and happy childhood there. Upon returing to the US in the 1970s, one of the many things I missed about Germany was the fantastic German candies. I was able to find the Haribo Bears in the mid-1980s and the Cola bottle in the late 1980s.<br /><br />The Haribo products are much better than their American imitiations. The Haribo products tend to be a bit firmer and of more uniform consistency. The American imitations are way too soft and too sweet. The Haribo products have a better, finer and more complex flavor. The 5 pound bags are an excellent deal!

review/summary: Love the flavor...hate the smell!
review/text: The taste of a Haribo Happy Cola Gummy is quite honestly a miracle. I still have no idea how they're able to take such an intense amount of cola flavor and pack it into a teeny-weeny piece of chewy deliciousness. It's downright succulent! If I had a five pound bag on me at this very moment, I'd down them all in an instant...but not before I pinched my nose with a clothes pin.<br /><br />These things reek. Every bag I've ever bought knocks me on my haunches and I've come to accept the bad odor as a bit of extra baggage. Sometimes they smell like poop, sometimes they smell like vomit, but they always smell wretched whatever the case. Not only do I avoid sticking my nose anywhere near the bag, but I have to wash my hands as soon as I'm finished snacking! It's sick!<br /><br />If the smell which emanated from these little guys was that of a freshly cracked can of soda pop, five stars would be issued all around. But it's not. It's the same stench that I wake up to after a hard night on the town.<br /><br />Once again, the taste is great. I still eat them after all, so I can't knock 'em completely. Buying a bag wouldn't be a mistake, but opening the bag in a small, draft free room would be.

review/summary: Really Enjoyed the Story, the Candy?  Not So Much
review/text: I bought this candy because of 20% curiosity 80% that one reviewer's spectacularly written story.  The flavor of this candy can be pretty much summed up like this: without the fizz cola flavor is mostly sugar.  I didn't really realize this until I bought the candy. It had the flavor of flat cola, and the flavor is faint (otherwise it would probably be too sweet).  Was also a tad on the rubbery side for my tastes.  Between me, my two college roomates, and two other friends we BARELY managed to polish this thing off before we got too sick of them. 5 lbs is a lot of candy, even for five college guys.

If you believe America was the king then you missing out.  Most fond memory was in Germany going down to the lake with my german coinage.  Was a small little shop there and would get 3 different types of gummies(twin-cherries,frogs,and cola bottles).  Hardest thing to find and now and if you do find its alot for just small portions.  If I had the money I would buy 20 of these.  Hope everyone who gets them enjoy them and maybe remember great memories!

My memories of eating Gummy Bears, coca bottles etc., were to me walking through the forest to get to the gummi store as we called it - that huge forest to me was a walk through a park with trees as my mother still laughs at me today over - but I remember the walk to this day! That huge forest! I am purchasing these items for my sisters who will smile and think about our childhood as well - Being in the military is hard enough for families today but their is always something that may bring a smile to someone with a happy memory! keep smiling and we love Haribo!.

review/summary: Happy with Happy Cola
review/text: I have been eating Haribo Happy Cola for a while now, on a weekly basis.  This has become a regular staple food at my groups weekly D&D sessions alongside the normal cheetos and mountain dew, so when I saw that there was a 5 lb. bag option available, I jumped on it.  I know I won't be disappointed in the product because I eat them out of the small bags already.  Highly recommended, but remember, in moderation.  I don't recommend eating an entire 5 lb. bag in one sitting.

review/summary: Haribo "Happy - Cola" candy
review/text: How could you go wrong with a 5 pound bag o candy? Ridiculously low price, considering its a five pound bag, and one of my favorite candies out there! Shipping prices were reasonable, and it arrived a lot faster then estimated (3 days after I ordered the product, it was sitting at my doorstep). Also, if you are trying the product for the first time, definitely do not get a five pounder, because if you buy it, and don't like it, you're stuck with five pounds of candy. But if you do happen to like the candy, then buy the five pound bag, its definitely worth it, and better then buying a bunch of those tiny one dollar bags at your local drugstore or candy selling store.

review/summary: Fresher than the candy store and 1/3 the price
review/text: These are easily my wife's favorite treat but they are so expensive if you buy them at the candy store at the mall, and I've never been a fan of buying bulk items where masses of people can 'interact' with them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that I found them on Amazon and at 1/3 the cost of buying them at the mall.  In addition to being much cheaper, they are considerably fresher than the ones that come from the bulk containers at the mall.<br /><br />We put ours in a big tupperware container once we open up the bag and they stay fresh for weeks, but they rarely last that long at our house.  Whenever someone opens the container, that yummy smell usually draws everyone else over for a handful or two.  The only time that they last for more than a week or so is if they get pushed to the back of the pantry and are forgotten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I think these are something that you either really like or really don't like.  There is little in-between.  If you're not sure about them, go buy a small handful from the candy store in the mall or even in a little sealed bad at the grocery store.  If you are a fan of these, this is the place to buy them.  If you seal them up well, they'll last quite a while and you'll save yourself quite a bit of money (and a trip to the mall).

review/text: One thing you will find upon purchasing Haribo products is originality.  They are pioneers in the field of gummy candies. It is important to consider them first when you enjoy gummies.<br />Honestly these gummies are amazing unless you fo not like the flavor. This flavor is not for everyone but if you enjoy them I would recommend purchasing. Make sure you have some sort of container or bag to put them in after you open since they do not come in a resealable bag. The five pounds will last a while depending on how many people are consuming them. Highly recommend to anyone who has not tasted them to try. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Not really cola, BUT...
review/text: Let me start by saying that I think these candies are excellent.  They have that tough, chewy texture that is neither just soft goo nor the jaw tiring, too hard to get started chewing chewing experience of gum stuck under a desk -- just right for me.  The flavor does not strike me as anything more than vaguely reminiscent of cola-- there is a pronounced aroma of cinnamon when one gets a whiff upon opening the bag and during chewing the taste is a slightly sour/slightly sweet citrus (vaguely lemon) with only infrequent small bursts of a background hint of cola.  I do not care for sour candy, fruit or anything really and normally find those things only palatable when balanced with an overwhelming sweetness much like lemon ade and I try to avoid that kind of sugar blast.  These Haribo Gummi Candy, Happy-Cola are are an effective balance.<br />  Sorry if I sound like some effete gummi bear snob but I was trying to describe a flavor that is not easily described.  The bottom line is that no matter what the flavor is supposed to be, it is very pleasantly infused in a matrix of just the right texture.  I like these a lot and expect to order more.

review/text: The taste of the cola flavored gummy bears is ok, the regular harbi gummy bears have a much better flavor. I wont be buying these again as they were just too hard and chewy, not anywhere as soft as you get from the local store. If you like your gummy bears chewy these are for you, if you want a soft gummy bear look elsewhere.

review/text: If you want the best value. This 5 pounder is the way to go.<br /><br /> like their original gummy bears so much that I grab a pack of this to try. Not disappointed at all. You can really taste the cola flavor on this bottle shaped candies. It is not too sticky that it glues your teeth together; although a bit on the rubbery side. Not too sweet neither. Just the right combination of flavors to taste. . From the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (Haribo - based in Germany).<br /><br />Just FYI: 5 oz bag has 3.5 servings, with each serving at 140 calories, 10% carbo, 21g sugar, and 3g of protein. A serving is about 17 pieces of gummies.

The 5 lb bag is a great deal for the price and these are so good that it's hard to stop eating them! Someone else mentioned that Haribo has the best gummy candies, and I'd have to agree whole-heartedly. They are gummy but not too hard, and the "cola" flavor is perfect. This particular bag would be great for a party or something like that. They are so delicious that it's hard to stop once you start! The bag came in perfect condition, and the gummies tasted fresh. I'm almost finished with the bag, and all in all, I'd buy it again!

review/text: I used to get these when I was a kid, and finding them again has been a real treat.  These are sold by about 5 sources on amazon, so prices vary.<br /><br />If you have never eaten these, then go find a 3oz bag somewhere and try them.  They are not for everyone.

review/text: Shipping was super fast. I got it two days after I bought it. And the candy was great! I enjoyed it, my little sister enjoyed it, and my mom even enjoyed it after she found out that I bought 5lbs of candy. Its been about a  month and I only have a few ounces left. It wouldve been gone sooner if my mom hadnt hid it from me! (I'm 17 by the way)

review/text: The Gummi Colas are one of the best gummi candies out there. It was a very good bargain to get a 5-lb bag for such a low price. Being my second favorite gummi candy of all time, I was glad to see it on Amazon and quickly snatched a bag. The delicious flavor of cola is a wonderful sensation in the form of a gummi.

review/summary: yummy gummi! -- but too hard
review/text: I love the cola flavored gummies. LOVE it! but these are a little too hard/stiff for me. VERY chewy, almost a stale type of chewy. wish it was more like the soft gummies that you can get from the grocery stores. but the flavor is good though.  price is great for 5 pounds but it's only getting 3 stars. it would have gotten 5 stars if it was softer.

After I moved in the US I only saw this product in small bag, and in few and far between places (and nowhere near I live of course).  So it was great to see Amazon selling it!  I immediately bought 2 bags (to get the free shipping) and enjoying them immensely.

review/summary: Fan of all Greenies products- except this one.
review/text: Though my cat is a huge a fan of all of the Dental Chews produced by greenies, my experience with this product was less than pleasant.<br />This product did the opposite of what it set out to do.  My cat violently vomited hairballs the same evening I fed him these.  In fact, he couldn't digest them at all and has never thrown up so much at one time.  This was unusual and still has me shocked, especially for an animal that regurgitates seldom and mildly.  Be careful, as I wish I had.

review/summary: Tasty and works!
review/text: First off, my cat HATES regular Greenies (the big crunchy ones) and won't even try to lick them. Any flavor. But my big fluffy Himalayan was hacking up stinky furballs in unreachable places, so when I saw these at the pet store I bought them on a whim.<br /><br />She loves them! I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!

review/text: I purchased this box mix at an outlet originally.  I only purchased one box to test it out.  It was fabulous.  I can bake it plain or add nuts, cranberries, chocolate chips or whatever.  You can't imagine how easy and quick it is to put together.  Everyone I serve it to.....raves!!!!!  This brand has many other choices in their box mixes and they are all wonderful.....but this is my favorite.  After I could not find it at the outlet anymore I got desperate and went on Amazon.  It was out-of-stock and I went on the waiting list and they notified me.  Then I ordered 6!!!!!  A must try.

It makes a great desert or a quick breakfast. I'm ordering other flavors now and can't wait to try them!

I almost didn't get it because it is not for bread machines. But it looked so good and was inexpensive enough to try. There are 6 boxes. 3 boxes went in 3 days! I took one to work and it lasted all of ten minutes. The other 2 loaves were gone fast at home.<br /><br />I even played with the mix a little with no bad results. I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar at the last minute of mixing so it wasn't quite mixed in. It left swirls of goodness all through the bread. yum!<br /><br />This is easy, tasty and priced right. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Tastes Like Cake
review/text: I initially bought a box of this Bread Mix at my local upscale supermarket and brought it home to give it a taste test. I like to bake, but am not a dyed in the wool "scratch baker." Frequently I start with a mix and add ingredients until I have something really unique that my friends and I like.<br />So I took this mix, added nuts, baked it and took it to my Wednesday AM get together with the girls. Oh My Gosh! It is SOOOO nice and rich. Instead of bread, it tastes like cake. All the ladies liked it, so I bought another box and planned to use when needed.<br />A bread and salad potluck came up, and I was in a hurry so I just whipped up the bread and baked it in the oven and took it with me. Soon, ladies at the potluck were asking "Who brought the wonderful bread?"<br />I love it. My friends love it. SO,I put in a Subscribe and Save order with Amazon. It is great just as it is when cooked with no additions, but is even better with nuts. I'm sure you could add chocolate chips and/or dried fruit. Your imagination is your limit. It is great. Tastes like Cake. Have fun and Enjoy.

I was interested I mean a coffee that is healthy who wouldnt want some health benefits from  Something they love, but, like most my first question was OK but what does it taste like?<br />The ad offered a free sample so I bit and sent for one, when the package arrived with the picture of the cup of coffee and the od looking mushroom, I was more than a bit scared but prepared it anyway and took a drink... Wow, this stuff was good. OK I drank the whole thing. Now I have had problems with coffee before, having acid reflux disease but I couldn't give it up so I dealt with it. This stuff didnt hit me like coffee did I could enjoy it without the acid side effects. I was and am hooked, today I drink it all the time and have not been to Starbucks in weeks, should pop in they probably are concerned, I ordered more and decided that what the hell, I like this so much I will sell it. And I sell it at wholesell e-mail for info and I would love to give you the drink-gano domain.<br /><br />Make It a Great One<br />Todd

Tea Festival) that I bought this second one as a gift.  I might buy another and stash it to experience how it ages.<br /><br />A previous review said that this tastes like green tea. Yes, a very refreshing green tea, which is what raw Puer is, I believe.  This particular tea tastes slightly fruity rather than just "green", and the flavors stand up to repeated brewing:  9 or 10 (small, Chinese) cups.  It's great as iced tea, too.

Alot of vendors are jumping on the pu erh bandwagon charging customers alot of money making them think it's pu erh. I do not believe this is 100% pu erh as stated in the description.
