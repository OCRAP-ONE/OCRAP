review/text: I have been using this for the last three years.  It tastes good is worth the money.  Most decaffeinated coffees have a little caffeine in them.  Even a little caffeine will keep me from sleeping.  This doesn't.

review/summary: I put away my Mr. Coffee.
review/text: I stopped buying expensive (for me) Starbucks coffee and put away my Mr. Coffee after I received this item.  This order has lasted me years and the coffee is fantastic.  It's delicious, not weak tasting at all.  It's also convenient for cold drinks because you can just mix it into some milk with brown sugar.  It is also great in brownies and homemade ice cream.  I'm never going back to regular coffee (this is my first decaf buy.)  I am not a regular coffee drinker but I love not being tempted into buying Starbucks or fancy machines.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: Did some comparison taste testing and this came out on top.  Organic and great flavor without the caffeine.  No surprise that Amazon is far cheaper than Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods.)  You'd think that making instant coffe is intuitive. There is a another counter intuitive way.  Many decades ago a young Greek gentlemen in Athens showed a way to make instant coffee that is still my preferred method.  Maybe because I grew up in London I prefer to boil my water on a stove top over nuking it.  While the water heats mix the instant coffee, granulated sweetener of choice (Splenda for me) and if using a non dairy creamer powder that as well into a thick paste with a little of the water that is heating.  Then when the water achieves a rolling boil pour into the cup and stir.  This method results in a nice foam (creama) on top that just pouring water on the coffee granules and then adding sweetener and creamer will not achieve.  Enjoy.

review/summary: EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  A MUST BUY!!!
review/text: I was searching to find an organic, decaf, instant coffee and this is the only one I could find.  I read the reviews and saw how wonderful everyone thought it was so I tried it and am so glad I did.  This is by far the ABSOLUTE BEST coffee I have ever had in my life!  It is so flavorful that you use much less than you would on a generic coffee so don't be scared away by the oz/$ comparison to other coffees, your health is worth the tiny bit more it costs.  Oh, it is so good and me being sensitive to caffeine, I use so very little in my cup but it flavors it so well.  The price is EXCELLENT as I've seen them cost $10-$12 in various health food stores.  I have several cases onhand and will continue to stock up before the end times arrive.  It would make super gifts for others that are trying to watch their health.

review/summary: Very Good Bloody Mary Mix - Highly Recommended!
review/text: "Mr & Mrs T's Bloody Mary Mix" is our favorite off-the-shelf Bloody Mary mix and these 5.5oz cans are very convenient. We use the less expensive larger bottles if we know our guests will be having Bloody Marys but like these cans for single servings since the larger bottles need to be refrigerated after being opened.<br /><br />We add a little more than 1oz of Vodka (your taste may vary) and find that it really doesn't need anything else for most people. It is just spicy enough for my wife, but I put an extra shot of Tabasco Sauce in mine and my mother cuts hers with a little tomato juice to dilute the heat a little. These are also good straight (without any spirits added) and as substitute for tomato juice in cooking (particularly vegetable stock) to add an extra zing to your dishes.<br /><br />The 24 can case is a good value (especially if you have Prime or qualify for free Super Saver shipping) since we could only find them in smaller packs locally and at a much higher price per can.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Better than the bottle
review/text: I developed an appreciation for this drink during my days of frequent airline travel. I prefer to drink them straight (without booze). As a result, I started buying bottles of the mix at the grocery store--because finding this by the can in the real world is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, when you buy this by the bottle something happens. The first glass tastes exactly as you expected. But  once you open the bottle, if you don't drink the contents within 24-36 hours the taste turns. Keeping a stock of cans in the house, therefore, is essential. I live in a major metropolitan area and I can't find these cans in any store. Not grocery stores (including mom & pop, big chains, high-end small chains, etc), not liquor stores (including corner stores or BevMo). Enter Amazon. I'm very grateful I can buy this by the can here on the interwebs. I personally prefer the smaller-size cans to the 11.5 ounce. Make sure to buy enough to qualify for super saver shipping.

review/summary: A good Bloody Mary mix but you can easily make a Better One
review/text: I have a Virgin Mary almost every day and a true Bloody Mary maybe once or twice a week. I've experimented with a lot of different tomato juices, hot sauces, and spices but I've only tried a few Bloody Mary mixes.<br /><br />I recently purchased both the Tabasco Spicy Bloody Mary mix and the Mr & Mrs T Spicy Bloody Mary mix to see what (if anything) I was missing. The Tabasco mix was simply horrid but the Mr & Mrs T was pretty good. It has a nice blend of heat versus sweetness (tomatoes working against hot peppers). However any other flavors (if they exist) seemed lost in the Mr & Mrs Ts mix. A true three star product - good but not great.<br /><br />I'd recommend Mr/Mrs Ts to anyone who MUST purchase a mix. It's a good one. But I don't recommend you purchase any mix!<br />.<br /><br />I'd recommend a simple recipe using just two ingredients - your preferred tomato juice and a great hot sauce but the devil, of course, is in the details.<br />.<br />SIMPLE BLOODY MARY RECIPE - Two Ingredients:<br /><br />1.) Tomato Juice or V8 juice - I prefer the low sodium variety of V8 but that is NOT a critical factor. Use whatever juice you like.<br />Actually the lowest priced cans of tomato juice at my local supermarket have proven really excellent! Go figure.<br /><br />2.) A High Quality Hot Sauce. Using a better than average hot sauce is absolutely key. I strongly recommend (if you do not already have a favorite) one of the following (I've taste tasted about 30 different ones and below is my short list of favorites which are also readily available:<br /><br />My LIST of "High Quality" Hot sauces:<br /><br />  a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced with a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. It really makes the virgin/bloody mary quite special. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section!<br /><br /> b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section<br /><br /> c) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br /> d) Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce - a well know, national brand. The Chipotle pepper is smoked and has a unique flavor. Widely available and worth a try. There are many other brands of Chipotle sauces.<br /><br /> e) El Yacateco Green<br /><br />That is simple as it gets. A juice and a dash of a really good hot sauce. This is not only far better than the Tabasco mix (which is horrid) but it is also better than the Mr/Mrs Ts Bloody Mary mix!<br /><br />An added bonus of mixing your own ----- you can adjust the heat level to your individual preferences. You can't do that with a mix.<br /><br />Have some fun by adding Worchester sauce, horseraddish, etc to your home mix

review/summary: I LOVE these noodles!!!
review/text: These noodles are for anyone who is working to eat healthfully and loves pasta! They are delicious and make the best and only subsitute for regular pasta, so much so that there's nothing to miss but the extra calories! One whole bag of these noodles only have 40 calories. Give these noodles a try, and you won't be disappointed. I know *I'm* never going back to the real thing!

review/summary: These noodles are incredible!
review/text: I found a link to the tofu shirataki in an article on MSN.com talking about foods to stay away from.  Of course they weren't talking about staying away from the tofu shirataki noodles, but to steer clear on pasta, even whole wheat, claiming it to be a glorified junk food that quickly turns to sugar once digested.  Being Italian and an avid pasta fan, I quickly "googled" and found a link to Amazon.com on www.house-foods.com.  I ordered 5 packages of the noodles, because I have been eating health food for awhile and despite the poor reviews, I was ready to give these a shot.  I am so glad that I did.  They are like tough spaghetti.  By tough I do not mean, tire rubber, but more like over cooked.  That doesn't bother me at all.  I cooked them in marinara sauce, put them in broth and made an Asian style soup and served them with teriyaki chicken.  These things are so versatile and fabulous.  I am on weight watchers and an entire bag of these noodles has 0 points and only 40 calories with 4 grams of fiber.  You can't ask for a better alternative to pasta.  The expiration date is about 4 months from when you order, so you don't have to gobble them up immediately. It also makes stocking up more convenient.  I will be stocking up on these indefinitely!  My only complaint is that shipping is kinda high, but I guess they do have to be cold packed to stay fresh.

review/summary: My FAVORITE new food
review/text: I am addicted to shirataki noodles. No joke! If you check out lowcarbfriends.com, there is a thread I started in the main lobby. We've had over 20,000 hits, and there are almost 600 posts. The majority of the posts are from people who are now eating shirataki noodles, instead of pasta. It's great for losing weight, adding fiber to your diet and like tofu, they taste like whatever seasoning or sauce you use with them. I have them five out of seven days a week.<br /><br />There are some recipes on the thread on lowcarbfriends, including noodle pudding (kugel), spaghetti pie, among others. These noodles are the BEST!

review/text: These noodles taste great, although the texture is a little different than regular spaghetti noodles.  Be warned, if you do eat the whole bag (a serving size is half the bag) they tend to sit like a rock in your stomach.  I've used these in soup as well as with spaghetti sauce.  The nutritional information is what really blows me away - no sugar, very little sodium, and for those of us on weight watchers, the entire bag is 0 points.  I just wish I could find them in a local grocery store.

review/summary: Great Noodles, but not spaghetti
review/text: I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!  My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water.  This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use.

review/summary: Shirataki Oodles Of Noodles, Tofu-Styled
review/text: I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.<br /><br />I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.<br /><br />House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!<br /><br />What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?<br /><br />For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.<br /><br />Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?<br /><br />When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.<br /><br />After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!<br /><br />Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.<br /><br />Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as "chewy" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.<br /><br />House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!<br /><br />And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com. How about that?<br /><br />So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight. Eating pasta on a "diet" never tasted so good, baby!<br /><br />We haven't heard the last of shirataki!

review/text: The Shirataki Noodles were awesome!!!!  My sister and I purchased 20 bags and they are almost gone, we cook them everyday!!!  Yes, they do have a funny odor when you first open the bag, DUMP THEM IN A STRAINER AND RUN COLD WATER OVER THEM FOR A MINUTE AND THEN BOIL THEM FOR LIKE 5 MINS!!!!  They are totally great!!!  I have made them with spaghetti sauce, stirfried (after being boiled) with veggies and shrimp.  Stirfried with veggies and parm cheese, just some teriyaki sauce and grilled chicken in a skillet!!!!  I can go on and on.... The only bad thing was we waited 3 weeks for our shipment, but we are ordering another big shipment with several friends that love them too!!!!  They are really filling (serving size is half a bag, but we have been eating the whole bag, and who cares, its a total of 40 calories and 2 carbs!!!  (no sugar)  Shirataki Noodles are truly amazing and a great way to feel good about yourself!!!!

Yes, they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off! I make sure I rinse them really well in cold water right before I boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell! I just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal! I found the texture to be actually good , like a firmer version of the ramen noodles! I think these make an excellent snack or meal!

review/text: These noodles are a low carb, high protein alternative to regular pasta.  They are decent for stir frys and simple dishes.  I would not recommend them with a heavy sauce as it will not "cling" to the noodles.<br /><br />The noodles need to be rinsed before cooking.  This is very important unless you like fishy smelling food!  You can get these cheap at Trader Joes.

review/summary: Not that different from regular shirataki noodles, and they are much cheaper elsewheres
review/text: These House Foods tofu shirataki noodles have only a small amount of soy flour in them - the konnyaku yam flour is still the main ingredient.<br /><br />I couldn't tell much of a difference between these tofu shirataki noodles and regular shirataki noodles - they may be just a bit softer, but not much.<br /><br />Shirataki noodles are not a hydrated starch paste like wheat noodles - instead they have the structure of a firm gel and are 96% water with only a tiny amount of the konnyaku yam flour (a long chain polysaccharide) holding it all together.<br /><br />The gel structure accounts for the mouth feel and chewing texture of the shirataki noodles.  This is also what makes them so filling without getting you all those calories.  The water soluble fiber of the yam flour is also not digested for the most part, and is very healthy for you.<br /><br />They do go great with a lot of different stuff - udon soup, tomato or pesto based spaghettis, etc.  I give five stars for the shirataki noodles.<br /><br />The main problem with the House Foods noodles listed here is their price, especially the exorbitant shipping charges.  House Foods is actually located in Southern California, and the listed seller is in New York!<br /><br />There are cheaper suppliers elsewhere.

review/text: These noodles are a little hard to take in the beginning - "rubbery" would best describe them.  However, seasoning is the key.  Serve them with grated parmesan or imitation parmesan, tomato sauce, olive oil, a little garlic, and you have a delicious meal.  It's a godsend for people who must watch their calories carefully and still crave to eat foods beyond vegetables.  As someone who has always had to watch her weight, I strongly recommend that you give them a chance.  And the fact that it's good for your health is another plus.  Try Whole Foods or Wild By Nature.  Less than $2.00.

review/summary: You CAN Eat Noodles Again!
review/text: My lovely wife and I discovered these noodles hidden in a corner of a cooler in the "Tofu/Natural Foods" (??) section of our local branch of a mega-mart chain. We were skeptical, but they LOOKED like spaghetti, and they WERE on sale. Are we glad we took the plunge! If you drain and rinse them well, and dry them thoroughly after cooking and before saucing, the tremendous savings in calories and carbs will be well worth the differences from traditional pasta. And there are recipies at the manufacturer's Web site -- try the Cheesy Noodle Bake with reduced-fat cheese for a guilt-free mac'n'cheese substitute! If your local store doesn't have'em, order'em today. They're NOT exact substitutes for traditional pasta, but they're the best alternative we've found!

review/text: I had read about these noodles in Your Diet magazine and was intrigued.  I first called my local Whole Foods, but they didn't carry them.  I guess these are super-popular because the guy on the phone said that while they don't currently carry them, they plan to shortly because of the huge number of requests they had received.<br /><br />I placed my order and waited.  I worried that my perishible noodles were sitting somewhere rotting because it took FOREVER (over three weeks) for them to be delivered.  I finally got the box with 4 packets of noodles and a freezer dealy designed to keep them cool.<br /><br />I tried them the way the magazine recommended, heated in the microwave.  Uh, yuk.<br /><br />I'm not a big tofu lover to begin with.  The noodles were similar to really overcooked spaghetti.  Tasteless, with a really strange plasticy flavor to them.  I poured my beautiful homemade marinara on them, they turned into a watery mess.<br /><br />The heck with that.  I'm going for whole wheat noodles or protein enriched noodles.<br /><br />The product is as advertised, it just wasn't to my taste.

They do smell when you first open them but if you spend any time rinsing/boiling them it's not an issue.  They have a very slippery texture but they're far from inedible. I added some parmesan cheese to them and realized that they don't have that much of a taste, so adding them into some sauce is probably your best bet.  I just ate the entire package, am full, and feel good that what I ate was super healthy!

review/summary: THE REAL SCOOP ON SHIRATAKI NOODLES!!
review/text: Okay, so I heard about the amazing Shirataki noodle and decided to give it a try.  After MUCH research and deliberation I decided to try both the "miracle noodle" (zero calorie, glucomannan, no tofu) and the House Foods (40 calorie per bag, tofu and yam flour) varities.  BOTH arrived today, so I decided to try both and give an unbiased review.<br />#1 - Anyone who says these noodles have a repulsive odor, has never eaten fish before.<br />#2 - anyone who says these noodles have a repulsive texture, has never eaten ramen, or udon noodles before.<br /><br />I put a small pot of boiling water on the stove, brought to a boil.  Opened the bag, put noodles into a strainer, and rinsed 10-15 seconds under cold water.  Then I put the noodles in pot of boiling water.<br /><br />I purposely sniffed the bag.. and yes.. it has a medium to mild "fishy" odor, nothing worse than salmon.  If you don't like this, then don't sniff the bag.  The "miracle noodle" had slightly less of this odor.<br /><br />I purposely sniffed the boiling water after about 1 minute, and yes, it had an odor, not so much fishy anymore, as almost plastic-y.. kind of hard to describe... again, don't sniff the steam if this bothers you.<br /><br />After 3 minutes of boiling (for the House foods brand), and 2 mintues (for the miracle noodle brand), I poured into the strainer again, and rinsed with HOT water for 10 seconds.  I then drained, and put back into the small pot, and added half a flavor packet from a pack of ramen noodles (chicken flavor).<br /><br />IT TASTED JUST LIKE RAMEN!  I was very excited.  The noodles (as other reviews state) have no flavor on their own, but take on asian flavors nicely.  As for being a "spaghetti substitute," these would probably do the same as if you put ramen noodles under some spaghetti sauce.. not quite right.. but not the fault of the noodles, just not the intent of an asian noodle.<br /><br />As for the texture, these noodles actually get FIRMER as you cook them, instead of softer (like regular noodles).  If your're a fan of "al dente" pasta, then this is for you.  YES &lt; they are a bit firm, but not hard like rubber bands (like other reviews have said).  And not slimy in the slightest, I don't get why people have said this (again, felt just like ramen noodles in my mouth).  I love al dente pasta myself, and found the texture preferable to normal ramen noodles.  The "miracle noodle" is slightly firmer, and more transluscent (like more tradition ramen noodles).<br /><br />I ate one bag of each, and loved every bite of both.  This was also about 4 hours ago, and I felt full this whole time (not uncomfortably full, just not hungry).<br /><br />I'm VERY glad I took a chance on this.  Perhaps if you have a picky pallet, this isn't for you.  But if you like Ramen noodles, then I'm telling you give these a try.  One bag (of either) is about the same volume as one packet of Ramen noodles, but at a fraction of the calories (or zero in the case of miracle noodles).  I plan on experimenting with other spices, such as bullion, and asian "flavor packets" found at the grocery store.<br /><br />Hope this helps!!

review/text: Be warned:  Shipping is very expensive (at least $18).  This is not indicated anywhere.  You will be much better off trying to find a store that carries them.<br /><br />As to the noodles, they were OK.  I tried them in a dish with a pesto-based sauce and shrimp.  They don't taste too bad, but they didn't hold the sauce like pasta would.  All the sauce slid down to the plate.  They might work better in a different dish.

review/text: I bought these at a upscale grocer near my house.  I used them in a dish with diced chicken, plenty of vegetables, and a mixture of asian sauces. The noodles absorbed the asian flavor and tasted great.  I actually loved the texture as well.  40 calories in an entire bag? I'll definitely be using these again.<br /><br />However, I think the texture of the noodles is geared for asian dishes.  I definitely would not use these in an italian recipe.

review/text: The noodles were more like ramen noodles than pasta.  Probably good in soup but I was hoping for more pasta like consistancy.  The noodles took a very long time to ship, they have gone up in price since I ordered them.  I did not think the value for my money was worth it.  And most importantly, the noodles made me extremely gassy for the entire day after I ate them.  I will not be ordering these again.

review/text: Granted I'm not a huge tofu fan but after reading the fabulous reviews on this site and at the Hungry Girl site, I thought I'd give it a shot.  Tried them with marinara and like another reviewer said, the sauce just slid off.  The texture was way too chewy--like squid. Fine if you are eating squid (which I like) but not if you want pasta.  They taste  nothing like pasta. Very disappointing. I will be giving my other 3 packages away. Perhaps they would be better in an Asian soup dish but they are definitely not a substitute for good old spaghetti.

The taste and texture of them tastes IDENTICAL to real pasta, they're not chewy or rubbery or anything like people in other reviews said, if you prepare and cook these noodles according to what it says on the packaging they will be identical to real pasta in every single way and you will not be able to tell the difference.

review/text: I love this product; I happen to be veggie (20 years now) and also am nice and plump.  This product was made for me 'cause it takes on the flavor of any sauce you put on it, e.g. olive oil and garlic, vodka sauce, marinara sauce, etc. and lets you enjoy "pasta" without adding the calories and carbs.  I'm lucky to have it in my local health food store and don't have to pay shipping, but I would certainly do so in order to obtain this product.  Just order a dozen or so packs (it keeps for about 3 months) and the shipping won't add that much to each meal.  Try it - I think you'll really like it!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Joan

review/text: Anyone remember making those gelly-like bugs in a mini extruding machine when you were a kid?  Well, these noodles, though basically adopting the flavor of the sauce you dress them with, have that same, chewy, rubbery texture.<br /><br />I didn't find the smell offensive, and I was pleased with the appearance, since they looked very much like the real deal when I used them for lo mein.  But after a few bites (about 50 per forkful) I decided it was just a bit too rubbery for me.  I purchased 8 bags, and put the remaining 7 in the trash.<br /><br />I have to say, also, the "8 oz" package size is the prepared weight, not like with dried pasta...so 8 ounces of this stuff goes only half as far as the real thing.<br /><br />If you don't mind chewing, go for it...they will taste like whatever you cook them in.  But I felt like I was eating creepy crawlers and just couldn't get beyond that.<br /><br />:&lt;(

review/text: I also read about these noodles on HugryGirl and despite the negative reviews on the amazon board, decided to give them a try. Now, I understand why some people would be turned off by them, they do smell pretty funky when you first open the bag (but the bag does warn you it will) and the texture is a little bit chewy, more so than normal pasta, and they do look kinda strange...but once you get over that and actually try them they areny bad at all. Because its tofu it takes on the flavor of whatever you cook it with, which in my case was spaghetti sauce. Overall I thought it was a pretty good product. Like I said before I mixed it with spaghetti sauce and the only difference I could tell between these noodles and real pasta was the slightly chewy texture, which I dont mind.<br /><br />Most of the people who bought these noodles did so because they were a low calorie "health food". Of course they wont taste exactly like the real stuff but if you are looking for something low cal and good go for it. I wasnt dissapointed.

I threw away the noodle cake that came with Ramen and used the flavor pack on the equivilent amount of shirataki noodles.<br /><br />I couldn't eat them.  Way too firm for me.  Like tiny compressed lines of squid, or edible rubber.  My mother could eat them though, and was happy for all the food without the calories.<br /><br />I would really like to see them meld these noodles with wheat noodles so that they're softer, but still save on some of the calories.

Afterall, I've discovered a lot of new reduced calorie options over the years that merit the trade-off.  Unfortunately, these noodles were just not worth it.  The texture alone kept me from wanting more than two bites.  Still hopeful, I mixed them together with spaghetti sauce and grated parmesean cheese and let them sit overnight in the frig (as sometimes the flavors can make it better the second day).  Again, no luck.  Just plain yucky.  Maybe putting in soup would help change the rubbery texture??? Not sure but I won't be trying again anytime soon.

Also, if you don't know the first thing about cooking, don't expect much from these. They're not your garden variety Kraft Mac 'n Cheese out of a box (or a bag, in this case). Use your imagination (yes, what a hard task for some of you). Seasonings, other than your basic salt and pepper, can bring out quite a bit of flavor. And no, I'm not saying just basic pasta sauce either. You can make a tasty Thai dish, or even just butter and romano cheese would be nice. Just THINK before you complain. Otherwise, you can keep eating refined carbohydrates and wonder why 60% of America is fat. Okay, rant over!

review/summary: Worst tofu product ever
review/text: As a vegan, I have tried just about every tofu product on the market, and nothing ever came close to the terrible texture of these noodles.<br /><br />The smell when you opened the bag was not pleasant, but if you wash them off and parboil, that goes away, but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much.<br /><br />But I kept an open mind, cooked the noodles for a few minutes, added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese grated on top.  Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either. Even as a low calorie food, it seems like a waste to spend 40 calories on these noodles.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: First of all...the shipping cost was $18 for a $1.99 package of noodles that tasted peculiar enough that I couldn't finish them.  I asked the company to cancel the order before it was shipped and they didn't.  They wrote me that they would cut the shipping in half for my trouble.  So I payed $10.99 for a bag of noodles that were gross in tast and texture...not worth it!

review/summary: shiritake noodles
review/text: THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT LEAVES ALOT TO BE DESIRED. THE NOODLES WERE DISGUSTING. IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE SHIPPED IN LIQUID AND NEEDED TO BE REFRIGERATED, I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THEM. THEY HAVE NO FLAVOR AND THE TEXTURE IS DISGUSTING. I NOW HAVE THREE PACKS OF NOODLES SITTING IN MY REFRIGERATOR THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. CONSIDERING HOW EXPENSIVE THE SHIPPING COST WAS, I WILL BE THROWING MY MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE THE VEGAN WAY OF LIFE. THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE.

review/summary: absolutely disgusting
review/text: This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it.

review/summary: Tastes good but too runny
review/text: I think the ingredients in this dish meal are excellent, healthy and tasty - my only problem is that it is too runny, almost like a soup.  Therefore it can drip and spill out of the spoon.

review/summary: If you want them to eat meat...
review/text: My son is eating regular food, but it's very hard for him eat beef since he doesn't have enough teeth to really chew even small pieces of meat, so it has to be ground which leaves me a limited number of menu options.  This is a great way to make sure he gets some meat in his diet and he really likes it.

review/summary: Love Plum Organics, Disappointed with 'beef stew'
review/text: My son (10 mo) loves everything Plum Organics we've ever given, but the Beef Stew is a total flop.  It is VERY runny, so tough to feed with a tiny little spoon and I mixed with baby cereal to give it enough texture to feed.  Then he was 'over it' about a third of the way through and stopped eating.  I tried it again a week later and he wouldn't eat it at all.  I wish I hadn't bought a big box of this - every other item has been great so I didn't think to try one before committing!
