review/summary: Best chips I've ever eaten
review/text: Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm a huge fan of jalape&ntilde;o poppers, so I was a little skeptical about trying these the first time, but I was absolutely not disappointed.<br /><br />These chips looks like the puffy cheeto's, and taste exactly like a jalape&ntilde;o popper. The only complaint I could ever have with these is that there is never enough in a bag!

review/summary: High quality and authentic Dry Paan Gulkand 10 /10
review/text: It is difficulty to find quality Indian goods online. Many products are available but most are 'export' goods that have been altered in some way. Or worse they have been warehoused so long they are stale.<br />Not so with this Dry Paan! This paan is authentic in every respect and carries the real taste these products should. Well packaged and well made the paan is in large pieces and moist.  Flavor is sweet and gently rosey, with the ever so slightly smoky tone much preserved paan has. If you are familiar with these products you will not be disappointed in this brand.

review/summary: Really good, not a huge calorie burden.
review/text: This is a really good "bright" tasting sauce.  Love it.  Absolutely nothing sacrificed with the reduced calories.  Puts more emphasis on quality vegetables for taste, and less on fat.  Really good for quick meals on the go, for anything you'd use sauce for.  A sensible amount of pasta (ideally quinoa-based) with a dash of this sauce and some added seasoning to taste makes for a great pre-workout meal.<br /><br />Without Super Saver Shipping it comes out to five bucks a bottle...I can't remember what I pay for it locally but I think at best this price is breaking even with store-bought, but my gut tells me it's higher than what you'd pay at Ralph's.  However, if you can't get this locally it's worth ordering...40 calories a serving.

review/text: My fussy dog has been on a grain free diet for about a year and it's made a great difference in her health.  She eats EVO grain free dog food in the small kibble size and thrives on it.  So I thought I'd try the EVO grain free snacks.  She really likes them and eats them up and doesn't hesitate.  They are pricy and when you consider s/h, it's an expensive treat.  But it's good to have the variety of this snack in her diet.

review/summary: Terrific Grain-Free Treats !  GO EVO !!!
review/text: Before bringing our puppy home, we decided on an all-natural, grain-free, dry food regimen; which produced one very healthy & happy dog.  However, continued to feed him various types of treats. He would begin scratching after eating & we finally came to the conclusion it was the treats.  After switching to EVO grain-free treats, the scratching is almost nonexistent.  He loves the treats & shame on us for not reading prior ingredient labels!  Go EVO!!!

review/summary: Training Treat
review/text: Reviewing this product as a training treat:<br /><br />First and foremost, the dog loves this treat better than any other food/treat item.  Better than meat, better than cheese, better than other dog or cat foods.  Five stars for taste.  The dog will work for this treat.  There are a couple less-than-optimal factors with this treat, though.  It is a dry treat.  It is also a low-density dry treat (low-density being better than high-density, because of the number of treats required per session).  Dry treat means crumbs everywhere with extra cleanup.  The dog spends too much time searching for dropped crumbs and not enough time training.  Trainers also recommend a moderately moister treat for other reasons.  For example, dry treats require drinking interruptions, moist don't.  The treat size is way too large for a training treat.  We go through a couple dozen "payouts" in a session, so treats should be small.  This means breaking up the biscuits into smaller chips with a whole lot more crumbs.<br /><br />Recommend the manufacturer 1) shrink the treat size to about the size of a green-pea, 2) Is it possible to create a moist(er) treat with the same flavor incentive?  Accomplishing #1 might be sufficient, because without needing to break up the biscuits, the crumb factor would go way down.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The dog loves this treat.

I subsequently learned that her breeder started recommending EVO to all new puppy owners.<br /><br />I was so happy to see the EVO dog treats, which our dog adores and her digestion does too. The biscuits are easy to break up into small pieces, which I use for training rewards. That means fewer calories and the cookies last longer.

review/summary: Innova Evo No Grain Treats
review/text: I had previously received a sample pack of these with some Dog supplements (for my Holistic Pet Food business)I purchased and since I only have cats I was at odd with what to do with them. My Siamese cat could smell them and went nuts. I have NEVER seen him behave that way about ANY foods including fresh Shrimp. It was comical so I ordered 2 packages and since I live in Puerto Vallarta I had them sent to a friend in the states to bring down to me. Sadly the bozo's at custom took them from her so my cat is out his treats and I'm out 20.00. All I can say is if Dog's like the treats half as much as my cat did you will not regret buying them. Since they are grainless they contain much less carbs and calories and I would buy these for any of my pets in a heartbeat.

They're quite small so are good for any size dog, and the shapes (hearts, circles, bones) are kinda cute.  They are a little stinky, which may be one of the reasons my dog likes them so much.

review/summary: This is the only real Goji juice.  It really works if you know how to use it.
review/text: Goji juice really does work, but you need to know how to use it. If you are going to try Goji juice, please try this one because it has 6 times the concentrate of pure goji juice than the rest of the type on the market.  It is in a glass bottle with absolutely no added juice, as every type in the white plastic bottle is and cost almost the same or more to by.<br /><br />Goji juice works, but you have to give it time.  You basically needed to make it a daily routine. Drinking about 1-2 ounces on an empty stomach (you can mix with OJ or favorite juice for a better flavor because pure Goji is not really sweet).  Then take about the same amount in the afternoon.  You can take more ounces depending on your health since Goji juice is organic and pure.<br /><br />After about 1 week of taking it regularly you really will start to notice a difference.  I have been taking this for about 3 months straight and have not had a cold, feel wonderful, happier, and just plain better!  Goji is a daily supplement and really does aid in immune support, so taking it for that is worth it.  You just have to give it a chance to work.  There are never really any overnight miracle cures for anything.  The good stuff that really works takes time and you have to make it part of your everyday lifestyle to see the real benefit.  I have even planted my own Goji berry plants, so I can eat the fruit as well.<br /><br />This is the best price of all the Goji sold.  You can get it straight from Genesis today or from amazon for the same price, give or take a dollar.  Don't waste money on the white plastic bottle type sold under several names because it is mostly made of other fruit juices and is not pure Goji concentrate.  This is pure with no juices and is well worth the price.  Just remember that to see the real benefits you have to make it part of your lifestyle and it will work.  It is not called the "happy juice" for nothing.  It is even used over seas to help ease the after affects of that patients get when taking chemotherapy.  Just remember that sometimes in America we take something that works and blow it up by exaggerating the cost, adding stuff to the original, and not really informing the consumers on the proper way to use it.  This again is the only real 100% totally pure Goji juice and the only one worth spending money on other than growing ur own fruit trees.

review/summary: love the food, hate the price
review/text: I adopted a retired racing greyhound and soon after getting her she was said to have pancreatitis.  This was determined after  a bit of vomiting and not so pretty diarrhea.  A blood test showed slightly high pancreatic enzyme levels so the vet said to have her eat low fat food.  I checked the dog food analysis website and was looking at those prescription diets, but they seem to be full of a lot of nothing and I stumbled across this Wellness reduced fat kibble.  It wasn't as low fat as the prescription diets, but was less fat than what I was feeding her.  So I tried it and she has been fine since, even made her doggie droppings easier to pick up.  I also think the fact that it has no grain in it helps quite a bit.  I am now buying the other  Wellness Core dog foods, regular and ocean fish, and adding some of that to her reduced fat kibble.  She is a greyhound and doesn't hold the weight, so as long as she is doing okay, I upped her fat intake a little to get some meat on her.  Still, this is one of the most expensive foods out there.  I just tell myself it beats an outrageous vet bill, which is a whole nother story....  In all, this is quality food, so you definitely get what you pay for.

review/summary: Seems great for overweight dogs
review/text: I bought this after comparing ingredients on about a zillion bags of dog food.  I have a 10yo husky who has put on about 10 lbs over his ideal weight in the last couple years.  He also has had bouts where his stomach acids 'gurgle' as though they're unsettled.  I had him on Innova Lg Breed Senior and he maintained his high weight.  He's been eating this for about 3-4 months now, has lost 4 lbs. and no longer gets the gurgling stomach.  He seems vibrant as ever.  Though I typically add a little meat, he is willing to eat this food dry on its own (something he's never done with other foods).  The only downside I have noticed is that it makes his stools VERY smelly - not sure if this is because he's sensitive to an ingredient or a result of the probiotics/supplements the food contains.

review/summary: Confident giving this to my dog
review/text: After careful research on the best dry food for my dog's diet, I chose Wellness Core Reduced Fat. My mixed breed dog is low energy and has a tendency to put weight on easily. It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils.  Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing!<br /><br />You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein.<br /><br />For a more comprehensive analysis of dog food, check out [...]

review/summary: health food
review/text: This is the kind of cinnamon, cassia cinnamon that has been touted in various "health" conscious magazines since summer 2011. This 12 oz container of cassia bark was a much better price than the pulverzied baking forms of cassia cinnamon that cost two or three times the price for only 3-4 oz of product. But, you get what you pay for and this bark is very durable (hard), so it takes awhile but with my Osterizer pulse-matic I can pulverize into granuals that mix with astragalus tea or green tea for a nice morning beverage. Also, this granular form cooks well and is palatable in oatmeal and other hot breakfast meals. Also, bark pieces that I have not broke down are good to put next to my gums, it has a bitter-sweet spicey taste without the nicotine that tobacco use would give. I never was into tobacco use, but hey, maybe someone trying to give up "chew" might try cassia bark as a natural alternative.

review/summary: Wonderful but ridiculously priced
review/text: I was waiting for a friend to check out at a U Penn food court, and she asked if I wanted anything. I rather mindlessly noticed Berkshire Bark in a display stand and handed her a bar, which she paid for. Imagine my shock when I looked it up on Amazon and found this "candy bar" is priced at $5.99! Absolutely wonderful chocolate -- but embarrassingly expensive, especially when it's on a friend's tab! Sorry, but 6 bucks for less than 3 ounces is just ridiculous. I won't be buying my own (but I owe my friend a drink!).

review/summary: Love every one.
review/text: I bought this to be shipped to me in Afghanistan. The packets are packaged in a box, and I use the box as a dispensary. I love that I can ways keep 3-5 packets in my pocket. A few for me, and one or two for whoever happens to notice. These are much more portable than the traditional glass bottles I've had shipped to me before, and a lot less likely to be abused/stolen.<br /><br />I really enjoy the flavor of Tapatio as opposed to other sauces whose main ingredient seems to be vinegar. Just enough heat to let you know it's there, and the flavor compliments everything you put it on. I use it on eggs, pizza, chicken, beef, popcorn, nacho cheese flavored tortilla chips, and even schnitzel, believe it or not.<br /><br />This is one purchase I will definitely do again when the time comes.

review/summary: Yummiest & Freshest Cookies
review/text: Caveman Bakery has made the best tasting, yummiest, freshest gluten free, high protein cookies!  Plus they are lower in calories than most cookies.  They do indeed taste old fashioned.  For those of us sensitive to gluten, they are a<br />great alternative to being able to enjoy a cookie while staying "safe" from gluten or corn products.  I took a couple with me when we went to see Avatar on Christmas - I was very happy to have them while the guys were enjoying eating their<br />popcorn.  This item will be a staple in our home for holidays, special occasions, or going to the movies.<br /><br />I do have one big problem with these cookies.  They are so delish that I have difficulty in only eating two per day.<br /><br />A friend recently told me that she could never follow the strict anti-inflammatory diet that I do.  I told her that I know how bad I felt and it's not worth it to me not to follow it.  That's one big reason why I am so excited about these Caveman Cookies.

review/summary: Perfect for what they should be used for!
review/text: These are a great grain-free treat! I do believe that the fresher the food, the healthier it is for you. And nothing is fresher than making your food from fresh ingredients straight from your kitchen! Sometimes, however, you don't have access to a kitchen. I bought some of these to see if I liked them. (I actually bought the sample packs of all four flavors.) The reason I did so is because I'm going to be in the hospital in a few months attempting a VBAC, but I might be there for more than a few days if the attempt fails and I end up with another c-section. Because I react to even the tiniest bit of all grains, and because I don't trust the people at the hospital to really know how to handle that (although I'm more afraid of grains in meds they will try to give me), it's great to know that I can order a few snacks before hand and bring them with me without having to worry about them going bad or making me sick.<br />So would I recommend eating or buying them for regular consumption? No. But for situations similar to mine I think they are perfect.<br />The cookie itself is of a soft, chewy nature - as one would expect with ingredients like honey and almond flour. Personally, I enjoyed all of the flavors except for the Alpine - but read the ingredients and see if it contains things that you would normally enjoy. I believe this one in particular contains a bit of cinnamon, which combined with the raisins creates a nice cinnamon-oatmeal-raisin sort of flavor (the texture is completely different, obviously). I liked this one the best. The rainforest and the tropical flavors were very good as well, and both of them have a hint of a kick to them due to the pepper and ginger.

review/summary: Great taste but not low cal
review/text: As someone who has gone Paleo diet for weight control reasons as opposed to gluten allergies, I was looking for something that stuck with the restriction of the diet while still offering satisfaction in taste and satiety.  Up till now I have been using coconut flour and other low cal ingredients to tend to that snack/indulgence urge, but its a hassle and prone to heating up the house too much with the oven use.  These cookies come in small, individually wrapped servings, about the size and thickness of a oreo's single waffer.  They are dense and chewy and give a fairly pleasant experience both in mouth feel and taste, in fact they taste IMHO better than most home baked cookies, and even better than what I made for myself.<br /><br />However don't expect them to arrive with a week or so, I guess they make them in small controlled batches (given the individual packaging this wouldn't surprise me) and that takes time.  I tried all 3 and though all were great, I liked the oatmeal raisin the most.  I will definitely keep a few bags of these on hand as I think they should freeze pretty well and I can thaw them in small batches, my only complaint about them is their size and calorie density, for how good they taste, I want to be able to eat a lot more than I should lol.

review/summary: An amazing treat!
review/text: These cookies are great!  We had our first taste when these "Original" cookies were the only Caveman Cookies around, and though we've tried the others our heart still lies with these.  We've stored them in our cupboard for several months and found them to be just as good as when we first opened the package.  Very delicious, and filling if you don't let yourself sit down with the box and absent-mindly munch away.  If you're looking for cookies without all the processed preservatives and only a few, easy-to read ingredients, these cookies are amazing.  If you're looking for a cookie that's cheap, are okay with loads of processed sugar and don't mind an intense ingredients list, then any cookie off the 7-11 shelf will probably be your preferred choice.<br /><br />And if you didn't get this vibe from the other reviews, these are incredibly tasty!

You have to be crazy to spend this kind of money on these things. I'll take the Kashi cookies any day over these. They may be healthier than Kashi but you'll tire of Caveman real quick and I still have some in the fridge because they're horrible and I can't even finish them off. Dr. Oz recommended these cookies and it cost me $40 bucks to find out I hate them. Save your money and buy KASHI. Enjoy a real cookie for God's sake. I can't believe this company can stay in business with these overpriced novelties.

Also the images make them look larger than they are.  They basically fit in the palm of your hand.<br /><br />If you are looking for something similar to a Kashi cookie I would try these.  If you are looking for something on parity to a homemade cookie, don't count on it.

review/text: Don't get me wrong, I still love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HXQPG2">Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</a>, but after trying these there is a definite difference in how they're processed. When I first tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAQ8V6">Nectar Nugget Peanut Butter Cup</a> I was surprised at how smooth and creamy the peanut butter was - imagine a spoonful taken right from a jar. This is not at all like the firm, grainy, very sweet filling of the Reese's cup. In addition the chocolate was very good, in fact it begins to melt in your hand the minute you remove it from the wrapper, which is why I'd suggest eating it out of the wrapper. These were definitely a treat and something I'm glad I was able to try while they were on special here on Amazon, but unless Amazon restocks them or I am able to find them locally, I probably won't be buying them again anytime soon at the current 3rd party pricing. I would definitely pay a premium for these, but anything more than $15 a box is too much in my opinion.

review/text: Several years ago in a Target grocery aisle far, far away I found Maxwell House International Cafe Pumpkin Spice latte. (Formerly General Foods International Coffees. Remember the "Jean Luc" commercial? Yes, that stuff.) It was a limited edition flavor... it was on clearance... I bought all the tins that remained... even the one with the huge dent. This stuff was that good. Then it was gone and all I had left was a single empty tin to remind me that this flavor wasn't something I only imagined or conjured up in a dream. Now it is finally back! It has a different formula that becomes distinctly frothier but it tastes just as mmm, mmm good as I remember.

review/summary: Disappointing coffee
review/text: After reading the other reviews and discovering that the Pumpkin Spice Latte was no longer available in the grocery stores, I thought I had truly missed out on a great new flavor.  Well after receiving my six cans, at almost ten bucks a can, I can honestly say the only flavor I taste is sugar!  Hmmm, could this be because sugar is the first ingredient listed?  I was expecting a pumpkin spice taste, but it's just not there.  In fact, the "coffee" is so bland I'm considering adding a teaspoon or two to a cup of my regular coffee just so the entire order isn't a bust.  What a disappointment!

review/summary: The taste of fall all year round
review/text: I personally always look forward to the fall, the weather changes, the holidays are just around the corner, and of course pumpkin spice makes a comeback.  If you are like me and are constantly craving pumpkin spice this is a great product.  I love latte's and this is a convenient way to cure my cravings without leaving the house.  The only real downside to the product is that it's a little high in sugar (8g per 1 1/3 tbsp), but other than that its a great product.  It reminds me of fall, and its great to have it year round.  This is definitely a great addition to your coffee for that extra punch of flavor.

review/summary: Where's the pumpkin spice?
review/text: I got this a few weeks ago and I have to say, I almost think I've wasted my money. This is just an incredibly disappointing drink.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this, so it's not like I was expecting this to taste like a freshly made professional drink or even a cup of pumpkin spice coffee from Wawa. I expected something that would taste good but more importantly I was expecting something that actually had the taste of pumpkin spice to it. I didn't get that in this drink. It's decent enough to where I'm willing to bring it to work and let my coworkers drink it (I'm not mean enough to bring nasty tasting things for them to finish off), but it's definitely something that I know I won't be finishing off on my own.<br /><br />My recommendation is that if you absolutely must try this drink, wait for it to go on sale. I like some of the other drinks MHI puts out, but this was just disappointing.

review/summary: Spicier than 7-11's Pumpkin Latte
review/text: I found this product online after deciding that keeping 7-11 in business single-handedly with my pumpkin latte addiction wasn't the best choice for my wallet. I'd read online that this is the same mix that 7-11 uses-but it's a lie! This mix has much more spice in it (or maybe I just got a bad batch), and since I'm technically allergic to cinnamon, I can't really enjoy this. I'm bummed out because now I have I bunch of unopened tins of the stuff. I'm thinking of making care packages just to give them away.

review/summary: Leaks
review/text: I have breastfeed two children and have tried every breast milk storage bag on the market and after trying them all I landed on lansinoh storage bags and used them for 2 years with my first child. After I had my second child I decided to look into the market again to see if there was a better bag for reasons: better for enviroment, cost effective and no leaks. Well I tried the honey suckle brand because they were everything I was looking for with very good reviews so I bought 300 bags.<br /><br />Well im terribly disapppointed, THEY LEAK! I have had them leak by just setting them on the table the bottom seal pops open, during thawing process, and ive had a few that were thawed and placed in fridge and all of the sudden started leaking for no reason. Evertime it is the bottom seal.<br /><br />I tried to contact the company by email several times to let them know of the problem im having so they can hopefully prevent this problem for furture customers but no response..<br /><br />In the 300 bags I purchased probably 100 leaked, some I could save some milk while others lost all which is very furstrating

review/summary: Great bag
review/text: I like these better than the lansinoh ones which are the only other ones I've tried. The bags feel thicker, more sturdy, etc. Seal well, double zip lock seems secure. The bags being a little thicker, they freeze nicer. I lay them flat to freeze, but with the Lansinoh bags, I felt like they were too soft and deformed during the freezing process which makes them hard to stack later for storage. I don't have that problem with these bags. We haven't had any issues with thawing milk in these bags either. The price is good, especially in the bulk package so I'm a happy customer.<br /><br />Just wanted to update, I've been using these for 3 months now, and am still very happy with the result.

The bags are durable, tamper proof and has a place for me to write the name, date and amount.  I am back at work and I use these bags every day.  When I'm low, I will definitely be buying more along with the baby food storage too.

review/text: I've been using these bags for only three weeks now, and so far no complaints. They seal easily, haven't leaked yet, quality feel and thickness, and can either stand up or lie flat in the freezer. They are larger than I thought - can hold up to six ounces. Although, I do wonder if the oz count is correct - I pump into marked bottles (from two different manufacturers) and when I transfer the milk into the bag, it usually shows a larger volume based on the ounce markers than the bottles. But it doesn't bother me at all. Also - hard to beat this price, I compared a lot of different milk storage bags before buying.

So far I had only one bag that leaked out of 30 or so, which is very impressive. Although i don't know if the bag leaks when you thou the milk in the fridge, since "Lansinoh" brand had this problem most of the time. Overall very happy with product.

review/text: My daughter has had some issues with failure to thrive and other medical conditions. Because of this, I couldn't keep up with her demand and had to do something. We were fortunate enough to find some amazing women willing to donate milk to my daughter. We had been buying bags for our donors to store the milk in and finally, after buying a box here and a box there, I decided to look into some bulk options.<br /><br />I found these bags and I was a little skeptical but have been pleasantly surprised! When we go to thaw the milk, we have had far fewer leaky bags with the honeysuckle bags than with lansinoh or medela bags! Anyone who has used thawed milk knows exactly how tragic a leaky bag can be!<br /><br />Great bags and a great price!

review/text: I wish I had discovered these bags 5 months ago!  I have tried the Medela (too small, stiff plastic, spill easily) and the Lanisnoh (frequent leaks) and was desperate for a milk storage solution that wouldn't take up our entire freezer (i.e, glass bottles).  The Honeysuckle bags arrived sooner than expected and I put them to use immediately.  After 3 weeks of use I can say I'm impressed - the plastic is much more flexible that the other brands I've tried, making defrosting much less of a gamble.  I feel less concerned that a frozen milk chunk will penetrate the bag and the seams appear stronger than the Lanisnoh. The size is great (I store 4-5oz at a time), and there is plenty of room to mark the date and amount. Great product!

The new bags do have a spot for volume to be written.<br />Also the bags were shipped in a very discrete brown box with no extra writing on them to say breastmilk bags, so that was nice.<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />I was introduced to these bags when I started donating extra breastmilk. All I have to say is OMG sooo awesome. I wish they were available in stores. Previously I was using Lansinoh and I had sooo many leaky bags. I felt so bad for my daycare because it seemed like every other bag I was bringing them were springing leaks. I haven't had a single leaky bag with these.<br />Yes there is limited writing room in the official spaces, but there is plenty of room above the boxes to write in the volume or whatever else you want to write.<br />If you are looking for bags, buy these! I've tried all the other ones and these are the only ones I haven't had problems with. And yes, I have completely filled them with 14ounces of milk and haven't had any problems with freezing or thawing.

review/text: Previous to the Honeysuckle my wife was using the Lansinoh bags.  I remember some issues with the Lansinoh bags rupturing while she would thaw the frozen milk so we decided to try a different product when our second child arrived.  My wife is pumping exclusively and ever since we started using the Honeysuckle I think we only had 1 or 2 occasions where the bag leaked.  What is particularly nice about these bags is that they are biodegradable.  It makes us feel good to know that we are using a product that is environmentally friendly.

review/summary: less than 1% leak
review/text: For those of us that express milk like cows, the most important quality in a breastmilk bag has got to be limited leaking. Any bag is going to leak if it gets bumped around too much or folds improperly while freezing. Out of over 120 of these bags used, I have had one leak. Less than 1% leaking is acceptable to me.<br /><br />The other bag I would recommend is Simplisse (http://www.amazon.com/Simplisse-Breastmilk-Storage-Bags-Pack/dp/B00363M0Q0), which are double-walled. I have used over 50 of those and one has leaked.<br /><br />Both types store flat in the freezer, which is a huge plus. (I used Medela with my first baby, and these did not lay flat.)

review/summary: Nice bags!
review/text: These bags seem very thick and strong. The bottoms are reinforced. I've never had a leak (but I do not freeze a lot of milk). Every bag is sealed at the top and you have to remove the plastic top where it's perforated, which gives me peace of mind that each bag is sterile. The measuring on the front is accurate, but you must expand the bottom of the bag to get the accurate reading. There's not a designated spot for volume (which is nice for freezing flat) but there's plenty of writable space to put it if you want.<br /><br />I don't freeze a lot - my daughter goes to daycare 6 hours a day so I usually just send in the fresh milk that I pumped the day before. At the end of the week, if there is milk leftover besides the milk I pumped on Friday (to use on Monday), I freeze it. I really like these bags and will continue to buy them if I need more.

review/text: I first was introduced to these bags through their free sample. I've been pumping/freezing milk for 11 months as well as nursing. I started with the Lansinoh� Breastmilk Storage Bags because they were available in the store to me. I had SEVERAL leaky bags and lost close to 50 ounces of milk. Anyone who is nursing knows this is a heartbreak. I switched over to Honeysuckle bags and have had NO leaks. The plastic is thicker and more durable. I freeze mine flat then put them upright for storage. They thaw quickly and store easily. These bags i would HIGHLY recommend and have bought many as shower gifts. I also love they are a small business and their customer service is quick and friendly. LOVE YOU HONEYSUCKLE!

review/summary: Great storage bag...HIGHLY recommended
review/text: I searched for breast milk storage bags for months prior to deciding on which ones to get & I am super happy that these are the ones I bought!  I asked my sister who used Lansinoh if she ever had any leak & she had quite a few that did, just like a lot of other people stated in their reviews.  When I bought some Lansinoh nursing pads, they had 2 of their bags inside & you can tell a HUGE difference in the quality.  They both claim to have a "double zipper", but only the Honeysuckle bags hold true to that.  The Lansinoh bags has one decent zipper & a line, I wouldn't even constitute as a zipper.  With these Honeysuckle bags, I have not had ANY leak out of the 300 bags (& 6 months later) I have filled & used.  Yea, there is no designated space to write the ounces, but there is plenty of space above the name & date.  I write the amount on the tip of the "bottle" on the bag.  Has worked great.<br /><br />Also the company had super fast shipping which I was originally worried about it taking a week or two to arrive, but they were at my house within 3-5 days of me placing the order.  Would recommend to anyone & I plan on buying a whole bunch more!

review/summary: NO LEAKS!!!
review/text: After losing so much breast milk while using the Lansinoh brand bags, someone turned me on to this brand. I'd never heard of them before, but am so, so glad I did. They are wonderful, they hold large amounts of milk very well, are sturdy and thick and so far, I've never had a problem with them leaking. I'm so happy I found these, I'll never buy another Lansinoh bag again.

review/summary: Love these bags!
review/text: I have been EBF for 5.5 months and pumping a bottle a day as well. I have gone through LOTS of these bags and never experienced a leak. I love how there is a three tear system to get into the bag and they are very sturdy. The main reason I bought them was because they are recyclable and biodegradable! This is a big concern of mine. I donate milk and have never heard bad things about these bags from my milk bank or donors.

review/summary: Great alternative to Lansinoh
review/text: I got some hand-me-down Lansinoh breastmilk bags when I went back to work three months after my little one was born, and after the third leak I decided to start looking for an alternative. These fit the bill perfectly--no leaks so far, and I love the fact that they're biodegradable.

review/text: I have used several other brands but none compare to Honey Suckle. I received a free sample and since then I haven't even thought about buying another brand. They are easy to use and do not leak like others I've tried. When DS is eating foods I'll try the baby food bags.

review/summary: The best
review/text: So much easier to close than the Medela ones. I love these. So glad I got them. The only downside is they kind of slouch over more in the freezer but that really hasn't mattered all that much.

review/text: I loved these bags when I was breastfeeding. The are so much better than the Lansinoh brand. They hold more volume and the material is stronger (will not bust in the freezer).
