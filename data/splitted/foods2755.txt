review/summary: Actually quite fun.
review/text: I bought this for my wife who's an HP fan; all the while thinking "what-the-crap".<br />But I found it to be quite fun to pick one at random and trying to guess what the crap you just put in your mouth.<br />There are "normal" jelly beans and special "weird" flavor jelly beans; these smaller boxes contain mostly weird ones - a larger box that I purchased (outside of amazon) had a more balanced variety between the two kinds.

review/summary: Authentic - enjoyed by wizards AND muggles
review/text: Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!

review/summary: Great gag gift
review/text: This is a great gag gift. I got a big kick out of this with my friends and my co-workers. Most people I offered them to seemed put off by the possibility of getting a bad flavor jelly bean, but eventually curiosity got the better of them and they couldn't resist trying one.<br /><br />I had the displeasure of getting "earthworm" and "earwax" myself. Yes, they tasted absolutely horrible. But that's the point! It's fun to try the jelly beans out to see if they really are as disgusting as you might imagine.<br /><br />There are some good flavors in there too, but most of them are gross and fun. :p<br /><br />It's a great conversation starter. It's fun to see who is risk-averse and who will try anything.

review/text: I ordered these to have at my son's Harry Potter birthday party.  The kids had fun eating them and trying to guess what "nasty" flavor each one was.  However, the two boxes are extremely small and I would not pay the almost $9 +shipping for them again.  If I had known how small the boxes were (I honestly did not check size before purchasing-lesson learned!) I would not have bought them.  I had to be very skimpy with the kids on how many they could try so that each child got to eat a couple-and we only had 10 kids there!  Fun, but pricey!

review/text: I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office.  Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

review/summary: MMMMM....Chocolate....
review/text: I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister. I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

review/summary: Good, but Amazon has the flavor names wrong
review/text: Flavor names vs flavor photos are pretty confusing. I ordered "Rich Chocolate" and received "Rich Milk Chocolate". Now that I tasted it it's fine and I realize it's very possible that Nestle stopped making Rich Choc and started these Rich Milk / Rich Dark items, but Amazon should really fix the flavor names so that it's clear what you're getting.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

review/summary: Morning Comfort
review/text: My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

review/text: I use this product mixed with chocolate or vanilla Soy Slender, which also has 30% calcium, 25% D, and 7 g fiber.  Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.<br /><br />And I will be happy to answer M "M" about why.  This is four (4) canisters so it's not that expensive.  The other reason, besides it is good, is that those grocery stores you speak of don't have it. It has become very hard to find.  I can't find it at all any longer and am very happy to order a supply at Amazon.

review/text: I have long loved this hot cocoa but each year it gets harder and harder to find. Amazon's price is quite the bargain.<br /><br />Like a review posted upthread, I have tried several different hot cocoas including Ghirardelli and Godiva, both of which are great. However, this cocoa is my fave. I love the Butterfinger flavor and it really does taste like they dropped the candy bar in your mug. Because of Amazon's economical price, I am a little more willing to share this product at work and I must say, everyone has fallen in love with it.

review/summary: Good hot cocoa mix, but....
review/text: I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br />This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we've<br />never had before.  My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,<br />but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".

review/text: I purchased this pack of 4 because the size is perfect for my husband to take to work. He loves this brand of cocoa with the rich milk chocolate taste. He likes to mix it with his French press coffee and make a poor man's mocha. Tastes great and saves us money!

review/text: Always my favorite, but getting harder and harder to find.  Used to come in the 28 ounce canisters, now only the 7.33 ounce canisters.  I wish they'd bring back the larger canisters.

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.

review/text: I've been using Nestle's Fat Free Hot Cocoa Mix in the small envelopes for years and loved it.  When my store discontinued it, I searched on line and discovered I could get it in the canisters at a much lower price.  Only one problem, I use so much more now.

review/text: I no longer need to search for a canister of Nestles hot cocoa. As the stores that carry it dwindled, I became more and more frustrated. Now, I know where I can find it at the tip of my fingers. I did have to buy 4, but that was no problem, as I share it with family members who were having the same problem.

review/summary: Nestle's Hot Chocolate Disappeared!
review/text: I had been purchasing these large cans of Nestle's Hot Chocolate all through last winter and even the summer months at my local grocery store. In the fall they stopped carrying the item.  I checked at several grocery stores with the same results.  I was surprised to see Amazon had the item. I placed my order and it arrived within the week. Very satisfied with the item and the service I received.

review/summary: Best Fat Free Hot Chocolate
review/text: I was so excited when I found amazon selling the Nestle Hot Chocolate.  We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether.  It was very disappointing.  It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate.  As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.

review/text: great purchase.  I live alone, and am the only one drinking this... wish that i could have bought it in a small size package.  Hopefully I will go through it all before the expiration date.  It is wonderful to know that you can have a "zero" point weight watchers snack in the evening.... It felt like having dessert without the guilt.  It mixes well, and was creamy and chocolately.  I would recommend to all!!

review/text: I also LOVE this stuff!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe Nestle's has stopped making it.<br /><br />I actually wrote them TWO letters.  They replied that the sales numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the continued production of it.<br /><br />I just can't believe this.  I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

The packets don't have enough in them to make a great cup of hot chocolate, so this canister is perfect as you can put in the amount you want to make the taste perfect!  Stores here don't carry this canister anymore so thank you Amazon!  Wish was a bit cheaper though!

review/summary: A delicious cocoa mix
review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

review/text: This is such a good hot cocoa mix with more flavor than most because of the "double chocolate". I'm frustrated because I haven't been able to find it in the grocery stores any more. So I ordered a whole case from Amazon. Hooray for Amazon!
