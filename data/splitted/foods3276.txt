review/text: I have been looking for this item since last winter. My store stopped carrying it (and I shop at four different grocery stores)I'm so glad I found it here. This is so very rich and smooth, I like the flavor but wish it came in a dark chocolate flavor. And I really agree about the coffee, it makes it so much better. Most cocoa mixes are like drinking colored water, this is so good and you don't need milk to get the thick and rich balance. LOOOOOVE IT !!!

review/summary: My baby's favorite
review/text: All of the Sprout brand baby foods we have tried so far have been a big hit with baby, but this is his favorite (of Sprout brand or any other).  He tries to grab the pouch & the spoon as soon as he gets a taste, and is grunting for me to feed it to him faster.  I also really appreciate that there are no additives here - it is just pears.<br /><br />I am not really big on the pouch design because when they are little & not eating entire pouches early on, it is a mess to spoon out & reseal leftovers.  It is also difficult to get all of the food out because of the way the pouch is designed.  But since it is baby's favorite, I am still giving it 5 stars.

review/summary: High sodium + sugar, but tasty
review/text: I like the taste of this broth. As a longtime vegetarian, I cannot say how much it tastes like chicken, as I haven't had chicken in decades. I really don't care if it tastes like chicken, I just like a variety of vegetarian flavors. This flavor could be called "yellow" (and Frontier's beef flavored broth could be called "brown"), it still tastes good to me. This is a quick, savory broth mix, that satisfies an urge for something hot and salty. I liked this and was going to buy more until I checked the nutritional stats. If you aren't too concerned about nutritional value, you may like it too.<br /><br />But the salt is the problem. I use about 2.66 tablespoons of broth powder (2 Tbs + 2 tsps) to make a cup of about 10 ounces of broth. It comes to 1400 mg of sodium. I am not on a low sodium diet, but I keep track, and my daily allotment of healthy sodium intake is 2300 mg (based on a 2000 calorie a day diet). So one bowl of this broth uses more than half (60%) a whole day's worth of salt!<br /><br />It also has 4 grams of sugar in the above described serving. My 10 ounce bowl has almost no other nutritional value, no vitamins, no protein, and 80 calories. For me, this is not a food that should be a pantry staple, it just isn't nutritionally worth consuming. I'd really worry about giving this regularly to anyone with high blood pressure concerns.<br /><br />This broth is good, but not so good I can't give it up for healthier choices. It could be an occasional treat, but it really isn't great enough to be a splurge food. I'd rather indulge in pizza or nachos once in a while and otherwise eat lower salt foods.

review/text: We have three dogs and each one has digestive problems.  We have always fed Blue since it contains quality ingredients, is considered to be holistic and doesn't contain corn, wheat, soy or by-product meals.  Finally, after years of dealing with inconsistent, runny stools, we decided to try Pro Plan Sensitive S&S.  Once we switched, the stools immediately improved.  Blue is a wonderful brand which contains quality ingredients however, since our dogs need something that is easier to digest, this is second on the list.  We didn't buy from Amazon but bought from a local pet store.

I switched both to this after noticing the Science Diet sensitive skin/stomach was passing through mostly undigested (it's corn-based) and wasn't "curing" their problems. It's been two years and the digestive and skin problems are gone and their coats are beautiful. I get it from Petsmart and avoid the steep shipping charges listed here.

review/summary: best dog food for our dog
review/text: for a dog with horrible gas and almost 6yrs old, this food is a blessing. I read the comments left for this petfood and thought we would give it a try and see if it worked. Since we started giving it to Ruby I have not heard any awful gas noises or smells. Thank you for making the air smell better and Ruby to be able to digest food better. Definitely a keeper.I must say after using this dog food for a month that Ruby will always be on this food. It is the very best food that I have ever found. Not only does it take care of the gas problem but she gobbles it up. So good to find a dog food that she not only enjoys but is good for her too. The rescue people said she looks great. So we must be doing something right.

review/text: My dog used to have to wear a E-collar most of the time as otherwise he would bite himself raw.  The bites would get inflected and he would have to be put on meds to clear them up.  The local pet store suggested this food for dogs with skin problems.  I also add fish oil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABR6E">Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser, 32 Ounces</a> to the food.  Since the dog food is made from fish it does smell like fish so it is best to keep it in a closed container. It took awhile, but as long as I keep the dog on this diet, he no longer has skin allergies. Amazon has a good price on this product as it is much cheaper that what the pet store charges.

review/summary: Finally Izzy has healthy poots
review/text: I know feeding my dog Purina is controversial. Well, I've fed her the expensive stuff, solid gold, Canidae, blue buffalo, etc. Izzy is a rescue dog who was about 15 months when we got her. From almost day one  for the last five years. she had stomach issues and allergies. About once a month she'd get colitis and have horrible mucous poo. I know, gross, imagine how we felt. She is beautifully house trained but the poor thing would be whining by the door, running out, having horrible runs. Around Thanksgiving of last year she got really sick to the point of being clinically dehydrated. We took her to the vet and she had to be hydrated with the fluid under her skin. Many dollars of tests later and they still had no idea, she didn't have worms, Pancreatic infection etc, we had a whole lot of what she didn't have. I was desperate and did a web search for food made in the USA for dogs with stomach issues.<br /><br />We started feeding her the Purina the first of Dec. She has had one, one bout of diarrhea since then, and I think it's because I gave her some duck liver at christmas and her tummy just can't handle any rich food. Between the Purina Pro Plan and the tsp of active culture yogurt daily she is doing great. Her coat is shiny, she gained a pound, she has energy and she has stopped the once or twice a month diarrhea episodes.<br /><br />Purina Pro Plan sensitive stomach has really worked for Izzy. She is healthy, happy, and her stools are nice and solid. I wish we had tried it years ago, but I was put off by all the bad press Purina has. I don't know about the rest of their products, but I recommend this to anyone who's dog is not doing well with other foods.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK4K50">Newman's Own�Organics Advanced Cat Chicken & Rice Dry Formula, 76-Ounce Bag</a><br />I buy only this cat food for my cat. He has finally stopped throwing up since I changed to this. The nuggets are hard and he has to chew them up. That slows him down. His sister can eat any cat food with no trouble. She has better manners.

review/summary: My Kitty Loves This Food
review/text: I know the front label says this food is for senior cats but my sphynx kitten is very active and this is also for active cats, so I figured I'd give it a try. I made a mixture of half Newman's Own Advanced with half of Kitten Chow (for the required kitten essentials!) and my kitty loves it. I like how this is organic and the nibbles are nice and hard to promote healthy teeth. I've also noticed my kitty's poop isn't stinky anymore because this food is of much better quality than the other so-called premium cat foods I've tried before. Tip: If you're feeding your cat a dry food mix and its poop stinks it usually indicates its poor quality - so upgrade. I'm going to continue feeding my kitty the mixture and once he's an adult I may switch over to feeding him just this exclusively.

review/summary: Good for my Cat!
review/text: With all the worries about recalled pet food I wanted something I could trust. I put it on auto-ship which lowers the price a little. My cat goes through one bag in a little more than a month and the whole thing will fit in her feeder (very convenient). She isn't a picky eater like other reviewers cats (although she turns her nose up at canned cat food), but she seems to like it just fine. When I received my first bag I wasn't about to do a taste test, but I did the sniff test. The organic smelled fresh and...well...like cat food, but the new IAMS bag smelled musty and sort of rancid. Shortly after when I was still weaning her off the IAMS cat food, I had an invasion of ants. Both open bags were under the sink in the laundry room and they went for the organic but didn't come near the IAMS. Maybe they know something we don't???

review/summary: Okay cat food but too expensive at Amazon
review/text: I switched to this cat food when it became available at my local supermarket (Publix) for $9 per 3-pound bag.  Compared to others, I thought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIUYA">Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula, 3-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> was a little pricey but I didn't mind spending more for an organic cat food. My cat wasn't thrilled with the switch but she eventually took to it but without the relish she had for the others.<br /><br />Now that my cat has adjusted to it and I can get it easily enough at my supermarket, I'll probably stick with Newmans' and purchase it there. But I will definitely NOT buy it at Amazon!  It is way too expensive here which really surprises me.  Even the Subscribe and Save deal is no bargain.<br /><br />So my final words are ~ this is not a bad organic cat food but it is way too overpriced at Amazon.

My red tabby male had a penchant for upchucking his food and this has put a stop to that. The pellets are small and hard and they seem to love crunching on them. I also mix Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula with small amounts of other dry cat food as treats for them. This is premium cat food and I love the packaging's very effective zip lock and the graphics to. I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics.

review/text: I've had my cat for about 7 years and have had an issue with her vomiting for all 7.  I've tried sensitive stomach foods, indoor cat foods, hard vs. dry food, etc.  However, I've never purchased a pricier food for her.  With her vomiting about once a week now at least, I finally gave in and decided to try this and have been very pleasantly surprised.  First, she's only been eating it for about 2.5 weeks but so far, no vomit.  Second, she loves it and this is a cat that hates catnip, won't drink milk, won't eat soft food anymore and won't eat most other types of food.  The added bonus is that her coat is amazing!  She is so soft now and her coat is shinier than its ever been.  I definitely recommend at least trying this food.  I've stocked up on it!

She had been on Science Diet "oral care" for years and seemed to do well on it, except for not being able to keep it down 2-4 times per month. Apparently the problem was indeed the corn products and chemicals in Science Diet and other foods.  This 11 year old Siamese loves the organic Newman's and keeps it down.  Hooray!

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Food
review/text: Bless Paul Newman's heart. His services to the Feline Community are immeasurable. With four four-legged family members, health is an important issue. Two of my Kitties had difficulties eating 'ordinary' cat food. Allergies and even apathy ensued and I switched to 'Blue Buffalo' food. That worked for about six month. After this period my Cats wouldn't want to eat this food anymore. (Later I heard they had a recall...)<br />since I feed my rascals Newman's 'Own Organics Advanced Cat Food', the allergy and apathy of my two darlings has receded. Their fur coat is shinier than ever before. My Feline children lost weight and they eat less of the Organics Food, than they did of the 'Franken Cat Food and even Blue Buffalo. For all of those who like to be sure that they give their beloved critters only the best possible food without breaking the bank, I recommend to subscribe to Newman's and thus get it to the same price or even cheaper than the Frankencatfood.<br />Thank You Paul Newman for all You did to humanity and its pets and equally a big Mahalo (Thank You) to Nell Newman for keeping the family business in the spirit of her father. Newman's Own is the best. Period. (No, I don't get money for writing this;)

review/text: All of my six cats love Newman's Own Organic foods. I feed them the dry food and the canned. It's a bit more expensive than the other stuff, but it is organic. That means it doesn't contain any of the 'frankenmeat' that is in other non-organic pet foods. I know that I'm not giving them any of the 4-D meat (dead, diseased, dying, decayed) present in other non-organic pet foods. Google 4-D meats to learn what is in the usual brands. The extra cost is worth it because I don't need to deal with the expense of urinary tract infections and skin problems.

review/summary: Newman's Own makes my cats purr.
review/text: The two rescue cats who adopted me were both about four years old. Both had been surrendered, separately, by their owners and became best pals at the shelter.  When they agreed to come home with me, I began researching the best foods to feed indoor cats.  Books were ordered, articles were researched and we discussed, the cats and I, if I should begin preparing their food myself in order to make sure they got the nutrients they deserved.  I read the labels of almost every dry and canned cat food on the shelves of pet stores and grocery stores.  Then, I found a bag of Newman's Own on the shelf of my local grocery story.  I read the label and found this to be the first and the ONLY cat food whose ingredients matched those recommended by vets and authors. Better still, I could order the food through the Amazon subscription service and have it delivered to my door.  My mature, loving cats are healthy, happy, full of energy, have grown incredible whiskers and we couldn't be more pleased.  The cats experimented with both dry and canned Newman's Own and have settled on a daily combination that seems to work.  They now purr when the package arrives at the door each month -- and they clean their plates every day.  As their caregiver, I'd give Newman's Own cat food -- dry and canned -- the highest marks, and its availabilty spared my refrigerator and freezer from being filled with frozen packages of home-prepared cat food.

review/summary: Looks healthy but cat won't eat it
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this cat food is that it doesn't smell horrendous. I poured some into my cat's food bowl and she ran over and started devouring it. She didn't do that with the other brands I've given her (IAMS, Hill's science diet, the goodlife recipe). She seems to really like this food and she hasn't thrown it up. I'm not a vet so I don't know how nutritionally sound this product is, but it lists a lot of organic ingredients and it has chicken as one of the first ingredients. I'll post pictures of the bag with that information. I know Newman's Own is a quality brand (I use their pasta sauces and salad dressing) so I imagine this product is high quality as well. It sure seems to be.<br /><br />Update 8-16-12: My cat does not seem to like it anymore after the first week. I mixed it with her old food and she picks around to avoid the Newman's Own pellets. I tried putting just Newman's Own in one dish and the other cat food in another. She won't eat the Newman's Own when it's separate either. I guess she prefers the cheaper cat food.

review/summary: Delicious AND nutritious!
review/text: Okay, I am usually a bit wary of most breakfast "cookies" or "bars," as the nutritional profile tends to be pretty poor.  I think it is important to get protein and fiber with breakfast, so if I want a bar, I'll reach for something like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007D6DVPA">Luna Nutrition Bar, Blueberry Bliss</a>.<br /><br />I first decided to try BelVita Breakfast "Biscuits" because I had a coupon.  When I checked them out in the store, I was impressed to see that the nutritional profile was actually decent:  these cookies (for that is really what they are) provide 4 grams of protein (could be better, but not bad), 3 grams of fiber, and 18 grams of whole grain.  They are lower in sugar than most other bars (13 grams), and although the fat content is a bit high at 8 grams, there is only a trace of saturated fat (.5 grams).<br /><br />I was also surprised to see that you get a generous four biscuits per serving (they are thin, but good-sized).  The best part, however, is that these biscuits are delicious!!!  They are crispy and buttery-tasting, with bits of real blueberries in every bit.  I admit, these aren't my absolute healthiest breakfast (I'll usually have a little plain, non-fat yogurt along with them), but as an occasional treat, they are a yummy, guilt-free indulgence.

review/summary: Perfect Breakfast Food
review/text: I've been a faithful follower of a massive muffin for breakfast for years and did not believe that there was any satisfying yet healthy alternative out there to switch to. Well this is it!!! They are just as other reviewers describe. I would also add the following: there are 4 cookies, and blueberry is somewhat chewier than other flavors. By the time you get to the forth one, you are about done with "chewing" and are no longer hungry. Most other breakfast bars do not get it right - you are done in few bites and are left feeling hungry until the calories "kick-in." Belvita has only 230 calories and it does last for 3-4 hours. Finally, these cookies are loaded with fiber, I will not elaborate, but it works. I've been on Belvita for several months and do not have any need/interest in switching to 600+ calorie muffins :)

review/summary: "Breakfast Biscuit" AKA How to eat cookies at 8am and not feel too guilty
review/text: Nabisco is stressing the heck out of the claimed health benefits of Belvita. Whole grain! Natural! Fiber & Vitamins! Nutritious Sustained Energy! They talk about the last one like it's trademarked. If you check the website, the product claims to be specifically made with carbohydrates that slowly release over the course of 4 hours. To their credit, these "biscuits" (I can't in good conscience leave the quotes out) do a pretty good job in that respect. I don't know if it's because they honestly formulated it well or a placebo effect because that's what I was hoping it would do. In any event, it did curb my appetite for a while, and they taste great.<br /><br />Really great, actually. When you open the package, the blueberry scent is very strong, and the taste matches that intensity well. I appreciate the use of real dried fruit. If anything, they might be a little too sweet. Looking at the calories after eating them makes a lot of sense. Each serving contains 4 pieces, which add up to 230 calories. So that's about 60 calories per piece-pretty steep! But if they keep their word on staving off hunger for a few hours (in my case, yes) then they're not empty calories you would get with something like eating a handful of Oreos. The vitamins are a let down, though. You only get 10% of your daily required on just a few things, which is far far less than a cereal bar (or, you know, actual cereal). So if you can limit yourself to one pack at a time, they make a pretty good hold over snack until your next meal.

review/summary: Great for those with dairy allergies (and lactose intolerant, too)
review/text: I grabbed these today, one of those running late days- skipped breakfast and found myself starving. I have a dairy allergy*, and it was the first of 10 or so "breakfast " items that I checked in the aisle that didn't contain milk ingredients.  I immediately regretted my decision when I got back to the office, because I actually looked at the box- not just the ingredients- and it looked pretty unappetizing. When I opened the pack, I smelled blueberries, and the pieces in the cookie seemed to be actual blueberries!  They tasted great, it reminded me of the blueberry muffins I used to get from Dunkin Donuts.  Granted, I haven't had dairy products in forever, and consequently cant eat most fast food or prepackaged stuff, so they may not taste as great to someone who can have the real thing- but they are the perfect thing to have on hand for mornings like today, or when my family gets donuts so I can pretend its a muffin.  Waaaa allergies suck.<br /><br />*note to people with allergies, it DOES contain wheat and soy, so not gluten free

review/summary: Blueberry Thrill
review/text: The Belvitas are similar to the Nabisco Fruit Thins, only better. One of the first things I checked on was the blueberry content. Yes, dried blueberries are in there unlike in some other products called blueberry that only contain some other kind of fruit and blueberry flavoring.<br /><br />The Belvita (beautiful life?) biscuits come four in a package with plenty of little blueberry bits to add some delightful chewy texture to the biscuit crunch. There's a lot to like about this product: the good taste, the wholesome ingredients, whole grains as the first ingredient, the lack of artificial undesirables, the nutritional content and that all important degree of satisfaction. I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors in the Belvita biscuits line.

review/summary: It's Really a Cookie!
review/text: These are tasty and I am enjoying one with my morning coffee break while I write this, but reading the nutrition facts and the ingredients list on the package, I have to think that this is more of a tasty and somewhat healthy cookie than a substitute for breakfast. According to the package, a serving is four biscuits which adds up to 230 calories. Though that includes 4 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, it also includes 13 grams of sugar and 8 grams of fat.<br /><br />They are good, tasting like a nice butter cookie with a blueberry aroma and a hint of blueberry flavor. Still, I think I'll be more likely to have one from time to time as a little treat with my morning coffee or after dinner than to substitute a package for breakfast. There I'd more likely chose a low-fat fruit yogurt which would have more than twice the protein, less sugar and fat, and less calories.

review/summary: Satisfying
review/text: Love these biscuits for all the reasons the other reviewers have stated. But what surprised me the most was that they passed the test with my label-reading daughter. She thought I had ordered something to replace pop tarts, but after giving the label a going-over, she was satisfied to the point of trying them herself. Now she also loves them. This must be what goes on in other households, too, since now they've become so popular all flavors have been out of stock (via Amazon) the past two weeks.<br /><br />The Oat flavor is currently in stock, but priced at almost 26 dollars for the same package of 3 I paid 12 dollars for. Please take price into consideration when you place your order.

review/text: I found these at the drug store yesterday. It was 5pm, I hadn't had anything to eat and my body was not happy.  This was the best "health" choice I could find. I bought them with the anticipation that they would be dry and brittle, like most breakfast biscuits are.<br /><br />I cannot believe how delicious the biscuits were. They were not overly dry. I could taste the blueberries.  A package of 3 bars contains a whopping 18g of whole grains as well as some B vitamins.  Overall, a good choice on the go.<br /><br />I will be buying these in the future!

review/summary: Breakfast in a hurry
review/text: On my days off I have plenty of time to prepare eggs, but on workdays I need to guzzle my coffee and get moving. I feel guilty about not getting a proper breakfast and it doesn't help that my appetite doesn't really kick in until well after my second cup. Belvita has handily solved my problem. These things are sweet but not too sweet to face first thing in the morning, and they are awesome for dunking. You have to be careful though, they have a brittle texture that breaks easily, so if a piece falls into your cup it will dissolve before you can fish it out again. Not conducive to a good morning when that happens. I've gotten into a habit of checking the bikkie for breaks before dunking and it's all good now. Thanks to Belvita I no longer start the day running on just coffee for the first few hours.

review/text: It's hard to find a good quick blueberry flavored biscuit or cookie that doesn't have a weird aftertaste. The dried blueberry in the belvita actually tastes like blueberries. The biscuit is light, crispy, and tastes really good, not to sweet, but with a delicious hint of sweetness.<br /><br />Each package is a generous 4 biscuits. While not diet food, grabbing one of these mid afternoon is going to be more filling and healthier than a candy bar.<br /><br />Each packet of four biscuits is:<br />230 calories<br />8 g of fat (no cholesterol)<br />36 carbs<br />3 g fiber<br />13 g sugar<br />4 g of protein<br />18 g whole grain per serving

review/text: I am a diabetic and I love carbs which is the worst thing for someone like me. I found these products online and I now eat pancakes every Saturday and Sunday!  It is amazing how delicious they are when I make them with a little tweaking.<br /><br />My recipe is so good, I even had pancakes for dinner a few times!<br /><br />I always use  one package of sweet and low, 1 egg beaters container (2 eggs), a little bit of banana, almond, lemon or vanilla flavoring, a touch of oil and a touch of water, I shake it really well (have my own little shaker for this now) stir it to test the thickness of the batter...and start making pancakes.  I top it off with a little whip cream (sugar free and sugar free rasberry ice cream topping) and it is soooo goood!!!  Just  like eating at IHOP or Waffles restaurants!!<br /><br />I recommend getting a small container (for 1 person) with a top for shaking...it makes it so simple..less than 2 minutes and it is ready for the fry pan!

review/summary: PANCAKES ARE VERY GOOD - after modifying the recipe!
review/text: Hi! 1st batch we made - had an unusual inside texture for a pancake - they were still very good - but .. a little wierd.  The inside texture was a bit - spongy or like the way an eggs are that are whipped/beaten and then used in an omelet or breakfast casserole.  A couple of days later, my son, husband and I made our 2nd batch, but this time we modified the recipe on the back. We used only 1 egg -- and that was the right modification!  Now the pancakes were just like regular pancakes!  They are delicious and certainly satisfy the "pancake craving".  We always add extracts to our pancakes - usually vanilla and maple, sometimes vanilla and coconut, sometimes vanilla and banana plus walnuts!  My ONLY issue is the SHIPPING cost us MORE than the product!! UGH .. bummer... nevertheless we are ordering another package - I will check to see if ordering more cost more in shipping -- if not might order 3 boxes as once. It's a shame food that is 'better' for us is always more costly -- but, that is not going to change.

review/summary: Not bad, but really quite different taste than regular pancakes
review/text: These pancakes do cook beautifully, but to me still taste like air or cardboard, which is exactly why I was hesitant to buy a low carb mix.  They are better than mixes found in stores, but for me, not good enough to buy again, especially for the amount you're getting in the box.  I will try the 1 egg modification next time to see if there's any improvement on texture, so thanks for sharing that tip.  I'm disappointed they aren't better, but it's hard to make low-carb taste like high-carb goodness.  So, I would imagine this is an excellent product for some.  I would just rather not have pancakes at all than compromise this much.

When used with a sugar free syrup these make a very acceptable breakfast for a diabetic or someone watching their carb intake.<br /><br />One hint to pass along, we cut back on the number of eggs used in the directions as the first batch tasted very "eggy".<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Diabetic's dream!
review/text: Having recently been diagnosed with diabetes, it's been difficult to find something to eat for breakfast that won't shoot my blood sugar through the roof.  My one & two hour post prandial glucose has been consistently below 140 after a pancake breakfast with this product. Half of a whole grain English muffin shoots it up over 180. My diet choices are complicated by that fact that, in addition to a diabetic diet, I'm also on a low salt, low fat low cholesterol diet (I'm sure I'm not alone, however).  I agree with prior reviewers that the pancakes are a little eggy but they taste really good nonetheless; light, fluffy and yummy.  I substituted Eggbeaters for the eggs (reducing further the calories, fat & cholesterol); they still taste great but maybe not as fluffy.  Next batch I'll try half eggs & half Eggbeaters.  Wonderful product!

review/text: I have tried another low carb Maple...brand, which I am sure many are aware of, however, I prefer the taste of New Hope Mills. New Hope is also much lower in carbs than the the other brands sold in my local supermarket and Amazon. The taste is not rubbery, nor bland. It's easy to make and is an excellent substitute for brands with sugar. I have added crushed or whole almonds or walnuts and periodically a few pecans, a bit of vanilla to increase the fiber for some texture.<br /><br />What I dislike is the cost via Amazon. I went to the New Hope Mills site and discovered 3 (9oz)boxes for $11.95 or a case of 8 boxes for $25.00! Plus, my local supermarket has offered to order a case for me. Quite a big difference in cost!  So, although I like the convenience of Amazon, I will place future orders directly from New Hope Mills' site.  It's quite exciting to be able to order it in bulk and enjoy pancakes. Hint to Amazon, it would be great if you offer a comparable price w/Prime member benefits!

review/text: I didn't expect this low carb pancakes to taste like the yummy carb laden pancakes of my youth, but dear Lord, these pancakes were horrible.  i followed the directions to the letter from the back of the box and made up the entire box (we love us some pancakes, and we have company over). The first few pancakes were the usual... not meant to be served.  But they kept getting worse.  Thick, gloppy, uncooked centers, and the parts we could eat tasted like glue and saw dust.<br /><br />The WORST part is, I called New Hope Mills to complain and they won't give me my money back or offer me a consideration.  It must be user error.  I can make pancakes, I've been cooking for over 25 years.  In fact I made bisquik pancakes yesterday for the family.<br /><br />So.... Skip this mix.  Unless you like raw centered glue/saw dust pancakes.  In which case, Enjoy!!

review/summary: Long term low carbers will love it.
review/text: I have a feeling that those who gave this product bad reviews had very little experience with low carb eating.  Does it taste like a regular high carb pancake from Waffle House?  Of course not.  Is it yummy in its own right?  Oh, yes.  A quarter cup of mix makes four decent sized pancakes, which I cheerfully cover with low-sugar peanut butter or low-carb jam.  Sometimes, I'll eat them with just a little butter when I'm craving bread.  I do have to water the batter down some, as it's very thick.  I've also used this mix to successfully create beer batter for frying chicken or fish or veggies--it puffs up a good bit when frying, so a little batter goes a long way.  (If you decide to use the mix as batter, you may want to add some salt.)

The consistency was a little chewy and the taste quite egg-y, but with sugar-free maple syrup I was still in heaven with every bite. I also sprinkled on some cinnamon for flavor. However, next time I'll try reducing to one egg instead of two, and see if this helps cut down the egg-iness. Not bad overall!

review/text: I used to be a cook in college making eggs and pancakes for breakfast in the college dining hall.  It wasn't actually gourmet but it at least was a pancake.  I followed the directions to the letter on the box which wasn't too difficult but, like the others low rating reviews, it came out like a watery flat omelet.  It had a strong taste of eggs, it didn't rise very well.  I chucked the rest of the box out.  You might get a better result if you cut the mix with a little regular flour or add more mix than recommended on the package, but I don't think its worth the effort.  Better to just eat a normal pancake with sugar free syrup than this stuff.

review/summary: Pancakes again
review/text: I can't say that these pancakes are the best I have ever had, but after not having any at all for awhile, they weren't bad!

review/summary: This is NOT the Atkins recipe
review/text: Although this is advertized as the exact Atkins recipe (Hope MIlls bought the right to make it from Atkins), it is not.  Very bland, very tough waffles and pancakes.  What a rip-off!

review/summary: just a little tough
review/text: The batter whips up alright but for some reason the pancakes are a little on the rubbery side- they were cooked per pkg directions.

review/summary: allergies
review/text: I developed a severe case of hives after eating this product for a month.  I am not sure it's from the product, but the hives went away after I stopped eating it.  I do eat a similar product from Maple Farms that doesn't give me the reaction.  Although both products contain Gluten, I am told by my doctor that this product may have some ingredients that are different from Maple Farms.  I'm sure not everyone would get this reaction, but I did and I wanted to put out a warning.

review/summary: Yuck!!
review/text: The reason I decided to purchase this item is because of the other positive reviews.  But, after tasting it, I am not sure that the other reviews have ever tasted a real pancake!  These are yellow in color, have a gritty texture, and a eggy taste, sort of like French toast (and I HATE French toast). I am sure the rest of the box will sit on the shelves until it expires.

review/summary: Dried up Omelette
review/text: After reading several of the other reviews, I decided to purchase this product,  mainly as a way to adopt a more low carb diet.  Here's the deal:  Right away you notice that the mixture is extremely eggy. The mixture has the look of a pancake and cooks all the way through easily enough.  The taste: tastes like a dried up omelette.  Very eggy taste.  Hard cardboard texture.  No amount of syrup can bury this flavor.  Was not able to get through even one pancake.  Very unsatisfied with this product.  Could never recommend to anyone.  If you are trying to lower your carb intake; eat smaller portions of carbs.
