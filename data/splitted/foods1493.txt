review/summary: Feeling left out
review/text: I'm not writing to say this is not a good product. It unfortunately did not agree with me or my daughter. I have tried several brands, this one gave me and my daughter strong stomach cramps and diarrhea. Despite the early onset of this I kept using it hoping it would eventually stop. We had to finally stop and use another. We are both in good health and eat well. Even though the issues with this brand ceased after not using it, we still have a vague sick feeling all over much of the day. We are both disappointed because we are juicers and loved the idea of adding this to our daily regimen. We have been using coconut oil for a couple months....thinking this would be ample time for our bodies to become adjusted. We also never exceeded 3 tbls in a day. Bottom line, we believe this is a great product, just not for us and feel left out from all the wonderful benefits of coconut oil. However, we do continue to use it on our hair and skin.

I've been very happy with it for cooking. I actually bought it as a moisturizer, but decided it smells not so tasty after a few hours because it reacts to the oils on my baby's skin. Buy it to eat.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have been using this product for several months now, and am really pleased with it.  It smells very much of coconut when first opening it, but it does not flavor the food much if any - perhaps just the faintest hint of coconut.  I use it in place of olive oil as this has a higher smoking point than olive oil and so it does well when using higher heat.  I bake with it, roast red peppers, use it for sauteing veggies, anything that one would regularly use olive or canola oil for.  My only complaint is that the jars though sealed, always arrive greasy, surely a better packaging system can be used...this is why I gave it four stars instead of five.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: Lovely coconut oil.  I bought the pack of two 15 ounce jars, one for cooking and one for the cat's food, my own body, and my hair, and it's just heavenly.  It smells brilliant on, but the smell fades after awhile so it doesn't totally overpower you and everything around you, my cat likes it so much that he licks it off my legs--he needs a bit of extra fat since the raw meat you get at the grocery is generally lean--and my incredibly picky boyfriend tried some teriyaki pork I saut&eacute;ed in coconut butter and he loved it--huge surprise, since I was ready to go overboard apologizing to him for the coconut flavor.  I've made raw truffles with this, carob powder, almond extract, agave, and crushed almonds, and they turned out so yummy that SAD eaters loved them.  But--warning!--if you live in the South, and especially in the summer, be really, really careful peeling the protective bit of plastic on the top off!  Mine is permanently liquid, but especially so when it sat outside in a box waiting for me to come home.<br /><br />Another bit of advice:  buy the 54 ounces; it's a better buy, and you'll use it!<br /><br />To whoever hated the plastic jars:  yeah, you're right, but I'd still buy this coconut oil again.  No, plastic isn't ideal, but I just transfer the oil to my old glass olive oil bottles and add one of the metal dispensers on the top--easy to use and it's glass.

review/summary: Excellent product, but....
review/text: The oil itself is wonderful. It has only a subtle coconut scent, which is excellent for low-heat cooking. Although it is recommended for slightly higher heat, the risk of burning the oil is high, yielding an awful synthetic taste and smell.<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my raw vegan desserts. Unfortunately, I live in Florida, which means that the coconut oil itself is always in a liquid state when kept at room temperature. Be forewarned that in the warmer months, you will have a liquid oil, since it "melts" at 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 C). If I make a raw cheesecake, it needs to be refrigerated immediately and cannot sit on the counter for very long, But it still does an excellent job! It is also great for the hair and skin; I keep a separate bottle in the bathroom for such uses. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, and the gentle moisturizing properties of the coconut oil do not irritate my skin or pores at all.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this product, after months of receiving it, was that it was shipped to me once with an open lid. When I received the box, it was coated in oil with a sticker from the post office that it had been received damaged by them (the postal carrier would not even carry it up for me), and damaged a box of books I had shipped separately. However, Amazon was very quick to rectify the issue.<br /><br />A few other reviewers have complained that the oil "sweats" and no matter what they do, the outside of the jar becomes oily. I've been through about 6 bottles of oil over the years and have only had this problem when I didn't wipe the bottle off after use. Scoop the oil out with a spoon (don't pour it from the bottle!) and you won't have a problem.

This is by far the best coconut oil I have been able to find and cooking is the very least important thing on my list!<br /><br />Our 3 year old son suffers from Eczema and this stuff is like a wonder oil!! I cover him from head to toe when he gets out of the bath. He smells lovely and it keeps his Eczema under control much better than any other (including perscription) lotions and meds ever have!!! That is a reason to have it forever right there.<br /><br />I use it for shaving my legs! It is amazing for this. I apply it to my legs before I get in the shower, get in, shave them and ohhh la la! No razor burn, no bumps, and oh so soft! It works so wonderful.<br />I also use it as hand cream when my hands are dry, eye makeup remover, and lip balm.<br /><br />There are so many uses! I highly recommend this product to everyone!!!

review/text: This product is awesome.  It has a wonderful taste and gives baked goods a tender texture.  It remains solid at room temperature, so I scrape what I want out of the jar into a plastic container, then microwave it for 30 seconds and pour it into my batter.  It will lend a slight coconut flavor to baked items, which works with just about any kind of muffin, cookie, or bread.  It looks promising as a skin moisturizer, as well, though I haven't yet tried it for that purpose.  Smaller jars in the grocery store are quite expensive, so buying it from Amazon in the larger jars is more economical.

review/summary: Wonderful Product - So Many Benefits - Tastes GREAT
review/text: Just a note to my existing review below. There was a piece of day old Rosemary Bread on the counter.  I remembered so many people saying this tastes good on bread so I decided to try it.  I admit I stood my the garbage pail because I was expecting to throw the piece of bread with coconut oil spread on it away.  I love this stuff but didn't think I'd go so far as to eat it straight out of the jar.  Wow.  It had a nice smooth buttery taste.  Ate it all.  By the way, Subscribe and Save is the way to go.  Doing it for a year now.  Very satisified with the service.<br /><br />Besides the cooking benefits of coconut oil I've discovered other benefits that make this a must have in my house.  For more years than I can remember I had a wart on one of my fingers.  It would come and go but finally got to the point that when it flaired up it would split, bleed, and get infected.  It was getting very hard to keep under control so had decided that I would finally have to go to a specialist and have it removed.  The last time I had an episode with it I decided to try one last thing...coconut oil. I had read coconut oil had anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.  Within 2 days the infection had started to clear up.  In less than 10 days the wart had shrunk to practically nothing.  It's been months now.  I use coconut oil on my hands every day...several times a day and haven't had a single new flair up.  After dealing with this for more than 15 years, I can barely feel where the wart was. I've used coconut oil on burns, cold sores, and callused feet (smooth as can be now).  It's also wonderful for keeping my gray hair very soft and manageable.  I had read an article about "oil pulling" and tryed it with coconut oil.  I won't go into that here.  Just go to Bing or EHow and check it out.  It has really improved my oral health.  The articles I read suggested oil pulling with sesame oil but I used coconut oil because of it's anti-bacterial qualities.  This is a product I wouldn't be without now.

review/text: This product works very well, especially when frying foods. It does not saturate whatever you are frying and does not have that greasy, oily, taste. It is nice knowing I am using something healthy too, as there is no animal fat in this product. It actually has a good taste and therefor enhances the flavor of things like, cookies, cakes, and pies. I highly recommend it!

It is one of the best rubs I've ever made. I had to heat the mixture 1st though because the oil gets hard when cooled. It's tough to work with in the beginning, but it's worth it!

review/text: I am a avid user of the WF Extra Virgin Organic Coconut Oil. Based on the reviews, I decided to try this particular brand of coconut oil and I'm in love. I use it as pre-poo (Pre-conditioning treatment) for my hair,  and to bake and cook. Since I use scented oils as a fragrance, I pour a lil of the scented oil in a hand full of coconut oil and moisture my whole body. It has a light coconut scent which doesn't overpower the food or the fragrance I use with it. There is no staining on your clothes. My boyfriend even uses it daily and it has minimized the blemises on his acne-proned skin. Amazon offers the best price for the quantity.  This is the best yet!

I was disappointed that it comes in a plastic jar, but so do numerous things we buy these days. Besides you can always transfer your oil to glass jars if you like as well.  I would definitely order this item again from Amazon because it is a great price for the quantity that you receive.

review/text: This coconut oil is excellent!  We have been using raw coconut oil for about 3 months now and I think they are right!  It may have cholesterol in it, but it must have other properties that are more beneficial, because my husband's cholesterol levels are in check for the first time in 10 years!  This brand of raw coconut oil is a very good one and we enjoy it a lot - it smells faintly of coconut, but it doesn't have a strong coconut flavor... we use it for frying eggs, in sautes, stir fry, even as a butter replacement on toast with raw honey (yum!)  The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the containers had oil on the outside, which I was able to clean off fairly easy, but it was kind of a mess.

review/text: When I was thinking about adopting a little rescue dog, I was told the dog  was very under weight. But they had started using a little extra virgin  coconut oil on her food and she liked it.  Then they sent me a link to an article on how coconut oil can be used with pets.  I was so intrigued, I looked up more articles and saw how it can be used in a variety of ways with people.<br /><br />I ended up getting the dog - and the coconut oil.  It appeared that the "organic, extra virgin" was the best choice.  I bought 2 jars and have been using it  successfully in these ways:<br /><br />A few drops on my rescue's dry food, and she loves it<br />Use it to make popcorn and it really does taste like theater popcorn<br />I use it on my dry hands , body and even my face - of course I am prepared to get a lot of licks from my rescue<br />Put it on my grandson's diaper rash - it cleared it up better than diaper rash ointment<br />I have put it on my own bruises and scrapes, hard to tell if it works better than anything else, but I like that it is natural<br /><br />I know there are many other uses for it, like using it on your hair, and I am going to keep researching.  I am so happy with this particular coconut oil that I signed up for the subscription services.  It is worth a try!

review/text: Coconut oil (extra-virgin organic) has become the only oil I will use for cooking. It gives food a tropical kick of flavor & aroma, but not overpoweringly so. Nutiva is a major brand you can trust, though I've tried & used other brands from local healthfood stores as well. It annoys me that some books & health professionals still knock coconut oil as a fat to avoid on the premise that it's a naturally saturated fat, when in fact it's a tremendously healthy product. Don't believe the nay-sayers.

review/text: The quality of this product is very good, but the plastic bottles  were not tightly closed. When I received my Nutiva Coconut Oil, the bottles were packed lying on their sides soaking wet all over. About 1/3 of each bottle were leaking out. I bought other brand ,like Tropical Tradition,and received it all dry no leaking problem.<br />My advice is : When putting the bottles in the box, please don't lay the bottles on their sides. Let the bottles stand up, that will help the leaking problem, because coconut oil melt below 72 degree. Thanks for letting me write the review.

review/summary: Not as Healthy as I had Hoped
review/text: I wrote a review of this product detailing my own experience with this product and coconut oil in general. It generated a good discussion spanning 97 comments, however it was not very concise and I wished I had made my points more clearly. This is a rewrite of my initial review.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I had heard stories in the popular media about how coconut oil contains a healthy form of saturated fat. I welcomed this news because coconut oil is a fun ingredient. It has a high smoke point, a great taste, and does not go rancid.<br /><br />As a chemist, the hypothesis for why it may be healthier made sense to me. Coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats, which differ from the long chain saturated fats found in red meat. I studied lipid transport during my PhD and I think it is totally possible the body does different things with these two different chemicals.<br /><br />However it is also totally possible that the two types of saturated fat both increase one's risk of cardiovascular disease. To figure this out, I looked through the literature and spoke with people to see what proof there was.<br /><br />What I found was that the arguments that suggest medium chain saturated fats are health appeared flawed to me. Here are the arguments I have heard:<br /><br />Some people reference studies of island dwelling-people who eat diets rich in coconut fats. These people have low rates of heart disease. The problems with these studies are significant. First, these people often die earlier than Westerners, and that is why they have lower cardiovascular disease. They have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease too. This is because of the second, larger problem: there are MANY things about the life of an island-dwelling person that is different than that of a Westerner. Maybe the diet is the cause of an observed effect, maybe it is the increased exercise or different sleep pattern. You just can't draw conclusions when so many variables have changed. Islanders are just too different to use as a model.<br /><br />Some people trust books written about the subject like "The Coconut Oil Miracle" or "The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil". The problem with these books is that they are books, not studies. To prove something, you have to perform a study. To make their arguments, they often cite studies, but the studies are like the one above, typically flawed. There isn't a paper published that shows medium chain saturated fats do not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the way saturated fats do.<br /><br />There have also been citations from doctors such as Dr. Mercola. It is best to take advice from leaders in the field, rather than doctors trying to sell a book or treatement. Specifically Dr. Mercola has been admonished by the FDA for making misleading claims:  [...] Be careful who you trust.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is no evidence that medium chain saturated fats have different health effects than saturated fats. The most convincing argument in favor of coconut oil is that saturated fats themselves are not dangerous. There is controversy on this subject (just like with most medical subjects) but the vast majority of the data supports the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. To support this, here are some sources.<br /><br />1) Harvard University School of Public Health published this easy guide to fats and cholesterol:<br />[...]<br />Here they recommend that you should not decrease fat intake overall, just replace saturated fats with unsaturated, the less saturated the better.<br />2) The most convincing paper on this subject says this:<br />"Based on consistent evidence from human studies, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk, with ~10% risk reduction for a 5% energy substitution; whereas replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate has no benefit and replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat has uncertain effects. "<br /> To restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. The authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion.<br />Further research has shown "The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%." That is a huge effect.<br />Citation is here:<br />Lipids. 2010 Oct;45(10):893-905. Epub 2010 Mar 31.<br />Saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence.<br />Micha R, Mozaffarian D.<br />Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.<br />3) Finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. The majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br />[...]<br /><br />To summarize what I learned from these conversations and articles, I now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and I know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.<br /><br />I decided to take the more conservative path and I sold the coconut oil I bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. I hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.

review/summary: Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.  Purchased from Swanson, my favorite purveyor of health products, this coconut oil is one of the highest qualities of life healing offerings available from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of the jar on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust this company [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray</a>.  From reading Bruce Fife's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a> I clarified my belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil and in this brand's production purity.  My experience of using this product for only 24 hours had shown results which have made me feel blessed... finally!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then ultimately seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4">The Magnesium Miracle</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, can work as magnesium's ultimate catalyst.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my reviews on magnesium products along with the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great books and products of Magnesium and Coconut are available on Amazon, found easily using the search capacity.<br /><br />According to experts, the most important thing to know about oils and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed clearly in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods and additives defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than Mg, and in current food market and habits is usually supplied in quantities much too large, causing many illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This is clearly detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons severely deficient in magnesium [like I am] is that in its current state that fruit holds more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.  In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.  Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient. With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some books say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary foods, in order to live strong and disease free.

review/summary: Great for cooking AND oil pulling!
review/text: This coconut oil is even better than I expected! Very smooth and nice, with a beautiful, light taste you can detect in the food you cook it with (I love using it to "pan-fry" the rice I cook it with first). Oil pulling with it is a real blast - it melts in your mouth and feels so clean afterwards. It's cold-pressed and organic - you can taste and see the purity! I love this stuff!

review/text: I love this deal from Amazon subscription! Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils to use/cook with. The price is very reasonable and i love that it has become easy to switch to this healthier cooking choice. It smells coconutty, but there is no coconut flavor in your cooked foods. Yay for not having to pick something else up from the grocery store! I could get used to all grocery items being delivered at such great prices.

review/summary: Great taste, great value!
review/text: This is the highest quality of coconut oil on the market and the price can't be beat.  Coconut oil is a high heat oil so it won't burn your food like lower heat oils. Use freely for sauteing, frying and anywhere the coconut flavor is a plus. It's not overwhelming in flavor, just subtle. I've used it to deep fry battered fish and yum, so tasty. Also use it to make popcorn. Your popcorn won't burn and you'll get a really nice flavor. And, of course, you can use it on your skin, hair, etc. There are many benefits to coconut oil.

review/text: This oil has a smooth feel and a strong coconut scent and flavor. I use it for cooking and also for hair and body. It's a very good replacement for hand/ body lotion, it works really well in cold/dry climates. It has a much better texture and flavor than Spectrum. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's packaged in plastic - I much prefer glass.

review/text: I have purchased coconut oil in the past and have HATED it.  It has invariably been bad-tasting. I read that when coconut oil goes bad, it can leave a soapy aftertaste.  When I saw this product, I thought, okay, I'll give it ONE MORE TRY.  When the oil arrived, I checked the packed on/use by date and saw that the product was quite recently packed and should have a long shelf life.  I've used about half a jar now and am amazed at the difference!  This stuff is GREAT!  I use it several times a week and the food comes out delicious, and no nasty after-taste!

review/text: You know I would have given this item 5 stars except for the fact that when my package arrived, one of the bottles was opened. The coconut oil is very easily turned into a liquid, and because of this, my package was all slippery and slimy. Now I should have returned it but I was too lazy to return so I kept it. The bottle that was not opened was fine and was exactly what I wanted. So besides one of my coconut oil bottles being opened and leaking a little which lead to me throwing it away, all else was fine.

review/summary: Nutiva Coconut Oil
review/text: I got this because I had read on another website that this product was great for using in place of butter and for skin care. Well, I don't like using it in place of butter. It is very tasty with no phony aftertaste or anything. I have used it when making certain things on the stove where I would use butter. Mostly I use it for items that are on the sweeter side. It's very good on toast too. Almost like having dessert!<br /><br />In the winter, I get very dry elbows. I have one of the jars in my bedroom so I can just apply to my skin whenever I want. It's not greasy which surprised me. I thought it would be everywhere. It soaks right into your skin. In the reviews on QVC (I believe), there are women using this exact product on their face. That's just not my thing. I think the sweetness of the smell would bother my nose due to sensitivities to smells. Anyway, it fixes my elbows up with a couple of days; I only apply it in the morning and at bedtime. I also use it on my arms & legs whenever they seem to be getting a little dry. Wonderful product!!

review/summary: Scabie Cure?
review/text: I love this product. My mom is in a nursing home, and I think I may have gotten scabies there. Anyway, I had quite a rash, and did not know at the time this was it. I tried medicated powders, diaper rash cream - thinking it may be heat rash. One night the itch was so bad, I decided to put coconut oil on it. Wow- the itch stopped and I slept through the night. Since then, two relatives came down with scabies. They went the chemical route via their doctor. I never did. As I researched this I think one of the reasons coconut oil works for me is that the oil smothers the little critters. Instead of chemically killing them, I am drowning them in coconut oil. Plus so what if the oil gets into my blood stream! My rashes healed, my skin is soft. Now the scabies take a while to leave your body, but I just kept a small container of coconut oil and if I feel an itch, I apply it there. I also read that if you put TEA TREE Oil or Clove oil ( a few drops) and use coconut oil as a carrier it may really kill scabies. So I am using a bit of Tea Tree Oil just in case, but I feel I was being cured just by using the coconut oil.<br />I gave it four stars because of the plastic container. However, I read this plastic is the safe kind. BUt it still makes me a bit concerned.....

review/summary: OK stuff if used within reason.
review/text: First, I'm not sure why it's called "oil": it's butter, not oil; it's solid w/o refrigeration. The consistency is translucent sorta clunky white, sorta like grated candle would look. Just like butter, it immediately melts in your hand or mouth, to say nothing of the frying pan. Smells great, tastes also nice: like, well, coconut. Supposedly it's great for cooking due to its supposedly higher heat-resistance something: it's supposed to keep its nutritional qualities when heated better than other common cooking oils. There's a rub though: with many foods you can mix and match and achieve some sort of mixed flavour -- not with this stuff! It's irrepressible: whatever you add it to -- veggies, cakes, meat, cardboard, or motor oil -- will then smell/taste like coconut and nothing beside. It overpowers every other flavour. So the only cooking variables you have left when using it is texture and sweetness (and looks, I guess). It goes very well with something that's sweet (probably because we're used to coconut being used in sweets). From what I've tried, it goes well with carrots, apples, sunflower seeds (anything nutty-tasting), stuff like that. Real good with sweet potatoes. But I would not recommed using it for cooking meat (unless you like your pork chops smelling and tasting like coconut). You can't kill this flavour, that's what I'm getting at. I'm using it carefully (not too much and in suitable combinations) and I'm happy with it so far. The product seems good, and so is the price (Added on 12/18/2010: that was the price at the time of purchase, $13.54 on Dec 2, 2010 -- and now, only two weeks later, the price on this page is $18.46, amazing, no? A 30% increase in two weeks, wow, these guys sure are optimistic about the value of their product).<br /><br />A bit of a warning: there's a megaton of unsubstantiated semi-literate BS online about miraculous powers of coconut oil. Be careful about it: coconut oil is pure saturated fat (a serving consists of 14 grams of fat, 13 of them saturated) -- and I've found no acceptable medical/scientific info in support of the healthfulness of saturated fat (while there's a lot on the opposite). What I did find was that it's not openly harmful when used in small doses: a healthy 200-lbs 40-sh male, not overweight and exercising regularly, is allowed 200 saturated-fat calories a day. A serving of coconut oil is 130 calories, but of course, you'll get saturated fats from other foods too. Another thing is that coconut oil contains no appreciable amounts of vitamins/minerals (unlike butter, which is _loaded_ with all kinds of goodies). So be careful: despite the squall of shilling on the net and in print, it's not health food. But it's tasty and not like lethally bad, so...<br />-------<br />Added on 12/18/2010: I'm half-way through the first jar, and I find myself using it less and less. It's too smelly, and I just don't have that much opportunity to use it for stuff where it's OK. Besides being food, it is supposedly also good for external use, for skin and hair; I haven't tried it this way (yet; maybe I will). But I have a feeling that _as food_ it doesn't have much of a future in this household: it's too overpowering, too particular.<br />-----<br />01/01/2011: Tried it for skin lotion: well, um, yes and no. No: it doesn't get absorbed into the skin, and the area of application stays greasy forever, so you can't do it before going out (even wiping with, say, paper towel, doesn't remove enough of it, so you'll stain the clothes with oil). Yes: it has a terrific staying power, hours and several hand washes after application there's still something remaining on the skin. And I work with my hands a lot, with the result that they tend to get real dirty, so I wash hands frequently and rather severely, the surgical way: very hot water, several soap-ups, brush. This causes severe dehydration of the skin, so I've always used hand lotion immediately after, but with coconut oil the skin remains slightly oiled, soft and moisturised even after a couple of such washes.<br /><br />So, finally: I'm not sure how (and whether) I'll continue to use coconut oil: I have definitely ceased to use it as food; as moisturiser we'll see... at least it's marginally cheaper than dry-skin cream so I'll give it a longer try. But the cream dries up in a minute, so it's more practicable, I must say. Doesn't smell of coconut either! :-) I must say I did not find the product as useful as it's hyped, so I'm taking one star off right now. I'll revisit in a month or two: if I discover by then that I've stopped using this thing altogether, I'll update the review to this effect.<br />--------<br />02/20/2011: Bottom line: I think I've settled into a two-sided routine with this oil: I use it, first, for light-frying/sauteing veggies (with yams or sweet potatoes as a basis; adding greens, like spinach, in the mix later on). I don't do this often though, 'cause I prefer to steam or eat raw, rather than fry anything; sauteing is quicker though, so when I'm pressed for time, this is workable. The other use is for skin: skin really loves this oil -- in addition to staying hydrated forever, it becomes very even in texture and colour; after shower I grease myself up, literally from head to toe, and it's just lovely (except for the clothes who get stained :-).

review/text: I don't know what I was expecting from coconut oil in general but I guess I thought it would have a real sweet almost tropical smell but when I opened up the jar, I didn't get that at all. After doing some research after I received the product I found out that the Nutiva brand has more of a nutty smell than some others. So maybe next time I may try a different brand.<br /><br />For the good stuff, I do like the consistancy and the way it instantly liquifies in my hands before putting it on my hair. I will continue to use this oil, but will just mix it with something else with a stronger smell to over power the nutty oil smell.

It is also a good thing it comes in a pack of 2 because after the first time you crack the lid,... well, lets suffice to say that the product is now "Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tub (Pack of 2)" My pubic hair has never looked so radiant and soft and its hard to imagine a smoother johnson.<br /><br />Also, cleanup is a snap with a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0">Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz</a>

review/summary: I bought this for my hair
review/text: I bought this for my hair after reading some reviews about how good it is for the hair - I think its really good for a pre-shampoo but not as a leave in.  One it makes my curly hair a bit frizzy if I use it as a leave in and two, bees are attracted to it...... not fun running to my car to get away............  but I hear its great for cooking with though :)

review/summary: coconut oil everywhere.
review/text: I ordered this product and just got my box today 4/21/2011.  When I opened the box there was another box, so I opened the next box and there is cocunut oil all over the 2 jars, bubble wrap and all over the box!  I will never order this again, as today I received my box and they already close the return date!  There is a major problem here and I do not recommend anyone ordering this product.  I want my money back.

review/summary: okey product, but pricy
review/text: I like the flavor of coconut in my favorite noodle soup. I used this coconut oil to prepare my pancakes as well. It gives nice flavor. However I felt that over time the flavor was not as strong as I first opened the package. Also the price seems to be a little more.

review/summary: why plastic jars?
review/text: These just arrived and I was very disappointed to see that the jars are plastic. I thought Nutiva was a more "green" company than to cut corners like that. Sure, it's recyclable: once. Glass is a better choice, especially since this is an oil and every other day a new study comes out showing how much plastic packaging leaches into food. I wish the product description on Amazon would mention how it's packaged.

review/summary: Not Good for Cooking
review/text: This product may be great for tanning (over your sunscreen of course), but it is not good for cooking unless you are making a coconut pie, cake or cookies (GF of course) because it tastes and smells like coconut.<br /><br />I should have been tipped off by the plastic container and by what appears to be a lower than I expected melting point, but I admit that I was looking for an economical solution to Subscribe & Save for my adult children as I do all that I can to help them eat right.  I am telling them to use this as body oil and I will buy them some Spectrum Naturals Coconut Oil.

review/summary: Don't buy it!
review/text: This was a 2 pack.  One of the jars had obviously been opened before.  The shipping box was slimy from whatever amount of oil seeped out.  So my great deal on a 2 pack turned into an OK deal for a one pack.  I will not purchase a Nutiva product again.  Beware that all grocery items are not able to be returned.

review/summary: Waste of my money.
review/text: The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old.  At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil.  As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase.

review/summary: Use topically for my psoriasis
review/text: I use this to put on my psoriasis to help keep the skin layers down and itching away. Has worked very well. I would recommend to anyone who is tired of all the prescription and over-the-counter endless, useless topicals that are out on the market today. I have had psoriasis for 20 years and have tried several chemotherapy treatments, one almost killed me. So, I'm going all natural. I also soak in Dead Sea salt baths three to four times each week to help keep the layers and itching down. It has changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: best flavor!
review/text: I've tried several different brands of coconut oil (including one relatively pricey, self-publishing, industrial-tasting brand) and keep coming back to this brand. When making a dish that really calls for coconut flavor, this one holds up very well either after heating or by itself. The coconut flavor is not overwhelming when cooking, and tastes like coconut (and nothing else!) by itself.  If you're going to be trying to up your healthy fat intake with coconut oil or use it to treat one of the many things coconut oil is supposed to be good for, this is by far the most palatable one I've tasted.<br /><br />My only complaint is that ordering on Amazon can be problematic in warmer months. My jar leaked all over the inside of the box, though the jar wasn't cracked and didn't appear to be previously opened. There needs to be a better seal or the product needs to be stabilized upright during shipping.

review/summary: Great for Skincare. Great for Health. Good Stong Smell.
review/text: Add Vitamin E to help with wrinkles and stretch marks. Only moisturizer that does not break out my Ultra sensitive skin, no clogged pores. Really after thirty years of searching countless products this actually helps my face look way way better. The sking on my hands, neck, chest, and lips love it too. Use it all over, makes skin almost as soft as skin so soft does. :)<br /><br />Better price on Amazon with auto-delivery than at Earth-fare, which carries tons of this stuff. Any product that is carried in such quantity at a health food store always catches my attention.<br /><br />Strong smell with cooking, use limited amounts for introducing taste to family members. Butter replacement.  When I have kids it will be my go-to oil for adding full fat flavor to veggies, muffins, and toast.<br /><br />Great in the bedroom too. ;)<br /><br />Look up health benefits and uses with an online search.

review/text: At first I was a little worried that my eggs would taste like coconut, but I really don't notice.  I use it instead of butter on my toast and it goes great with jam or cinnamon sugar!  Melts easier than cold butter also.

review/summary: Orgainic Cocconut Oil
review/text: This is the second time I've ordered this product. I am very pleased with the way it melts and cooks. We use it to "fry" about all of our foods at our house. It gives a slight flavor to the foods we cook, but it's very mild. We'll certainly be buying this oil again.

review/summary: Highly Recommend Using as a Moisturizer
review/text: This double pack was a terrific deal (~$10) compared to local stores. I bought this product mainly to moisturize my very dry skin and it works wonders! It does not leave the skin feeling greasy compared to other products (e.g. jojoba oil) and is much more economical. I enjoy the very natural smell of coconut when I first use it on the skin, but the smell dissipates shortly afterwards. Cooking with it is like cooking with canola oil - it does not impart a coconut taste to the final dish. Use oils in moderation, including coconut. One jar is used for cooking and the other is kept in the bathroom as part of my beauty routine. As other reviews have noted, I wished it was in a glass jar.

review/summary: Great for hair and skin
review/text: I purchased the two pack of this thinking that I would keep one in the bathroom and use it for skin and haircare, and the other in the kitchen for cooking.  I haven't yet had a chance to use the oil for cooking, but I have been using it on my hair and skin, and it has a very nice, light, but very moisturizing feel.  It sinks right in to the hair, and keeps it moist without making it too greasy.  It's a solid at room temperature, but it softens right in your hands, so you don't have to use any effort to get it soft.  It has a light coconut scent that is not too sweet smelling.  I haven't tried it for this purpose yet, but I imagine it would be perfect for removing eye makeup.  Again, I can't attest to how it works as a cooking oil, but for skin and hair care, I highly recommend it.
