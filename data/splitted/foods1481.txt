review/summary: Weed indeed
review/text: This herb is great with salads, seafood, poultry. My Favorite dishes using Dill Weed: Dilled Chicken Salad, Tuna Salad, Baked Salmon and maybe a dash on some hard boiled eggs.<br /><br />Background: This is an aromatic herb that is grown all over the world. It's often used as a cooking spice. In Greece, people once placed dill over their eyes to help them fall asleep. Ancient documents from Egypt call for dill to be used as a pain reliever.<br /><br />Dill is mainly used in pickling, dill pickles, dill dip mix have become a North American classic and in Europe Sauerkraut and dill vinegars have been popular for centuries. It is especially popular in Russia and Scandinavia, where it is used in courts-bouillons and sauces for fish, pickled salmon, casseroles and soups.<br /><br />Bottom line price was good, flavor was mild not as strong as I expected. The tin works for short term storage easy for me to open. I will try other brands of Dill weed to have something to compare against this brand. This product has better value than what is offered in local markets. There is a good chance I will purchase this  product again; it arrived quickly and filled the need for my Dill weed.

review/summary: Snack Chip Heaven
review/text: Gluten-free, vegan, and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

This coffee is absolutley amazing. I normally only prefer coffee with just a splash of french vanilla creamer, however, this coffee was still amazing with a bit of creamer and sugar. This coffee is so good I just bought myself some and a new coffee pot! Anyone who likes bold coffee with a kick will really enjoy this coffee.

review/text: This is wonderful stuff if you like nice strong full-bodied coffee, as we do (and we find watering it down works fine for visitors who like their coffee weaker - it's still good).  After trying it once, we now get it on subscription from Amazon.<br /><br />The package says it's certified organic, it has a fair trade ("fair trade, not aid") label too, and it comes from a company "proud to support ... Wings Over The Rockies [and] Nature Conservancy".  So we can enjoy our morning coffee while feeling virtuous about buying from the company too.

review/summary: Strong Burnt Flavor
review/text: I normally purchase my coffee beans from boutique roasters and have rarely been disappointed. I should have tried a smaller bag of "Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark" because it's not a brew that I like. I've tried brewing it weak and it still has a burnt, stale flavor that lingers far too long. Mixing it 1/3rd to 2/3rd other beans to use it up. Also be aware that these oily beans have a very strong smell. I had to move the grinder out to the garage because the house smelled like burnt coffee.<br /><br />Pros: It's a good price for the amount  of coffee beans you get.

review/summary: Rising in price, significant drop in quality
review/text: I've been drinking kicking horse from amazon for well over a year and my last 3 months worth of orders have all been disappointing to say the least, this simply is not the same bean they were selling last year, the quality has dropped measurably and their price keeps steadily rising, it's simply not worth the price anymore for a bean of this low quality. I would suggest trying out some ravens brew, the quality of their bean and roast has become far superior to any of the kicking horse brews, this coffee simply not the same as it used to be, it's been changed for maximum profitability rather than a quality product.

review/summary: Hate to 'kick,' but ...
review/text: I like to give products a fair trial, and I've tried this one with varying combinations of filtered water, grinds and coffee-water ratios.  The overpriced bag I bought is really no better than any of the store-brand 'columbian' coffees I revert to from time-to-time in my quest for the elusive Consistent Cup.  Maybe this has been overhyped and they've sacrificed quality since other reviews (as in the oversold, over-roasted Starbuck blends.) It happens with everything on the market.  But the bag of beans I got and that I've really tried to enjoy has proved very disappointing. I'd send it back if I could do so without paying postage. I don't mind paying double, or even triple, for a cup of coffee that actually gets me going and says 'Good morning, tastebuds! to start each day. Life's just too short to drink crap coffee unless you have to. But this so-called 'Kick-a**' Kickin' Horse is little more than donkey dung that I'll be a-kickin' on down the road.

review/summary: Excellent Dark Roast
review/text: I've ordered this coffee several times & it has been excellent every time.  It's not over-roasted/burnt tasting & the flavor is very complex.  The beans are oily, black & I found no quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.  If you've always been disappointed in dark roast coffee, you may want to give this a try but if you just don't like dark roast; you will probably NOT like this one.<br /><br />I use the "pour over" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I use cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe.  I heat the water to boiling, pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, wait a minute & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.  There is a lot of crema, the beautiful reddish brown foam that develops on top of the beans, & it smells & tastes wonderful.<br /><br />I brew directly in to this carafe using this coffee cone (pour over method):<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a><br /><br />I use this grinder:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a><br /><br />I use this water kettle to heat the water:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><br />I use these coffee filters:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0BEYG">Melitta 626412 40 Count #6 Natural Brown Cone Coffee Filters</a>

review/summary: #1 Favorite Coffee!!!
review/text: This is my favorite coffee hands down. My fiancee got me into "good" coffee by getting me to drink Starbucks, but I couldn't handle the acidity of the Pike's and had to get cream to prevent the heartburn, but this coffee is near acid free and smooth. I can drink several cups and not worry about heartburn, although with the kick it has I would advise against drinking too many cups :D<br /><br />I've yet to drink this with making a french press, but with a burr grinder and drip coffee or the Senseo it is superb. Other people complain that the flavor is plain and lacking, but if you really love the taste of coffee this is the best. It doesn't have any "hidden" flavors that leave an after taste or might make it so the coffee is good for the first few cups and then the extra flavors kill the taste. Example is the Komodo Dragon blend from SB, it's a great coffee and I love the flavor but after two cups I just can't drink it anymore.<br />The Kicking Horse is just pure undisturbed coffee goodness!

Even better, it is ORGANIC and FREE TRADE.  How good can it get with the low price per pound and free shipping with Amazon Prime.  Closed my subscription from Peets and buying Dark Horse from Amazon from now on.  I LOVE IT!!!

review/summary: Not good for super-automatic espresso/coffee makers
review/text: This looks like a pretty decent coffee, but its not suitable for super-automatic espresso/coffee makers.  Problem is that the beans are TOO oily.  Good if you self-grind... bad if you put the beans in a large hopper and expect them to automatically slide into the grinder when needed... The oil creates a stickiness which tends to keep the beans stationary. 5 stars if rating the coffee simply on the quality of the beans... would be unfair to downgrade the avg because they don't work with my setup.

review/summary: Strong and smooth
review/text: I hate mornings. Picking out the right coffee is very important to me. I have tried just about everything Starbucks makes with mixed outcomes.<br /><br />The Amazon community steered me in the direction of this Kicking Horse product with overwhelmingly solid reviews, and I have to say they did not lead me wrong. The beans have a heavenly smell out of the bag (but the aroma of the coffee itself was more muted.) The taste is dark and full, but as many commentators pointed out, does not come with an acidity or burnt taste frequent to many dark brews. To me, this is a simple, straight up coffee that does exactly what it is supposed to. The downside is that it lacks a distinctive, exotic, or exquisite flavor. If that is what you are looking for, this probably is not the product for you.<br /><br />But if like me, you have given up trying to have your coffee do too many things wrong and come up short, this seems to really get the job done well. I find myself enjoying it black-- no cream or sugar needed for a very drinkable and enjoyable coffee such as this.<br /><br />Prime shipping and low cost with subscribe and save makes this coffee about $1/pound cheaper than Starbucks brews, depending on the bean.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Smooth<br />Delicious<br />Drinkable<br />Great Aroma<br />Favorably priced to other high end coffee<br /><br />CONS:<br />Lacking in exotic taste (if that is your thing)

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: I very much enjoy dark roasts.  The challenge I find is that many of them are either burnt or overly bitter from poor roasting.  This coffee does a very good job of being a strong dark roast that is full of flavor without any hint of burnt or bitter flavors.  It is very dark and oily and the small portion that did not fit in my airtight container dried out a bit and was not as strong flavored.  That took over 3 weeks though due to the volume of coffee and it was still better than other dark roasts I have tried.  I have used this for guests to eat with pies and cake over the holidays and all of them commented on its excellent flavor.  A couple who don't really like dark roast did request some cream, but still gladly had multiple cups.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who:<br /><br />1.  Likes dark roast coffee<br />2.  Doesn't know, and wants to try it<br />3.  Wants to change it up from a medium, or god forbid, a light roast.<br /><br />It is a good quality product made more so because of the cost

review/summary: Wonderful (Actually Dark-Roasted) Coffee
review/text: I had never had Kicking Horse coffee before,but bought it on the strength of Amazon Prime eligibility, organic certification, and the many positive reviews.  The other reviewers are right - this coffee does not disappoint.  When I first tasted it, it seemed a little too dark, even for me, and I typically like my coffee quite dark.  However, adding just a touch of cream really opened it up, allowing the flavors to develop and mellow.  Instantly, it went from being a very good of dark coffee (when black) to being a perfect cup of rich, smoky coffee (with cream).  This is a really good coffee at a REALLY good price; just know that unlike so many coffees advertising themselves as "dark" or "strong," this one actually is.  Enjoy!

review/summary: The office coffee club consensus
review/text: My office has a coffee club where everyone chips in and we buy coffee to try from all over. We ordered Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark to give it a try.<br /><br />This coffee is roasted very dark roast without being burnt. Those of us in the office who like our coffee on the strong side really enjoyed the blend. It is a blend, I would assume of Sumatran and Costa Rican beans. The roast was actually too strong for the coffee drinkers who like light to medium roasts so we will not be purchasing this one again.<br /><br />I took a little of this home and tried it in the Moka pot. I personally like dark roasts and this was too strong for me when using the espresso esk method.<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars because it's not for everyone. I feel the blend could have been a little better (use of cheaper Central American beans) at he $11 plus per pound reduced amazon price.

review/summary: Hmmm...So many glowing reviews...
review/text: I've been drinking coffee for a really long time.  I've had lots of coffee from all the major retailers and from every region of the world.  I also get coffee from local fine food stores and lots of stuff on-line.  I have multiple coffee makers, one of them, my daily workhorse, a built-in Miele coffee/cap/espresso maker.  So, I think I know coffee better than most.  This coffee is good but certainly not spectacular.  I adjusted the grind to their recommendations, and I also tried other grind levels without a significant change in my opinion.  Keep in mind that personal palette plays an important role in coffee appreciation, akin to the appreciation of wine, music, or art, so my opinion is still only one opinion.  That being said, I still believe that I can safely state that this coffee, while good, will not change your life.

review/summary: Best all-around bean
review/text: This is an exceptional bean for any coffee drinker. It is easily the best price fair trade and organic option on the market, unless you want something flavorless.<br /><br />I primarily make espresso and this bean puts all others to shame. It takes an average-fineness grind, fine but not powdery, and preferably a HOT portafilter. Double shots are best, as it really needs to heat up to get a fine emulsion and delivers excellent crema. Fantastic as espresso, with rich chocolatey notes and a superbly smooth feel. My wife, who enjoys cream and sugar with a bit of coffee, loves this in a latte with 1 part espresso and only 2 parts milk (usual latte is about 1 to 6). After using this for the past few months, when travelling and stopping at Starbucks or Caribou, it's disgusting to drink what used to pass for good coffee. This is the best bean you could ever want.<br /><br />On occassion, I've also brewed using a French press and, naturally, the result was fabulous. I usually find brewed coffee quite lacking in body and flavor, but this was rich, flavorful, and absent of acidity. I actually found it to taste best after steeping for 10-15 minutes, much longer than called for.<br /><br />Obviously this is for people who really love strong coffee. It is a dark, dark roast but the balance of body and acidity makes it a versatile option for the skilled barista.<br /><br />Still yet to check out the 454 Horespower roast, could be even better, but can't compare to the great value of Kick Ass. If you're bothering to look at this bean, then go ahead and buy it. You won't be disapointed.

review/summary: Converted from Starbucks French Roast!
review/text: UPDATE:  Well, the below review was during my first brew or two of this bean.  One thing I noticed is that this particular bean tastes much better a notch coarser and brewed for about 30-60 seconds shorter than the Starbucks French Roast.  When I brew 1.5 oz of these beans with 24 oz of water for no more than four minutes, this coffee turns out smooth and delicious.  I'll report back again after I try another pound of the Starbucks for comparison.<br /><br />I'm sure there's nothing "wrong" with this coffee--it's just not to my taste.  I prefer my beans roasted-to-hell, so to speak.  I'm sure that roasts like that destroy any character that the beans once had, but it's what I like.<br /><br />I was actually looking for something as dark or darker than my usual Starbucks french roast, but this is significantly lighter than that.  You can actually tell when pouring the beans that because of the shorter roast, they are noticeably denser (more moisture inside) than the Starbucks (which presumably makes this roast cheaper per pound because they don't have to use as many beans.)

review/text: I came across this when I was doing a search for Stumptown coffee, and was excited that a product with such great reviews shipped quickly with Prime.  The coffee is a definitely a dark and oily roast.  However, opening the bag didn't give me that awesome overwhelming whiff... and the brewed cup (I've been using this for both french press and filtered water coffee maker) isn't as exciting as I hoped.  It isn't bad, but the taste is not strong, and I was hoping for a little more depth.  I tend to prefer coffee that holds its flavor even after I added milk/sugar... and this didn't hold up.  I've been playing with different amounts of coffee used, but it didn't seem to matter.  For the price of the bag, it wasn't much of a savings from the brands I already get, although the quick delivery is awesome.

review/summary: A bold, refreshing cup of coffee
review/text: Much like the pricier brands I used to buy  this coffee is dark, bold and yet smooth at the same time. I think what attracted me to the coffee was the name, who doesn't want a caffeinated cup of joe with the words "Kick Ass Dark" on it? If you have to wake up before the crack of dawn, you want something that will kick your ass out of the pj's and into the work clothes without being bitter or chalky, or making your stomach ache from the acidity. This coffee is our new personal favorite. We've tried a few other flavors by this brand as well and enjoyed them, but Kick Ass Dark has got to be my favorite. Maybe it's just the name, maybe it's the coffeehouse flavor without the coffeehouse price, either way, I would recommend this to anyone.

review/text: I have tried may different coffees based on reviews fro Amazon.  Kicking Horse Dark is certainly not the worst (Three Peckered Billy Goat takes this honor).  On the other hand, it certainly isn't near the top of my favorites, either.  I would rank Kicking Horse on par with your run-of-the-mill Starbucks House Blend.  Neither is offensive, but also isn't anything special.<br /><br />That being said, no small part of taste in coffee is the 'taste' part; which is surely very personal and subjective.  For my money, though, Deadman's Reach is still the best I've found.

I have been ordering from Amazon for over a year now, using automatic monthly delivery, and have never had a bad or even slightly stale bag.<br /><br />I usually use a french press to make coffee, and this grinds perfectly for that, but I have also used it with a drip coffee maker and an aeropress, with very good results also. This coffee compares very well to the best beans you can buy at your local coffee shop (and is better than some), and is a very reasonable price. Honestly, I can't say enough good things about it; it is generally the only coffee I buy any more.

review/summary: Unique coffee... Great to some, not to others. I love it!
review/text: Philosophies on coffee, its flavor, proper roast and other variants range dramatically and there's a specific reason, everyone's opinion/preference/palate is unique. The first thing one needs to recognize when critically reviewing a coffee is that like alcohol, smoke from cigars/cigarettes, and other similar acquired tastes is that they are not naturally palatable. This means that we are all going to develop specific tastes based highly on exposure and familiarity; and moreover that all of us winced at our first sip of joe, booze (still do often), or our first inhale of fine hand-rolled tobacco. With this fact in mind, hyper-critical reviews of any such product is silly.<br /><br />Anyway, Kicking Horse is an amazing company based on ethical roots with clear and focused mission, to make good coffee. Their line of roasts is widely varying, but they have something for everyone. A morning without Kick Ass isn't the same for me, but I'm not a fan of the 454 Horse Power roast that is similarly a dark variant in their product line. Their presentation is fantastic, business formula great, and their social consciousness is something to be admired. Kick Ass is a wonderful roast, with a unique flavor profile. It's dark, but like any coffee won't yield a dark brew if not used properly. It's oily, but those oils are the same that carry the flavor of your coffee, and the same that will require you to clean an automatic grinder coffee maker after ever use (probably not what you'd want if you use the auto grind setups). Regardless of what you're used to, this blend of Indonesian and Central American beans will surely be different from what you've been drinking. Some have noted Kick Ass to be bitter, but that's how I'd describe most of Starbucks' roasts. For more of a reference toward my personal taste, I'd say D&D Regular blend lacks gusto and doesn't offer enough flavor, while D&D Dark tastes a little burnt (good mainstream baselines for comparison I think).<br /><br />When in doubt, try a smaller amount as a sample!<br /><br />Also, nice job utilizing Amazon and offering exclusive pricing, thanks Kicking Horse! Bring Cafes to NJ!

FYI 4 scoops fresh ground in the french press makes the perfect brew.

review/summary: Highly Caffinated Goodness!
review/text: If you're looking for one of the strongest whole bean coffee brands out there, look no further than Kicking Horse. This particular blend, Kick Ass Dark, is their most caffinated dark roast that they make. The flavor and strength of this coffee is nothing short of amazing, I've been drinking coffee for years, I'm sure like most of you, and for my morning cup I need a little something extra to get me going. This coffee does that and then some. Not only is it very strong, it also goes down smooth and lacks a bitter aftertaste most often associated with stronger coffee. Forget Folgers, the smell of this coffee alone will get you going in the right direction in the morning, when most of us need it the most. Couldn't recommend this brand and this particular flavor high enough.

review/text: I had never heard of this brand, but am always in search of a good whole bean coffee.  Based on the good reviews, I just ordered this coffee...it arrived yesterday and I am in heaven (at 6:30 AM).  I was so thrilled to open the bag to see that the beans have that oily look, something lacking from even some of the most expensive coffees.  The beans themselves have the most incredible aroma.  I love dark roast, but hate the "burnt" taste and lack of flavor that come with many of the dark roasts, even the big brands.  Kicking Horse has mastered the art of dark roast!  This is a really good darker roast, not burnt and not bitter...nice and smooth with great flavor.<br /><br />Just thought I would add one more positive review, in case anyone needs more convincing to try this coffee, I am so glad we did try it! We like it so much we just signed up for subscribe and save.:  A huge thank you to the reviewer that compared this coffee to Caribou Obsidian, it does indeed remind me of that coffee, other than being a notch better and less expensive...couldn't get any better than this!

review/text: My girlfriend and I absolutely love Kicking Horse Kick Ass coffee.  We're spoiled now, making other "average" coffees, well, average.  What a wonderful find.  We've subscribed to monthly deliveries.  Going to give their decaf whole bean coffee a try next.  If you love coffee drink Kicking Horse now!

review/text: I love strong coffe, I really like Peets coffee so if you've had that you get the idea of what I like. Anyways, there is not anything special about this coffee. I wish I picked something else! Being organic is about it. The beans are dark and oily and I was really excited but what I got in result was not up to all the hype. I use a French press.

review/text: I make my coffee in a french press, use a coarse grind, and watch my time. I started brewing for only 3 minutes, still a little to burnt for my tastes. I usually like the very dark roasts, but something was just too deep about this one. Still, I've had worse and rank this about average (3 stars)

review/summary: Surprisingly disappointing
review/text: When I saw this particular bag of coffee pop up so highly in the search results, and saw the high reviews, I hesitated a moment due to its high price.  But then I decided to go for it, since I'm always up for trying a new coffee, regardless of price, if it's really something spectacular.<br /><br />I received the coffee promptly, and loaded the beans into my high-end burr grinder.  I then brewed the grounds in a french press.  I expected something pretty amazing, or at least an above-average coffee.  Unfortunately, I found neither in this bag.<br /><br />Though I hate to say it, I'd put this coffee on par with Folgers, or some other budget American brand.  It completely lacks flavor...  It's very mild across the whole spectrum, and even lacks body/mouthfeel.  Simply put, it tastes about like cheap diner coffee that's been sitting on a burner for a while.  Really, really disappointing.<br /><br />The only reason I can come up with for the high price is that the quantity is quite high; the bag is enormous (2.2 pounds).  Unfortunately, the quality is exponentially lower.  It's a shame, too; given that British Columbia is so close to Seattle (a place that prides itself on excellent coffee), I expected this to be a great one.  Unless you really need a (giant) cool looking coffee bag design, I'd avoid this one.

review/text: I have ordered this coffee several times and have talked it up to all of my coffee drinking friends. This last bag was so oily it was shiny when I opened the bag and the smell was nauseating. I went ahead and used it thinking that maybe slight exposure to the air and small batch grinding would help but every pot gets worse. My mouth feels like it is coated with oil and I feel like gagging even hours after drinkig my morning cup.<br />I am relunctant to reorder so will probably just go back to Starbucks.<br />Very disappointed.

These are some beautiful dark beans. Pungent and aromatic, and glistening with oil.<br /><br />The brew is strong but richly smooth, not bitter.I'm sure I'm not doing Kicking Horse any justice with my review, but trust me when I say you won't be disappointed.

review/text: There's nothing really wrong with this coffee.<br /><br />That being said, I don't find it to have the flavor or heavy body that I look for in a dark roast.  Honestly, I think Starbuck's medium blends are stronger than this.  I like  dark roasts and was really looking forward to an experience more akin to what the label says to expect.  I also expected better from a boutique roaster at this price point.  This is not a bad coffee at all.  Not by a long shot.  On the other hand, there is nothing compelling about this coffee either.<br /><br />All things considered, I'll stick to Starbuck's.

review/summary: Kick Ass Really Kicks Ass
review/text: I live for the morning coffee.  I like it strong, deep colored, and without the frills of milk/cream, sugar/sugar substitute.  Kick Ass is heaven in a two pound bag.  I have tasted and enjoyed some brand coffees or coffee shops, but this, when ground in the morning with some filtered water is the best.  I just ordered my second bag and the only reason I do not go to subscription is I do not know the variable rate of my household consumption, guests included, so I will wait until the bag gets to a certain depth, or lack thereof, and reorder and thanks to Amazon Prime, I have it in two days!!

Its taste is in the blend side, and not bitter nor flavorful.  We use a Krups Expresso machine, so we can extract most of the flavor from the coffee.  This product is no comparison to the Starbucks French Roast.

review/text: I agree with some reviewers about the oiliness of the beans. They never specified if the beans were arabica or robusta, but judging from the appearance, smell, taste, caffeine content and amount of crema obtained, I think that there is a high percentage of robusta in this. That being the case, I would have been better off roasting my local beans myself, because the results are almost the same for a fraction of the price. Just came from finishing off a 2.2 lb of Lavazza and I was a bit disappointed with the taste of the Kicking Horse to be honest. Maybe other tasters have different preferences, so to each his own, but I'll stick to what I'm comfortable with.

I looked up the Kicking Horse website, where they describe each of their coffees, some dark, some medium roast.  I am thrilled to see it on Amazon for less and already put this Kick Ass Dark in my cart!<br />Update:  The 2 lb bag arrived in perfect condition.  I like having the option of 2 lbs, since I go through it so quickly.  The coffee is fresh, perfectly roasted, and I'm happy to wake up each morning to enjoy it.

review/summary: Good, but oily
review/text: Coffee flavor and aroma are good, and I like the organic/fair trade designations. I've sampled dozens of specialty coffees from Amazon.com, and I'd say this one is in the top 5. However, if you are using a grind-and-brew coffee maker, you should know that the beans are so oily that they stick to the inside of the hopper more than other beans. To make a full flavored pot of coffee, you have to set the grinder to 2-4 cups more than the amount of water you are using (so, if you pour in 8 cups of water, set the grinder to 10 or 12 cups). The alternative is to open the top of the hopper and nudge the beans to the hole, but then you are exposing them to oxygen.

review/summary: Great Surprise!
review/text: I tried this coffee kind of as a joke because of the name and because we have rescue donkeys and have a horse ranch.  The great surprise was the coffee was absolutely wonderful.  I love a rich dark roast and this coffee has the depth of a dark roast but has retained a very rich flavor!  Since the first bag I have not purchased anything else.  I have had some of the best dark roast coffees in the world and would rate this right at the top!  Keep doing what you are doing Kicking Horse and I'll keep buying.  If you like dark full flavor give it try.

review/summary: Simply Yummy
review/text: This is great, great coffee.  Brews up like a dream in our Bunn.  Handles cream well, but also is an excellent black cup of coffee.  Worth the price.
